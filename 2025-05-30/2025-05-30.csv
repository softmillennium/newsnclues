            Kiwi Zhang, a computer science student from China, was full of hope for his academic future in the United States – until his visa was revoked at the US border last week.
    


            The first-year PhD student at a university in the south of the country had just presented his research at a conference in Asia. He was returning to the US after a brief visit home when his American dream was abruptly cut short.
    


            According to Zhang, he was detained at the border for 48 hours by US officials, who confiscated his phone and laptop, and searched his belongings. He said they questioned him about his ties to the Chinese Communist Party and meetings with friends while in China.
    


            At the end of the interrogation, Zhang said he was deported and barred from the US for five years, on suspicion of having shared his research with the Chinese government – an allegation he denies. He is now back in China and mulling his next steps.
    


            “I never imagined this could happen to me,” said Zhang, who – like everyone CNN spoke to for this story – asked to use a pseudonym and that CNN conceal specific identifying details out of fear of retaliation. “I didn't know things would get this extreme after Donald Trump returned to office. His administration is jeopardizing my academic future, and I feel powerless to defend my rights.”
    


            Now, many Chinese students studying in the US fear they could meet the same fate, after President Trump's administration vowed on Wednesday to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”
    


            The announcement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio was brief and vaguely worded, but it sent shock waves through China, triggering widespread confusion, anxiety and fear among current and prospective students and their families, as well as strong opposition from Beijing.
    


            Student chat groups lit up with messages of disbelief. Education consultants were flooded with panicked phone calls. Many students aired their frustration and anger on social media.
    


            At a regular news conference Thursday, China's foreign ministry accused the Trump administration of using ideology and national security as a “pretext” for the “politically motivated and discriminatory” move.
    


            Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of young Chinese minds, drawn by the prestige of a world-class education and the allure of the American dream, found themselves facing a stark reality: the future they had worked so hard for now hangs in the balance, held hostage by the whims of a US administration that increasingly views them – and their homeland – as a threat.
    


            “What strikes me is how tiny individuals are in the tide of history – career plans can collapse overnight,” said Joyce, who received an offer from her dream school, Harvard, to pursue a master's degree in architecture.
    


            Her visa from her undergraduate program in the US is still valid for another year, but she did not dare to return to China for the summer, worrying that she might be denied reentry at the US border.
    


            “I can't help wishing I'd grown up in a golden age of US-China relations,” she said.
    


            For decades, China's brightest minds have flocked to America, as their home country played catch-up with the world's leading superpower. Until last year, Chinese students made up the largest group of international students in the US, contributing significantly to the economy and helping America maintain its competitive edge in scientific research and technological innovation.
    


            But as strategic rivalry between the two nations intensifies, mistrust has deepened. Both sides have ramped up national security measures and grown more protective of their advanced technologies – particularly in sensitive sectors with military implications.
    


            During his first term in 2020, Trump introduced a ban that effectively denied US visas to graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military. Within just three months, more than 1,000 Chinese nationals had their visas revoked, and the order remained in place under former President Joe Biden.
    


            It's unclear how quickly or widely the new revocations will be carried out. But the fear is palpable in CNN's interviews with Chinese students. Studying in a country that has long held itself up as a beacon of freedom, many were too afraid to speak openly under their real names – a fear all too familiar to those back in China.
    


            They include David Yang, whose heart sank when he saw Rubio's announcement. “This is just too surreal,” said the second-year PhD student in theoretical chemistry at a top university in the Midwestern US.
    


            “When the news broke, some classmates said they were working on their final assignments but completely lost the motivation to continue. I felt the same way,” he said.
    


            In recent weeks, Yang has found it nearly impossible to focus on his research, simulating how molecules interact with each other in the human body. Instead, he's been glued to the news, anxiously tracking Trump's escalating war on elite universities and international students, trying to gauge whether he might land in the crossfire.
    


            Last week, the Trump administration barred Harvard University from enrolling international students, accusing the prestigious institution of “coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party,” among other allegations.
    


            Although a federal court has since blocked the move, the State Department soon followed with a diplomatic cable instructing US embassies and consulates worldwide to halt new student visa appointments.
    


            As Yang scrolled through the headlines, periods of anxiety would suddenly hit, and he found himself compulsively refreshing news sites over and over.
    


            “I felt sad, lost and helpless. It's been incredibly stressful,” he said. “The constant policy changes bring so much uncertainty into our lives. It really impacts productivity and, over time, takes a toll on your mental health – and for me, it already has.”
    


            Worried about his visa, Yang is planning on canceling his trip home this winter. His major could well fall under what Rubio called “critical fields” and – like millions of Chinese students – he's a member of the Communist Youth League, a youth branch of the 99-million-strong Communist Party for those aged between 14 and 28.
    


            In China, most students are Youth League members by the time they finish high school, or have party members among family and friends – thanks to the party's ubiquity across government and business, as well as cultural and social sectors.
    


            “The vast majority of people in China have some connection to the Communist Party – so this is essentially the same as condemning all Chinese students with a single stroke,” Yang said.
    


            Zhang, the student whose visa was revoked at the border, said US officials asked whether anyone in his family was a member of the Communist Party. He told them both of his parents were. They then questioned him about his own affiliation with the Communist Youth League, he said.
    


            “I said I've never had any connection with them. The Communist Youth League charges us seven or eight yuan (about $1) a year, but there are no activities at all. But the officials said: ‘You are lying.' I honestly didn't know what to say. I could only sit there, stunned,” Zhang said.
    


            Facing potential deportation in the middle of their hard-won education, some Chinese students are considering other options.
    


            Ella Liu, a math undergraduate at a university in the midwest, is visiting family in the southern city of Guangzhou before her summer research project in the US starts next month.
    


            “Me and my parents are all praying that I won't be banned from entering the country in June,” she said.
    


            Liu was drawn to the US by its academic freedom and resources. But if the hardline visa policy continues, she might consider transferring to another university in Europe or Hong Kong.
    


            “I am very determined to study mathematics and there are also many excellent math resources in other countries, such as in France,” she said.
    


            Like many Chinese students, Liu comes from a middle-class family. Her parents saved for years for her to attend college in the US, where tuition and living costs can run to more than $80,000 – much more than getting a degree in Europe or Asia.
    


            Some Chinese students are already looking elsewhere. In recent years, the number of Chinese students in the US has steadily declined from a peak in the 2019-2020 school year – a drop that coincides with the Covid-19 pandemic but also increasing friction between the two governments.
    


            Nelson Urena Jr., co-founder and director of college counseling at an education management firm in Shanghai, said that for years many Chinese families saw American universities as the “gold standard” for college education.
    


            Since around 2018, however, he has noticed more interest from students and parents alike in universities in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, as well as the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong.
    


            “A lot of families were concerned legitimately about their children's safety, and then also just the rhetoric of, you know, whether they're welcome in the US,” he said, citing issues such as gun violence and racist hostility or even violence against Asian people.
    


            “More recently, I think people are starting to see the growing disconnect between the US and China, and feeling like maybe things are going to be more difficult for them – from getting the visa to making payments for tuitions.”
    


            Rubio's announcement Wednesday also vowed to “revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications” from China, including Hong Kong.
    


            Since then, Urena has been inundated by phone calls from anxious students preparing to start their college education in the US. But he didn't have a ready response for them.
    


            “It's just a lot of uncertainty right now. The students are trying to figure out what to do…The options are very limited at this point – Do they do a gap year? Do they go to university elsewhere? Do they have to go back to the application process?” he said.
    


            Nevertheless, for some Chinese parents, the allure of American higher education has not worn off.
    


            Arno Huang, a 56-year-old businessman from China's coastal Fujian province, still wants to send his kids to the US for graduate schools after they finish undergraduate studies in Hong Kong.
    


            “The US represents one of the most civilized, developed, and open places for humanity. Although US-China relations are currently strained, smart people still recognize this fact,” said Huang.
    


            Having kids studying in the US gives a family “face,” he said, using a common Chinese phrase to refer to good reputation or social standing. “Once their child is in the US, they can proudly tell others, ‘Look how successful my son is!'”
    


            Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a non-government think tank in Beijing, lamented a seemingly bygone era, when Chinese officials, entrepreneurs and scientists alike were trained in the US – especially those who played key roles during China's reform and opening-up era that began in 1978.
    


            “When they returned to China, they brought back not only professional knowledge and credentials, but also a deep respect and admiration for America as an open and inclusive society,” he said.
    


            “I believe many Chinese people see what makes America great not merely as its economic or military strength, but its openness – its world-class universities, its confidence in the marketplace of ideas, and its ability to attract top global talent,” Wang added.
    


            “That, at least in my view, is what many people around the world truly admire about the United States.”

Moscow has the means to respond to Berlin's decision to lift the range restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with missiles provided by Germany, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu has said.

Earlier this week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz claimed that “there are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, neither from the British nor the French, nor from us, nor from the Americans.”

In a separate interview on Wednesday, Merz said deliveries of German Taurus missiles – which have a range of 500km and could potentially reach Moscow – to Kiev is “in the realm of possible.”

Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Shoigu highlighted the inconsistency of Ukraine's Western backers regarding the use of long-range weapons.

The administration of former US President Joe Biden lifted the restrictions on long-range attacks last November, with the UK and France following suit shortly afterwards. Since then, the Russian military has repelled a number of strikes against its territory, which included US-supplied ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles.

Former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was reluctant to approve deep strikes into Russia or to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles over fears of escalation.

“There are many statements. They are all different. First, they say that they had lifted it, then they say that they did not. Then they say that they did it long ago… So, did you lift it or not?” Shoigu said, adding: “we can also lift limitations on some things. I will not expand on this, but we have our own restrictions that we can remove in response.”

The chancellor, who welcomed Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky in Berlin on Wednesday, also said Germany will help Kiev with the production of long-range weaponry inside Ukraine. According to the German Defense Ministry, a large part of the country's newly announced €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) military aid for Ukraine will be allocated for the project.

High-ranking Russian diplomat Rodion Miroshnik stressed on Friday that any weapons production facilities in Ukraine are legitimate targets for the Russian military, and are subject to “unequivocal destruction.”

Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large tasked with documenting Kiev's alleged war crimes, also said Berlin's recent moves show that they “are not looking for peace, [but are] trying in every possible way to continue the Ukraine conflict, to continue the bloodshed” in order to distract the people from the problems in their own country.

Russia's long-standing security concerns regarding NATO expansion are reasonable, US presidential envoy Keith Kellogg said Thursday in an interview with ABC News

He was responding to a question about reports that Moscow wants NATO leaders to issue a written commitment halting further enlargement – particularly the inclusion of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia into the US-led military bloc.

“It's a fair concern and we've said that repeatedly … that to us Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table,” he said.

“We're saying: okay, comprehensively we can stop the expansion of NATO coming close to your border,” Kellogg added, noting that such a move would ultimately require a presidential-level decision.

Towards the end of the Cold War, senior US officials gave assurances to the Soviet Union that NATO would not expand eastward, in exchange for support for German reunification. Since the 1990s, Moscow has cited the alliance's expansion to Russia's borders as evidence of Western duplicity.

NATO's insistence on admitting Ukraine to the bloc is a key factor which led to the current conflict with Russia. In 2021, Moscow offered a diplomatic proposal to ease tensions, but the US and other bloc members insisted its open-door policy was non-negotiable, describing Ukraine's path to membership as “irreversible.”

Moscow hopes to hold a new round of negotiations with Kiev on Monday in Istanbul, where both parties would exchange draft memorandums on the next steps in the peace process, including a conditional cease-fire. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration at not receiving the Russian draft in advance and said they might boycott the meeting.

“I always caution [Kiev's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov]: don't say things like that,” Kellogg said. “Part of life is showing up, and you need to show you're serious.”

Russia and Ukraine reached a preliminary peace agreement in Istanbul in 2022, but Kiev later withdrew from talks, aiming for a military breakthrough with support from Western nations. Moscow sees the renewed talks launched earlier this month as a chance to revisit the proposal, which involves Ukraine adopting a stance of neutrality and limiting its military.

The interviewer pressed Kellogg on whether those terms were “pretty extreme,” suggesting they were proof that Russia does not seek peace. Kellogg responded that ending the conflict was in Moscow's interest.

A reported EU plan to scrap member states' veto power on matters of foreign policy would spell the end of the bloc and could become “the precursor of a huge military conflict,” Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has warned.

Slovakia and its Central European neighbour Hungary have long opposed the EU's approach to the Ukraine conflict, criticizing military aid to Kiev and sanctions on Russia. Both governments have repeatedly threatened to use their veto powers to block EU actions they view as harmful to national interests.

To bypass dissent, Brussels is reportedly weighing a shift from unanimous voting, a founding principle of EU foreign policy, to qualified majority voting (QMV), arguing that it would streamline decision-making and prevent individual states from paralyzing joint actions.

Fico, however, condemned the proposal on Thursday during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Hungary.

“The imposition of a mandatory political opinion, the abolition of the veto, the punishment of the sovereign and the brave, the new Iron Curtain, the preference for war over peace. This is the end of the common European project. This is a departure from democracy. This is the precursor of a huge military conflict,” he said.

EU sanctions on Russia currently require unanimous renewal every six months, with the current term set to expire at the end of July. Brussels is also preparing an 18th package of sanctions aimed at tightening restrictions on Russia's energy sector and financial institutions.

Earlier this month, during a visit to Moscow for Victory Day commemorations, Fico assured Russian President Vladimir Putin that Slovakia would veto any EU-wide attempt to ban imports of Russian oil or gas.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has taken a similar stance. While Hungary has not formally blocked a sanctions package, it has delayed several rounds to extract concessions.

Orban has also warned that removing the veto would strip smaller nations of their sovereignty.

“We want Brussels to show us, as all other member countries, the same respect, not only symbolically, but also by taking our interests into account,” he said last month.

Both Slovakia and Hungary have resisted increased military support to Kiev, with Budapest blocking several key decisions citing concerns over national interests and the potential for escalation. Fico has emphasized the need for peace negotiations over continued military engagement.

NEW YORK, May 30. /TASS/. NATO may stop accepting new Eastern European countries into its ranks, as the US understands that this is a matter of national security for Russia, US special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told ABC News in an interview.

""That's one of the issues that Russia [will] bring up. They [the Russians] are not just talking Ukraine, they're talking the country of Georgia, they're talking Moldova. We've said that to us, Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table, and we're not the only country that says that - you know I could probably give you four other countries in NATO and it takes 32 of the 32 to allow you to come in to NATO,"" Kellogg said.

The special envoy did not rule out the possibility of reaching such an agreement during negotiations between the US and Russia, taking into account the positions of other countries. In this case, the proposals worked out in detail by diplomats would have to be submitted to the US president for consideration and discussed among the other NATO members. During the same interview, Kellogg said he considered the Russian side's concerns about NATO's eastward expansion to be justified. He also assured that Ukraine's accession to the alliance was not on the agenda.

Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Moscow was ready for the second round of negotiations with Kiev, which is scheduled to take place in Istanbul on June 2. Lavrov said that the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, would present Ukraine with a Russian memorandum on eliminating the root causes of the crisis.

The previous round of negotiations took place on May 16 and resulted in agreements to exchange prisoners on the ""1,000 for 1,000"" basis and to present their vision of a potential future ceasefire. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the meeting's outcome.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 30. /TASS/. Twelve Russian servicemen involved in downing the first US F-16 fighter jet in the special military operation zone have been paid 15 million rubles ($195,000), Fores told TASS.

""Fores has delivered on its earlier promise to transfer 15 million rubles to members of the Russian Armed Forces for downing the first F-16 in the special military operation zone,"" the company said. According to it, the award ceremony took place in a border area in the presence of commanders on May 29. ""Twelve servicemen involved in downing the target received money certificates,"" the company added.

Earlier, Fores Director General Sergey Shmotyev said on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum that his company would will pay a bonus of 15 million rubles for the first F-16 fighter jet that could be shot down in Ukraine.

Wiles' contacts on her personal cellphone were purportedly hacked and AI used to communicate with lawmakers

US politics live – latest updates

The FBI is investigating an apparent impersonator who pretended to be the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, in texts and calls to her contacts, including prominent Republicans.

Wiles has privately informed colleagues that the contacts in her personal cellphone were hacked, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, and has been asking people to disregard messages and calls that aren't coming from her phone number. Wiles also has a government phone that wasn't affected by the hack.

The impersonator texted one lawmaker for a list of people who should be pardoned, a request that was initially taken to be real. In another case, Wiles' impersonator asked for a cash transfer, according to the report.

Some requests came off as suspicious as they contained questions about Donald Trump that Wiles would know, and had broken grammar in other cases. But some said that they had engaged with Wiles' impersonator before they realized it wasn't her.

Contacts who spoke to the Journal anonymously said that some of the calls came from a voice that sounded like Wiles, leading some to believe that an impersonator is using artificial intelligence to mimic Wiles' voice.

Wiles served as co-chair of Trump's presidential campaign and was deeply embedded in Florida politics as a lobbyist before she joined Trump's team.

In a statement, the FBI director, Kash Patel, said the FBI is investigating the matter “with the utmost seriousness”.

“Safeguarding our administration officials' ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top priority,” he said.

The White House has still been grappling with the fallout of the so-called “Signalgate” scandal, when senior Trump officials discussed sensitive military plans on a Signal group chat in March that included Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg.

Earlier this month, Trump demoted his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who mistakenly added Goldberg to the group chat. A government oversight group has since sued the Trump administration over the potential deletion of sensitive conversations, which could violate federal recordkeeping laws.

The US president has largely dismissed privacy concerns and said that Signalgate was “not a big deal”.

Reporting has also revealed that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has shared details about a Yemen strike on a separate group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Critics warn the experiment will lead to low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime

On a heat-dazed afternoon in Culiacán, the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state, a speaker by the cathedral was droning through an advert for the judicial elections on loop when a plume of smoke appeared in the sky. A flicker of agitation ran through the plaza.

After months of cartel conflict, Sinaloa is on edge. Yet on 1 June, it and the rest of Mexico will start to elect every judge in the country, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, by popular vote.

It is a world-first democratic experiment, but one that has prompted warnings of low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime.

The reform is the most radical move made by the governing Morena party and its allies since they won a congressional supermajority last year allowing them to change the constitution at will.

Few disagree that Mexico's judicial system needs change. Justice is inaccessible to many, corruption is commonplace and impunity is rampant.

Morena claims its reform will address these issues by making the judiciary more responsive to popular opinion.

But critics say it will bulldoze the separation of powers, and that by throwing the doors open to less qualified candidates whose campaigns may be backed by opaque interests – including organised crime groups – it could aggravate the very problems it seeks to solve.

Delia Quiroa, a well-known advocate for Mexico's disappeared, is no fan of the reform. But she admits it has given her a chance to become a federal judge she would not otherwise have had.

It is just the latest unexpected turn in a life that was shattered the moment her brother, Roberto, was disappeared on 10 March 2014.

Though born in Culiacán, Quiroa moved to the border state of Tamaulipas when she was a child. She had been studying to become an engineer, but as the years stretched on with no sign of her brother, she retrained as a lawyer to force the authorities into action.

Threats from criminal groups eventually displaced her family to Mexico City. Then last year they moved back to Sinaloa, which for years had been relatively calm owing to the dominance of the eponymous cartel.

“People used to say that the narcos in Sinaloa left the public out of [their fights],” Quiroa said, with a rueful smile. “Then this conflict began.”

In July 2024, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained by US authorities along with one of Guzmán's sons after a small plane touched down in Texas.

El Mayo accused El Chapo's son of betraying and delivering him to US authorities. Now a faction led by El Mayo's son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo who remain free in Mexico.

As the conflict enters a ninth month, it has left well over 2,000 dead or disappeared.

And it has made the judicial elections even more complicated.

“The violence has hit the campaign,” said Quiroa. “You can't always find people in the streets.”

The city's central market was Quiroa's target for the day. Friends and family came along, handing out pamphlets with her logo: a spade and a gavel crossed over the scales of justice.

“I try to explain that I have no political or economic interest in this,” said Quiroa. “That the only thing I want is a change in this country.”

But as Quiroa bounced between market stalls, people's responses did nothing to dispel fears of an uninformed vote come 1 June.

Unlike in other elections, parties cannot support candidates, nor can candidates openly profess a partisan affiliation, even if they clearly have one.

Radio and TV spots are also banned, meaning largely unknown candidates are limited to handing out flyers and posting on social media.

Then there is the sheer number of candidates. Voters will be faced with at least six ballot papers, some with dozens of names on them but little else. “It looks like an exam,” sighed Quiroa.

Even an enthusiastic supporter of the reform – a butcher behind a pile of cow hooves, who celebrated the election as a chance for “the people to stop the robbery” – could not name a candidate.

Others were sceptical, if not cynical. “I'm not going to vote for candidates I don't know,” said one shoe shiner, who was reading a dog-eared biography of the 19th-century president Benito Juárez. “Just like I won't eat a meal if I don't know what's in it. It's common sense.”

According to the president of the National Electoral Institute, voter turnout is expected to be less than 20%.

Even though Morena is not allowed to back candidates, many assume the ruling party will use its unrivalled capacity to mobilise voters to help its preferred candidates – particularly for the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena's executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line.

“Morena wants to hoard all the power,” said the shoe shiner. “They don't want to leave a crumb for anyone else.”

But other interests, including organised crime, may also seize the opportunity.

Defensorxs, a civil society organisation, has identified various “highly risky” candidates, including a lawyer who was counsel to El Chapo and a former state prosecutor in Michoacán accused of alleged involvement in the murder of two journalists.

“I don't think people have managed to find out who the candidates are and what each kind of position actually does,” said Marlene León Fontes of Iniciativa Sinaloa, a civil society organisation. “People will vote on the basis of personal connections or political parties.

“It's a blind date with democracy,” she said.

If Quiroa emerges a judge, she says she will be an “iron fist” against corrupt and negligent authorities – not least when it comes to searching for the more than 120,000 people registered as disappeared, and identifying the 72,000 bodies in Mexico's morgues.

“It was the feeling of being tortured by the authorities who should be protecting me that made me put myself forward as a candidate,” said Quiroa.

Yet as far as Quiroa knows, she is the only candidate to have emerged from the many thousands searching for their relatives.

“I'd have liked there to be more – and more victims of all kinds who are lawyers and human rights defenders,” said Quiroa. “But many people said they didn't want to be part of the destruction of the judicial system.”

Quiroa shares their anxiety.

“This is an experiment,” she said. “And we don't know how it's going to go.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Crypto venture with Abu Dhabi could enrich pair with millions – and Democrats say ethics conflict is ‘plain as day'

President Trump received plenty of attention this month when he happily accepted a $400m Boeing 747 from the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar.

“Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our country,” Trump posted on social media.

But Trump and his golf buddy turned special negotiator Steve Witkoff landed a much bigger gift this month, likely to enrich them far more: a $2bn investment in their new cryptocurrency venture from the emirate of Abu Dhabi.

The investment by a firm controlled by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund will go to World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm whose biggest beneficiaries are the Trump and Witkoff families.

Thanks to Abu Dhabi's purchase of their “stablecoin”, the Trumps and Witkoffs will collect hefty fees and could reap hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments.

The deal isn't as headline-grabbing as Qatar's plane, but it's a lot more valuable. It was the biggest single purchase of World Liberty's cryptocoins yet – an immense injection of revenue into Trump's most lucrative personal money-making scheme.

None of this is normal. Presidents don't usually maintain private businesses that sell investment vehicles to foreign leaders who seek favor with the United States. Nor do they appoint their private business partners as diplomatic envoys to negotiate with the same leaders over war and peace.

But Trump and Witkoff have found a vastly rewarding way to straddle the line between public service and private profit.

Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest and most powerful member of the United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich federation of seven Persian Gulf emirates. After Abu Dhabi invested $2bn in the Trump-Witkoff stablecoin, Trump agreed to allow the UAE to buy more advanced AI semiconductors from American companies. “It's a very big contract,” the president observed.

In 2023, the Biden administration sharply restricted exports of advanced chips to the UAE because of fears that some of the technology could leak to China, which has deep economic ties with the emirates.

Witkoff and Trump first met in the 1980s, when Witkoff was a lawyer working on one of Trump's Manhattan real-estate deals. Witkoff says he adopted Trump as a role model; “I learned the business from him,” he told Tucker Carlson in March. Over time, the two dealmakers became golf buddies, friends and business partners. After Trump lost the White House in 2020, Witkoff became one of his staunchest defenders, and testified as a character witness at Trump's 2024 New York trial on business fraud charges.

It was Witkoff who first alerted Trump to the opportunity to take over a fledgling cryptocurrency firm that their respective sons had discovered, World Liberty Financial.

The two families negotiated equity interests in the venture, which now showcases Trump on its website as its “chief cryptocurrency advocate”. Witkoff is listed as a “co-founder”. A heroic photograph of Trump dominates the website.

A Trump family subsidiary owns 60% of World Liberty and is entitled to 75% of net income from its coin sales, according to the website. A Witkoff family firm is entitled to 12.5%. The firm says it sold more than $550m in cryptocurrency “tokens” in its first five months of operation, generating undisclosed amounts of fees and profits for the Trump and Witkoff families. Most of the sales occurred after Trump's election.

Before Trump's inauguration, when he was the president-elect's personal envoy for Gaza, Witkoff promoted World Liberty at a crypto investors' conference in Dubai. The meeting's organizers billed him as both a co-founder of World Liberty and the incoming president's key man for the Middle East.

During the same period, Witkoff met – in his diplomatic role – Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, the UAE's Mohamed bin Zayed, and Qatar's Tamim bin Hamad, all of whom command enormous sovereign wealth funds.

After Trump's inauguration, Witkoff helped broker Qatar's offer to donate a spare 747 to the president, according to the New York Times.

Witkoff came equipped with plenty of experience doing business in the Gulf. He knew the heads of several sovereign wealth funds from earlier real-estate deals.

A UAE-controlled fund invested in his purchase of New York's Park Lane hotel in 2013; in 2016, the Qatari fund took the troubled property off their hands.

When Russia's Vladimir Putin sent a special envoy to Washington to talk with Witkoff about Ukraine, his emissary wasn't a diplomat; it was Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund.

Once Witkoff landed his government post as Trump's all-purpose peace negotiator, he appears to have stepped back from active involvement in World Liberty.

A Witkoff spokesman at the state department, Edgar Vasquez, said the envoy “does not discuss WLF [World Liberty Financial] or any other personal business while conducting his official duties”.

His son Zach Witkoff has acted as the firm's chief overseas salesman instead.

The fact that Zach's father is one of Trump's closest confidants appears to have helped open doors. When Zach Witkoff visited Pakistan last month, he met the country's powerful army chief and its prime minister, an unusual level of access for an obscure cryptocurrency firm. The prime minister's office noted in a news release on the meeting that Zach is “the son of Steve Witkoff”.

No modern precedent exists for a US diplomatic envoy so deeply tangled in a president's private business interests.

“I can't think of any parallel,” said Robert Dallek, a retired UCLA historian who has written biographies of Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson.

Presidents have sent special envoys abroad since the early days of the republic. George Washington sent Gouverneur Morris, a delegate to the constitutional convention, to London in 1789 to negotiate peace with Britain. Roosevelt sent investment banker Averell Harriman to Moscow in 1941 to talk with Stalin. But historians say they can't think of any instance in which a special envoy was also the president's partner in a private moneymaking venture.

In more recent history, then secretary of state Hillary Clinton came under fire after foreign donors made big donations to the private Clinton Foundation, prompting allegations the family was mixing public and private interests.

Trump and other Republicans denounced that arrangement as unethical.

“It's a criminal enterprise – Saudi Arabia giving $25m, Qatar,” Trump said in 2016. “These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.”

“My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics,” Trump said.

This time it's Democratic senators who are raising alarms.

“The White House is open for business, and the Trump family is proudly advertising to the world where to send the check,” Chris Murphy of Connecticut told the Guardian.

“The Trumps and the Witkoffs are in business together making money off their government positions,” he said. “It's just plain as day.”

Murphy charged that the administration's announcement that it plans to relax restrictions on semiconductor exports to the UAE, a change the emirates have long sought, is a “quid pro quo” for Abu Dhabi's investment in the Trump-Witkoff crypto venture.

“You wouldn't be investing in Trump stablecoin unless you want something from him,” Murphy said. “It's all about getting access to Trump and ultimately getting favorable policy from the United States.”

Murphy and other Democrats also charge that once the emirates have those chips, it will be difficult for the United States to prevent some of them from reaching China, which also has close ties to the emirates.

“China will be right there waiting to get their hands on that technology,” he warned.

To ethics officials from previous administrations, the Trump and Witkoff stakes in World Liberty raise red flags.

By reaping income from the firm's crypto sales, both Trump and Witkoff appear to be violating the US constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officers from accepting payments from foreign governments, they said.

“If Witkoff owns an interest in World Liberty and there is a UAE-controlled fund investment in World Liberty, that is likely a violation of the emoluments clause,” Richard W Painter, the top White House ethics official during the George W Bush administration, said in an email message. “His intentions don't matter.”

Witkoff is also subject to administrative regulations enforced by the office of government ethics, Painter and other former officials noted.

“An employee may not use their public office for their own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise … or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated,” the OGE rules state.

The regulations also admonish employees to “ensure that the performance of their official duties does not give rise to an appearance of use of public office for private gain”.

Witkoff says he has begun the paperwork to divest his interest in World Liberty by transferring his interest to his adult sons.

But that move, which he hasn't completed, may not insulate him fully from the ethics laws. He has already collected substantial gains from his equity in World Liberty. And even after a divestment, if his sons profit thanks to his diplomatic post, that would appear to be a violation of the OGE regulations.

Trump is exempt from all conflict of interest regulations, because Congress decided long ago that restricting a president's authority because of his financial interests would be both impractical and a constitutional overstretch.

The White House says Trump and Witkoff have done nothing wrong.

“Despite dishonest claims from Democrats, there are no conflicts of interest,” deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a written statement.

“Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is divesting from all of his assets, including WLF, and has no operational role in the company. These types of baseless accusations only serve to distract from all his incredible work in service to the country.”

The same goes for Trump, she said.

“The president's assets are in a trust managed by his children” – a back-handed acknowledgement that Trump, unlike many of his recent predecessors, has neither divested nor placed his assets in a blind trust. “There are no conflicts of interest,” she repeated.

But “no conflicts of interest” doesn't square with the facts. World Liberty is openly using its association with the president to generate profit for the Trump and Witkoff families.

Senator Murphy dismissed the White House's defense as “absurd on its face”.

“Everybody can see what's going on,” he said.

As for Witkoff's day job – negotiating peace in Gaza, ending the war in Ukraine, and cutting a deal with Iran – it doesn't appear to be going especially well.

In Gaza, Witkoff helped to close Biden's ceasefire deal in January by making the point that Trump wanted it, and by making sure Netanyahu got – briefly – on board. But he's failed at several attempts to extend or renew the ceasefire. He won freedom for one Israeli-American hostage by going around Netanyahu, but not the 20 Israeli hostages who are still believed alive; he's trying to negotiate another temporary ceasefire that would free about half of the captives. He and Trump appear to have misjudged how stubborn Netanyahu would be in his desire to continue the war.

In Ukraine, Witkoff tried to win Putin's confidence by pre-emptively endorsing some of Russia's main demands, including its claim to five Ukrainian regions including Crimea. That hasn't been enough; Putin still appears intent on pursuing his goal of controlling all of Ukraine. In a two-hour telephone call on 19 May, Trump tried to jawbone Putin into embracing a ceasefire, but the Russian leader merely agreed to hold more talks – during which he intends to continue the war.

On Iran, Witkoff initially stumbled by publicly softening US policy, saying Iran could maintain a uranium enrichment program as long as it didn't move toward weapons capability. After a storm of protest from US hardliners, he backed off and returned to the demand that Iran dismantle its entire enrichment program. Trump has given the US-Iranian negotiations a deadline of mid-June, but that's unlikely to be enough to reach a result. Then secretary of state John Kerry needed 20 months to negotiate the 2015 agreement that Trump scrapped, and that was after years of preparatory work.

What's gone wrong? The answer from many foreign policy professionals is that Witkoff, a real-estate developer with no previous diplomatic experience, is in over his head.

“He knows nothing about Russia, he knows nothing about Ukraine, he knows nothing about Iran, he knows nothing about nuclear weapons,” said John Bolton, who served as national security adviser for 18 months during Trump's first term. “What could go wrong?”

Witkoff readily acknowledges that he was naive when he started.

“Of course I didn't understand the dimensions of it,” he said of the Gaza conflict. “Now I do.”

Witkoff says he's fully devoted to his peacemaking mission and considers it more important than anything he accomplished in his real estate career. “The work is so worthy,” he told the Atlantic.

Trump has long derided US diplomats as lousy negotiators and extolled entrepreneurs as master dealmakers.

This month, at a belated swearing-in ceremony for Witkoff, Trump awarded his friend the highest compliment in his business-world lexicon: “He's a killer.”

Witkoff told the Atlantic that he's been boning up on traditional diplomacy by reading books and watching Netflix documentaries. “I watched a ton of stuff on Henry Kissinger,” he said.

But Kissinger never tried to negotiate three complex deals at the same time. Kissinger's negotiations to withdraw US troops from Vietnam lasted more than three years. His talks to reopen US relations with China took more than a year. His disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt took about 20 months.

Witkoff has been on the job for only four months – six if you count his time as Trump's pre-inaugural Gaza envoy. And he's working for a president whose foreign policy decisions often appear erratic.

So landing the Nobel peace prize, as Kissinger did, is likely to be a tall order. But Trump and Witkoff will have at least one consolation: By the end of Trump's term, their families will be a lot richer.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A federal appeals court offered US President Donald Trump a temporary reprieve from a ruling threatening to throw out the bulk of his sweeping tariff agenda, giving at least some hope to a White House now facing substantial new restrictions on its effort to rewrite the global trading order.

The administration celebrated the order from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as validating its vow to aggressively challenge a ruling issued on Wednesday night by the Court of International Trade blocking sweeping parts of Trump's tariffs over his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

White House officials also said that Trump has options to pursue similar tariffs through other authorities if appeals ultimately fall short, even as they planned to continue defending the legality of the IEEPA tariffs to the US Supreme Court.

However, for a president eager to use trade policy to quickly reshape global commerce, other options would be more complicated and bind the threats he has able to wield in the negotiation process with other world leaders. Some alternative US tariff options are laborious to use and would take months to execute, while others are capped in scope and duration.

Trump hailed the appeals court ruling in a social media post on Thursday, while calling the original decision “so wrong and so political.” He claimed that seeking congressional approval for tariffs would hinder his trade agenda and “completely destroy Presidential Power.”

Despite the temporary stay, the possibility that the appeals court could ultimately back the original ruling and block Trump's tariff policy hung heavy over the White House.

Separately, a second federal judge declared a number of Trump's levies enacted using emergency powers unlawful, but limited his decision to the family-owned business that sued and delayed the order from taking effect for 14 days to allow the US Department of Justice time to appeal.

“America cannot function if President Trump — or any other president, for that matter — has their sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations railroaded by activist judges,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.  “Ultimately, the Supreme Court must put an end to this for the sake of our constitution and our country.”

The original court ruling would have provided the Trump administration just 10 days to unwind the levies, but the new order laid out a briefing schedule that runs until June 9 to decide on the request for a longer-term stay. If granted — or if a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court was granted — the tariffs could remain in place for months.

For all of the confidence on Trump's team, Wednesday's initial court ruling marked one of the biggest setbacks of the president's second term. Trump campaigned on using tariffs to combat what he calls other nation's unfair treatment of the US, and the emergency law gave him the fastest avenue to deliver on his pledge.

The ruling would reduce the effective US tariff rate to below 6 percent from a high of almost 27 percent last month, according to Bloomberg Economics calculations, an astronomical level that risked stagflation for the US.

The legal fight also threatens to inject even more uncertainty into a world economy already rattled by Trump's ever-changing posture on import taxes. It might sap Trump's leverage as his team negotiates with numerous trading partners seeking tariff relief.

The trade court decision on Wednesday blocked tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, as well as a flat import tax on almost every US trading partner.

Trump invoked the IEEPA on the grounds that fentanyl and trade deficits are each emergencies necessitating the broad use of executive power. The court ruled that he went too far.

Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance — one beat at a time.

Big Ocean seamlessly incorporates sign language into their performances, and their shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools — vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. 

This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea's entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.

The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April last year and recently wrapped a European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the UK, while promoting their second mini-album, Underwater, which dropped on April 20.

To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop's demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes — flashing light guides displayed on monitors — to help stay in sync.

Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. They also use a pitch-checking app and artificial intelligence voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.

“We each felt rhythm differently when dancing,” PJ said. “So when we'd play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.”

This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. 

“When we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,” said Jiseok. “But we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation — just like we practiced.”

Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. 

“When a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can't see the stage movements in front of us,” PJ said. “Our concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.”

“When there's no clear beat in a song, it's really hard for us to stay synchronized,” Jiseok said. “When the bass is overwhelming, it's difficult for us to catch it accurately.”

Despite these challenges, Big Ocean's commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase — known as PADO — which has responded with similar commitment.

“While communicating with PADO, we've heard that they're actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,” Jiseok said. “When we see how much they're preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.”

The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.

During a head-to-head debate lasting two hours, centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's governing pro-European coalition, faced the Eurosceptic historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS).
The two candidates, who qualified for the second round after coming in the top two places in the first vote on Sunday last week, clashed over Poland's relations with Ukraine, EU policy and the track records of their                                    



                                                                                Four people jailed in the landmark Hong Kong national security trial of ""47 democrats"" accused of conspiracy to commit subversion were freed today after more than four years behind bars, the second group to be released in a month.
Among those freed was long-time political and LGBTQ activist Jimmy Sham (岑子杰), who also led one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups, the Civil Human Rights Front, which disbanded in 2021.
""Let me spend some time with my family,"" Sham said after arriving at his home in the Kowloon district of Jordan.

Four months into his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump has stunned both the American people and the wider world by his administration's rapid-fire actions, which include forcefully deporting immigrants and enacting major reforms of the federal government via the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. On the foreign policy front, he has delivered a shock by effectively abolishing the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on global warming and the World Health Organization.

At the White House, Trump also had a spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sending chills down the spines of many people around the world. There were fears that the Trump administration might try to push Ukraine to capitulate to Russia, in accordance with Moscow's wishes.

Then, in early April, Trump announced plans to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on almost every country and region. He set off a global panic when he added that Washington would impose additional tariffs on about 60 countries and regions with which the United States has large trade deficits.

The world is being swayed by the superpower that is the United States and is struggling with how to respond to the Trump administration. This is especially true for Japan — the United States is its one and only ally and its largest target for investment abroad. It is only natural for Japan to view its relationship with the United States as the most important.

However, there are more countries in the world than just the United States. Japan is now faced with the question of how to develop a comprehensive and proactive foreign policy that takes into account the entire world while maintaining appropriate relations with the United States.

Actually, Japan already has the answer in its vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). While focus has recently shifted away somewhat from this concept toward immediate Japan-U.S. relations, this is a vision that not only can endure but could prove vital during the Trump era.

Though the world economy is showing signs of slowing, there are economies that have managed to sustain high growth rates and display clear signs of dynamism in their economic development. These are the coastal regions along two oceans, from the Western Pacific to Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East and over to Africa, that is, the Indo-Pacific. Japan's future economic growth depends on how closely it will connect with this vast area.

China is increasing its military presence in this region, including by enhancing its military strength in the Taiwan Strait. Peace in the Indo-Pacific is essential for Japan's security and economic prosperity, as well as for the development of the global economy.

The vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific has been backed by major players in the region, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and India. The European Union and the United Kingdom, too, share the view that the Indo-Pacific is important. In a world where U.S. actions are increasing uncertainty, this vision of FOIP has become a good insurance policy for many countries.

For its part, China also views the Indo-Pacific as important, especially for its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to create a massive economic bloc. However, China's loans for infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific are now on the decline. By contrast, Japan's assistance is expanding in scale, and aid projects have been completed in quick succession. So, Japan's focus on a Free and Open Indo-Pacific has had real world results.

Japan regards its relations with Africa and Pacific island nations as an essential part of its Indo-Pacific vision.

Since 1993, Japan, the United Nations and the World Bank have co-hosted the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), with the ninth summit set to be held in August in Yokohama. Through the TICAD process, Japan has extended infrastructure support to help address Africa's development challenges as well as innovative technical support in various fields, including agriculture, education and health. In recent years, Japanese companies have become increasingly willing to invest in Africa.

As for Pacific island nations, Japan has hosted the Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM) since 1997. The 10th PALM summit was held in Tokyo in July 2024. Japan's detail-oriented support tailored to the challenges of each partner country has earned a high level of trust.

Now that the Trump administration has terminated most of the USAID programs, Africa and Pacific island nations are hoping for more aid from Japan. Unlike USAID, Japan's development approach is not based on large-scale grants in aid. It is unrealistic for Japan to take over U.S. financial assistance. Still, Japan is capable of expanding its effective support.

Of course, if we are considering a comprehensive strategy for Japan abroad, we should look beyond the Indo-Pacific. In my opinion, Japan will be able to make its strategy more comprehensive by strengthening its foreign policy toward Europe, inland Asia and Central and South America.

Relations with Europe will become increasingly important. Cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is essential for security in the Indo-Pacific region. To that end, it is necessary to demonstrate Japan's willingness to cooperate toward the future reconstruction and security of Ukraine.

The EU's member countries and the United Kingdom share the same perspective with Japan on global challenges such as global warming. Japan should join hands with Europe to provide leadership on climate change, while keeping in mind that the Trump administration is extremely passive on this issue.

Turning to inland Asia, it is clear that Japan's relations with Mongolia and Central Asian countries are important. Located between Russia and China, these countries tend to be strongly influenced by their goliath neighbors, but they also harbor a strong desire to improve ties with other major powers.

For Mongolia and Uzbekistan, Japan is the largest provider of official development assistance (ODA), and both countries value their relationship with Japan.

In August 2024, then Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had to cancel a planned trip to Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan after the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information advisory for a megaquake. Another tour of inland Asia by the prime minister should be arranged as soon as possible.

And we should not forget Japan's relations with Central and South America. In March, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited Japan as a state guest. Japan's ODA has been well received in the region, having supported soybean production in Brazil and salmon ranching in Chile. There is also room for cooperation via multilateral diplomacy, given that many countries in the region share democratic values with Japan and are home to people of Japanese descent.

Taking a broad view in this way, it becomes clear that Japan should pursue proactive, not reactive, diplomacy based on what I call a “FOIP+++” vision extending its arms toward Europe, inland Asia and Central and South America. Proactive diplomacy could offer a better way to deal with the Trump administration.

Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany will attend planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on June 2, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said in an interview with ABC News on May 29.

""We'll have what we call the E3. That is the national security advisors from Germany, France, and Great Britain... When we were in London, they kind of helped us mold a term sheet for Ukraine,"" Kellogg said.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

""What they're doing with their ballistic missiles, with the Iskanders firing into cities like Kyiv, or using their drones shooting into Kyiv... When they did that the other day, that's a direct violation of what's called the Geneva protocols,"" Kellogg said, reiterating previous statements.

Trump, on May 19, held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Russia reiterated its refusal to a full ceasefire in its war against Ukraine.

""He's killing a lot of people... I don't know what the hell happened to Putin, I've known him for a long time,"" Trump said on May 25. In the same statement, Trump told journalists sanctions against Russia could be on the table amid Russia's intensified attacks.

Despite the peace talks in Turkey, Russia has increased drone and missile attacks against Ukraine.

Despite recent peace talks, Moscow has refused a ceasefire and instead insisted it will provide Ukraine with a memorandum of a peace proposal.

Russia has not given Ukraine the proposal despite indicating it would once peace talks concluded on May 16. Kyiv has not yet officially announced it will attend the next peace talks slated to take place on June 2 in Turkey.

Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said.

""The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful,"" Kellogg said on May 25, following Russian attacks on Kyiv.

A lot depends on the circumstances under which you try to define or feel your own loneliness.

Let me begin with my biography — my recent story. I joined the army in the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, as an officer in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I had never served in the military before, and I never thought I would.

In fact, I considered myself an anti-militarist — and still do.

Yet, I see no contradiction between that and being proudly a senior lieutenant in the Armed Forces. Within three and a half months of participating in the liberation of the Kyiv Oblast and other operations further east, half of my platoon — eight of my subordinates and I — was captured by Russian forces in Luhansk Oblast.

What followed were two years and four months of Russian captivity. I was a prisoner of war, held the entire time in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory — the very region we were defending.

For some reason, keeping me as a POW wasn't enough — perhaps because they learned I was a journalist and human rights activist.

A few months into my captivity, they fabricated a criminal case against me. The following year, I was sentenced as a “war criminal” to 13 years in a penal colony for supposed heinous crimes.


I felt lonely because of what I had experienced.
    

The only evidence against me was a confession — extracted under duress. I prefer that phrasing, as it avoids the word “torture.”

I was part of a prisoner exchange in October of last year.

Naturally, I'm incredibly happy to be free. But it also breaks my heart — almost everyone I spent those years with in captivity, except for two, are still there. And of my own platoon, four remain incarcerated.

As a former POW, when you're released and return to your native city — Kyiv, which I've never loved more — you meet hundreds, even thousands, of wonderful people, joyful to see you free. I felt an overwhelming lightness, warmth, and happiness. And yet, at the same time, I understood — and so did many of them — that something fundamental had changed between us. I felt lonely because of what I had experienced.

I've been to places and seen things they never have — and I hope they never will. But I also realized that our worldviews had diverged. How we see and feel the world is no longer the same.

Most of them, when they thought about it — without any prompting — said, “No, we don't know what you went through.” And that's true for every former prisoner of war or civilian detainee.

This is what distinguishes a war veteran or a civilian under occupation from everyone else. We are shaped by what we live through.

It's a strange thing, to feel lonely in such a significant — perhaps even defining — part of your life. But it's a kind of chosen loneliness, because you don't want others to feel what you felt. You don't want them to go through what you endured.

In captivity, our guards deliberately tried to inflict another kind of loneliness. They worked to break us — morally, psychologically, and yes, physically. Especially in the first several months, we were held incommunicado, with no contact with the outside world.

They repeatedly told us: “You've been abandoned. Everyone has forgotten you. You are on your own. You're at our mercy. No one can reach you. We can do whatever we want. No one cares.”

I was lucky. I never believed it. Not for a single second — not even in the darkest moments. I placed all my trust in my loved ones — my family, my friends, my colleagues, and just kind people out there — believing they remembered me, remembered us.

Other Ukrainian POWs came to hear me say it out loud: “We are not forgotten.” That kind of destructive loneliness didn't work. Physically, we were isolated — but morally, we were not.


“You don't know what's happening. You don't understand. Wake up.”
    

The loneliness I felt after my release was of a different kind. It wasn't about isolation. It was more complex. At the same time, I knew I was free because of other people. They had written letters, led campaigns, given interviews, and posted on social media. In the final months of my captivity, I learned there was a campaign of solidarity for me — but I couldn't have imagined the scale of it.

After my release, I kept meeting strangers who had participated in it. And I know I am free, to the extent possible, because of them.

I had plenty of time in captivity to reflect. My first degree is in philosophy — it never fades. I realized I had never treasured people as deeply as I do now. I began to grasp how much I am human — at my best — because of others.

I recently returned from an advocacy trip across Europe, specifically within the EU. And I felt something many Ukrainians abroad have shared with me — being in a peaceful country untouched by what we've endured for more than three years now.

I felt joy simply observing people. Watching groups of young people rushing through their day-to-day lives. I was so happy to see people living in normalcy. They should not endure what we're living through. That's a good thing. That's human.

War is a state of profound dehumanization. People aren't meant to live through it. I was glad to see them. But at the same time, I felt like I knew something they didn't. I had this urge to walk up to someone, shake them, and say, “You don't know what's happening. You don't understand. Wake up.”

It's a kind of loneliness rooted in experience — that of a former prisoner of war. We've lived through something I sincerely hope no other community or country will ever have to experience. And as terrible as it sounds, I want us to be alone in that experience. Because if we're not, it means we failed to defend ourselves, and others had to share this tragedy with us.

I would hope we rather remain lonely in that regard.

The Trump administration said Thursday that Israel has accepted a new U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel had supported. She said that Hamas has not yet accepted the proposal but talks are continuing. 

A Hamas official told Reuters that the group “is studying the amended Witkoff proposal with a high sense of responsibility, stemming from interest to achieve the interests of our people and ensure an end to the aggression.”

The ceasefire development comes at an intense time in Gaza where people are desperate to obtain food. UN agencies have been warning that people there are at risk of famine. Last Friday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict.” He said that after a nearly 80-day blockade, Israel had allowed “finally, a trickle” of aid to cross over. It wasn't enough. 

The World Food Program said Wednesday that “hordes of hungry people” broke into its warehouse in central Gaza searching for food. The agency said that according to initial reports, two people died and several were injured. However, the Associated Press, citing hospital staff, reported that four people were killed. 

“Humanitarian needs have spiralled out of control after 80 days of complete blockade of all food assistance and other aid into Gaza,” the WFP said in a statement. It added that it has warned of “alarming and deteriorating conditions” in Gaza and the risks imposed by limiting humanitarian aid to hungry people who are desperate for help. The agency called for food assistance to be scaled up, saying it's the only way to reassure people “that they will not starve.” 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel has signed off on the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza.

Last week, Israel ended its blockade on humanitarian goods and allowed trucks carrying life-saving aid to enter the enclave. This week, a new controversial U.S.-backed private company called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has the support of Israel, set up aid distribution sites in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas steals aid, something aid groups have denied. 

International aid organizations have condemned the new system of distributing aid in Gaza, accusing the state of politicizing the process. Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN's aid co-ordination office, has said that Israel is trying to bypass its system run by 15 UN aid organizations and 200 NGOs and partners. He warned before the new aid distribution system was launched that it appeared to be “a deliberate attempt to weaponize the aid.” He said aid should be provided based on need. 

Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN aid co-ordination office for the Palestinian territories, said Wednesday that in Gaza “people are being starved and then drip-fed in the most undignified way possible.” He said the new distribution scheme was “engineered scarcity: four distribution hubs located in central and southern Gaza, secured by private U.S. security contractors, where those Palestinians who can reach them will receive rations.”

Humanitarian aid organizations held a press conference on Parliament Hill Thursday criticizing the new aid distribution method, saying it politicizes an already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. 

Oxfam Canada's director of international programs, Erin Kiley, said the new mechanism gives Israel power over who receives aid, where and from whom, turning relief into a tool of coercion.

“These actions undermine international humanitarian law and set a precedent for occupying powers to dictate the terms of aid based on political agendas and military goals,” she said.

The UN said this week its human-rights office received information that at least 47 people were injured Tuesday while trying to obtain aid. A spokesperson for GHF said the report of injuries is “completely false” and that GHF “has had no major injuries or deaths since we started operations on Tuesday.”

GHF said that “misinformation” is circulating online and sought to clarify that no shots have been fired at Palestinian crowds at their distribution sites, nor have there been casualties. 

The company said in a statement that it continued its operations Thursday at three distribution sites and that they have plans to build more across Gaza, including in the north. 

Danny Glenwright, president and chief executive officer of Save the Children Canada, said that none of the chaos unfolding in Gaza is necessary. “This is a crisis that Israel has created because it is bypassing systems that have been in place that work for us, that have worked for us in every conflict setting, in every humanitarian setting in which we've worked for many, many decades,” he said.

Mr. Glenwright said that humanitarian principles exist to ensure that those who need aid the most are able to get it, and aid must be delivered independently.

Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, said Israel is trying to alleviate the political pressure it is facing from global allies. “They want to relieve political pressure, but they don't necessarily want to address the underlying humanitarian crisis,” he said.

He said pressure from the international community needs to continue, and Israel needs to allow experienced humanitarian organizations long established in Gaza to resume their work at scale. 

“This is not going to work,” he said of the new aid distribution model. “This is not how you do famine relief. Famine relief is not about making people walk very, very long distances carrying very heavy boxes of food.”

The UN's humanitarian office warned that 100% of Gaza was at risk of famine. Meanwhile France's Macron says a tougher collective stance on Israel may be needed if the situation on the ground doesn't change. Follow DW.

Below you can read a roundup of developments in Israel, Gaza and the wider Middle East on Friday May 30, 2025:

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Berlin will decide on whether the country should approve new weapons shipments to Israel based on a humanitarian assessment of the situation on the ground in Gaza.

""We are examining this and, if necessary, we will authorize further arms deliveries based on this examination,"" Wadephul told German daily, the Süddeutsche Zeitung.

According to Wadephul, Germany's ""special responsibility"" towards Israel is beyond debate and that the country should be able to defend itself against the threats it faces.

""On the other hand, of course, this does not mean that a government can do whatever it wants.""

Wadephul's comments join Chancellor Friedrich Merz's criticism of Israel's operation in Gaza. Israel's operation in Gaza has also been widely criticized by other western countries of late, including the UK and France.

Middle East expert Rene Wildangel told DW that the new wave of criticism by German politicians on Israel's war in Gaza must be followed by action.

An arms embargo on Israel is ""overdue"" from Germany's perspective, Wildangel said.

""Chancellor Friedrich Merz says he does not understand [Israel's war] objectives anymore, then I would say he should listen to some of the Israeli leaders because they splell it out pretty clearly,"" the historian says, pointing out that the several Israeli officials have said their aim is ""the permanent occupation and expulsion of Palestinians"" from the Gaza Strip.

According to Wildangel, criticizing Israel is not enough.

""We're talking about a weapons banand we are also talking about trade relations with Israel,"" he says, adding that most human rights organizations and several genocide scholars describe Israel's actions in Gaza as ""genocide.""

The comments come amid a growing chorus of criticism aimed at Israel over the humanitarian situation unfolding in Gaza.

This week, Germany said it remained committed to Israel and that its expectations regarding the aid situation had been expressed.

""We stand with Israel,"" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Wednesday in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News.

""We are close partners to Israel, not only with regard to our history. We are responsible for the security and the existence of Israel,"" he added when asked whether Germany was making a U-turn in its policy.

""This humanitarian situation for the Gazans is very dire and therefore it is our request on Israel to allow humanitarian aid to come to the Gaza Strip,"" the foreign minister said, adding that this expectation had been expressed ""very clearly.""

The UN has issued more dire warnings about the desperate situation unfolding in Gaza as attempts to get aid to Palestinians continue.

""Gaza is the hungriest place on Earth,"" said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, as quoted by the AFP news agency.

""It's the only defined area — a country or defined territory within a country — where you have the entire population at risk of famine. 100% of the population at risk of famine,"" Laerke said, rejecting claims by Israeli authorities that it wasn't the case.

While the aid blockade has been partially eased in recent days, of the 900 truckloads of authorized aid, only 600 had been offloaded on the Gazan side.

""This limited number of truckloads that are coming in... it's a trickle,"" Laerke said, describing it as ""drip-feeding food.""

The spokesman said the mission to deliver aid was ""in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history.""

Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, also said that half of the organization's medical facilities in the area were out of action due to a lack of fuel or medical equipment.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that the collective position on Israel could toughen if there were no improvements to the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

""The humanitarian blockade is creating a situation that is untenable on the ground,"" Macron said during a joint press conference in Singapore with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

""And so, if there is no response that meets the humanitarian situation in the coming hours and days, obviously, we will have to toughen our collective position,"" Macron said, adding that sanctions against Israeli settlers may be up for consideration.

""But I still hope that the government of Israel will change its stance and that we will finally have a humanitarian response,"" the French leader said.

Macron reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry later hit back at Macron an accused him of a ""crusade against the Jewish state.""

It said ""Israel is currently facilitating aid entry into Gaza through two parallel efforts,"" referring to both the UN and the controversial US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Fund.

A number of European countries have begun changing their tone on Israel's Gaza offensive in recent weeks. This added fuel to a debate here over whether Germany should continue to deliver arms to Israel. DW Political Correspondent Matthew Moore explains.

There are stark warnings from the United Nations after a spokesperson said the entire population of Gaza is at risk of famine.

The situation in terms of aid deliveries has been described as ""drip-feeding food"" as not all of the 900 authorised truckloads have been offloaded on the Gaza said.

Meanwhile French President Emmanuel Macron has cautioned that the collective stance on Israel may need to be toughened if a humanitarian response was not forthcoming in the coming hours or days.

The convention initiated by Beijing was signed by more than 30 developing countries, signaling China's growing influence in the Global South. 

China on Friday signed a convention forming a global mediation-based dispute resolution organization in Hong Kong, seeking to grow it in status similar to bodies such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

More than 30 countries backed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation in Hong Kong, including Laos, Cambodia, Serbia, Papua New Guinea and Venezuela.

Pakistan, Indonesia, Belarus and Cuba also signed the convention to become founding members of the global organization, following Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

""The birth of IOMed will help transcend the zero-sum mentality of 'win or lose,' promote the amicable resolution of international disputes, and build more harmonious international relations,"" Wang said.

Through the establishment of the organization in Hong Kong, China also aims to solidify the city's credentials as an international legal and dispute resolution services center in Asia.

The move to form the international organization comes amid the US's diminishing presence in global affairs as China seeks to fill the gap left by the US under President Donald Trump.

The support for the body by a remarkably high number of developing countries signals Beijing's growing influence in the Global South.

Beijing has been steadily increasing its involvement in international affairs over the past few years and expanding its influence in global bodies such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Since beginning his term in January, Trump has ordered the US to leave UN bodies such as the UN Human Rights Council and has also decreed a US pullout from the WHO.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Thailand is moving to restrict cannabis to medical use only. What will the new rules mean for its booming weed industry?

Thailand decriminalized cannabis in 2022. However, it did so without a comprehensive law regulating its sale, production or use.

Since then, tens of thousands of licensed dispensaries and retailers selling cannabis and cannabis extracts have opened across the country, particularly in tourist hot spots.

Three years later, Thailand is now planning to tighten the control of marijuana use, ensuring that cannabis is only used for medicinal purposes and not recreationally. 

Under a new medical bill expected to be announced in the next few weeks, dispensaries will be allowed to sell cannabis only to other licensed shops or to customers with a prescription from a medical professional.

Chokwan ""Kitty"" Chopaka, a well-known cannabis activist in Thailand, said the new medical bill could see a 90% drop in licensed cannabis shops in Thailand.

""I understand what the government is doing. I don't agree with it,"" she told DW.

""I feel the ones that are going to be left are the bigger shops, who actually have that war chest and they will serve the tourists, and the locals will probably grow their own, because getting a doctor's note is going to be too much of an issue.""

""[There will be] probably only 1,000 dispensaries left,"" Kitty added.

The government had hoped that decriminalizing cannabis would turn it into a kind of cash crop for Thailand, boosting its tourism and agriculture sectors, with the Thai Chamber of Commerce estimating it could be worth $1.2 billion (€1.06 billion) annually.

But the lack of a law governing its use created a loophole which has seen a rise in recreational use, illegal distribution and a saturated market. The free use of cannabis has also seen some backlash from activist groups who have protested against its legalization.

Tighter regulations for the use of cannabis also come at a time when tourists have been warned about taking cannabis products out of Thailand. In recent weeks, two British women were arrested in Georgia and Sri Lanka, respectively, for allegedly smuggling cannabis.

Marijuana that has been smuggled out of Thailand has also prompted concerns from Thai officials over how easily and in what quantities cannabis can be purchased today.

Gloria Lai, Asia regional director for the International Drug Policy Consortium, said the decision for a new bill seems rushed.

""The health minister's announcement appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to concerns about people smuggling cannabis out of Thailand, and it is questionable whether the proposal to restrict the buying and selling of cannabis to medical prescription only will solve that concern,"" she told DW.

""Given the proposal of legislation to regulate cannabis in a more comprehensive manner, it seems more useful to initiate inclusive consultations on those proposals — while allowing reasonable time frames for inputs from communities impacted by proposed cannabis regulations — rather than rapidly introducing new rules that risk causing greater confusion.""

Rattapon Sanrak, founder and president of the Highland Network, a cannabis organization in Thailand, said the new cannabis bill poses potential problems for the industry.

""Sudden enforcement could cause chaos,"" he told DW. ""If the law takes effect right away, businesses, the public and officials will not have time to learn the new rules or adjust their work. Changing everything overnight is not realistic.""

But Rattapon believes there is still uncertainty over how long-lasting the new rule will be. 

""This bill comes as a ministerial regulation, decided by a single minister. If the minister changes, the rules can flip again. That is risky for an industry that involves huge investments and thousands of jobs. Passing a full act of parliament would give the rules a stable, democratic foundation and protect everyone who has invested time and money in the cannabis industry,"" he added.

Confusion over the future of cannabis in Thailand has been ever-present since Thailand's Food and Drug Administration officially delisted cannabis from the narcotics list in June 2022.

Thailand's ruling Pheu Thai Party had initially pushed for cannabis to be reclassified as a narcotic. But in 2023, former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin told reporters at the UN General Assembly in New York that cannabis would be only allowed for medical purposes.

Pressure from Thailand's government coalition partner, the Bhumjaithai Party, whose flagship policy was to decriminalize cannabis, has pushed for the plant to remain legal. 

The new bill is expected to be a temporary measure before Thailand announces a comprehensive cannabis act to fully regulate the use, production and export of the plant. This is expected to be announced in two years.

			Maine businesses brace for drop in Canadian tourists amid antipathy towards president over his tariffs and annexation threats

Overlooking picturesque Perkins Cove in Ogunquit, southern Maine, Barnacle Billy's has welcomed presidents, prime ministers and princes over the past six and a half decades.

George HW Bush used to ferry world leaders, including Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev, on his speedboat across the bay to the seafood restaurant from his summer residence at Walker's Point.

But now Tim Tower, the owner of the business, is more focused on a more prosaic clientele: Canadians.

Nearly 800,000 Canadians crossed the border last year, spending almost half a billion dollars in the US.

This year, Maine's businesses are bracing themselves for a 25 per cent drop, largely thanks to Donald Trump.

His repeated suggestions that Canada should become America's 51st state, coupled with his tariff war, saw the number of tourists crossing over the Canadian border to holiday in the States drop by 157,000 in the first four months of the year.

Canadians also did not take kindly to Mr Trump berating Justin Trudeau, the former prime minister, belittling the country on Truth Social and antagonising Mark Carney, Mr Trudeau's replacement, throughout the general election earlier this year.

Sporadic reports of Canadians being interrogated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, having their phones searched, and even being detained at the border has many Canadians under the impression that Trump's America is not putting out the welcome mat for its friendly northern neighbours.

One of the most popular spots for summering Canadians in the US is the northeastern state of Maine, home to a rugged, rocky coast, tranquil lakes and rolling, green mountains.

With traditional industries like paper manufacturing and textile mills having gone long ago, tourism is vital to the state's economy. It even has “Vacationland” emblazoned on number plates.

It is Maine's business owners such as Mr Tower who are at the sharp end of Mr Trump's falling out with Canada.

The son of the restaurant's founder, “Barnacle Billy” Tower, trusts that generations of goodwill should shield the business from some of the fallout triggered by the US president's invective.

But the future is uncertain in the town and southern Maine as a whole with fears that the once steady stream of Canadian cars heading south is slowing down to a trickle.

Fewer Quebec and Nova Scotia number plates are being spotted on the roads down from Canada and far less French is being heard in restaurants and stores this spring, locals say.

Like many business owners, Mr Tower is somewhat apprehensive about what the summer holds.

“Revenue will be down. And hopefully there'll be something to counterbalance it if indeed the Canadians don't show up in the numbers we expect,” he told The Telegraph.

“But I'm worried about Canadians in general [not] coming because of a negative feeling they might have.”

Hoteliers have told him that Canadians who come to the seaside town of Ogunquit every year are giving Maine a miss this summer.

The fear is that some may never return.

“If you were going to choose any country to have a border with, of all the countries in the world, Canada would always be number one,” Mr Tower continued.

But he fears that the neighbourly goodwill has dissipated.

“I'm disappointed that one man or one administration could do something like that,” he added.

John Clancy, who owns the Perkins Cove Pottery Shop, which has been in business for 41 years, fears the predicted 25 per cent drop in tourists to Maine could be an underestimate.

“I had a conversation with a [Canadian] tour operator,' he told The Telegraph.

“This past season, they usually were scheduled like about 100 trips a season all over the US. And this year, they were down from 11 to five . And I think once they were at five, they just decided to cancel all trips for 2025.

“All this sort of ridiculous talk of Canada becoming another state, the rhetoric is just dismissive of our friends in Canada. So I could clearly see that Canadians were just not coming to visit.”

About 13 miles to the north, Ken Mason felt the cold blast of Canadian antipathy towards Mr Trump before the summer season even started.

Canadians account for around 40 per cent of springtime guests at the Seaside Inn on Kennebunk Beach, which has been in the same family since 1667.

“Traditionally, we have quite a few of the same Canadians come back each year; we have about an 82 per cent return rate,” he told The Telegraph.

“Each year in November, I send letters to returning guests offering them first refusal to come back the following season.”

“Starting about the end of January, beginning of February, I ended up having enough Canadians cancel that I had to refund just under $7,000.

“The only reason that any of them gave us was they just didn't like the rhetoric towards Canada and they didn't feel that they were welcome this year to come down to the States.

“They didn't like being called a little brother, they didn't like being called to the 51st state,” Mr Mason said.

He added: “And these are people that have been coming for decades and I know them and I call them back and try to let them know that they're more than welcome in the area.

“They're more welcome anywhere in the States to come but they just said this year because they didn't feel like they were being welcome, they just went to pass and go someplace else.”

Old Orchard Beach, a seaside resort with an old-fashioned funfair, has been popular with Canadians for decades. It was singled out for a boycott by Mr Trudeau earlier this year.

In early March, as Mr Trump launched his trade war, the former prime minister pinpointed the Maine resort as a target for Canadian retaliation.

“This is a trade war,” Mr Trudeau said. “Canadians are hurt. Canadians are angry. We're going to choose to not go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever.”

Canadians also boycotted other US products from bourbon to wine as feelings ran high.

“We definitely did have a bunch of cancellations in January and February,” Sean Nickless, who runs the Crest Motel, told The Telegraph.

“Some Canadians are still coming. At the beginning, I was a little more pessimistic, but now I'm more hopeful.”

This is not the first time that Maine has fallen victim to Mr Trump's administration.

During his first term, his trade war with China saw Beijing slap a 40 per cent tariff on US lobsters, dealing a mortal blow to one of the state's other key industries.

Janet Mills, Maine's governor, who had a spectacular Oval Office row with Mr Trump over a transgender athlete, has tried to limit the damage to its tourist industry.

To make Canadians feel wanted in Maine, the state has put up signs in English and French welcoming them to the state.

She admits it is a small gesture.

“A sign can't stop harmful policies or rhetoric coming from Washington, but it can send a simple but powerful message – here in Maine, we value our neighbours, we will always treat them with respect, and we welcome them warmly to our state.”

The report contained numerous fake citations and markers indicating that it had been compiled using OpenAI.

The White House's keystone health report outlining its agenda for Americans' health is riddled with artificial intelligence “hallucinations,” with fabricated citations and broken links reflective of the administration's embrace of non-scientific approaches to public health.

An analysis by The Washington Post uncovered numerous citations in the “Make America Healthy Again” report with the letters “oaicite” attached to the URLs — a marker indicating that they were collected using artificial intelligence created by OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT. 

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, The New York Times and NOTUS uncovered numerous citations within the report, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that were totally fabricated. This lines up with the tendency of AI technology like ChatGPT to “hallucinate” information — a common and growing problem fueling the spread of disinformation online and among the public. 

Experts say relying on AI for a factual report that has serious implications for people's health and lives is dangerous, as AI does not “know” objective truths and is subject to manipulation by its programmers. And yet, this document marks the administration's approach to the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of Americans and their children.

“The problem with current AI is that it's not trustworthy, so it's just based on statistical associations and dependencies,” Steven Piantadosi, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Post. “It has no notion of ground truth, no notion of … a rigorous logical or statistical argument. It has no notions of evidence and how strongly to weigh one kind of evidence versus another.”

“This is not an evidence-based report, and for all practical purposes, it should be junked at this point,” Georges C. Benjamin, who heads the American Public Health Association, told the Post. “It cannot be used for any policymaking. It cannot even be used for any serious discussion, because you can't believe what's in it.”

The Trump administration chalked up the fake citations to “formatting issues,” which would not explain fabricated citations and AI markers. The administration subsequently uploaded a version of the document with some of the fake citations replaced.

It's ironic that the administration would decry traditional methods of scientific research and tout the “gold-standard” work that the administration will do instead in a document that couldn't even accomplish the most basic fact checking and citation tasks required for quality research.

“Scientific publishing is supposed to be about verification,” said Ivan Oransky, who co-founded a website that tracks study retractions, per The New York Times. “There's supposed to be a set of eyes, actually several sets of eyes. And so what that tells us is that there was no good set of eyes on this.”

It's also ironic that Kennedy threatened this week to bar government-funded scientists from publishing in major medical journals while using research published in those very journals to bolster his points in the MAHA report.

The report itself, experts have said, is full of disinformation, often making statements not supported by the sources it cites. It strategically omits certain explanations for poor health outcomes in the U.S. — like COVID-19, the lack of universal health care, or the fact that the leading cause of death for children is gun violence — while failing to mention legitimate solutions for others. It also cherry-picks evidence, like rising rates of mental disorders among children, while failing to note that clinicians are becoming better at recognizing and diagnosing such disorders.

Meanwhile, some of the report's recommendations are flatly hypocritical. For instance, under its section about the spread of ultra-processed foods, the report touts the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, for its “proven track record of improving children's health.” 

However, the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to social programs via Republicans' reconciliation bill are slated to negatively impact enrollment in WIC, jeopardizing benefits used by millions of pregnant, postpartum, newborn and child beneficiaries to access healthy, fresh foods.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Organizers protested the Canadian government's planned investment into militarization at a weapons fair this week.

Organizers protested the Canadian government's planned investment into militarization at a weapons fair this week.

For just $61 billion, Canada can get in on Donald Trump's latest scheme: a space-based North American missile defense system that Trump has called the “Golden Dome.”

Trump posted the amount of money he would expect Canada to pay on his Truth Social account on May 27 — the same day that King Charles was in Ottawa to read the Speech from the Throne to open a new session of Parliament. Trump told Canadians that if Canada became the 51th state, the cost of being part of the program would drop to zero — something that Global News reports that the Prime Minister's Office had not heard from Trump.

Trump's plan revives a version of Ronald Reagan's spaced-based missile plan, popularly known as “Star Wars.” In a brief written in March 2025 for The Simons Foundation for Nuclear Disarmament, Ernie Regehr, senior fellow in Arctic security and defense, argues, “The new iteration of strategic missile defence in the form of the Golden Dome is every bit as ambitious (and just as unrealistic) as was Reagan's Star Wars.”

While the throne speech didn't mention the Golden Dome plan, it did show that Canada is hoping to play to both London and Washington for military alliances. The throne speech is usually delivered by the king's representative in Canada, the governor general, and outlines the government's priorities for a new session of parliament. But in a nod to Carney's desire to be closer to the United Kingdom, Charles III read the speech — only the third time in Canada's history for a royal to do it. The last time was in 1977. Reading the speech, King Charles III said this: “The Government will protect Canada's sovereignty by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will boost Canada's defense industry by joining ReArm Europe, to invest in transatlantic security with Canada's European partners. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.”

The ReArm Europe Plan is an $900 billion project that was presented to the European Commission in March 2024 and passed by the European Parliament last March. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that joining ReArm Europe will reduce Canada's reliance on the United States. Carney told CBC's “Power and Politics”: “We're spending over 75 cents on every dollar of capital spending for defense that goes to the United Space. That's not smart. What's better if we spend more at home, have diversified partnerships.” By joining ReArm, Carney says that Canada would “become part of a very big build-out of [Europe's] defense industrial base, which will have big benefit for jobs in Canada.”

The throne speech did not explicitly name Golden Dome, but that doesn't mean that Carney is publicly opposed to deeper integration with the United States around missile defense. In fact, the same day as the throne speech, the Globe and Mail reported that Carney “talked up the benefits” of Trump's plan. “Is it a good idea for Canada?” Carney said. “Yes, it's a good idea to have protection against missiles in place for Canadians.”

The Canadian government confirmed on Tuesday that it was formally speaking to U.S. officials about the plan. A request for an interview to Canada's Department of National Defense was referred to the Prime Minister's Office. The Prime Minister's Office did not respond to two requests for comment.

Rachel Small, Canadian organizer for World BEYOND War, says that Carney's apparent support for joining the Golden Dome program is confusing, given that Carney's election victory was thanks in no small part to “a promise to disentangle Canada's military from the U.S.… That's clearly his mandate. That's what he should be doing. And so for me, this is the exact opposite.”

“I was quite shocked, to be honest,” Small told Truthout, “because it seemed unthinkable to me that at literally the same moment that Trump is trying to ramp up economic aggression, maybe annexationist threats against Canada, that we would consider partnering with them on hundreds of billions of dollars of new military projects, let alone one that will literally antagonize military powers around the world.”

Small argues that the real security threats that need to be addressed do not come from abroad: “If we take an honest look, the biggest security threats facing Canada — literally the forces that risk killing the largest number of humans in this country — then it's clearly climate change, ecological collapse, disease epidemics, public health emergencies and poverty coupled with the ballooning cost on housing and food.” She says that spending money on war readiness rather than what Canadians need is “a slap in the face of everyone in Canada who is struggling to get by.”

Carney's desire to spend more money on North American security alongside the United States feels like an about-face from where Carney was just a few months ago. Back in March, just as Canada was about to head into an election campaign, Carney promised to review a contract to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, worth $85 million each. Canadians expressed concern that U.S.-built jets would be used by the Canadian military at a time where the president of the United States was vocally and repeatedly threatening to annex Canada.

Small points to Carney revisiting the F-35 contract as an example of a decision Carney makes when he is trying to gain favor from the Canadian population. “I don't think the Canadian public is with them on [expanding military spending]. I see zero evidence specifically that the Canadian public is interested in picking a fight with China or in supporting the U.S. in its war mongering, or buying these wildly expensive war machines,” she said.

The throne speech coincided with the start of the annual national defense trade show and conference, called CANSEC, in Ottawa one day later. It was the first time that Canada's newly minted minister of defense made public comments. In front of Canada's arms industry, David McGuinty took aim at Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and promised to triple defense spending by 2030. He reiterated Canada's desire to join ReArm Europe though did not mention the Golden Dome.

A protest organized by a coalition of antiwar groups tried to shut access to the conference by occupying a road outside of it. Ottawa police said that they arrested 11 protesters, just before 11 am on May 28. Among those arrested were a photographer and a medic. Protest organizer Brent Patterson said that Ottawa police carried out the arrests even though protesters had “repeatedly communicated that we were dispersing at that point.”

The group, which included the Palestinian Youth Movement, Labour for Palestine and Independent Jewish Voices, is calling for an immediate two-way arms embargo on Israel, an end to the planned construction of a new weapons facility in Ottawa and redirection of military spending to health care, housing, education and climate justice.

Patterson said that it's critical for Canadians to demonstrate that they do not support the government's planned investment into militarization. “We have to keep saying that that's not the way to go,” he told Truthout. “Enriching the transnational corporations that profit from genocide and repression, that's where that money is going … all of that we have to say ‘no' to and I think that is what we did yesterday at CANSEC.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

            President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh Friday to celebrate a deal he once vowed to oppose - Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel's long-announced plans to buy iconic American steelmaker US Steel.
    


            The deal to have a Japanese company purchase US Steel has drawn bipartisan opposition. President Joe Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds shortly before he left office. But a week ago, Trump announced he would approve the deal, although he described it as a “partnership” between the two companies, not a purchase. When asked Sunday about the deal, he told reporters “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon.)”
    


            “It will be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal,” he said.
    


            Trump is set to appear at a US Steel plant just outside of Pittsburgh Friday evening. The appearance, and his latest announcement, appears to clear the way for the controversial deal at a time that long-time allies Japan and the United States find themselves in the middle of a trade war.
    


            Trump is threatening increased tariffs on US imports from Japan and has already imposed tariffs on all steel imports. It also introduces foreign ownership to a company that was once a symbol of American industrial might that has become a struggling afterthought in the modern US economy.
    


            But the actual terms of the deal have not been disclosed since that announcement last week. From the outside, it appears that Nippon will still purchase all outstanding shares of US Steel for $55 a share, or about $12.5 billion, under terms of a deal first announced in December 2023. Trump said it has also agreed to invest $14 billion in US Steel's American operations.
    


            Neither company has commented on the terms of the deal since Trump's announcement. But the United Steelworkers, which represents US Steel's hourly workers in Pennsylvania and Indiana, said it is not dropping its opposition, because it believes the deal still represents a complete purchase by Nippon.
    


            “The latest ‘partnership' announcement continues to raise more questions than answers,” said the union's statement. “Nippon still maintains it would only invest in US Steel facilities if it owned the company outright. We've seen nothing in the reporting to indicate that position has changed. We also have no confirmation if or how much of the stated $14 billion would go to our union-represented sites, or how much would be for new capital improvements versus routine repair & maintenance.”
    


            Even if Nippon does own all the shares, it apparently will be with restrictions. The “control” Trump is referring to will likely come from the federal government holding so-called “golden shares” in US Steel as a condition of approval. That allows the government to approve a majority of the company's board members, who will all be American, Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick told CNBC.
    


            “That will allow the United States to ensure that production levels aren't cut,” McCormick, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, said Tuesday.
    


            A week after the announcement, neither company has yet said how much of US Steel Nippon will own.
    


            “US Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement last Friday following Trump's announcement.
    


            While Trump repeatedly vowed to block the deal while on the campaign trail, he has signaled since taking office that he might be open to the deal after all. In March, the administration filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. Trump then ordered a new review of the acquisition in April.
    


            Trump said Sunday that members of Congress had been pushing for approval of the deal as had local unions that represent hourly workers at US Steel. But the national union officials continue to urge Trump to block the deal, calling it a “disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security and the future of American manufacturing.”
    


            US Steel has threatened that it would be forced to close some of its older, unionized mills unless the deal is completed and it gets the investment dollars needed to modernize.
    


            But the USW has said its worried Nippon's long-term goal is to shift production to its non-union operations in Texas or import steel from Japan to be finished in the United States, ending integrated steel production at the company.
    


            Nippon Steel has promised, however, to honor the union's contract with US Steel and to invest billions in integrated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
    


            US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II.
    


            But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.
    


            But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands — particularly in the politically significant state of Pennsylvania. So those who support the deal have gone out of their way to suggest that it will stay American, with an American CEO and headquarters in Pittsburgh, even if it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign rival.

            US ports have been seeing pandemic-level declines in imports, so good news on tariffs was just what port officials were hoping for.
    


            For awhile on Wednesday, it looked like retailers and ports got exactly that, with a court blocking many of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But a federal appeals court on Thursday quickly paused that ruling.
    


            That kind of whiplash underscores why, even when there's news of tariffs easing, goods  don't start flowing into US ports right away. And that could mean fewer goods on store shelves in the coming months, cutting into available choices and raising prices for everyday Americans.
    


            Indeed, last month, imports declined by a whopping $68.4 billion, according to advanced trade data released by the Census Bureau on Friday. This came after retailers stocked up on goods in March, aiming to get ahead of tariffs. But the stunning decline in imports could mean retailers have less of an inventory buffer, leaving them less able to avoid paying future tariffs — and that could lead to price increases for US consumers.
    


            “I think there was an expectation that all of a sudden everything would start coming in again. I don't think you've seen that huge rush to bring everything in again because I think folks are still being cautious on how this is going to proceed,” said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.
    


            Even after Trump lowered tariffs on China from 145% to 30% earlier this month, America's largest ports have yet to see a rebound. The Port of Los Angeles reported a 30% import decline during the final week of May compared to last year. The Northwest Seaport Alliance, which represents the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, says imports also dropped by 30% from the last week in April to the first week in May, and volume is significantly lower compared to last year.
    


            Then Wednesday evening's decision by a US court in Manhattan injected new chaos into the trade picture. The ruling blocked a swath of Trump's tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most imports and the higher duties on China, Mexico and Canada. The White House filed an appeal, and by Thursday afternoon a federal appeals court restored the tariffs until both sides provide written arguments by early next month.
    


            The back and forth is confusing enough for any retailer trying to do business, especially when they have to plan weeks or even months in advance.
    


            “It's kind of a ping pong back and forth. We're trying to understand what's on, what's off. So it's very difficult for retailers to try and plan ahead,” said Gold.
    


            As retailers sit confused, fewer containers are headed for America's ports. The 30% tariff on China was already proving too costly for many retailers to bring more inventory into the United States, according to Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. About 45% of the port's cargo comes from China.
    


            Those that can afford the cost are shipping already-manufactured products, but no new factory orders are being placed, he said.
    


            “With the whipsaw effect of information that continues to come out on trade policy and tariffs – many continue to take the wait-and-see approach,” Seroka told CNBC on Thursday.
    


            Things are improving for the Port of LA, albeit slowly. In the first week of June, 96,000 large cargo containers are expected to arrive, up from 69,000 in the final week of May. By the second week of June, 106,000 containers are expected. That's a jump, but that's still a loss of 9.4% from last year, according to port data.
    


            “We're nowhere near where we should be heading into the first two weeks of June. We still have 10 cancelled sailings of scheduled vessel arrivals for June – half of those are in the first week,” Seroka said. “So we are not seeing an uptick like some observers had called for or a big surge. It's a moderate uptick to catch up to where we were.”
    


            It's not just cost – businesses are also facing a time crunch. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is set to expire on July 9, and the 90-day pause with China expires on August 12.
    


            “Ninety days of this reprieve is a short time in our business. That's typically the amount of time that it takes to put an order in, get the goods manufactured and ready to ship here to LA,” Seroka said.
    


            Still, some experts say a surge may manifest, but what it looks like is hard to predict.
    


            “There's probably not going to be an issue with empty shelves, but I think there will be additional costs being potentially passed on to consumers, because what we're seeing is all this uncertainty has a cost,” said Daniel Hackett, a partner at Hackett Associates, a maritime strategy and trade logistics company.
    


            A number of large retailers, such as Walmart, Home Depot and Target, have already said they will increase prices to mitigate the impact of tariffs.
    


            “You have supply chains, and they like predictability. They like certainty,” Hackett said. “It's just that uncertainty is adding costs, if nothing else.”

            An Alaska man who was pinned face down in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours survived the ordeal with only minor injuries, thanks in part to his wife's quick thinking and lots of luck.
    


            Kell Morris' wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after Morris was pinned by the boulder, which crashed onto him during a hike near a remote glacier south of Anchorage.
    


            His second stroke of luck came when a sled dog tourism company that operates on the glacier overheard the 911 dispatch and offered up its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible to all-terrain vehicles.
    


            Once rescuers arrived, it took seven men and inflatable air bags to lift the boulder off as he drifted in and out of consciousness.
    


Rescue of hiker missing for weeks in snowy California wilderness a ‘surreal moment'



            Morris, 61, said he realizes he is probably the luckiest man alive. “And luckier that I have such a great wife,” he said Thursday.
    


            His wife, Jo Roop, is a retired Alaska State Trooper. They moved to Seward, about 120 miles south of Anchorage, from Idaho last fall when she took a job with the local police department.
    


            Last Saturday, they wanted to avoid the big crowds that converge on the Kenai Peninsula community during holidays and decided to hike near Godwin Glacier on an isolated and undeveloped trail behind a state prison, Seward Fire Chief Clinton Crites said.
    


            Their trail was actually a rocky creek bed lined with large boulders deposited by the glacier. Morris said he noticed dangerous boulders, some weighing up to 1,000 pounds along the banks of the creek and avoided them the best he could, until he ran into an area he couldn't pass.
    


            “I was coming back and everything, the whole side, slid out from under me,” he said.
    


            He said things became a blur as he tumbled down the embankment about 20 feet (6 meters), landing face down in the water.
    


Freezing hikers stuck in waist-deep snow rescued during Mount Washington whiteout



            Then he immediately felt the boulder hit his back in what Crites described as “basically an avalanche of boulders.”
    


            The way Morris landed, there were rocks under him, in between his legs and around him that caught the weight of the boulder, preventing him from being crushed, Crites said. But the massive rock still had him pinned, and Morris felt intense pain in his left leg and waited for his femur to snap.
    


            “When it first happened, I was doubtful that there was going to be a good outcome,” Morris said.
    


            His wife tried to free him for about 30 minutes, putting rocks under the boulder and trying to roll it off him, before she left to find a cell signal.
    


            Amazingly, she only had to walk about 300 yards to connect with 911 and relied on her law enforcement experience to send exact GPS coordinates to dispatch.
    


            A volunteer at the neighboring Bear Creek Fire Department heard the call while working at the sled dog tourism operation and diverted the helicopter used to ferry tourists to the scene. Ultimately, firefighters who couldn't navigate their all-terrain vehicles over the boulder field jumped out of the helicopter.

            By this time, Morris was hypothermic from the cold water running off the glacier, Crites said, and his wife was holding his head out of the water. “I think if we hadn't had that private helicopter assist us, it would have taken us at least another 45 minutes to get to him, and I'm not sure he had that much time,” Crites said.
    


            The firefighters used two air bags normally reserved to extract people from wrecked vehicles to slightly lift the boulder. “But then it just became an all-hands brute force of ‘one, two, three, push,'” Crites said. “And seven guys were able to lift it enough to pull the victim out.”
    


            An Alaska National Guard helicopter lifted them out of the creek bed with a rescue basket. Morris spent two nights at the local hospital for observation but walked away unscathed. “I fully anticipated a body recovery, not him walking away without a scratch on him,” Crites said.
    


            Morris, who is now reflecting on his ordeal at home, acknowledged it might have been a little wake-up call to stop doing things like this at his age.
    


            “I was very lucky. God was looking out for me,” he said.
    


            When he and his wife go hiking this weekend, they are going to stick to established trails. “We're going to stop the trailblazing,” he said.

Follow:


            The flurry of punitive measures taken against China by the Trump administration over the last few days was prompted by a belief among US officials that China has failed to live up to commitments it made in trade talks earlier this month, three administration officials told CNN.
    


            This week the administration made moves to revoke visas for Chinese students and suspend the sale of some critical technology to Chinese companies.
    


            The officials said they are frustrated that China failed to follow through on the commitments that were meant to deescalate the trade conflict between the two countries, as they seek an overall deal by the middle of August.
    


            The dispute underscores the highly fraught relationship between the world's two largest economies. Even as the two sides emerged from the talks in Switzerland having agreed to reduce the withering tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, the gulf appears to be widening on supply chains that each nation believes are critical to national security.
    


            Trump took to Truth Social to blast the trade negotiations with China on Friday morning, writing the nation has “TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.” Trump said that he made a fast deal with China to “save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation.” But as Trump expressed his anger he added: “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”
    


            After the talks in Geneva this month — the first substantive meeting on trade since Trump imposed the tariffs — US officials had expected China to ease export restrictions of rare earth minerals, which are an essential part of everything from iPhones and electric vehicles to big-ticket weapons like F-35 fighter jets and missile systems.

Trump administration will ‘aggressively revoke' Chinese student visas in major escalation with Beijing



            But the restrictions haven't been lifted, causing intense displeasure inside the Trump administration and prompting the recent series of costs imposed on China, the three administration officials said.
    


            The decisions in Washington to limit critical technology sales to China and restrict the number of Chinese students studying in the US reveals just how central the trade war is to the administration's overall foreign policy towards China.
    


            It is a “unified administration strategy,” said one senior administration official in describing the connective tissue.
    


            The actions taken in the last week will have a significant impact on Chinese tech companies and students.
    


            The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Trump had effectively cut off some American companies from selling software used to design semiconductors to China. A Siemens spokesperson later told CNN that the US government on Friday informed the industry about new export controls on chip designing software to China and Chinese military end users globally.
    


            Just days later Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration will “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.
    


            “On day one, the President signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of State to enhance federal screening and vetting of aliens coming to the United States, including visa holders. The Secretary made this decision in the Administration's ongoing effort to protect our homeland from espionage and other hostile actions,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who Trump tapped to lead the talks and run point on the bilateral relationship, has highlighted the importance of the process the Geneva talks put into place for negotiations to take place in the months ahead.
    


            But he has stressed the value of the “mechanism” established between the US and Chinese sides to prevent future escalations that would derail future talks or any eventual outcome.
    


            Bessent, who led the Geneva talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, has maintained a focus on a functioning relationship and has said a second in-person meeting between the two sides is likely in the future. But Bessent has also calibrated his public comments to make clear the US has no plans to slow or stop a strategic effort to decouple from China on supply chains deemed critical to US national security.
    


            “I would say that they are a bit stalled,” Bessent said of the China talks Thursday on Fox News. “I believe that we will be having more talks with them in the next few weeks. And I believe we may, at some point, have a call between the president and party chair Xi (Jinping).”
    


            “I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,” Bessent said.
    


            Growing concern within the administration in the leadup to the talks over China's moves to cut off access to rare earth minerals sparked a wide-ranging effort behind the scenes to find potential workarounds, officials said.
    


            That effort, which included officials from several agencies and the West Wing, wasn't halted after the trade talks and remains a focus. But there was a view that the immediate pressure would ease as a result of the agreement reflected in the joint statement. When that did not happen, the US began to think about ways to impose costs on China.
    


            US officials said they were not concerned about the one-two hit derailing the future of the US-China trade talks. Instead, officials are looking to make clear that not effectively engaging in the ongoing trade talks comes with consequences for the country.

            “It is clearly an escalation. But if you look at what Trump does when he thinks he is getting close to securing a deal, and it's not there yet, he tries to elevate the rhetoric. They think that elevated rhetoric and action will move a deal faster,” said one person close to the White House.
    


There were signs that Beijing was initially caught off guard by the visa announcement. For much of Thursday, China's state-controlled media remained largely silent on the news that will significantly impact the fate of hundreds of thousands of Chinese students.
    


            Then China's foreign ministry spokesperson came out calling the move “politically motivated and discriminatory.”
    


            Any path towards steadying the relationship across the board remains uncertain.
    


            “The Geneva agreement was a major first step towards securing a final, comprehensive trade deal with China,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Discussions continue, and the Administration is monitoring compliance with the agreement.”
    


            It isn't clear when the next round of trade talks between the US and China will take place. And despite saying for weeks he would talk soon with President Xi Jinping, Trump and the Chinese leader have not yet spoken amid the trade conflict.

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 111 people were confirmed dead in central Nigeria on Friday after floods submerged the market town of Mokwa in the country's Niger State following torrential rains, officials said. 




The heavy rains lasted for several hours Thursday, and media reports quoting local government officials said a dam collapse in a nearby town had worsened the situation. The flooding displaced large amounts of people, the reports said. 

Rescuers continued to find more bodies into the afternoon Friday. Earlier reports said 88 people had died, but then at least 23 more bodies were found, Niger State emergency agency spokesman IIbrahim Audu Husseinit told The Associated Press in the afternoon. 

That brought the toll to 111, but that could go higher as the search continued.

“More bodies have just been brought and are yet to be counted, but we have at least 111 confirmed already,” Husseini told AP by telephone.

Mokwa, about 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of Abuja, is a major meeting point where traders from the south buy food from growers in the north.

In a similar occurrence last September, torrential rains and a dam collapse in Nigeria's northeastern Maiduguri caused severe flooding, leaving at least 30 people dead and displacing millions, worsening the humanitarian crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency.

Nigeria often faces seasonal floods, particularly impacting communities such as Mokwa along the banks of the Niger and Benue Rivers. Communities in the far north of the country, which experience prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change, also see excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during their brief wet season.




In videos and photos shared on social media platforms, floodwaters cover neighborhoods where homes are fully or partially submerged, with rooftops barely visible above the brown currents. Residents are also seen waist-deep in water, appearing to salvage what they can carry or rescue others.

The chairman of Mokwa local government area, Jibril Muregi, suggested that poor infrastructure worsened the impact of the flood. He appealed to the government to start “long overdue” construction of waterways in Mokwa under a climate resilience project.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's high school track-and-field state championships starting Friday are set to be the testing ground for a new participation and medaling policy for competitions that include transgender athletes.

The California Interscholastic Federation will let an additional student compete and potentially offer an extra medal in three events in which a trans athlete is competing. The athlete, high school junior AB Hernandez, is the second seed in the triple jump and will also participate in the long jump and high jump.

It may be the first effort by a high school sports governing body to expand participation when trans athletes are participating, and it reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls' participation in youth sports.

“The CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,” the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.

State law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.

President Donald Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez's high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.

The meet, which is taking place at a high school near Fresno, will open up the girls triple jump, long jump and high jump to one additional athlete each who would have qualified had Hernandez not participated. Hernandez will compete in the preliminaries Friday for a chance to advance to the finals Saturday.

Under the pilot policy, if a transgender athlete medals, their ranking would not displace a “biological female” student from medaling, the federation said.

The federation said the rule would open the field to more “biological female” athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for “biological female” athletes but not for other trans athletes.

The federation did not specify how they define “biological female” or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.

Medical experts say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females.

The two-day meet is expected to draw attention from a coalition of protesting parents and students. Critics have objected Hernandez's participation and heckled her in qualifying events earlier this month. Leaders from the conservative California Family Council joined Republican state lawmakers Thursday for a press conference blasting the policy change and saying Hernandez shouldn't be allowed to compete.

“If they have to create special exceptions and backdoor rule changes to placate frustrated athletes, that's not equality, that's a confession,” Sophia Lorey, the council's outreach director, said in a statement. “Girls' sports should be for girls, full stop.”

CIF Executive Director Ron Nocetti urged participants and bystanders to behave respectfully toward all student-athletes in a message shared in the championship program. 

A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women's sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats. Trump won Fresno County, where the meet will be held, in 2024.

Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn't worry about critics. 

“I'm still a child, you're an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,” she said.

She noted that she has lost some of her events, saying that disproved arguments that she can't be beat.

Hernandez is expected to perform well, particularly in the triple jump, in which she has a personal best of over 41 feet (12.5 meters). That is more than 3 feet (1 meter) short of a national record set in 2019. She's the fifth seed in the long jump but ranked much lower in the high jump. 

California's state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify.

More than 57,000 high schoolers participated in outdoor track and field in California during the 2023-2024 school year, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations. California had the second-largest number of high school outdoor track-and-field athletes, only behind Texas.

Of the 12 high school athletes who have set national records in the girls triple jump between 1984 and 2019, eight have been from California, according to the national sports governing body. 

Davis Whitfield, the national federation's chief operating officer, called a state championship “the pinnacle” for high school student-athletes.

“It's certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience in some cases to participate in a state championship event,” he said.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday to celebrate a details-to-come deal for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, which he says will keep the iconic American steelmaker under U.S.-control.

Though Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker's bid to buy Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, he changed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as “partial ownership” by Nippon. It's not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured. 

Trump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country's supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.

Trump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the U.S. since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect U.S. manufacturing.

U.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed “partnership” but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.

State and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government's veto power in the form of a “golden share.”

In the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes “any meaningful change” from the initial proposal.




“Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel's facilities if it owned the company outright,” the union said in a statement. “We've seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.”

The White House did not offer any new details Thursday. U.S. Steel did not respond to messages seeking information. Nippon Steel also declined to comment.

No matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.

Trump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world's largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.

Trump said Sunday he wouldn't approve the deal if U.S. Steel did not remain under U.S. control and said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.

In an interview on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the arrangement “strictly an investment, a strategic partnership where it's American-owned, American run and remains in America.”

However, Meuser said he hadn't seen the deal and added that “it's still being structured.” 

Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick came out in favor of the plan, calling it “great” for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel's employees. A bipartisan group of senators, joined by then-Senate candidate McCormick, had opposed Nippon Steel's initial proposed purchase of U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.

In recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel's new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.

Pennsylvania's other senator, Democrat John Fetterman — who lives across the street from U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Steel Works blast furnace — didn't explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel's original bid until “Nippon coughed up an extra $14B.”

The planned “golden share” for the U.S. amounts to three board members approved by the U.S. government, which will essentially ensure that U.S. Steel can only make decisions that'll be in the best interests of the United States, McCormick said Tuesday on Fox News.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had largely refrained from publicly endorsing a deal but said at a news conference this week that he was “cautiously optimistic” about the arrangement.

In an interview published Thursday in the conservative Washington Examiner, Shapiro said: “The deal has gotten better. The prospects for the future of steelmaking have gotten better.”

Chris Kelly, the mayor of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel's Irvin finishing plant is located, said he was “ecstatic” about the deal, though he acknowledged some details were unknown. He said it will save thousands of jobs for his community.

“It's like a reprieve from taking steel out of Pittsburgh,” he said.

Faizan Zaki nearly threw away his opportunity to go from runner-up to champion at the Scripps National Spelling Bee with a shocking moment of overconfidence. 

Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. He almost lost, making a mistake with the word ‘commelina,' but recovered, correctly spelled ‘eclaircissement,' and took the prize.

OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — Faizan Zaki's enthusiasm for spelling nearly got the better of him. Ultimately, his joyful approach made him the Scripps National Spelling Bee champion.

The favorite entering the bee after his runner-up finish last year — during which he never misspelled a word in a conventional spelling round, only to lose a lightning-round tiebreaker that he didn't practice for — the shaggy-haired Faizan wore the burden of expectations lightly, sauntering to the microphone in a black hoodie and spelling his words with casual glee.

Throughout Thursday night's finals, the 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, looked like a champion in waiting. Then he nearly threw it away. But even a shocking moment of overconfidence couldn't prevent him from seizing the title of best speller in the English language.

With the bee down to three spellers, Sarvadnya Kadam and Sarv Dharavane missed their words back-to-back, putting Faizan two words away from victory. The first was “commelina,” but instead of asking the requisite questions — definition, language of origin — to make sure he knew it, Faizan let his showman's instincts take over.

“K-A-M,” he said, then stopped himself. “OK, let me do this. Oh, shoot!”

“Just ring the bell,” he told head judge Mary Brooks, who obliged.

AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee champion.

“So now you know what happens,” Brooks said, and the other two spellers returned to the stage.




Later, standing next to the trophy with confetti at his feet, Faizan said: “I'm definitely going to be having nightmares about that tonight.”

Even pronouncer Jacques Bailly tried to slow Faizan down before his winning word, “eclaircissement,” but Faizan didn't ask a single question before spelling it correctly, and he pumped his fists and collapsed to the stage after saying the final letter.

The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Faizan may be the first champion who's remembered more for a word he got wrong than one he got right.

“I think he cared too much about his aura,” said Bruhat Soma, Faizan's buddy who beat him in the “spell-off” tiebreaker last year.

Faizan had a more nuanced explanation: After not preparing for the spell-off last year, he overcorrected, emphasizing speed during his study sessions.

Although Bruhat was fast last year when he needed to be, he followed the familiar playbook for champion spellers: asking thorough questions, spelling slowly and metronomically, showing little emotion. Those are among the hallmarks of well-coached spellers, and Faizan had three coaches: Scott Remer, Sam Evans and Sohum Sukhantankar.

None of them could turn Faizan into a robot on stage.

“He's crazy. He's having a good time, and he's doing what he loves, which is spelling,” Evans said.

Said Zaki Anwar, Faizan's father: “He's the GOAT. I actually believe that. He's really good, man. He's been doing it for so long, and he knows the dictionary in and out.”

After last year's bee had little drama before an abrupt move to the spell-off, Scripps tweaked the competition rules, giving judges more leeway to let the competition play out before going to the tiebreaker. The nine finalists delivered.

During one stretch, six spellers got 26 consecutive words right, and there were three perfect rounds during the finals. The last time there was a single perfect round was the infamous 2019 bee, which ended in an eight-way tie.

Sarv, an 11-year-old fifth-grader from Dunwoody, Georgia, who ultimately finished third, would have been the youngest champion since Nihar Janga in 2016. He has three years of eligibility remaining.

The most poised and mature of the final three, Sarvadnya — who's from Visalia, California — ends his career as the runner-up. He's 14 and in the eighth grade, which means he has aged out of the competition. It's not a bad way to go out, considering that Faizan became just the fifth runner-up in a century to come back and win, and the first since Sean Conley in 2001.

Including Faizan, whose parents emigrated from southern India, 30 of the past 36 champions have been Indian American, a run that began with Nupur Lala's victory in 1999, which was later featured in the documentary “Spellbound.” In honor of the centennial, dozens of past champions attended this year and signed autographs for spellers, families and bee fans.

With the winner's haul of $52,500 added to his second-place prize of $25,000, Faizan increased his bee earnings to $77,500. His big splurge with his winnings last year? A $1,500 Rubik's cube with 21 squares on each side. This time, he said he'd donate a large portion of his winnings to charity.

The bee began in 1925 when the Louisville Courier-Journal invited other newspapers to host spelling bees and send their champions to Washington. For the past 14 years, Scripps has hosted the competition at a convention center just outside the nation's capital, but the bee returns downtown next year to Constitution Hall, a nearly century-old concert venue near the White House.

Faizan has been spelling for more than half his life. He competed in the 2019 bee as a 7-year-old, getting in through a wild-card program that has since been discontinued. He qualified again in 2023 and made the semifinals before last year's second-place finish.

“One thing that differentiates him is he really has a passion for this. In his free time, when he's not studying for the bee, he's literally looking up archaic, obsolete words that have no chance of being asked,” Bruhat said. “I don't think he cares as much about the title as his passion for language and words.”

Faizan had no regrets about showing that enthusiasm, even though it nearly cost him.

“No offense to Bruhat, but I think he really took the bee a little too seriously,” Faizan said. “I decided to have fun with this bee, and I did well, and here I am.”

PARIS (AP) — If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.

The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season — although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week — and the sport's other athletes took note.

After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.

“I saw Carlos playing in it,” said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. “I'd be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.”

At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: “It is something that I'm going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.”

Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts — sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.

They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they're being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion. 




The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.

In practice, the science is less convincing.

In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn't make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.

“The effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,” Dinardi said. “But in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.”

Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them — both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit. 

But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.

“I tried out a device that's very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it's inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,” said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. “It will return, don't worry.”

For other players, like Nicolás Jarry, the strips are more than a trend — they're a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.

“Without it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,” he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. “Others don't have that issue and still use them.”

Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them — until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.

“Others have asked me, and many are trying it,” said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. “But before him? Nothing.”

There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.

“I have a horrible deviated septum. I can't really breathe out of one side of my nose,” said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. “Maybe I should start wearing one.”

She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.

“I don't know,” Pegula said with a smile, “if I have the confidence to rock one.”

BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for two attacks in southern Syria, including one on government forces that an opposition war monitor described as the first on the Syrian army to be carried out by the extremists since the fall of Bashar Assad.

IS said in a statement on Thursday that in one attack, a bomb targeting a “vehicle of the apostate regime” detonated, leaving seven soldiers dead or wounded. It said the attack occurred “last Thursday,” or May 22, in the al-Safa area in the desert of the southern province of Sweida.

In a separate statement, the group said another bomb attack occurred this week in a nearby area, targeting members of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army. It claimed that it killed one fighter and wounded three.

There was no comment from the government on the claims. A spokesperson for the Free Syrian Army didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack on government forces killed one civilian and wounded three soldiers, describing it as the first such attack to be claimed by IS against Syrian forces since the 54-year rule by the Assad family ended in December.

IS, which once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq, is opposed to the new authority in Damascus led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once the head of al-Qaida's branch in Syria and fought battles against IS.




Over the past several months, IS has claimed responsibility for attacks against the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.

IS was defeated in Syria in March 2019 when SDF fighters captured the last sliver of land that the extremists controlled. Since then, its sleeper cells have carried out deadly attacks, mainly in eastern and northeast Syria.

In January, state media reported that intelligence officials in Syria's post-Assad government thwarted a plan by IS to set off a bomb at a Shiite Muslim shrine south of Damascus.

Al-Sharaa met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, when the American leader said that Washington would work on lifting crippling economic sanctions imposed on Damascus since the days of Assad.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement after the meeting that Trump urged al-Sharaa to diplomatically recognize Israel, “tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria” and help the U.S. stop any resurgence of the Islamic State group.

Former FBI agent Rob D'Amico joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the intensifying manhunt for an ex-police officer who escaped prison after being convicted of murder.

The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the re-capture of a former Arkansas police chief serving time for murder and rape — dubbed ""the Devil in the Ozarks"" — who escaped on the afternoon of May 25.

Former Gateway Police Department Chief Grant Hardin, 56, escaped from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison, that Sunday afternoon in Calico Rock, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC).

The FBI said Hardin has ties to Garfield, Eureka Springs, Holiday Island and Huntsville. 

""The FBI's Little Rock Field Office is assisting the U.S. Marshal Service, the Arkansas Department of Corrections, and the Arkansas State Police with the search for and apprehension of Grant Matthew Hardin,"" reads an FBI wanted poster.

Former FBI agent Rob D'Amico told ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning that Hardin's past as a police chief may give him a unique advantage on the run.

""I think it makes it a lot more challenging. He knows how they do it. He knows what they look for, he knows how they follow leads. He knows how they do surveillance,"" D'Amico said.

The former FBI agent noted that there are likely many unmanned, unlocked cabins and sheds in wooded areas around Stone County, which is located East of the Ozark Mountains.

ADC Communications Director Rand Champion said during a Wednesday news conference that authorities are fairly confident in the route they believe Hardin took when he escaped prison and his current location in the region.

""Based on the information that we have and the experience of our teams, they feel fairly confident that he is still fairly close to this region,"" Champion said, noting that ""all it takes is one vehicle"" for Hardin to use to travel elsewhere, though officials have established a perimeter around the area of Stone County.

""As of this time, they are still very confident that he is in the area,"" Champion said.

Champion said the public should assume Hardin is ""a very dangerous individual,"" and there is a risk he may commit more crimes while he is on the run.

It took less than 30 minutes for prison officials to notice that Hardin had disappeared from prison. Photos that the Stone County Sheriff's Office posted to social media show Hardin wearing an ADC-style uniform during his escape through a sally port, though Champion said the uniform he was wearing was not an official uniform.

Hardin was sentenced to 30 years for murder plus additional time for rape. 

He pleaded guilty to the 2017 murder of James Appleton, 59, a city water employee who was found shot in the face inside his work truck, KNWA reported. While Hardin was being booked into the state prison around that time, officials submitted his DNA sample into a database. His DNA ended up linking him to the rape cold case of a teacher in 1997, the outlet reported. 

Hardin ended up pleading guilty in that case in 2019, according to KNWA.

The former police chief's escape came two days after 10 prisoners escaped a correctional facility in New Orleans, eight of whom have since been re-captured while two remain at large.

Hardin is described as a 6 ft. white male, weighing approximately 259 pounds. The FBI is asking tipsters to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with any information concerning the escapee.

The White House will ""fight this in a court of law"" after a judge blocked the Trump administration from ending a migrant parole program for those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision is a near-term victory for President Donald Trump as he moves to crack down on border security and immigration priorities in his second term. 

The order stays, for now, a lower court ruling that halted Trump's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for some migrants living in the U.S., which allows individuals to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other ""extraordinary and temporary conditions."" 

The stay, like many emergency orders handed down by the high court, was unsigned, and did not provide an explanation for the justice's thinking. 

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson did lay out their criticisms in a blistering dissent.

Jackson said that, in their view, the court ""plainly botched"" its assessment, and failed to properly weigh the ""devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.""

""While it is apparent that the government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize — not maximize — harm to litigating parties,"" she added.

The TPS program is typically extended to migrants in the U.S. on 18-month increments, most recently under the Biden administration towards the end of his presidency. 

But they were abruptly upended by the Trump administration in February, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attempted t o end protections for a specific group of Venezuelan nationals, arguing they were not in the national interest. 

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer asked justices earlier this month to allow the administration to proceed with its decision to revoke the status for the migrants, accusing U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of improperly intruding on the executive branch's authority over immigration policy.

""The district court's reasoning is untenable,"" Sauer told the high court, adding that the program ""implicates particularly discretionary, sensitive, and foreign-policy-laden judgments of the Executive Branch regarding immigration policy.""

The update comes after the Supreme Court also allowed the Trump administration earlier this month to revoke the protected status of 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with their plans to remove them.

No éclaircissement was needed after 13-year-old Faizan Zaki triumphed in the 21st round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The teen collapsed on the floor with excitement after correctly spelling ""éclaircissement"" and securing the national title — not to mention a trophy and $50,000. Zaki's win also coincided with a major milestone: the 100th anniversary of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

When spelling the ""M-E-N-T"" in ""éclaircissement,"" Zaki, who hails from Allen, Texas, was understandably thrilled after coming in second place at last year's competition behind Bruhat Soma, who was 12 years old when he took home the trophy.

However, his victory didn't come without drama — Zaki nearly lost in round 18 when asked to spell ""commelina."" Zaki started saying ""K-A-M"" before stopping himself and telling head judge Mary Brooks to ""just ring the bell,"" which she did. Zaki got another shot after 14-year-old Sarvadnya Kadam misspelled ""Uaupes"" in round 20 — paving the way for his win with ""éclaircissement.""

In a post on X congratulating the 13-year-old, the Scripps National Spelling Bee wrote that Zaki ""left everything on stage.""

FLORIDA TEEN WINS SCRIPPS NATIONAL SPELLING BEE

""He's the GOAT. I actually believe that. He's really good, man. He's been doing it for so long, and he knows the dictionary in and out,"" Zaki's father, Said Zaki Anwar told ESPN.

Zaki's win was notable not only for the final word and the Bee's centennial, but also because it marked the first time in nearly 25 years that a former runner-up returned to win the title. According to ESPN, the last person to do so was Sean Conley, who was the 2001 champion. Zaki and Conley are members of an extremely exclusive club with just five members total from the event's 100 years.

The final three in the 2025 competition also included 11-year-old Sarv Dharavane, who would have been the competition's youngest champion since Nihar Janga, who won in 2016.

Zaki's stumble over ""commelina"" and subsequent comeback are not the first examples of drama at the spelling bee. This children's competition has produced a surprising number of historic moments. In 2019, the spelling bee's results were arguably some of the most controversial, as the competition ended with the only eight-way tie in the Scripps National Spelling Bee's history.

‘Border czar' Tom Homan discusses a Tennessee mayor being accused of aiding and abetting illegal migrants on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

In a statement responding to the inclusion of Montgomery County Maryland on a list of sanctuary jurisdictions in the U.S., County Executive Marc Elrich accused the Trump administration of seeking to criminalize immigrants and ""create fear.""

President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for a list of sanctuary jurisdictions. DHS issued the list on Thursday, the department noted in a post on X.

""We are not in violation of federal law, and we will not be making changes based on political headlines. Montgomery County has always cooperated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cases involving violent crimes, serious felonies, and threats to public safety. That has been and remains our policy,"" Elrich said in his statement.

(Left: Win McNamee/Getty Images; Right: Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

""This designation, like many other actions taken by this administration, is about criminalizing immigrants, not protecting public safety. We will not be complicit in efforts to stigmatize or target our immigrant communities,"" the Democrat declared. ""These types of announcements are designed to create fear. But we do not govern by fear in Montgomery County. We govern by the law and by our values.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the arrest of an MS-13 member in a press release earlier this month, noting multiple instances of the Montgomery County Detention Center failing to honor immigration detainers for the individual over the years, including just last month.

""The Montgomery County Circuit Court in Rockville convicted Amaya of attempted motor vehicle theft April 4, and sentenced him to three years of confinement with two years, five months and 11 days suspended,"" the release noted of Salvadoran national Nelson Vladimir Amaya-Benitez. ""On April 18, the Montgomery County Detention Center again declined to honor ICE's immigration detainer and released Amaya from custody.""

POLK COUNTY SHERIFF GRADY JUDD NAMES OBSTACLES IN DETAINING MIGRANTS UNDER TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES

Montgomery County Department of Correction and Rehabilitation Director Ben Stevenson acknowledged the ""error.""

""This individual met the criteria we use to notify and coordinate with ICE due to a prior felony conviction and validated gang membership in the DOCR records. We failed to make this notification. We take full responsibility for this error,"" he said in a statement. ""Montgomery County has stated consistently that we cooperate with ICE in cases involving individuals convicted of violent crimes, verified gang members, drug distributors & traffickers and other felony convictions. That policy remains in place.""

Elrich said during a media briefing that ""we goofed on our part. We did not make a policy decision to let this person go.""

The Trump administration has been aiming to crackdown on illegal immigration and is seeking to remove many individuals from the country after massive numbers of people flowed across the U.S. border during President Joe Biden's administration.

Richard Percival has gathered more than 1,500 beer trays, transforming his garage into a mini-museum dedicated to the history of mostly British beer.

America's craft brewers may be facing the sobering reality of inflation and looming tariffs, but a number of them are using creative problem-solving to navigate tight economic times. 

Many of these artisans — traditionally known for their boldness and innovation — are finding ways to maintain quality and brand integrity without asking loyal customers to choke on the price.

""Pretty much everything that goes into making beer got more expensive over the past five years,"" Bart Watson, president and CEO of the Colorado-based Brewers Association, told Fox News Digital. 

MOST POPULAR BEER IN AMERICA REVEALED IN NEW STUDY

""In this competitive environment, it's hard for brewers to pass all that on to the customer because they risk losing sales. So brewers are faced with this dual challenge.""

Beer makers have seen a sharp increase in costs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""That's when the supply chain really shifted,"" David Stoneking, owner of Brotherwell Brewing in Waco, Texas, best known for its Belgian-style triple called Act of Faith, told Fox News Digital. 

""The tariffs and other related things are still an unknown. Everyone is aware of them, everyone is worried about them, but nobody has actually paid an additional price quite yet.""

Bill Butcher, owner of Port City Brewing Co. in Alexandria, Virginia, said he feels that, too.

""We have rising input costs for our ingredients, rising labor costs for our team and rents are going up. Everything is getting more expensive,"" Butcher told Fox News Digital. ""At the same time, people are being more careful with their money with all the uncertainty in the economy right now.""

One way brewers are mitigating their costs is by sourcing local ingredients.

""Our bestselling beer, Optimal Wit, is brewed with 100% Virginia-grown wheat,"" Butcher said. ""We are happy to support our local Virginia agriculture. And as we've grown, we've become the largest purchaser of food-grade, Virginia-grown wheat in the state.""

In addition to supporting local farmers, Butcher said it reduces transportation costs and also allows the company to monitor inventory and not over-order ingredients that might go unused. 

Breweries in the same areas are also consolidating their orders for ingredients, Butcher said, as well as working together to ship their beer out to market when they have shared distributors.

""We try to collaborate with our local allies in the market and work together in ways that make sense for everybody,"" Butcher said.

Some brewers are expanding into other markets, such as kombucha, seltzers and non-alcoholic options, in order to bolster sales.

""We make a non-alcoholic hoppy seltzer that we developed a couple of years ago as we saw the trend of 'Dry January' growing,"" Butcher said. ""We wanted to offer something to people if they wanted to come to the brewery but not necessarily drink beer.""

Brotherwell Brewing also has some non-alcoholic offerings and Stoneking said he's always keeping an eye open for new options there, including food.

""We don't have the resources right now to build out a kitchen,"" Stoneking said. ""But we do partner with local food trucks as often as we're able.""

Beer and communities have always been intertwined, Stoneking said.

""Breweries and community beer gardens have developed as a space that was, throughout history, the place for people to gather,"" Stoneking said.

""There's a little bit of shade and a little bit of beer — OK, let's hang out here as family or friends or community members. That has survived relatively unchanged for thousands of years.""

Compared with wine and spirits, even craft beer is on the low end of affordability.

""With beer, we can stay kind of accessible,"" Stoneking said. 

""People specifically choose craft beer at that $2 up-charge over major domestics precisely for the quality of it and for the exploration of it. They find value in it."" (iStock)

""Whether you're paying $4 for a Bud Light or $6 for a craft beer, that $2 difference isn't huge. That means we get to cast a wider net,"" he said.

Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute focusing on U.S. and China relations, told Fox News Digital that China is ""shameless"" in how it collects sensitive national security information through spies.

A former CIA station chief says China has U.S. military service members and government employees in the ""crosshairs"" of its overseas spy operations.

Jian Zhao and Li Tian, both active-duty Army soldiers, were arrested in early March after allegedly selling ""Top Secret"" information to individuals based in China, according to the Department of Justice. Zhao and Tian were both indicted by federal grand juries in Washington and Oregon.

Federal prosecutors allege Tian sold sensitive military information to former soldier Ruoyu Duan, who would allegedly receive money from individuals residing in China. Tian then allegedly received tens of thousands of dollars for selling the sensitive information.

Included in the alleged documents Tian sold was a Google Drive link containing classified documents about the Stryker combat vehicle. Tian also allegedly sent additional sensitive data on U.S. weapons systems.

Prosecutors said the incidents highlight efforts by China to use ""cut-outs,"" known as people trusted by Chinese intelligence services, to gather sensitive information that could help the Chinese government. Those ""cut-outs"" then recruit individuals with access to or knowledge of U.S. government information, which includes current and former government officials.

According to the court documents, security video showed Tian allegedly brought his personal cellphone into a classified area of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington in May 2024, printed a classified document and left with it. He would allegedly return over three hours later with the document. Prosecutors also alleged that Tian took screenshots of sensitive information on several occasions.

In a connected case at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Zhao allegedly sold classified information to an unnamed co-conspirator. According to federal prosecutors, Zhao received at least $15,000 for the documents. Zhao allegedly sold 20 military hard drives to an individual in China, some containing a ""Secret"" label.

Army paratroopers assigned to the 173rd Brigade Support Battalion, 173rd Airborne Brigade, board an Air Force C-130 Hercules in Pordenone, Italy, May 22, 2018. 

Zaho allegedly conspired to sell information related to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System as well as information related to U.S. military readiness if there was a war with China.

""While bribery and corruption have thrived under China's Communist Party, this behavior cannot be tolerated with our service members who are entrusted with sensitive military information, including national defense information,"" said FBI Director Kash Patel on the charges.

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital he thinks U.S. military service members as well as government employees are being targeted to take part in these spy operations.

Hard drives that Jian Zhao allegedly sold to an individual in China 

""I think anybody who serves in the U.S. government is in the crosshairs. And China will do it,"" Hoffman said. ""Sometimes they'll run their recruitment operations posing as someone else. So maybe somebody doesn't want to go spy for China, but they might pretend to be somebody else. Or they might contact you on social media, on LinkedIn or some other site and pose as someone not so nefarious when in fact they are.""

Hoffman said gaining intel from the U.S. military is one of the Chinese government's ""highest requirements.""

""They want to recruit U.S. military because there's a probability we might go to war with China, and not just U.S. military, but NATO members as well, and throughout Asia. So they've got a massive intelligence apparatus,"" he said.

China isn't just targeting the U.S. military. It's targeting many other aspects of American society as well, including academia.

Five former University of Michigan students were charged in October 2024 after they were allegedly caught spying on a National Guard training center for the Chinese government during a training session with the Taiwanese military.

The former University of Michigan students were confronted by a Utah National Guard sergeant major in August 2023 near a lake at Camp Grayling in Michigan.

Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute focusing on U.S. and China relations, told Fox News Digital the Chinese Communist Party ""will exercise whatever tactics they feel they need to by hook or crook to get our military secrets,"" adding China is ""shameless.""

""This is a tactic that China is exercising in the new Cold War that we're locked in with the Chinese Communist Party. And one of the things that is really striking is the low price that a lot of Americans are willing to sell their patriotism for and their allegiance for. Some of these people didn't get that much money to sell some really sensitive military secrets over to the Chinese Communist Party,"" Sobolik said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","What it was like writing jokes for George Wendt on 'Cheers'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3422226/george-wendt-cheers-jokes-norm-peterson/","Fri, 30 May 2025 03:40:00 GMT","

A joke is a very simple thing. It has only two moving parts: the setup and the punchline. And if you write jokes for a living, as I have done for 35 years, you learn that the basic rule of comedy is that if a joke isn't working, there are only two ways to fix it. You can fiddle with the setup, or you can tinker with the punchline, and that's about it.

My first job in show business — and pretty much my first job in life — was a staff writer on the long-running hit sitcom Cheers, where I learned about setups and jokes. Cheers has a joke staple we call the “Norm entrance,” which is essentially the setup/punchline structure whittled to pure simplicity.

The format of the Norm entrance is always the same, and if you are a fan of the show, you probably know it by heart: devoted barfly Norm Peterson, played indelibly by the late George Wendt, walks into the bar, shouts a cheery “Afternoon, everybody!” to the crowd, and they respond with “Norm!” shouted in unison. And then someone behind the bar offers the greeting setup, which is usually something like, What's going on, Mr. Peterson? or What are you up to, Norm? or What's the good word, Norm? Wendt would then stride across the bar to sit at his usual spot — downstage, stage left — and time his response perfectly so that he'd be seated by the time the laughs started.

He'd say something like, I'd rather talk about what's going in Mr. Peterson, gesturing for a beer and waiting for the laughs to subside before crossing the stage and making a quick upstage turn. My ideal weight if I were 11 feet tall, he would say, sitting down and waiting for the laugh. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing Milk Bone underwear, he would conclude, sigh, and take his first sip.

Norm entrances were a pain to write — something about the simplicity of the form, perhaps — and if you were working on a script, you'd do almost anything to avoid having to write one. If you were a writer out of favor, perhaps your last script came in weak, or maybe you were having trouble fitting in, you were sometimes assigned to go off and write as many Norm entrances as you could. But the secret to a successful Norm entrance was that it almost didn't matter what you wrote because Wendt could sell it with his slow, lumbering walk, beaten-down expression, and genius for timing. 

Also, people loved Norm so much that if a line of dialogue referred to beer, wives, or any other Norm-related topic, the audience would just start laughing in anticipation of his reply. They would laugh, in other words, on the setup. The punchline was already written in their minds by Wendt's indelible performance over the years. His total embodiment of Norm was so rich and complete that people naturally thought he and Norm must be nearly the same person. But Wendt was a devoted husband. He was a true family man: funny, animated, and anything but beaten down. And while it is true that Wendt liked beer and preferred to perch on a stool for most of an episode, he was different from Norm in one major respect: Norm was a lovable loser; Wendt was just lovable.

BACK FROM THE BRINK  

And here's how you can measure his immense, and sneaky, comic talent: Wendt could get a laugh on the setup. Not many people can do that.

When Wendt died on May 20, 2025, social media — and my email inbox — unleashed a flood of remembrances and testaments to his sweet and gentle nature. But there were also lots of clips of Norm entrances. Each one is a gem, mostly because of Wendt's ability to make it all look easy. So let me amend what I wrote above: there are three ways to fix a weak joke. You can adjust the setup, rewrite the punchline, or just let Wendt do it because nobody could walk into a bar like him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Supreme Court allows Trump administration to end mass parole for migrants","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3426631/supreme-court-allows-trump-administration-end-mass-parole/","Fri, 30 May 2025 14:49:12 GMT","

The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end a Biden-era mass parole program for thousands of migrants, pausing on Friday a lower court's ruling that had prevented President Donald Trump from doing so.

The high court granted a stay of U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani's April order, which had blocked the revocation of work permits and legal status for over 530,000 migrants flown into the United States under a Biden administration program.

The unsigned order from the Supreme Court said the April 14 order was paused until a final ruling on the case is made in an appeals court or the Supreme Court — if the justices decide to hear the merits of the case. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a dissent to the order, which was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson said in her dissent that her colleagues “plainly botched this assessment today” by granting the pause. She argued that the “irreparable harm” caused to the migrants challenging the Trump administration's order is significantly worse than the harm that would be caused by temporarily preventing the government from revoking their temporary status.

“It requires next to nothing from the Government with respect to irreparable harm. And it undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending,” Jackson said.

“Even if the Government is likely to win on the merits, in our legal system, success takes time and the stay standards require more than an anticipated victory,” she added. “I would have denied the Government's application because its harm-related showing is patently insufficient.”

The Trump administration petitioned the high court to block the order preventing it from ending the protected status, which former President Joe Biden afforded them during his term. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in his emergency application to the high court that not allowing the program to be ended would lead to time-consuming individual removal proceedings for each of the migrants.

“When lower courts have disregarded Congress's commands in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and usurped the Executive Branch's control over immigration policy, this Court has not hesitated to intervene,” Sauer said in the emergency application earlier this month.

The coalition of groups suing to keep the program in place has contended that the mass parole offered humanitarian relief, while the Trump administration has viewed it as a mechanism Biden used to bring in scores of migrants by executive fiat.

Talwani's April order in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully acted when it planned to revoke legal status en masse and not give each migrant individual review. She said migrants faced “two unfavorable options: continue following the law and leave the country on their own, or await removal proceedings.”

TRUMP TARIFFS APPEAR DESTINED FOR SUPREME COURT SHOWDOWN

Earlier this week, Talwani, who was appointed to the court by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to resume processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their work permits and status.

The high court's Friday order was the latest intervention in pausing lower court rulings that have blocked the Trump administration's actions on a variety of matters, including immigration and reshaping the federal government. The significant number of applications hoping to pause these orders has dominated the Supreme Court's emergency docket.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump blamed the Federalist Society for the federal court ruling striking down his tariff agenda, attributing the decision to “bad advice” the group gave him on judicial nominations.

One Trump appointee, Timothy M. Reif, sits on the three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade; Reif was appointed to the court by the president during his first term in 2019. The other two judges are Jane A. Restani, a Reagan appointee, and Gary S. Katzmann, an Obama appointee.

Trump said he was referred to the Federalist Society for judicial nominations and used them, but he also named Leonard Leo, the former vice president of the Federalist Society, branding him a “sleazebag.”

“I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real ‘sleazebag' named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions,” he posted on Truth Social. “He openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court — I hope that is not so, and don't believe it is! In any event, Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own ‘thing.'”

The Federalist Society is a conservative and libertarian legal group. The organization published an op-ed from an organization challenging the tariffs on Thursday but noted in an editor's note that the group “takes no positions on particular legal and public policy matters.”

“I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations. This is something that cannot be forgotten!” he added.

Trump also said he is “very proud of many of our picks, but very disappointed in others” and called on the Supreme Court to overturn the federal court's decision on the tariffs.

The federal court only temporarily struck down Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused the ruling at the administration's request. The Supreme Court could see an appeal from the appeals court ruling.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier called Wednesday's decision “judicial overreach.”

“The courts should have no role here,” she said. “There is a troubling and dangerous trend of unelected judges inserting themselves into the presidential decision-making process. America cannot function if President Trump, or any other president for that matter, has their sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations railroaded by activist judges.”

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT TRUMP'S TARIFF THREAT AGAINST MEXICO AND CANADA

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was “highly inappropriate” for the judiciary to weigh in when the Senate had already voted down a resolution aimed at ending the tariffs.

“It seems highly inappropriate for the judiciary to wade in here when the Senate had the opportunity to override the president and didn't,” Bessent told Fox News, adding that the president should set the country's trade agenda. “Anything the courts do to get in the way harms the American people in terms of trade and tariff revenue.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Republicans will hold the first full congressional hearing next month to investigate what they say was a coordinated effort to conceal the cognitive decline of former President Joe Biden and whether anyone else was pulling the strings behind his presidency.

Sens. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) and John Cornyn (R-TX) announced Thursday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would convene a hearing on June 18 to examine who was “running the country” during Biden's final years and the alleged “cover-up” orchestrated by his aides, family members, and the legacy media.

“For four years, when the American people saw Joe Biden, they saw someone who was clearly not capable of making major decisions for the nation,” Schmitt said in a statement. “Yet those closest to the president and the mainstream media did everything they could to hide this truth.”

Schmitt said a group of insiders “were the de facto commander in chief” while Biden, 82, was “sidelined.” Cornyn echoed that, saying the country “depends on having a president who has the mental capacity to do the job, and it's clear that President Biden did not.”

Cornyn called the alleged effort a “conspiracy between the mainstream media, Joe Biden's family, and his inner circle,” accusing them of having “lied consistently to the American people about his capacity to make decisions, which are solely vested by the Constitution.”

The lawmakers said they are still finalizing a witness list for Congress's first formal committee inquiry into Biden's health and mental fitness.

Their inquiry comes as House Republicans ramp up a parallel investigation into the Biden administration's alleged concealment of the former president's condition. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) introduced legislation Thursday to create a select committee that would explore “the potential concealment of information from the American public” about Biden's health.

The Senate hearing also adds to the political fallout from a related House investigation into the use of autopen technology by the Biden administration to sign executive orders and pardons in his final days. That investigation has also prompted broader concerns about who was making key decisions during Biden's presidency and whether he remained fully engaged.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is pursuing interviews with several high-ranking Biden staffers over their alleged roles in masking the president's decline. Those targeted include Neera Tanden, former Domestic Policy Council director; Annie Tomasini, deputy chief of staff; Anthony Bernal, longtime aide to Jill Biden; Ashley Williams, deputy director of Oval Office operations; and Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor.

All five people have made initial contact with the committee through their attorneys since receiving letters from Comer on May 22, a source familiar with the panel's work told the Washington Examiner on Thursday.

“We expect all witnesses to fully comply with the Committee's investigation. The Committee will issue subpoenas if necessary,” the source said.

Momentum behind the congressional push to uncover more about Biden's condition has grown in the wake of the new book Original Sin, authored by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson. The book alleges that the White House worked aggressively to shape the narrative on Biden's health and shield the public from the extent of his decline. It also raised new suspicions surrounding Bernal, Jill Biden's aide, and the extent to which he was influencing the president's decisions after the book made claims that he wielded “enormous” power in the former administration.

Comer teased on Wednesday that there could be additional subpoenas for the former president and his spouse in the separate House investigation. The senators made no mention of Biden's autopen in their press release on Thursday.

DEADLINE LOOMS FOR EX-BIDEN AIDES TO COMPLY WITH GOP AUTOPEN INVESTIGATION

Cornyn and Schmitt's announcement came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called for the former first lady to “speak up” about her husband's health condition ahead of his Oval Office departure.

“I think anybody looking at the videos and photo evidence of [former President] Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common sense can see this was a clear cover-up,” Leavitt said during a press briefing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration announced the departures of two top officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency at the center of the White House's mass deportation operation.

ICE announced Thursday that it was undergoing a “leadership realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.”

Ken Genalo, acting executive associate director of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, will retire from his post and step down to the role of a special government employee. ICE cited it as a way to spend more time with his family since he has been based in Washington since January.

A former senior DHS official with firsthand knowledge of Genalo's forthcoming retirement disputed why Genalo was leaving.

“I believe this announcement is trying to put a spin on the changes; Ken was told he had to go,” the official wrote in a text message. “Ken retired when they told him they no longer wanted him as the EAD and they were not allowing him to return to NYC as the [field office director.]”

Robert Hammer, the acting executive associate director of ICE's other arm, Homeland Security Investigations, has been replaced by Derek Gordon, a lower-ranking HSI official. Hammer had overseen 10,000 employees tasked with carrying out major investigations into cross-border crimes.

Genalo and Hammer did not respond to requests for comment.

The changes come as the White House continues to pressure ICE to turn up the numbers on arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants in the United States. The agency announced eight new faces in leadership as part of its new direction moving forward.

Cosmologists are fighting over everything.

Adam Riess was 27 years old when he began the work that earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics, and just 41 when he received it. Earlier this year, Riess, who is now in his early 50s, pulled a graph-paper notebook off a bookshelf in his office at Johns Hopkins University so that I could see the yellowing page on which he'd made his famous calculations. He told me how these pen scratches led to a new theory of the universe. And then he told me why he now thinks that theory might be wrong.

For nearly a century, astronomers have known that the universe is expanding, because the galaxies that we can see around us through telescopes are all rushing away. Riess studied how they moved. He very carefully measured the distance of each one from Earth, and when all the data came together, in 1998, the results surprised him. They were “shocking even,” he told his colleagues in a flustered email that he sent on the eve of his honeymoon. A striking relationship had emerged: The farther away that galaxies were, the faster they were receding. This “immediately suggested a profound conclusion,” he said in his Nobel Prize lecture. Something is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.

Riess's genius lies in making precise observations, but the task of explaining the accelerating expansion that he discovered fell to theorists. They proposed the existence of dark energy: a faint, repulsive force that pervades all of empty space. The amount of dark energy that fits inside your bedroom, say, isn't very strong. It won't blow the walls out. But when dark energy's power sums across truly cosmic volumes of space, it can drive galaxy clusters apart. And as this process puts more space between those galaxies, the repulsive force only strengthens, speeding up the expansion of the universe. Telescopes can see hundreds of billions of galaxies today, but trillions upon trillions of years from now, dark energy will have driven them all out of sight. Eventually, it will dilute every last bit of matter and energy into a cold equilibrium, a thin gruel of nothingness.

By doing the work that led to the discovery of dark energy, Riess had helped add the final piece to what has since come to be called the “standard model of cosmology.” Indeed, few people played a larger role in establishing the standard model as the field's dominant theory of how the universe began, how it organized itself into galaxies, and how it will end. But in recent years, cosmologists, the people who study the universe on the largest scales of space and time, have begun to worry that this story, and particularly its final act, might be wrong. Some talk of revolution. A growing number now say that the standard model should be replaced.

Adam Riess is among them.

Whenever a big theory of the universe is teetering, the old guard tends to close ranks; hence, the classic joke about science progressing one funeral at a time. Riess easily could have joined the old guard. He could have been its commanding officer. When he returned from Stockholm with his prize in 2011, he found that his academic life had changed. People around him started to behave oddly, he told me. Some clammed up. Others argued with him about trivial things, he said, perhaps so they could boast of having dunked on a Nobel laureate. Riess was besieged with invitations to sit on panels, give talks, and judge science fairs. He was asked to comment on political issues that he knew nothing about. He told me he was even recruited to run major scientific institutions.

Riess wondered about that path—being the big boss of a NASA mission or gliding around a leafy university as its chancellor. He could see the appeal, but he hated fundraising, and unlike other, older Nobel laureates, he said, Riess still felt that he had scientific contributions to make, not as an administrator, but as a frontline investigator of capital-n Nature. “Scientists sometimes tell themselves this myth: I'll go lead this thing, and then I'll come back and do research,” he told me. But then, by the time they've finished up with their administrative roles, they've lost touch with the data. They become clumsy with the latest software languages. “The science passes them by,” Riess said.

Riess decided to stick with research. There was plenty to do. The standard model had not solved cosmology. Even in 2011, people knew that the theory was lacking some important details. For one, 96 percent of the standard model's universe is made up of dark energy and dark matter—and yet no scientist had ever detected either one directly. Cosmologists had good reasons to believe that both exist in some form, but any intuitions about how one might find either in the actual universe had not proved out. Something major seemed to be missing from the picture.

To get a better handle on these mysteries, theorists needed some new data. They badly wanted to know the rate at which the universe expands at different times, and for that they had to know the distances to galaxies from Earth with greater precision. This was Riess's specialty: He would wait until he saw a certain kind of star explode in a far-off galaxy, and then he'd photograph its unfolding detonation in real time. He knew these supernovas always reached a certain luminosity, which meant he could figure out how far away they were by measuring their brightness in his telescope. The dimmer they were, the farther away.

I'm making this sound a lot easier than it is. Taking a snapshot of an exploding star from tens of millions of light-years away involves many subtleties. You have to subtract out light from the bright stars that surround it, in its own galaxy. The glow of the Milky Way will also sneak into your images, and so will the sun's; you have to get rid of those too. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds near the star will block some of its light, as will dust in the Milky Way. These dimming effects must be accounted for. The circuits and other parts of your telescope will add noise to your image. The hundreds of thousands of pixels in your camera aren't all the same, and their differences will need to be sussed out ahead of every observation.

Riess had never stopped trying to master these delicate additions and subtractions of light. Within the field, his measurements have long been regarded as the most precise, according to Colin Hill, a cosmologist at Columbia who does not work with Riess. But in 2011, Riess and his team developed an even better technique for measuring cosmic distances with the Hubble Space Telescope. (The idea came to him in the swimming pool, he said.)

As these new and better data piled up, a problem soon emerged. With each measured distance to another galaxy, Riess would update his calculation of the current expansion rate of the universe. To his alarm, the answers he was getting differed from those produced another way. Some cosmologists don't bother with the distances to galaxies and look, instead, at the afterglow of the Big Bang. They can then take the expansion rate that they see in that snapshot of the early universe and extrapolate it forward on the basis of assumptions from the standard model. In other words, the latter approach takes it as a given that the standard model is correct.

Riess expected that this discrepancy between the two expansion rates would fade with further observations. But it was stubborn. The more he looked at distant galaxies, the more pronounced the difference became. Indeed, the mere fact of its existence presented the cosmologists with a serious problem. They became so vexed that they had to give it a name: the Hubble tension.

Riess wondered if the observations of the early universe that fed into the other measurement's equations might be wrong. But neither he nor anyone else could find fault with them. To Riess, this suggested that the Hubble tension could be a product of a broken theory. “It smelled like something might be wrong with the standard model,” he told me.

If the standard model were to topple, the field of cosmology would be upended, and so would an important part of the grand story that we've been telling ourselves about the end of the universe. And so, naturally, with weighty matters of career, ego, and the very nature of existence at stake, the Hubble tension has led to a bit of tension among cosmologists.

Some of the field's most prominent scientists told me that they still expect the problem to disappear with more data, and that Riess may be getting ahead of himself. Wendy Freedman, a professor at the University of Chicago, has made her own measurements of the local universe, using different exploding stars, and the Hubble tension shows up in her data too. But it's smaller. She told me it's too soon to tell what the problem is: her measurements, the standard model, or something else. She would want to know the distances to many more galaxies before deciding on the culprit. She would also want to see multiple methods of measurement converging. At a minimum, hers and Riess's should match up. Hill, the cosmologist from Columbia, expressed a similar view.

David Spergel, the president of the Simons Foundation, who has for decades held a lot of sway in the field, agrees that it's premature to start dancing on the standard model's grave. “Adam speaks very loudly,” Spergel said. “He argues vociferously with whoever disagrees with him.”

Riess does indeed prosecute his case with vigor. Still, no one has been able to find an error in his measurements, and not for lack of trying. His numbers have been cross-checked with observations from both the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. Sean Carroll, a cosmologist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins who is not on Riess's team, told me that Riess has done a “heroic job” of knocking systematic errors out of his measurements. But Carroll said that it is still too early to tell if the Hubble tension will hold up, and definitely too early to throw out the standard model. “If the implications weren't so huge, people wouldn't be so skeptical,” Carroll said.

Riess grew visibly exasperated when we discussed these objections. He blamed them on the “sociology” of the field. He said that a clique of cosmologists—Spergel and “other graybeards”—who work on the early universe have tended to dismiss conflicting data. (For the record, Riess's own goatee is observably gray.) Even so, at least one of them had come around to his view, he said. Riess had sent data to George Efstathiou, a well-respected early universe cosmologist who'd been a vocal skeptic of the Hubble tension. On his desktop computer, Riess showed me Efstathiou's reply: “Very convincing!”

I didn't want to make too much of what might have been politeness, so I followed up with Efstathiou myself. In the email that he wrote to me, he was more circumspect than he had been with Riess: “I don't have much to say on the Hubble tension.” So far as he could tell, Riess's measurements didn't contain any errors, but he couldn't rule out the possibility that something in them was wrong.

Riess believes that in time he will be vindicated. He believes that the Hubble tension will likely grow more pronounced and that more cosmologists will start to question the standard model. For someone who helped stand up that theory, he comes off as gleeful about this possibility. Maybe this is just his scientific mindset: always deferential to the data. Or perhaps he simply craves the thrill of being right, again, about the fundamental nature of the universe.

When I visited Riess, back in January, he mentioned he was looking forward to a data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, a new observatory on Kitt Peak, in Arizona's portion of the Sonoran Desert. DESI has 5,000 robotically controlled optic fibers. Every 20 minutes, each of them locks onto a different galaxy in the deep sky. This process is scheduled to continue for a total of five years, until millions of galaxies have been observed, enough to map cosmic expansion across time. The observatory was preparing to release its second batch of data. Riess thought the information might produce another challenge to the standard model.

In the simplest version of the theory, the strength of dark energy—the faint, repulsive force that's everywhere in the universe, pushing it apart—is fixed for all eternity. But DESI's first release, last year, gave some preliminary hints that dark energy was stronger in the early universe, and that its power then began to fade ever so slightly. On March 19, the team followed up with the larger set of data that Riess was awaiting. It was based on three years of observations, and the signal that it gave was stronger: Dark energy appeared to lose its kick several billion years ago.

This finding is not settled science, not even close. But if it holds up, a “wholesale revision” of the standard model would be required, Hill told me. “The textbooks that I use in my class would need to be rewritten.” And not only the textbooks—the idea that our universe will end in heat death has escaped the dull, technical world of academic textbooks. It has become one of our dominant secular eschatologies, and perhaps the best-known end-times story for the cosmos. And yet it could be badly wrong. If dark energy weakens all the way to zero, the universe may, at some point, stop expanding. It could come to rest in some static configuration of galaxies. Life, especially intelligent life, could go on for a much longer time than previously expected.

Read: When a telescope is a national-security risk

If dark energy continues to fade, as the DESI results suggest is happening, it may indeed go all the way to zero, and then turn negative. Instead of repelling galaxies, a negative dark energy would bring them together into a hot, dense singularity, much like the one that existed during the Big Bang. This could perhaps be part of some larger eternal cycle of creation and re-creation. Or maybe not. The point is that the deep future of the universe is wide open.

I called Riess after the DESI results came out, to see how he was feeling. He told me that he had an advance look at them. When he'd opened the data file in his office, a smile spread across his face. He'd been delighted to see another tough result for the standard model. He compared the theory to an egg that is breaking. “It's not going to cleave neatly in one place,” he said. “You would expect to see multiple cracks opening up.”

Whether the cracks—if they really are cracks—will widen remains to be seen. Many new observations will come, not just from DESI, but also from the new Vera Rubin Observatory in the Atacama Desert, and other new telescopes in space. On data-release days for years to come, the standard model's champions and detractors will be feverishly refreshing their inboxes. For the moment, though, Riess believes that the theorists have become complacent. When he reaches out to them for help in making sense of his empirical results, their responses disappoint him. “They're like, Yeah, that's a really hard problem,” he said. “Sometimes, I feel like I am providing clues and killing time while we wait for the next Einstein to come along.”

When I talked to Riess for the last time, he was at a cosmology conference in Switzerland. He sounded something close to giddy. “When there's no big problems and everything's just kind of fitting, it's boring,” he said. Now among his colleagues, he could feel a new buzz. The daggers are out. A fight is brewing. “The field is hot again,” he told me. A new universe suddenly seems possible.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The tech bros have ascended to movie-villain status.

It's late morning on a Monday in March and I am, for reasons I will explain momentarily, in a private bowling alley deep in the bowels of a $65 million mansion in Utah. Jesse Armstrong, the showrunner of HBO's hit series Succession, approaches me, monitor headphones around his neck and a wide grin on his face. “I take it you've seen the news,” he says, flashing his phone and what appears to be his X feed in my direction. Of course I had. Everyone had: An hour earlier, my boss Jeffrey Goldberg had published a story revealing that U.S. national-security leaders had accidentally added him to a Signal group chat where they discussed their plans to conduct then-upcoming military strikes in Yemen. “Incredibly fucking depressing,” Armstrong said. “No notes.”



The moment felt a little bit like a glitch in the simulation, though it also pinpointed exactly the kind of challenge facing Armstrong. I had traveled to Park City to meet him on the set of Mountainhead, a film he wrote and directed for HBO (and which premieres this weekend). Mountainhead is an ambitious, extremely timely project about a group of tech billionaires gathering for a snowy poker weekend just as one of them releases AI-powered tools that cause a global crisis. Signalgate was the latest, most outrageous bit of news from the Trump administration that seemed to shift the boundaries of plausibility. How can Armstrong possibly satirize an era where reality feels like it's already cribbing from his scripts?



The film was billed to me as an attempt to capture the real power and bumbling hubris of a bunch of arrogant and wealthy men (played by Steve Carell, Cory Michael Smith, Jason Schwartzman, and Ramy Youssef) who try to rewire the world and find themselves in way over their heads. This was an easy premise for me to buy into, not just because of Signalgate, but also because I'd spent the better part of the winter reporting on Elon Musk's takeover of the federal government, during which time DOGE had reportedly made a 19-year-old computer programmer who goes by the online nickname “Big Balls” a senior adviser to the State Department. In order to keep the film feeling fresh in this breakneck news cycle, Armstrong pushed to complete the project on an extraordinarily short timeline: He pitched the film in December and wrote parts of the script in the back of a car while driving around with location scouts. When we met, Youssef told me that the “way it was shot naturally simulated Adderall.”

By the time I met Armstrong—affable and easygoing both on and off set—he was unfazed by fact seeming stranger than his fiction. “There's almost something reassuring about it,” he said. “It's all moving so fast and is so hard to believe that it allows me to just focus on the story I want to tell. I'm not too worried about the news beating me to the punch.” Lots of his work, including Succession and some writing on political satires, such as Veep and The Thick of It, draw loose and sometimes close inspiration from current events. The trick, Armstrong told me, is finding a “comfortable distance” from what's happening in reality.



The goal is to let audiences bring their context to his art but still have a good time and not feel as if they're doomscrolling. For instance, one of the main characters in Mountainhead is an erratic social-media mogul named Venis (played by Smith), who's also the richest man in the world. But the comparisons to our real tech moguls aren't one-to-one. “I don't think you'd think he's a Musk cipher, nor is he a Zuck, but he takes something from him and probably from Sam Altman and maybe from Sam Bankman-Fried,” Armstrong said.



Mountainhead is Armstrong's first project since Succession. That show's acclaim—19 Emmy and nine Golden Globe wins—cemented Armstrong and his team of writers as the preeminent satirists of contemporary power and wealth. His decision to focus on the tech world can feel like a cultural statement of its own. Succession managed to capture the depravity, hilarity, and emptiness of modern politics, media, and moguldom existing parallel to the perpetual real-life crises of its run from 2018 to 2023. But while Mountainhead has plenty of Succession's DNA—sharing many of the same producers and writers, and some of the crew—it's much more of a targeted strike than the 39-episode HBO show. Rather than a narrative epic of unserious failsons, the film offers a relatively straightforward portrait of buffoonish elites who believe that their runaway entrepreneurial success entitles them to rule over the lower-IQ'd masses. In some ways, Mountainhead picks up where a different HBO series, Silicon Valley, left off, exploring the limits of and poking fun at the myth of tech genius, albeit with a far darker tenor.



The tech guys weren't supposed to be the next group up in the blender, Armstrong told me. He was trying to work on a different project when he became interested in the fall of Bankman-Fried and his crypto empire. Armstrong is a voracious reader and something of a media nerd—on set, he joked that he's probably accidentally paying for dozens of niche Substacks—and quickly went down the tech rabbit hole. Reading news articles turned into skimming through biographies. Eventually, he ended up on YouTube, absorbed by the marathon interviews that tech titans did with Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman, and the gab sessions on the All-In podcast, which features prominent investors and Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks. “In the end, I just couldn't stop thinking about these people,” he told me. “I was just swimming in the culture and language of these people for long enough that I got a good voice in my head. I got some of the vocabulary, but also the confidence-slash-arrogance.”



As with Succession, vocabulary and tone are crucial to Mountainhead's pacing, humor, and authenticity. Armstrong and his producers have peppered the script with what he described as “podcast earworms.” At one point, Carell's character, Randall, the elder-statesman venture capitalist, describes Youssef's character as a “decel with crazy p(doom) and zero risk tolerance.” (Decel stands for a technological decelerationist; p(doom) is the probability of an AI apocalypse.)



“There was a lot of deciphering, a lot of looking up of phrases for all of us—taking notes and watching podcasts,” Carell told me about his rapid preparation process. When we spoke, all of the actors stressed that they didn't model their characters off individual people. But some of the portraits are nonetheless damning. Youssef's character, Jeff, the youngest billionaire of the bunch, has built a powerful AI tool capable of stemming the tide of disinformation unleashed by Venis's social network. He has misgivings about the fallout from his friend's platform, but also sees his company's stock rising because of the chaos.

From the April 2025 issue: Growing up Murdoch

“One of the first things I said to Jesse was that I saw my younger, less emotionally developed self in the level of annoyingness, arrogance, and crudeness—mixed with a soft emotional instability—in Jeff,” Youssef told me. “He reminded me of me in high school. I thought, These are the kind of guys who started coding in high school, and it's probably where their emotions stalled out in favor of that rampant ambition.” This halted adolescence was a running theme. On a Tuesday evening around 9 p.m., I stood on set watching five consecutive takes of a scene (that was later cut from the film) where Youssef jumps onto a chair while calling a honcho at the IMF, and starts vigorously humping Schwartzman's head. The mansion itself is like a character in the film. The production designer Stephen Carter told me it was chosen in part because “it feels like something that was designed to impress your friends”—an ostentatious glass-and-metal structure with a private ski lift, rock wall,  bowling alley, and a full-size basketball court.



Carter, who also did production design on Succession, said that it's important to Armstrong that his productions are set in environments that accurately capture and mimic the scale of wealth and power of its characters. “Taste is fungible,” Carter told me, “but the amount of square footage is not.” They knew they'd settled on the right property when Marcel Zyskind, the director of photography, visited. “He almost felt physically ill when he walked into the house,” Carter said. “Sort of like it was a violation of nature or something.” The costuming choices reflected the banality of the tech elites, with a few flourishes, like the bright Polaris snowmobile jumpsuits and long underwear worn in one early scene. “Jesse has them casually decide the fate of the world while wearing their long johns,” the costume designer, Susan Lyall, recounted.



True sickos like myself, who've followed the source material and news reports closely, can play the parlor game of trying to decode inspirations ripped from the headlines. Carell's character has the distinct nihilistic vibes of a Peter Thiel, but also utters pseudophilosophic phrases like “in terms of Aurelian stoicism and legal simplicity” that read like a Marc Andreessen tweetstorm of old. Schwartzman's character, Souper—the poorest of the group, whose nickname is short for soup kitchen—gives off an insecure, sycophantic vibe that reminds me of an acolyte from Musk's text messages.

But Armstrong insists he's after something more than a roast. What made tech billionaires so appealing to him as a subject matter is their obsession with scale. To him, their extraordinary ambitions and egos, and the speed with which they move through the world, makes their potential to flame out as epic as their potential to rewire our world. And his characters, while eminently unlikable, all have flashes of tragic humanity. Venis seems unable to connect with his son; Jeff is wracked with a guilty conscience; Randall is terrified of his looming mortality; and Souper just wants to be loved. “I think where clever and stupid meet is quite an interesting place for comedy,” Armstrong told me when I asked him about capturing the tone of the tech world. “And I think you can hear those two things clashing quite a lot in the discussions of really smart people. You know, the first-principles thinking, which they're so keen on, is great. But once you throw away all the guardrails, you can crash, right?”



By his own admission, Armstrong has respect for the intellects of some of the founders he's satirizing. Perhaps because he's written from their perspective, he's empathetic enough that he sees an impulse to help buried deep among the egos and the paternalism. “It's like how the politician always thinks they've got the answer,” he said.  But he contends that Silicon Valley's scions could have more influence than those lawmakers. They can move faster than Washington's sclerotic politicians. There's less oversight too. The innovators don't ask for permission. Congress needs to pass laws; the tech overlords just need to push code to screw things up. “In this world where unimaginable waves of money are involved, the forces that are brought to bear on someone trying to do the right thing are pretty much impossible for a human to resist,” he said. “You'd need a sort of world-historical figure to withstand those blandishments. And I don't think the people who are at the top are world-historical figures, at least in terms of their oral capabilities.”



For Armstrong, capturing the humanity of these men paints a more unsettling portrait than pure billionaire-trolling might. For example, these men feel superhuman, but are also struggling with their own mortality and trying to build technologies that will let them live forever in the cloud. They are hyperconfident and also deeply insecure about their precise spots on the Forbes list. They spout pop philosophy but are selling nihilism. “We're gonna show users as much shit as possible until everyone realizes nothing's that fucking serious,” Venis says at one point in the film. “Nothing means anything. And everything's funny and cool.” In Mountainhead, as the global, tech-fueled chaos begins, Randall leads the billionaires in an “intellectual salon” where the group imagine the ways they could rescue the world from the disaster they helped cause. They bandy about ideas about “couping out” the United States or trying to go “post-human” by ushering in artificial general intelligence. At one point, not long after standing over a literal map of the world from the board game Risk, one billionaire asks, “Are we the Bolsheviks of a new techno world order that starts tonight?” Another quips: “I would seriously rather fix sub-Saharan Africa than launch a Sweetgreen challenger in the current market.”



The paternalistic overconfidence of Armstrong's tech bros delivers the bulk of both the dark humor and the sobering cultural relevance in Mountainhead. Armstrong doesn't hold the viewers' hand, but asks them to lean into the performance. If they do, they'll see a portrayal that might very well give necessary context to the current moment: a group of unelected, self-proclaimed kings who view the world as a thought experiment or a seven-dimensional chess match. The problem is that the rest of us are the pawns.



“The scary thing is that usually—normally—democracy provides some guardrails for who has the power,” Armstrong said near the end of our conversation. “But things are moving too fast for that to work in this case, right?” Mountainhead will certainly scratch the itch for Succession fans. But unlike his last hit, which revolved around blundering siblings who are desperate to acquire the power that their father wields, Armstrong's latest is about people who already have power and feel ordained to wield it. It's a dark, at times absurdist, comedy—but with the context of our reality, it sometimes feels closer to documentary horror.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In court, the Trump administration is required to tell the truth.

During his testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took a swipe at Senator Chris Van Hollen, falsely accusing him of having had “a margarita” with Kilmar Abrego Garcia—one of the Maryland Democrat's constituents, who was mistakenly sent to an El Salvador megaprison more than two months ago and who remains there despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to facilitate his release.

“That guy is a human trafficker, and that guy is a gangbanger … and the evidence is going to be clear,” Rubio said of Abrego Garcia, repeating claims that have never been proved in court.

“He can't make unsubstantiated comments like that!” Van Hollen shouted over the pounding gavel of the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. “Secretary Rubio should take that testimony to the federal court of the United States, because he hasn't done it under oath.”

Van Hollen's frustration centered on the frequent gap between what the Trump administration says about its mass-deportation campaign in court, where it is required to tell the truth, and what officials say in public as they attempt to blunt criticism of their immigration crackdown. By playing up the alleged criminality of deportees at every opportunity, they deflect attention from the more mundane issue of whether the government is following the law.

Read: A loophole that would swallow the Constitution

When the administration's attorneys appear before the court, and top officials are required to provide sworn testimony, the administration is more restrained and tethered to facts. Department of Justice attorneys insist that the administration is following judicial orders in good faith. They recognize errors made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even if they attempt to diminish their significance. And they provide data and logistical details about ICE deportations that they do not otherwise release voluntarily.

Outside of court, President Donald Trump and his top aides depict deportees as terrorists and gang leaders regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime. They admit no mistakes. And if judges rule unfavorably, they denounce them as “communists” and “lunatics” and suggest that they won't respect their rulings.

Trump and his top officials have dispensed with the usual conventions regarding public comment on pending cases. This has been a theme of Trump's litigation approach for years—from the Manhattan hush-money trial to the January 6 investigations—and the top officials running his current administration have taken his cue. The political fight matters more than the legal one, one senior official told me.

“Instead of using the old playbook of saying ‘no comment' because there's pending litigation, you have top officials that are using the avenues they have to fight back and speak directly to the American people about what this administration is trying to do,” said the official, who agreed to discuss the approach candidly on the condition that I would not publish their name.

The official said the strategy is designed to challenge judges who are “thwarting the duly elected president from implementing his policies.” Although issuing public statements about ongoing litigation “is unusual,” the person said, “that's exactly what everyone who is a supporter of the president is looking for from his senior team.”

The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended that strategy. “We are confident in the legality of our actions and do not apologize for acting to protect the American people,” she told me in a statement.

But the approach has at times left Department of Justice lawyers stuck between what Trump officials say publicly and their professional and legal obligations to make truthful statements in court. When a senior ICE official said in sworn testimony in March that Abrego Garcia had been deported to El Salvador because of an “administrative error,” the Justice Department attorney who initially represented the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, relayed that characterization to the court. When asked why the administration hadn't taken steps to correct the error and bring Abrego Garcia back, Reuveni said his client—the Trump administration—hadn't provided him with answers.

The top Trump aide Stephen Miller soon began insisting publicly that Abrego Garcia's deportation was not, in fact, an error—the opposite of what the government admitted in court. Vice President J. D. Vance claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here,” even though he has no criminal convictions in the United States or El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi cast the error as missing “an extra step in paperwork” and said that Abrego Garcia should not be returned.

Reuveni was fired. Bondi said he had failed to “zealously advocate” for the government. “Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” she told reporters.

Trump and his top aides have made statements outside court that have undermined the legal positions staked out by government attorneys—at times with more candor than his lawyers. The president acknowledged during an interview last month with ABC News, for instance, that he could bring Abrego Garcia back by placing a phone call to the Salvadoran president.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, told me Trump and his top aides “really are saying whatever they want to say in public, and then after the fact, trying to figure out what that means for their litigation, instead of the other way around, which is where they figure out what they want to do in their litigation and then they mold their public statements to that.”

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who presides over the Abrego Garcia case, said during a recent hearing that Trump's claim was clearly at odds with his attorneys' contention that they could not compel a foreign government to release Abrego Garcia. Xinis also noted social-media statements by Department of Homeland Security officials saying Abrego Garcia will never be allowed to return to the United States. The judge said it sounded like an “admission of your client that your client will not take steps to facilitate the return.”

Jonathan Guynn, the government's attorney, said Trump's statement needed to be read with “the appropriate nuance” and it was not “inconsistent with our good-faith compliance.”

“What world are we living in?” Xinis said in frustration as Guynn ducked her questions. “What sort of legal world are we living in?”

Similarly, Trump officials have depicted Venezuelans sent to the prison in El Salvador as invaders and terrorists to justify the administration's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. But the majority have no criminal convictions in the United States, and at least 50 of the roughly 240 sent to El Salvador entered the United States legally and did not violate U.S. immigration law, according to a new analysis by the Cato Institute.

When U.S. District Chief Judge James E. Boasberg asked about a statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem—who said the megaprison in El Salvador was one of the tools it planned to use to scare migrants into leaving the United States—he questioned whether it was an admission that the U.S. government has control over the fate of the deportees it sends there. Another Justice Department attorney similarly argued that the statement lacked sufficient “nuance.”

“Is that another way of saying these statements just aren't true?” Boasberg said. When Boasberg asked if Trump was telling the truth when he said he could get Abrego Garcia released with a phone call, the administration's attorney, Abhishek Kambli, said the president's statement should not be treated as a fact, but as an expression of “the president's belief about the influence that he has.”

Jeff Joseph, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told me that Trump attorneys are twisting themselves into rhetorical knots because the administration officials conducting the deportation campaign are doing whatever they want, and coming up with a legal rationale later.

The government attorneys have “to sort of post hoc rationalize what they're doing,” Joseph said, “but they're running afoul of the fact that it's actually against the law, and they just can't explain it.”

“They can't just come in and admit that they broke the law,” he added, “so they have to come up with some sort of paltering way of addressing it.”

The Abrego Garcia ruling and the Alien Enemies Act litigation have left legal scholars warning of a constitutional crisis. But a more tangible effect, attorneys told me, has been the erosion of the “presumption of regularity”—the benefit of the doubt given to the government in court proceedings. It's based on the idea that federal officers and attorneys are operating in good faith, and not trying to achieve political goals through acts of subterfuge.

As judges see the administration saying one thing in public and another in court, they have started to treat the government's claims with more skepticism and, sometimes, with outright suspicion of criminal contempt. A recent Bloomberg analysis found that the Trump administration has been losing the majority of its immigration-related motions and claims, regardless of whether the judges overseeing their cases were appointed by Democrats or Republicans.

Adam Serwer: ‘A path of perfect lawlessness'

The White House is focused on political wins, and it has pushed back even harder at judicial oversight as the losses pile up. In a case challenging its attempts to send deportees to third countries if their own nations won't take them back, U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy ruled in March that the government had to give deportees time to challenge the government's attempts to send them to potentially dangerous places. Despite the order, Trump officials tried last week to deport a group of men from Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, and other nations to South Sudan.

Murphy ruled that the flight violated his previous order mandating due process—but the Department of Homeland Security still convened a press conference to recite the criminal records of the deportees, calling them “uniquely barbaric monsters.” The White House made an emergency appeal of Murphy's ruling directly to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, bypassing the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

Adam Cox, a constitutional law professor at NYU, told me that the Trump administration's approach marks “a sweeping transformation of past practices.” But he said it has also affirmed the importance of the lower courts to function as a powerful fact-finding body at a time when other oversight mechanisms are weakened or under attack. The courts' ability to compel sworn testimony is crucial to helping the public sort through political rhetoric to understand what's actually true.

“A lot of the focus of public debate around courts and politics has been (understandably) focused on the Supreme Court and big legal rulings,” Cox wrote to me. “But recent months have brought a nice reminder of just how important the well-developed fact-finding mechanisms of federal trial courts can be.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In her too-short career, the painter Christina Ramberg studied the many contortions that being a woman can demand.

Observing a woman get ready to go out is, for many girls, an early glimpse at the ritualistic preparations that femininity can entail. For the artist Christina Ramberg, watching her mother getting dressed for parties—in particular, putting on a corset called a merry widow, which gave her an hourglass figure—revealed the extent to which the female form was a ruse. “I can remember being stunned by how it transformed her body, how it pushed up her breasts and slendered down her waist,” Ramberg later observed. “I used to think that this is what men want women to look like; she's transforming herself into the kind of body men want. I thought it was fascinating,” she said. “In some ways, I thought it was awful.”

These dueling reactions, fascination and repulsion, come up in Ramberg's paintings, which, especially early in her career, fixated on the artifice of the female body—all the different ways that women construct themselves, with the aid of the mass market. Her striking portraits of women's body parts feature torsos strapped into corsets, feet shoved into high heels, intricately arranged updos. The images are crisp, flat, and slyly cropped or angled to never show faces. And although they're sensual, they're also depersonalized and often off-kilter; sometimes, hair is parted in unnatural directions, or skin is patchy. The dueling presence of unruly and taming forces in these paintings recalls the consumer products that divide women's bodies into conquerable parts: the sprays that restrain, the undergarments that shape. As the artist Riva Lehrer puts it in one of several essays accompanying a traveling exhibit of Ramberg's work, currently at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, “Without the face, the body must tell all.”

What it tells, in these paintings, is by turns sobering and playful—and never sanctimonious. Ramberg's explorations began to take shape in the late '60s, when she was a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago painting on small, cheap Masonite panels. She became affiliated with the Chicago Imagists, a loose grouping of figurative artists whose work tended toward the colorful, grotesque, and surreal (though, at times since its initial use, the label has seemed to result in a downplaying of the stylistic differences among its members). One of Ramberg's teachers at SAIC and a mentor to the Imagists, Raymond Yoshida, was a deep pedagogical influence. He was an avid visitor of flea markets and instilled in students like Ramberg a love—and practice—of collecting items. Collecting, Yoshida said, was a way of establishing a pattern of “looking,” and Ramberg over time amassed hundreds of dolls that she displayed in her apartment. Her paintings of fragmented bodies are their own kind of collection—and their own pattern of “looking.”

Ramberg wasn't unique in probing the commodification of female sexuality, though a particular blend of compositional rigor, sly humor, and curiosity gave an engrossing velocity to her paintings across the 1970s and '80s. The period in which she developed as an artist was charged with contradictions, one that saw second-wave feminism cresting amid a cultural tug-of-war over sexual liberation. Gloria Steinem had by that point published her exposé about working undercover as a bunny at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club; Playboy magazine, then headquartered in Chicago, hit the peak of its circulation in the early '70s. (Perhaps ironically, Ramberg's work occasionally appeared in the publication.) Cindy Sherman would, in the early '80s, make her famed photographic series in which she posed as centerfold models, drawing attention to the mechanics of male attention.

Similar cultural shorthands are at play in Ramberg's paintings. Her early work pulls from the brisk visuals of advertisements, the seriality of comic panels, the close crops of voyeuristic photography: These familiar elements initially draw viewers in, and might even seem to point toward a more standard indictment of the male gaze, or of consumerism, but Ramberg threw changeups that turned her paintings darker and more intriguingly complex.

One series, for instance, shows thick tranches of hair cinched into the shape of corsets, or possibly vases; the plaited tresses are sharp tricks on the viewer's eye, a menacing yet sensual play on the controlling perfection that shapewear (or, perhaps, home decor) helps to enforce. The interplay between skin and fabric in some of her images also seems mischievous. Ramberg had an enduring interest in fashion—at 6 foot 1, she often made her own clothes—and rendered fabrics carefully. She might give a bustier a fine, pebbly texture, redirecting the viewer's attention away from bare skin, while also perhaps nodding to how idiosyncratic personal taste can be when it comes to the materials we wear. In one image from 1971, a white fabric wound around a hand turns into a partial glove, snugly encasing just three fingers, leaving the other two free; with delicate humor, it hints at the thin line between what we wear and what we are.

In her journals, Ramberg once described an idea she had for a painting, in which the ruffles of an item of worn clothing would actually be painted as flesh. The implication of clothing as a type of skin is creepy but clarifies Ramberg's intent: She seemed to be exploring the artificiality baked into how we show ourselves to others. In Ramberg's wildest imaginations, clothing is no longer simply a mechanism that pushes up breasts or slims down a waistline; it becomes an authentic, even crucial, layer of self-presentation—as important to our sense of self as flesh itself.

The surreality of this idea expands the perimeter of our emotional response. With that hypothetical conflating of skin as fabric, or fabric as skin—the blurring of our core selves and the “layers” we put on for the world—Ramberg seemed to question whether most everything about ourselves might be constructed, and whether we are, in fact, what we construct. In all this, she was quite interested in hidden or subconscious desires. Her diaries, which she kept from 1969 to 1980, include sexual fantasies, and she describes dreams of bondage and illicit trysts. To Ramberg, like the complicated memory of her mother lacing herself into a corset, fantasies are ultimately generative—both productive and unpredictable.

Even in grief, Ramberg seemed to find solace in the affordances of fantasy. In 1973, when she was 27, Ramberg lost a baby that she delivered prematurely. Some of her female forms in this period shifted away from overt playfulness, while maintaining an openness to multiple readings—one 1974 painting titled Gloved shows an austere torso, this time wrapped in gauze that could be interpreted as either medical dressing or bondage wear. The ambiguity Ramberg painted into the fabric asks us to leave room for either possibility.

As Ramberg's work changed over the years, the focus of her gaze shifted, too. Some of her later paintings turn women's bodies into mechanistic objects—almost gridlike, compartmentalized structures. In one, a smaller body drops out of the bigger one, as from a factory assembly line. This seeming anxiety about women's bodies as sites of productivity reminded me of Ramberg's diary entries recounting her life. She described her days as a mother (in 1975, she had a child with her husband, the artist Phil Hanson), the aforementioned dreams and fantasies, the work she did in the studio. She documented everything in one place, sometimes using different-colored ink to differentiate between aspects of her day; but she didn't cordon one part of her life off from another. The entangled accounts suggest that she saw everything she did—the chaotic overwhelm of it all—as her work.

The diaries also show a preoccupation with the constraints, and influence, of the domestic realm, the way that the details of the world around you can affect what you make, what you think about, what you see. To me, this is another example of Ramberg's mode of “looking.” Her interest in fabric—as functional material, spiritual armor, generative art—seems distinctly connected to her interest in working with constraint, rather than trying to bust completely free. This philosophical inclination is apparent even in her later works, when she turned away from the female body: A sequence of quilted works celebrated the structure of geometric patterns, while a series known as her “satellite” paintings—a stark set of towers that nonetheless look vaguely torso-like—might be read as a stripped-down meditation on form and order.

Ramberg died in 1995 of Pick's disease, which had led to early-onset dementia; she was only 49. By all accounts, she was someone who saw art as a practice, a form of cultural critique, a crucial community; her role as a longtime teacher at SAIC, she later said, kept her connected to “just beginning and deeply committed artists” and helped her balance “immersion in my own work.” Perhaps that sense of proportionality explains why her paintings, and the ideas she probed again and again through them, have maintained their acuity. With focused precision but no piety, she explored what happens when “the individuality of the person is lost to the demands of femininity,” as Lehrer puts it, all the while maintaining curiosity about the powerful psychologies that helped build those expectations. And in examining the entanglements between women and the world they are a part of, Ramberg seemed to understand, ultimately, that a little bit of strangeness can bring precarity to the viewer's experience, and then expand it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A court's decision affirmed a fundamental American principle: The president is no king, and he does not have the power to impose taxes in the form of tariffs whenever he feels like it.

Wednesday's unanimous ruling against President Donald Trump's expansive “Liberation Day” tariffs by the United States Court of International Trade wasn't merely a victory for the businesses and consumers opposed to the policy. The decision was much more than that: a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers—and, even more broadly, for the rule of law in America.

The decision came in a case filed by the Liberty Justice Center and me on behalf of five American businesses harmed by the tariffs, and it also covers a similar case filed by 12 states led by Oregon. Our suit challenged Trump's attempted use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose 10 percent Liberation Day tariffs on imports from almost every nation in the world, plus additional “reciprocal” tariffs on many more countries. We argue that the IEEPA doesn't grant Trump the virtually unlimited tariff authority he claims, and that, if it did, it would be unconstitutional. Earlier, the president also used IEEPA to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, plus additional tariffs on China, under the pretext that they would somehow curtail importation of fentanyl into the United States. (Our case challenged only the Liberation Day tariffs, while the Oregon case also targeted the fentanyl ones.) In combination, the IEEPA tariffs kicked off the biggest trade war since the Great Depression. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump's IEEPA tariffs would have imposed some $1.4 trillion to $2.2 trillion in tax increases on Americans over the next decade. They also would have severely slowed economic growth, inflicted grave harm on many businesses—including our clients, who depend on imports—and raised prices on consumers.

Fortunately, the court ruled that Trump does not have the “unbounded authority” he claims “to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country.” The British overthrew King Charles I in part because he tried to impose “ship money” taxes without legislative authorization. The president of the United States is no king, and he does not have the power to impose taxes in the form of tariffs whenever he feels like it. The court's decision upholds this fundamental principle of the Anglo-American constitutional tradition.

The IEEPA doesn't even mention tariffs as one of the emergency powers it grants the president. No previous president ever used it to impose them. In addition, the law can be invoked only to address a “national emergency” that amounts to an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to America's economy or national security. The administration claimed that the president has unlimited discretion to decide what qualifies as an “emergency” and an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” Thus, the Liberation Day tariffs were supposedly justified by the existence of trade deficits with various countries, even though such deficits have persisted for decades; there is nothing “unusual” about them; and, as most economists recognize, they are not a threat at all. As Judge Jane A. Restani put it during oral argument, the administration's approach would allow the president to impose sweeping tariffs for virtually any “crazy” reason, such as a peanut-butter shortage.

Conor Friedersdorf: Striking down Trump's tariffs isn't a judicial coup

The court ruled that the “IEEPA requires more than just the fact of a presidential finding or declaration,” because “it does not grant IEEPA authority to the President simply when he ‘finds' or ‘determines' that an unusual and extraordinary threat exists.” Otherwise, he would have virtually unlimited tariff authority, which the Congress that enacted the IEEPA carefully sought to prevent.

The court also emphasized that “the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive powers to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” For that reason, “any interpretation of IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional.” It would “constitute an improper abdication of legislative power to another branch of government.” The Supreme Court has been relatively lax in enforcing what is called the “nondelegation doctrine,” which limits the extent to which congressional authority can be delegated to the executive. But both conservative and liberal justices have held that there must be at least some limits to delegation. And if anything qualifies as excessive delegation, it would be a transfer of unlimited power to impose tariffs amounting to trillions of dollars in tax increases.

The court ruling also cites the “major-questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to “speak clearly” when authorizing the executive to make “decisions of vast economic and political significance.” According to the major-questions doctrine, if the law isn't clear, courts must reject the executive's assertions of power. If Trump's sweeping use of the IEEPA is not a major question, nothing is. The magnitude of the IEEPA tariffs exceeds that of any of the measures ruled to be “major questions” by the Supreme Court. Not even President Joe Biden's $400 billion student-loan-forgiveness plan (which the Court in my view rightly invalidated under the doctrine) compares. And, as the Court of International Trade decision explains, it is anything but clear that the IEEPA grants Trump the immense authority he claims; indeed, it clearly does not.

The nondelegation and major-questions doctrines are related, but distinct. The former categorically bans excessive delegations of legislative power to the executive because they undermine the constitutional separation of powers, while the latter merely requires that broad delegations be clearly indicated by Congress. In combination, they aim to constrain executive power grabs, such as that attempted here by Trump.

In addition to vindicating constitutional principles, the decision is a win for the rule of law. Major legal rules should be clearly stated, and not instantly changeable at one person's whim. That is what differentiates the rule of law from the “rule of men.” Trump's claim to unlimited tariff authority and his repeated gyrations in imposing and lifting tariffs are a blatant affront to this principle. After imposing the Liberation Day tariffs, he soon suspended them for certain electronic goods, struck an ad hoc temporary deal to suspend some tariffs on China, and then proceeded to threaten new tariffs on such products as foreign-produced movies and Apple iPhones. Such one-man rule wreaks havoc on the rule of law—to say nothing of the stable legal environment that investors and businesses need to make plans.

The court's ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, thus granting relief to all Americans, not just our clients. Still, the litigation is not over. The administration appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, asking it to stay the injunction in the meantime. Yesterday, that court granted a brief “administrative stay” that delays the ruling for a few days as the parties litigate the issue of whether a longer stay should be granted. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

A second decision against Trump's IEEPA tariffs was issued yesterday by Judge Rudolph Contreras of the federal District Court for the District of Columbia. Unlike the Court of International Trade ruling, it applies only to tariffs imposed against the two toy manufacturers that brought the case. But notably, Contreras concluded that the IEEPA doesn't grant the president the power to impose tariffs at all, thereby going further than the Wednesday decision did. If the law did grant the sweeping authority claimed by Trump, Contreras—like the Court of International Trade panel—noted, that would be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and “render IEEPA unconstitutional.” While the impact of the district-court ruling is very limited, it further bolsters the case against Trump's tariffs.

The legal fight over the IEEPA tariffs will continue. But these decisions make me guardedly optimistic. The Court of International Trade ruling was joined by judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including one (Timothy M. Reif) appointed by Trump. Judge Restani was appointed by Ronald Reagan, and the third judge who joined the decision, Gary S. Katzmann, was appointed by Barack Obama. This shows that the legal case against these sorts of sweeping, unilaterally imposed tariffs cuts across liberal-conservative lines. The nondelegation and major-questions doctrines on which our case—and this decision—are largely based have been championed by conservative Supreme Court justices. Americans across the political spectrum have an interest in preventing the president from wielding monarchical powers, undermining the Constitution, and starting ruinous trade wars. It's good to see that courts seem to agree.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

An unlikely alliance is supporting a new bipartisan bill in Congress.

by  Rachel Cohen

As politicians grapple with declining birth rates, the financial burden of giving birth in America — where privately insured families face out-of-pocket costs of nearly $3,000 on average — has captured widespread attention. Last month, when news broke that the Trump administration was considering $5,000 baby bonuses for new parents, comedian Taylor Tomlinson captured the national frustration: “That's like spritzing a volcano with a water gun.” A recent viral TikTok showing one mother's $44,000 hospital bill shocked viewers worldwide, underscoring the uniquely brutal pressures facing American families.

Now, a rare bipartisan solution could directly address at least the problem of expensive childbirth. The Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, introduced in the Senate last week, would require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses — from prenatal care and ultrasounds to delivery, postpartum care, and mental health treatment — without any co-pays or deductibles. (Medicaid, which insures roughly 41 percent of American births, already covers these costs.)

The bill was introduced by Republican Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith (MS) and Josh Hawley (MO), and Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine (VA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY). A companion bipartisan version is expected in the House soon, with Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (ME) among the forthcoming cosponsors.

Perhaps most striking are the bill's endorsees: organizations that typically find themselves on opposite sides of reproductive health debates. Supporters include the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, alongside prominent anti-abortion groups, including Americans United for Life, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Students for Life, and Live Action.

While the White House has not yet weighed in, Vice President JD Vance championed the idea during his Senate tenure. He publicly called the free childbirth proposal “interesting” in January 2023, and his office had been preparing bipartisan legislation on the issue last year before being tapped to join the Trump campaign. Notably, Vance's former Senate staffer Robert Orr, who led the childbirth bill initiative, now works for Hawley.

Some abortion rights advocacy groups, too, have expressed approval. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director at Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, told me her organization “proudly supports” the bill. Dorianne Mason, the director of health equity at the National Women's Law Center, said they are “encouraged” to see the bipartisan effort. A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Action Fund said the group is still reviewing the bill but “generally supports legislation to make the cost of maternal health care and parenting more affordable.” Reproductive Freedom for All declined to comment.

While questions remain about whether eliminating childbirth costs would actually boost birth rates or reduce abortions — as various supporters hope — there's little doubt it would provide crucial relief to families who have already chosen to have children. The unlikely alliance behind the bill traces back to an unexpected source: a journalist's challenge to the anti-abortion movement.

The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover essential health benefits, like birth control and cancer screenings, at no cost to patients. This new bill would expand the list of essential health benefits to include prenatal, birth, and postpartum care, and require these services also to be free. 

The costs would be paid by insurance companies and modest increases in premiums for the 178 million people primarily covered by private plans. On average, premiums would go up by approximately $30 annually, according to an analysis from the Niskanen Center think tank.

Lawson Mansell, the Niskanen policy analyst who ran the cost modeling, told me he thinks this proposal is the simplest way, on an administrative level, to make birth free. The trade-off, though, is instability: Employer-sponsored coverage can disappear just when families need it most, since people often lose their jobs during pregnancy.

The bill to cover childbirth costs under private health insurance has an unusual origin story compared to most pieces of legislation in Washington, DC, and reflects evolving factions within the anti-abortion movement.

In early July 2022, shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Elizabeth Bruenig, a staff writer at The Atlantic, published a piece urging the anti-abortion movement to take up the cause of making birth free. 

“It's time the pro-life movement chose life,” Bruenig, who identifies as pro-life but opposes criminal bans on abortion, wrote. She recommended expanding Medicare to cover the costs, just as Medicare was expanded to cover dialysis and kidney transplants in the early 1970s. Her article cited examples of staggering medical bills, such as one couple charged $10,000 for delivering in Texas and another $24,000 in Indiana. 

The piece made waves within an anti-abortion movement that was grasping for its next move after the Supreme Court struck down Roe. 

“She was really challenging the pro-lifers on this issue, and we found the idea super interesting,” said Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats for Life of America.

Catherine Glenn Foster, then the president and CEO of Americans United for Life, responded a week after publication, praising Bruenig's piece and adding, “Making birth free should be table stakes as a political matter. I'll work to advance this.”

Democrats for Life and Americans United for Life teamed up, and in January 2023 the two organizations released a white paper, fleshing out the “Make Birth Free” policy in more detail. The authors thanked Bruenig in the acknowledgements for pushing them to take on the idea, and it was this white paper that caught Vance's eye in the Senate. 

John Mize, who succeeded Glenn Foster as CEO of Americans United for Life in January 2024, said the Bruenig article arrived at exactly the right moment. He acknowledges his movement “missed the mark” by being so singularly focused on banning abortion for so many years. “I think there's been a little bit of paradigm shift in some of the movement — not by all, by any means — but certainly by some parts” to better support women and families. He pointed to the Blueprint for Life coalition, which launched in June 2024 to promote more holistic family policies, and he noted that some anti-abortion groups are newly advocating for policies like expanding the Child Tax Credit and paid family leave. 

Still, many leading anti-abortion advocates and lawmakers have been leading the push to cut federal spending on programs like child care, food assistance, and maternal health care. The Heritage Foundation called the original proposal to make childbirth costs free an “unjust wealth transfer” and others protested the risk of more “socialism” in health care as too great.

When Bruenig's piece was originally published, she faced fierce pushback from the left. Critics felt the article was insensitive, implicitly endorsing the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe, and offering “fanfic” for a right-wing movement historically opposed to a robust welfare state. Political science professor Scott Lemieux called the piece “cringe” and “embarrassing” and “deluded.” Others said she was pitching “forced birth but make it free.” The left-wing backlash ultimately prompted Bruenig to quit Twitter.

Bruenig says she never expected much uptake on the idea, but is encouraged by recent changes. “For the last 10 years or more I have contended that the best way to deal with abortion is on the demand side, by creating a welfare system that gives people an honest choice,” she told me. “There's been, for better or worse, a shift in the way Republicans are thinking about these kinds of things...and in the center, and I'm very impressed to see some uptake on the idea.”

She says she's not surprised there was criticism, but was writing for “people who are persuadable when it comes to what the pro-life movement should be about.” She added that she embraces the “pro-life” label despite opposing abortion bans because “I don't think the pro-ban people should get to decide what counts as pro-life policy or philosophy.”

Bill supporters are cautiously hopeful about the road ahead for the legislation.

The timing reflects converging forces that have created an unusual window for bipartisan family policy. President Donald Trump's election, combined with growing concerns about declining birth rates, has coincided with a shift among some conservatives toward more proactive family policies. Meanwhile, Democrats see an opportunity to advance maternal health goals.

The legislation also benefits from political cover on both sides. Republicans can champion it as pro-family policy that potentially reduces abortions, while Democrats can support it as expanding health care access. Crucially, because it doesn't require new government spending but instead redistributes costs through the existing private insurance system, it sidesteps typical fights over federal budget increases.

But challenges remain. The upcoming reconciliation process will test whether Republicans prioritize fiscal restraint or family policy when forced to choose. And while Vance previously supported the free birth idea, the administration faces pressure from fiscal conservatives who view any insurance mandates as market interference.

Not all conservatives will be thrilled at the idea of tinkering with the Affordable Care Act or facing accusations of supporting socialized medicine. Bill supporters hope the momentum for pronatalist policies might help to combat those kinds of criticisms, though other conservatives have pointed to falling birth rates in places with single-payer health care, too.

Still, the legislation has attracted support from heavyweight conservative intellectuals. Yuval Levin, the director of social, cultural, and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote a policy brief earlier this year urging Congress to embrace making childbirth free, even if it doesn't affect birth rates. “Substantively and symbolically, bringing the out-of-pocket health care costs of childbirth to zero is an ambitious but achievable starting point for the next generation of pro-family policies,” he wrote.

Patrick Brown, a family policy analyst at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, tells me he thinks it's “the right instinct” to share the costs of parenting more broadly across society, though he hopes it does not “distract from more broad-based efforts to help parents” such as a larger Child Tax Credit. 

Mize, of Americans United for Life, has been in “the planning phases” of working with the White House on family policy. He thinks once the reconciliation bill is done, Republicans and Democrats could either retreat to their camps ahead of the midterms or decide to work together on achievable wins. “You could see level-headed people say, ‘Hey, this is one opportunity for us to put a feather in our cap and say that we're working on a bipartisan basis with our constituents,'” he said.

A Senate staffer working on the bill, who requested anonymity to more candidly discuss their plans, said their intention is to move the bill through normal order and attach it to a must-pass legislative package. Both Hawley and Kaine sit on the Senate HELP committee, which holds jurisdiction over the bill.

Golden, who is working on preparing the House version, said they're hoping to introduce their bill within the next week or two.

“While some debates over what [family policy] should look like can be complicated or contentious, this idea is simple and powerful: Pregnancy and childbirth are normal parts of family life,” he told Vox. “So, insurance companies should treat it like the routine care it is and cover the cost, not stick people with huge medical bills. That's the kind of simple, commonsense reform that anyone can get behind. ”

Less has changed than you might think in the US-Ukraine relationship.

by  Joshua Keating

President Donald Trump's seemingly infinite patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin may, in fact, have limits. 

“Something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform this week, citing the massive recent airstrikes on Ukrainian cities and Putin's desire to conquer “ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it.” 

Trump also took a vague shot at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (“everything out of his mouth causes problems”), and one could point out that Russia has been striking civilian targets in Ukraine and expressing a desire to snuff out Ukraine's political independence since the very beginning of the war. 

Trump followed up by telling reporters he is considering imposing new sanctions on Russia and posted, “if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia,” but told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he is holding off on new sanctions for now.

So it's not as if Trump has had a full and sudden change of heart overnight. But consider that, at the end of February, Trump was publicly dressing down Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, blaming Ukraine for starting the war, and halting all US assistance to the Ukrainian war effort. By that standard, Trump's new tone is still one of several developments that add up to a welcome change of pace for Kyiv.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Even if there are no new measures taken to either support Ukraine or punish Russia, and even if the US “walks away” from efforts to negotiate a ceasefire, as Vice President JD Vance recently threatened, the events since February still amount to a remarkable diplomatic change of fortune for Ukraine — and probably about as good an outcome as Kyiv could reasonably expect from this administration. 

For Ukraine, where cities are still reeling from some of the largest airstrikes since the beginning of the war, and where supplies of much-needed air defense ammunition are running dangerously low, there's obviously no cause for celebration. Hanna Shelest, a Kyiv-based defense analyst with the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Vox that despite Trump's changing tone on Putin, his ongoing attacks on Zelenskyy (it's unclear exactly what remarks triggered Trump's ire) indicate that “we are still in a transactional situation. We have still not been able to dramatically change the approach of the US president.”

Trump, for all his current frustration, clearly still views the conflict in a way that is much more sympathetic to Russia's interests than Joe Biden or many members of his own party. But in terms of actual material support, not much has actually changed since Trump took office.

Because of the time it takes for those contracts to be negotiated and fulfilled, weapons that were ordered in 2022 are only being delivered now.

He has frequently suggested he'd be willing to lift sanctions on Russia as part of a ceasefire agreement, but he has not done so, and in fact, has signed executive orders extending the sanctions that Biden imposed. Many of these sanctions could not be lifted without congressional approval. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently put it, “When Vladimir Putin woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he's always had since the beginning of this conflict.”

Aside from a week-long pause following the contentious Oval Office meeting, US weapons shipments to Ukraine have continued. In fact, the rate of weapons deliveries actually increased in the early weeks of the Trump administration because of moves the Biden team made to rush aid out the door before leaving office. 

The intelligence sharing vital to Ukraine's targeting systems has also continued, as has — despite Elon Musk's threats — the Ukrainian military's access to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. 

Congress has allocated two types of funding for aid to Ukraine: The first pays for weapons to be transferred to Ukraine for US military stocks. That aid has been almost exhausted, experts say. The second provides funds for Ukraine to buy its own weapons from American manufacturers. Because of the time it takes for those contracts to be negotiated and fulfilled, weapons that were ordered in 2022 are only being delivered now. The last items from contracts signed in 2024 might not be delivered until 2028. 

The upshot, as Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, puts it, is that “the overall military aid being delivered is relatively high and will stay there for quite a while.”

This White House and this Congress are very unlikely to allocate new funding for aid to Ukraine, but perhaps others could fill the gap. European governments are reportedly warming to the idea of purchasing weapons from American manufacturers. So far, these governments have preferred to buy from their own companies, but there are a number of systems — such as the all-important Patriot air-defense missiles — that only the US can provide. 

Ukraine's defense industry is also more self-sufficient than it used to be. The drones that are now inflicting the majority of the casualties on the front lines in Ukraine are increasingly produced in-country by the country's booming autonomous weapons industry. 

It's even possible that Ukraine may benefit somewhat from a more hands-off American approach. For all that the Biden team made clear it would back Ukraine's war effort for as long as it takes, Ukrainian officials sometimes bristled under what they saw as micromanagement from a White House concerned about the risks of conflict escalation with Russia, particularly when it came to long-range strikes into Russian territory. 

But according to an announcement from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz this week, allies including the United States have agreed to lift range restrictions on weapons headed to Ukraine, allowing the Ukrainians more freedom to strike targets deep within Russia. 

The two main shifts in US policy that have taken place under Trump have been the US-Ukraine minerals deal and the direct negotiations with Russia. Both have proven less disastrous for Ukraine than they initially appeared. 

The original version of the minerals deal presented to Ukraine reportedly required the country to hand over hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from the mining of its critical minerals as repayment for past military aid. The deal Ukraine eventually signed drops that requirement and while it doesn't include the explicit security guarantees Ukraine was hoping for, it at least gives this transactionally minded administration a financial stake in Ukraine's future. 

As for the ongoing ceasefire talks, Trump overturned two oft-stated principles of the Biden approach: that Russia should be diplomatically isolated and that there would be no negotiations “about Ukraine without Ukraine.” But ultimately, Ukraine's political position may have been strengthened by the process. Putin has rejected a proposed 30-day ceasefire after Ukraine agreed to one, was a no-show at talks in Istanbul, where Zelenskyy had proposed meeting face-to-face, and has rejected Trump's proposal to have talks mediated by the Vatican. 

It's much harder for even the most skeptical to argue, as Trump has previously, that the war is only continuing because of Zelenskyy's unwillingness to make a deal. Even Trump has been forced to wonder if Putin is merely “tapping me along,” engaging minimally in the diplomatic process without abandoning his end goal of subjugating all of Ukraine, not just the disputed regions, by force.

Trump has clearly moved on from the notion that he can end the war in 24 hours and seems to be losing interest in the peace talks entirely. Or as Vance put it, “We're more than open to walking away.”

Much depends on what exactly “walking away” means. If it means an end to weapons shipments, intelligence sharing, and sanctions on Russia, that would be disastrous for Ukraine, though not necessarily fatal. 

“It's not as if we pulled the plug tomorrow, that Ukrainians would just immediately cease to exist, which I think was the administration's assumption when they came in,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, a former White House and Pentagon Russia adviser. “They thought they had a lot more leverage than they did over both Ukraine and Russia.” (A spokesperson for the White House national security council did not respond to Vox's request for comment.)

If Trump merely maintains the status quo — keeps the sanctions that are already in place, continues shipping the weapons that have already been paid for — that might be enough for the Ukrainians to hold the line for at least the coming months. 

It's true that Russian troops continue to slowly advance, but the rate of advance is already slowing this year, and it loses dozens of casualties per square kilometer. According to one recent estimate, it would take Russia 80 years to conquer all of Ukraine's territory at the current rate. 

Ukraine's bigger concern may be recruiting enough troops to man the front lines, though its efforts have improved somewhat, US commanders say, and low morale among both troops and civilians as the war drags on with no end in sight. 

Russia has manpower woes as well as increasing signs of economic distress as it continues to pour money into Ukraine. Trump's tariffs have had the unexpected side-effect of slashing the Russian state's oil revenues.

Before Trump took office, Ukrainian leaders expressed some cautious optimism that despite Trump's fondness for Putin and skepticism about the value of supporting to Ukraine, they'd be able to appeal to his transactional nature and turn him to their side. That was overoptimistic: Trump seems unlikely ever to be a strong backer of Ukraine. But he at least appears less likely to be a strong backer of Russia. For the moment, they may be the best they can hope for.

The autism commission is doomed to fail.

by  Dylan Scott

Let's start with one unambiguous fact: More children are diagnosed with autism today than in the early 1990s. 

According to a sweeping 2000 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a range of 2–7 per 1,000, or roughly 0.5 percent of US children, were diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. That figure has risen to 1 in 35 kids, or roughly 3 percent.

The apparent rapid increase caught the attention of people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who assumed that something had to be changing in the environment to drive it. In 2005, Kennedy, a lawyer and environmental activist at the time, authored an infamous essay in Rolling Stone that primarily placed the blame for the increased prevalence of autism on vaccines. (The article was retracted in 2011 as more studies debunked the vaccine-autism connection.) More recently, he has theorized that a mysterious toxin introduced in the late 1980s must be responsible. 

Now, as the nation's top health official leading the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has declared autism an “epidemic.” And, in April, he launched a massive federal effort to find the culprit for the rise in autism rates, calling for researchers to examine a range of suspects: chemicals, molds, vaccines, and perhaps even ultrasounds given to pregnant mothers. 

“Genes don't cause epidemics. You need an environmental toxin,” Kennedy said in April when announcing his department's new autism research project. He argued that too much money had been put into genetic research — “a dead end,” in his words — and his project would be a correction to focus on environmental causes. “That's where we're going to find an answer.”

But according to many autism scientists I spoke to for this story, Kennedy is looking in exactly the wrong place. 

Autism is a complex disorder with a range of manifestations that has long defied simple explanations, and it's unlikely that we will ever identify a single “cause” of autism.

But scientists have learned a lot in the past 50 years, including identifying some of the most important risk factors. They are not, as Kennedy suggests, out in our environment. They are written into our genetics. What appeared to be a massive increase in autism was actually a byproduct of better screening and more awareness. 

“The way the HHS secretary has been walking about his plans, his goals, he starts out with this basic assumption that nothing worthwhile has been done,” Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist at Boston University who has worked with and studied children with autism for years, said. “Genes play a significant role. We know now that autism runs in families… There is no single underlying factor. Looking for that holy grail is not the best approach.”

Doctors who treat children with autism often talk about how they wish they could provide easy answers to the families. The answers being uncovered through genetics research may not be simple per se, but they are answers supported by science.

Kennedy is muddying the story, pledging to find a silver-bullet answer where likely none exists. It's a false promise — one that could cause more anxiety and confusion for the very families Kennedy says he wants to help. 

Autism was first described in 1911, and for many decades, researchers and clinicians confused the social challenges and language development difficulties common among those with the condition for a psychological issue. Some child therapists even blamed the condition on bad parenting. 

But in 1977, a study discovered that identical twins, who share all of their DNA, were much more likely to both be autistic than fraternal twins, who share no more DNA than ordinary siblings. It marked a major breakthrough in autism research, and pushed scientists to begin coalescing around a different theory: There was a biological factor.

At the time, this was just a theory — scientists lacked the technology to prove those suspicions at the genetic level. And clinicians were also still trying to work out an even more fundamental question: What exactly was autism? 

For a long time, the criteria for diagnosing a person with autism was strictly based on speech development. But clinicians were increasingly observing children who could acquire basic language skills but still struggled with social communication — things like misunderstanding nonverbal cues or taking figurative language literally. Psychologists gradually broadened their definition of autism from a strict and narrow focus on language, culminating in a 2013 criteria that included a wide range of social and emotional symptoms with three subtypes — the autism spectrum disorder we're familiar with today.

Along the way, autism had evolved from a niche diagnosis for the severely impaired to something that encompassed far more children. 

It makes sense then, that as the broad criteria for autism expanded, more and more children would meet it, and autism rates would rise. That's precisely what happened. And it means that the “epidemic” that Kennedy and other activists have been fixated on is mostly a diagnostic mirage. 

Historical autism data is spotty and subject to these same historical biases, but if you look at the prevalence of profound autism alone — those who need the highest levels of support — a clearer picture emerges. (There is an ongoing debate in the autism community about whether to use the terminology of “profound autism” or “high support needs” for those who have the most severe form of the condition.) In the '80s and '90s, low-support needs individuals would have been less likely to receive an autism diagnosis given the more restrictive criteria and less overall awareness of the disorder, meaning that people with severe autism likely represented most of the roughly 0.5 percent of children diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. (One large analysis from Atlanta examining data from 1996 found that 68 percent of kids ages 3 to 10 diagnosed with autism had an IQ below 70, the typical cutoff for intellectual disability.)

By 2025, when about 3 percent of children are being diagnosed with autism, about one in four of those diagnosed are considered to have high-support needs autism, those with most severe manifestation of the condition. That would equal about 0.8 percent of all US children — which would be a fairly marginal increase from autism rates 30 years ago. Or look at it another way: In 2000, as many as 60 percent of the people being diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability, one of the best indicators of high-support needs autism. In 2022, that percentage was less than 40 percent.

As a recently published CDC report on autism prevalence among young children concluded, the increase in autism rates can largely be accounted for by stronger surveillance and more awareness among providers and parents, rather than a novel toxin or some other external factor driving an increase in cases.

Other known risk factors — like more people now having babies later in their life, given that parental age is linked to a higher likelihood of autism — are more likely to be a factor than anything Kennedy is pointing at, experts say. 

“It's very clear it's not going to be one environmental toxin,” said Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation and parent of a child with profound autism. “If there were a smoking gun, I think they would have found it.”

While Kennedy has fixated on vaccines and environmental influences, scientists have gained more precision in mapping human genetics and identifying the biological mechanisms that appear to be a primary cause of autism. And that not only helps us understand why autism develops, but potentially puts long-elusive therapies within reach. 

It began with an accident in the 1990s. 

Steven Scherer, now director of the Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, began his career in the late 1980s trying to identify the gene that caused cystic fibrosis — in collaboration with Francis Collins, who went on to lead the Human Genome Project that successfully sequenced all of the DNA in the human genome in the early 2000s. Scherer and Collins's teams focused on chromosome 7, identified as a likely target by the primitive genetic research available at the time, a coincidence that would reorient Scherer's career just a few years later, putting him on the trail of autism's genetic roots.

After four years, the researchers concluded that one gene within chromosome 7 caused cystic fibrosis. Soon after Scherer helped crack the code on cystic fibrosis in the mid-1990s, two parents from California called him: He was the world's leading expert on chromosome 7, and recent tests had revealed that their children with autism had a problem within that particular chromosome.

That very same week, Scherer says, he read the findings of a study by a group at Oxford University, which had looked at the chromosomes of families with two or more kids with autism. They, too, had identified problems within chromosome 7.

“So I said, ‘Okay, we're going to work on autism,'” Scherer told me. He helped coordinate a global research project, uniting his Canadian lab with the Oxford team and groups in the US to run a database that became the Autism Genome Project, still the world's largest repository of genetic information of people with autism.

They had a starting point — one chromosome — but a given chromosome contains hundreds of genes. And humans have, of course, 45 other chromosomes, any of which conceivably might play a role. So over the years, they collected DNA samples from thousands upon thousands of people with autism, sequenced their genes, and then searched for patterns. If the same gene is mutated or missing across a high percentage of autistic people, it goes on the list as potentially associated with the condition. 

Scientists discovered that autism has not one genetic factor, but many — further evidence that this is a condition of complex origin, in which multiple variables likely play a role in its development, rather than one caused by a single genetic error like sickle-cell anemia.

Here is one way to think about how far we have come: Joseph Buxbaum, the director of the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, entered autism genetics research 35 years ago. He recalls scientists being hopeful that they might identify a half dozen or so genes linked to autism.

They have now found 500 genes — and Buxbaum told me he believed they might find a thousand before they are through. These genetic factors continue to prove their value in predicting the onset of autism: Scherer pointed to one recent study in which the researchers identified people who all shared a mutation in the SHANK3 gene, one of the first to be associated with autism, but who were otherwise unalike: They were not related and came from different demographic backgrounds. Nevertheless, they had all been diagnosed with autism.

Precisely how much genetics contributes to the development of autism remains the subject of ongoing study. By analyzing millions of children with autism and their parents for patterns in diagnoses, multiple studies have attributed about 80 percent of a person's risk of developing autism to their inherited genetic factors. 

But of course 80 percent is not 100 percent. We don't yet have the full picture of how or why autism develops. Among identical twins, for example, studies have found that in most cases, if one twin has high-support needs autism, the other does as well, affirming the genetic effect. But there are consistently a small minority of cases — 5 and 10 percent of twin pairs, Scherer told me — in which one twin has relatively low-support needs while the one requires a a high degree of support for their autism.

Kennedy is not wholly incorrect to look at environmental factors — researchers theorize that autism may be the result of a complex interaction between a person's genetics and something they experience in utero. 

Scientists in autism research are exploring the possible influence when, for example, a person's mother develops maternal diabetes, high blood sugar that persists throughout pregnancy. And yet even if these other factors do play some role, the researchers I spoke to agree that genetics is, based on what we know now, far and away the most important driver.

“We need to figure out how other types of genetics and also environmental factors affect autism's development,” Scherer said. “There could be environmental changes…involved in some people, but it's going to be based on their genetics and the pathways that lead them to be susceptible.”

While the precise contours of Health Department's new autism research project is still taking shape, Kennedy has that researchers at the National Institutes of Health will collect data from federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and somehow use that information to identify possible environmental exposures that lead to autism. He initially pledged results by September, a timeline that, as outside experts pointed out, may be too fast to allow for a thorough and thoughtful review of the research literature. Kennedy has since backed off on that deadline, promising some initial findings in the fall but with more to come next year.

If Kennedy were serious about moving autism science forward, he would be talking more about genetics, not dismissing them. That's because genetics is where all of the exciting drug development is currently happening.

A biotech firm called Jaguar Gene Therapy has received FDA approval to conduct the first clinical trial of a gene therapy for autism, focused on SHANK3. The treatment, developed in part by one of Buxbaum's colleagues, is a one-time injection that would replace a mutated or missing SHANK3 gene with a functional one. The hope is that the therapy would improve speech and other symptoms among people with high-needs autism who have also been diagnosed with a rare chromosomal deletion disorder called Phelan-McDermid syndrome; many people with this condition also have Autism spectrum disorder.

The trial will begin this year with a few infant patients, 2 years old and younger, who have been diagnosed with autism. Jaguar eventually aims to test the therapy on adults over 18 with autism in the future. Patients are supposed to start enrolling this year in the trial, which is focused on first establishing the treatment's safety; if it proves safe, another round of trials would start to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness.

“This is the stuff that three or four years ago sounded like science fiction,” Singer said. “The conversation has really changed from Is this possible? to What are the best methods to do it? And that's based on genetics.”

Researchers at Mount Sinai have also experimented with delivering lithium to patients and seeing if it improves their SHANK3 function. Other gene therapies targeting other genes are in earlier stages of development. Some investigators are experimenting with CRISPR technology, the revolutionary new platform for gene editing, to target the problematic genes that correspond to the onset of autism.

But these scientists fear that their work could be slowed by Kennedy's insistence on hunting for environmental toxins, if federal dollars are instead shifted into his new project. They are already trying to subsist amid deep budget cuts across the many funding streams that support the institutions where they work. 

“Now we have this massive disruption where instead of doing really key experiments, people are worrying about paying their bills and laying off their staff and things,” Scherer said. “It's horrible.” 

For the families of people with high-needs autism, Kennedy's crusade has stirred conflicting emotions. Alison Singer, the leader of the Autism Science Foundation, is also the parent of a child with profound autism. When I spoke with her, I was struck by the bind that Kennedy's rhetoric has put people like her and her family in. 

Singer told me profound autism has not received enough federal support in the past, as more emphasis was placed on individuals who have low support needs included in the expanding definitions of the disorder, and so she appreciates Kennedy giving voice to those families. She believes that he is sincerely empathetic toward their predicament and their feeling that the mainstream discussion about autism has for too long ignored their experiences in favor of patients with lower support needs. But she worries that his obsession with environmental factors will stymie the research that could yield breakthroughs for people like her child.

“He feels for those families and genuinely wants to help them,” Singer said. “The problem is he is a data denier. You can't be so entrenched in your beliefs that you can't see the data right in front of you. That's not science.”

﻿Criticism of Israel is ramping up. What does that mean for the war in Gaza?

by  Avishay Artsy

In Israel, left-wing politician Yair Golan, a retired general, recently stirred controversy when he said in an interview with Israel Radio that “Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state” and added that “a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the aim of expelling populations.” 

In the face of intense criticism, he has since walked back those comments.

But while Golan's comments were condemned across the Israeli political spectrum, they “also sparked a discussion about Israel's conduct and what it is doing and the toll of the war on civilians,” said Tia Goldenberg, a correspondent for the Associated Press in Jerusalem.

In an interview with Vox's Today, Explained, Goldenberg said Golan's comments are indicative of the fact that Israelis are increasingly turning against their country's war in Gaza.

That war began on October 7, 2023, when an attack by Hamas fighters left 1,200 dead and 250 captured. Some of those kidnapped have been returned; others have died. There are 58 hostages remaining in Gaza, of which a third are believed to be alive.

Israel's attacks on Gaza have killed more than 50,000 people and have devastated Gaza, leaving much of it uninhabitable. In recent weeks, it has expanded its military offensive, with increased air strikes and a goal of capturing the entire Gaza Strip and moving the population of Gaza to the south of the territory. 

That escalation comes amid a dire hunger crisis. Israel began a total humanitarian aid blockade on March 2 in order to increase pressure on Hamas to return the remaining hostages, leading one critic to accuse the country of using aid as a “weapon of war” during an April hearing on Israel's war strategy at the International Court of Justice. 

“During these few weeks, or nearly three months actually, no aid was being let into Gaza, no food, no medicine, no fuel, and you had a situation where food experts were warning that nearly 1 million Palestinians barely had enough access to food, and nearly half a million Palestinians were at the risk of possible starvation,” Goldenberg said. 

The escalating strikes and threat of mass starvation haven't just roiled Israeli politics; they've also drawn worldwide condemnation of Israel and created an unlikely coalition of critics.

MAGA-friendly podcaster and standup comedian Theo Von recently described the ongoing conflict in Gaza as a “genocide” and “one of the sickest things that's ever happened.”

Leading children's entertainer and YouTube star Ms. Rachel has used her platform to talk about how the conflict is affecting children in the region. 

“It's sad that people try to make it controversial when you speak out for children that are facing immeasurable suffering,” she told Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan. “I think it should be controversial to not say anything.”

The new pope, Leo XIV, like his predecessor, has appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza, the freeing of the remaining hostages, and called on Israel and Hamas to respect international humanitarian law.

German leaders have made public comments about changing their country's long-running special relationship with Israel, while French President Emmanuel Macron has floated acknowledging Palestine as a state.

Even President Donald Trump, a longtime ally of Israel and of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has started to suggest he's seen enough. “Israel, we've been talking to them, and we want to see if we can stop that whole situation as quickly as possible,” he said last weekend.

All of this suggests an inflection point in Israel's long-running war. It has been made possible in part thanks to aid from allies like the US, Germany, and France. If that support were to deteriorate, continuing its operations could become more difficult. 

That is not to say the war's end is necessarily near. 

Despite the shift in rhetoric, few of Israel's allies have made any material changes to their relationship with the country. Israel's goal of completely destroying Hamas has not changed. It recently killed Mohammed Sinwar, believed to be the head of Hamas's armed wing. 

“It's just been an intense, intense conflict. And yet that hasn't dislodged Hamas from its position. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is under a lot of political pressure from his governing coalition to continue the war,” Goldenberg said. “It's hard to see how the sides reconcile and come to an agreement that ends this war.”

Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US.

by  Ian Millhiser

The Supreme Court handed down a very brief order on Friday, which effectively permits the Trump administration to strip half a million immigrants of their right to remain in the United States. The case is Noem v. Doe.

Although the full Court did not explain why it reached this decision, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

As Jackson explains, the case involves “nearly half a million Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan noncitizens” who are in the United States “after fleeing their home countries.” 

The Department of Homeland Security previously granted these immigrants “parole” status, which allows them to live in the United States for up to two years, and sometimes to work in this country lawfully. Shortly after Trump entered office, DHS issued a blanket order stripping these immigrants of their parole status, putting them at risk for removal. But, a federal district court blocked that order — ruling that DHS must decide whether each individual immigrant should lose their status on a case-by-case basis, rather than through an en masse order.

Realistically, this district court order was unlikely to remain in effect indefinitely. In its brief to the justices, the Trump administration makes a strong argument that its decision to terminate these immigrants' status is legal, or, at least, that the courts cannot second-guess that decision. Among other things, the brief points to a federal law which provides that “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” certain immigration-related decisions by the secretary of Homeland Security. And it argues that the secretary has the power to grant or deny parole because federal law gives them “discretion” over who receives parole.

Notably, Jackson's dissent does not question that the Trump administration is likely to prevail once this case is fully litigated. Instead, she argues that her Court's decision to effectively strip these immigrants of their status is premature. “Even if the Government is likely to win on the merits,” Jackson writes, “in our legal system, success takes time and the stay standards require more than anticipated victory.”

The primary disagreement between Jackson and her colleagues in the majority concerns the Court's aggressive use of its “shadow docket” to benefit Trump and other conservative litigants. The shadow docket is a mix of emergency motions and other expedited matters that the justices decide without full briefing and oral argument. The Court typically only spends days or maybe a few weeks weighing whether to grant shadow docket relief, while it spends months or longer deciding cases on its ordinary docket.

Since Jackson joined the Court in 2022, she's become the Court's most vocal internal critic of its frequent use of the shadow docket.

As Jackson correctly notes in her Doe dissent, the Supreme Court has long said that a party seeking a shadow docket order blocking a lower court's decision must do more than demonstrate that they are likely to prevail. That party must also show that “irreparable harm will befall them should we deny the stay.” When these two factors do not strongly tilt toward one party, the Court is also supposed to ask whether “the equities and public interest” favor the party seeking a stay.

Jackson criticizes her colleagues in the majority for abandoning these requirements. As she argues, the Trump administration has not shown an “urgent need to effectuate blanket…parole terminations now.” 

She also argues that DHS “does not identify any specific national-security threat or foreign-policy problem that will result” if these immigrants remain in the country for a few more months. And, even under the lower court's order, the government “retains the ability to terminate…parole on a case-by-case basis should such a particular need arise.”

Although the Court has never formally repudiated the requirement that parties seeking to stay a lower court order must prove irreparable harm, it often hands down shadow docket decisions that don't explicitly consider this requirement. 

Concurring in Labrador v. Poe (2024), Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that, in many shadow docket cases, “this Court has little choice but to decide the emergency application by assessing likelihood of success on the merits.” So Kavanaugh, at least, has stated openly that there are some cases where he will rule solely based on which side he thinks should win, regardless of whether that side has proven irreparable harm. Kavanaugh's concurring opinion was joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

In the short term, the Doe decision could lead to many immigrants losing their protections. Long term, the most significant aspect of the decision involves an internal dispute about how fast the Court may move when it disagrees with a lower court decision. 

No justice contested that the Trump administration is eventually likely to prevail in this case. But Jackson called for her Court to continue to apply procedural constraints that a majority of her colleagues appear to have abandoned. The upshot of this abandonment is that right-leaning litigants like Trump are likely to receive relief very quickly from the justices, because most of the justices are Republicans, while left-leaning litigants will remain bound by lower court orders.

If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.

The Court's latest decision is a love letter to the abundance agenda.

Elon Musk said he had ""differences of opinion"" with the Trump administration during his time in government.

""It's not like I agree with everything the administration does,"" Musk said in a forthcoming interview with ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" a clip of which was released on Thursday.

""I agree with much of what the administration does, but we have differences of opinion. There are things I don't entirely agree with,"" Musk added, though he did not elaborate on what those disagreements were.

On Wednesday, Musk said he was departing from the White House DOGE office. The announcement capped off Musk's 130-day tenure as a special government employee with the Trump administration.

Musk's interview with CBS took place a day before he made his announcement. The full interview is set to air on Sunday.

Musk also told the outlet that he is ""a little stuck in a bind"" when voicing his disagreements with the administration.

""But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention,"" Musk said.

""So then, I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't wanna, you know, speak up against the administration. But I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything the administration's doing,"" he continued.

Musk said in the same interview that he was ""disappointed to see the massive spending bill"" that House Republicans passed on May 22. GOP lawmakers hope that the bill, which is now with the Senate, will be sent to President Donald Trump's desk by July 4.

Musk said Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" will increase the budget deficit and ""undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.""

""I think a bill can be big, or it could be beautiful. I don't know if it could be both,"" Musk told CBS in a clip released on Tuesday.

In November, Trump announced that Musk would co-lead DOGE with Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump said the cost-cutting outfit would conclude its work by July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, leaving Musk as its sole leader.

But Musk's work at DOGE sparked boycotts and protests against his EV company, Tesla. Musk also faced increased calls from investors to spend more time on Tesla instead of DOGE.

Last month, Musk said in a Tesla earnings call that he would scale down his involvement with DOGE to focus on Tesla.

""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days every few weeks. And to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" Musk said in an interview with CNBC on May 20.

Musk and the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","CEOs know AI will shrink their teams — they're just too afraid to say it, say 2 software investors","https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-ai-job-cuts-layoffs-corporate-speak-2025-5","Fri, 30 May 2025 05:29:00 GMT","

AI is a tool to boost productivity, not to take anyone's job, according to the script many CEOs have been using.

Behind closed doors, it's a very different conversation, said two software investors on an episode of the ""Twenty Minute VC"" podcast published Thursday.

""Public companies are trying to prepare their teams for it, but the backlash was too strong,"" said Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups.

Instead, CEOs fall back on the safer line: ""In fact, we're hiring.""

""That seems to take the edge off,"" Lemkin said.

""But I think they're just walking back the fact that everybody knows they don't need 30% to 40% of the team they have today. Everybody says this,"" he added.

""It's too hard for people to hear. There's only so much honesty you can get from a CEO,"" he said.

Rory O'Driscoll, a longtime general partner at Scale Venture Partners, said CEOs can't talk about job loss because employees will ""lose their shit.""

He said what ends up getting shared publicly is a ""very bland statement"" full of ""standard corporate speak for how you talk about AI.""

""No one is going to get fired. You're just going to do more interesting things,"" O'Driscoll said. ""That's the current state of the lie.""

From Klarna to Duolingo, several companies have tested the waters with bold AI declarations — only to backtrack.

Klarna' CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said in December that AI ""can already do all of the jobs"" humans do, and that the company has stopped hiring for over a year.

But earlier this month, he walked it back, saying his pursuit of AI-driven job cuts may have gone too far.

Duolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, also faced criticism after posting a memo on LinkedIn last month describing plans to make the company ""AI-first.""

He later said on LinkedIn that he does not see AI replacing what his employees do and that Duolingo is ""continuing to hire at the same speed as before.""

Lemkin and O'Driscoll did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Lemkin said mass layoffs could hit in the next two years as companies come to terms with a new reality. He added that he expects overall headcount to ""stay flat.""

There will be ""efficiencies"" and also ""jobs that would have existed in the absence of this product that won't exist now,"" said O'Driscoll. ""So there will be tension.""

O'Driscoll said he sees a gradual shift — more of a ""steady grind"" of 2% to 3% less hiring each year.

Tech companies, in particular, will see ""significantly reduced hiring"", he added.

Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, said on Thursday that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level office jobs.

AI companies and the government need to stop ""sugarcoating"" the risks of mass job elimination in fields including technology, finance, law, and consulting, Amodei said.

It's week three of the Sean ""Diddy"" Combs sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.

A federal jury in Manhattan has heard R&B singer Cassie Ventura — Combs' ex-girlfriend and the catalyst for his public downfall — tearfully testify about the humiliating ""freak offs"" she says she endured throughout their 11-year relationship.

A second sex-assault accuser, testifying as ""Mia,"" has described four times she said Combs attacked her during her nine years working as his personal assistant and film executive.

Along the way, there have been numerous celebrity mentions, including pop icon Britney Spears, actor Michael B. Jordan, rapper Kid Cudi, and late music legend Prince.

Combs was arrested in September on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution — the culmination of months of lawsuits and public accusations of sexual assault and other misconduct.

He has denied the charges. The music tycoon is arguing through his defense team that all sexual encounters were consensual, including the alleged drug-fueled freak offs. The defense also argues that any violence fell far short of sex trafficking and that his accusers have a financial motive to implicate him.

Here are some of the most striking moments from the trial so far.

One of Combs' former personal assistants testified under the pseudonym ""Mia,"" telling jurors he sexually attacked her four times between 2009 and 2017, when she was in her mid-20s and early 30s.She said that two of the attacks were at the sprawling glass and concrete mansion he rented in Beverly Hills, including a rape in the staff bedroom. She described waking to feeling Combs on top of her. ""Be quiet,"" she said he told her.

""I knew his power and I knew his control over me,"" she told the jury, her voice hushed and halting.

""And I didn't want to lose everything that I worked so hard for — or this, like, this world that was the only thing I had anymore.""

Combs once attacked Ventura during a party thrown by music icon Prince, the former personal assistant also testified.

The ex-PA, who used the pseudonym ""Mia,"" told the jury she and Ventura had snuck out to Prince's Los Angeles home after learning he would be performing for a small gathering — a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" experience, as Ventura described it on the stand.

Prince did not disappoint. Mia said that as he played music, they danced atop his backyard pool, which was backlit and covered in purple plexiglas.

Then Combs showed up, she said.

""I saw his bucket hat come through the entrance and then made eye contact with him,"" Mia said of Combs. ""Me and Cass just booked it.""

They ran through Prince's house and into the woods out front, where ""Puff caught Cass,"" and started beating her, Mia said, until Prince's security intervened.

Later that night, Ventura testified that Combs continued to beat her back at her hotel, leaving her with ""bruising on my face, knots on my head.""

Capricorn Clark, another former personal assistant and one who became one of his top marketing executives, kicked off week three of the trial by telling jurors that he once kidnapped her at gunpoint.

It was December 2011, after Combs learned of rapper Kid Cudi's brief relationship with Ventura, Clark testified on May 27.

Combs was ""furious"" with Clark for keeping him in the dark about Ventura's romance with the ""Pursuit of Happiness"" rapper, she said.

Clark told the jury that Combs, armed with a gun, went to her house in a rage and banged on the door.

""He just said, 'Get dressed, we're going to go kill'"" him, Clark testified that Combs told her, using the N-word to refer to Kid Cudi.

Combs then took Clark to Kid Cudi's Los Angeles home, she told the jury, describing it as being ""kidnapped.""

""The way he was acting, I just felt like anything could happen,"" a tearful Clark testified.

In the first week of trial testimony, Ventura told jurors that starting in late 2008, she was coerced by Combs into a decade's worth of near-weekly ""freak offs"" — dayslong sex performances, usually at luxury hotels, involving male escorts, Glade candles, and numerous bottles of baby oil.

Clark told jurors that in the years she was Combs personal assistant, from 2004 until 2006, she would set up and clean up the hotel rooms where Combs took another longterm girlfriend, model Kim Porter, the mother of four of Combs' children.

During those years, Combs and Porter would stay for days at luxury hotels in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York. Clark said, as a personal assistant, she made sure Combs' suite was stocked with ecstasy, baby oil, and pricey Diptyque candles.

Cleanup was tricky, Clark told jurors, who mentioned ""handprints left in oil on the, like, ultra-suede wall"" as a particular problem. ""It was just a lot of baby oil. It was just everywhere.""

These were not ""freak offs,"" Porter's former family attorney, Suzanne Kimberly Bracker, told Business Insider.

""He was madly in love with Kim,"" said Bracker, who helped negotiate Combs' child support settlement and who said that Porter had two children with Combs at the time.

""There is absolutely no way that he would share her with another man,"" she said. ""He would tell her 'I'm not gonna pay for an apartment with my kids in one room while you're with another guy in the other bedroom.'""

Kid Cudi took the witness stand in Combs' trial on May 22, telling jurors that in December 2011, the music tycoon broke into his Hollywood Hills home, enraged after finding out about the rival rapper's short-lived romance with Ventura.

Kid Cudi, given name Scott Mescudi, told the jury that he returned home after the break-in to find the Christmas gifts he'd planned to give his family unwrapped and opened. His dog, he said, had been shut in the bathroom.

""Motherfucker, you in my house?"" Mescudi recalled telling Combs over the phone as he raced home to confront him.

Combs was gone by the time he arrived, Mescudi said.

Mescudi also told the jury that some two weeks later, his Porsche was firebombed while in his driveway.

The Porsche ""arson"" is a specific element in the racketeering charges against Combs. Prosecutors alleged in court papers that Combs ordered his underlings to torch a vehicle ""by slicing open the car's convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside the interior.""

Regina Ventura corroborated her daughter's testimony, telling jurors she witnessed the aftermath of two of Combs' violent, jealous rages over romantic rivals.

The first was in 2011. The mom said Cassie Ventura came home to Connecticut for the Christmas holidays with a large bruise on her back.

Cassie Ventura had told jurors the week before that the bruise was from being kicked to the ground by Combs during a fight over Mescudi.

Regina Ventura also confirmed a 2016 incident from shortly before the younger Ventura's 30th birthday. Combs had swiped her cellphone, Cassie Ventura testified, after learning about her affair with an unnamed professional NFL player.

When she returned to her Los Angeles apartment without her phone, her mother, who was visiting, called the police and confronted Combs outside the building as her daughter remained upstairs, the elder Ventura testified.

""I was yelling and screaming and trying to hit him,"" the mom told jurors. ""He did give it back,"" she told jurors of the missing phone.

A former Combs personal assistant described watching — and doing nothing — as his boss brutally attacked a cowering Ventura in the bedroom of the rapper's private jet.

George Kaplan, 34, said the attack happened on a crowded flight to Las Vegas in the latter half of 2015. Kaplan said he heard the sound of screams and shattering glass coming from the jet's bedroom.

He said he turned to see Combs standing over Ventura with a ""whiskey rock glass"" in his hand, as she cowered on the bed.

""After the glass crashed, Ventura screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?'"" Kaplan told the jury.

""Did you look away?"" asked a federal prosecutor, Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey. Kaplan said he did.

""And after you looked away, what did you hear?"" the prosecutor asked.

""Further glass crashing and chaos.""

When the prosecutor asked what, if anything, the Combs security staff did in response, Kaplan answered, ""Nothing.""

No one, he said, went back to check on Ventura after Combs left the bedroom to rejoin his employees.

""I was 23 years old,"" Kaplan said in explanation of his own inaction. ""All I wanted to do was have a great job in the entertainment industry.""

Ultimately, he told the jury, this and similar domestic violence incidents drove him to quit.

Combs' former personal assistant spent two days on the witness stand, and in his most dramatic testimony, described how a 2008 run for cheeseburgers at an all-night diner nearly escalated the East Coast-West Coast rap wars.

It started at 4 a.m. in the parking lot at Mel's Drive-In in Los Angeles, the ex-assistant, David James, testified.

Combs' trusted security guard, Damian ""D-Roc"" Butler, noticed that Suge Knight, cofounder of rival recording studio Death Row Records, was sitting in an Escalade just a few parking spots away.

James, Combs' personal assistant from 2007 to 2009, testified that he was at the wheel of Combs' silver Lincoln Navigator when Knight and D-Roc faced off.

""What are you doing in my city?"" James, according to his testimony, remembered hearing Knight asking Combs' security guard, who had introduced himself as ""D-Roc, Biggie's boy,"" a reference to the rapper Notorious B.I.G.

Within moments, James and the bodyguard saw someone pass a gun to Knight and watched as four SUVs pulled up into different corners of the parking lot, he told jurors.

James testified that he was ordered by D-Roc to speed back to Combs' Hollywood Hills estate. There was no mention of whether they drove back with or without the cheeseburgers.

Once back home, and as Ventura protested in tears, Combs grabbed three guns for the ten-minute drive with D-Roc back to Mel's, testified James, who said he was still the driver.

Knight was nowhere to be found upon their return, James said.

""It was the first time I realized my life was in danger,"" the former PA testified, telling jurors that he sent in his resignation soon after.

Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard was the fifth prosecution witness, and her testimony on May 16 alleged that in 2009, Combs brutally beat Ventura after she took too long to cook him dinner.

""Where's my fucking egg?"" Richard recounted to the jury Combs shouting in 2009, as he stormed into the kitchen of his rented Los Angeles mansion.

""He took the skillet with the eggs in it and tried to hit her in the head, and she fell to the ground,"" Richard testified.

Ventura cowered on the floor ""in a fetal position"" as Combs punched her and kicked her, she testified. Then he dragged her upstairs by her hair, she said, adding that she then heard the sound of screaming and breaking glass from the third floor.

The next day, Combs called Ventura and Richard into the mansion's first-floor recording studio, she said.

""He said that what we saw was passion, and it was what lovers in a relationship do,"" Richard said.

She said Combs told the two women that ""he was trying to take us to the top, and that, where he comes from, people go missing if they say things like that, like, if people talk. And then he gave us flowers.""

While back on the stand on May 19, Richard re-emphasized that she felt this was a threat to her life.

The details in the testimony came as a surprise to Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who called it prejudicial and ""just a drop dead lie.""

""It didn't happen,"" the lawyer complained to the judge. ""And the reason we know it didn't happen is that Ms. Ventura didn't talk about it"" during her four days on the witness stand.

On cross-examination on May 19, Richard agreed that she only recalled the alleged death threat in speaking with prosecutors earlier this month. It had gone unmentioned, she agreed, during a half-dozen prior interviews with prosecutors.

Ventura was beaten by Combs for the most minor of perceived infractions, including taking too long in the bathroom, prosecutor Emily Johnson said in her opening statement.

""He beat her when she didn't answer the phone when he called. He beat her when she left a freak off without his permission,"" Johnson said.

Ventura's ex-best friend, Kerry Morgan, was called to the witness stand on May 19 and told jurors about two attacks on Ventura she witnessed, including one while on vacation in Jamaica in 2013.

Morgan said Ventura at one point went to the bathroom at the residence where they were staying, and Combs said, ""She's taking too long.""

""A few minutes later, I heard her screaming — like guttural. Terrifying,"" Morgan said. ""He was dragging her by her hair on the floor.""

Morgan told jurors that she saw Combs push Ventura to the ground, causing her to hit her head on the paving bricks.

""She didn't move. She fell on her side,"" Morgan said, adding, ""I thought she was knocked out.""

Ventura, too, had testified that arguments with Combs would regularly result in physical abuse.

Ventura —who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018 — described six separate times when Combs' attacks left her with injuries, with the most severe beating occurring in Los Angeles in 2009 following a party Combs had hosted at a club called Ace of Diamonds.

Ventura said she punched Combs in the face after he called her a ""slut or a bitch"" for talking to a record producer. Combs retaliated in the back seat of a chauffeured luxury vehicle by punching and kicking Ventura throughout a ten-minute ride to the rapper's rented mansion, she said.

She said she hid under the back seat to escape the attack. Combs demanded she stay hidden in a hotel for a week so her bruises could heal, she said.

The prosecution's fourth witness took the witness stand briefly on May 16 to detail what she and other Homeland Security investigators say they found inside Combs' suite at Manhattan's Park Hyatt New York after his September arrest.

Combs had checked into the luxury Midtown hotel, his lawyers have said, in case federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked him to surrender voluntarily.

Special Agent Yasin Binda told the Combs jury she photographed what her colleagues found inside the room.

Those items included a clear plastic bag of baby oil bottles found inside a duffle bag. There were three more bottles of baby oil in his bathtub, alongside two bottles of personal lubricant.

Two more bottles of lubricant were recovered from a nightstand drawer, next to a prescription pill bottle she said held two small baggies containing a pink powder.

On the living room floor was a large blue party light of the kind Ventura testified were used to illuminate freak offs.

Similar bags of pink powder have previously been seized from Combs and tested positive for ecstasy and other drugs, a prosecutor had said in court the day after Combs was arrested.

In some of her final moments on the witness stand, Ventura was asked by the defense about a legal settlement that she said she is on the verge of receiving from the InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles.

""I think it was $10 million,"" Ventura said of the settlement, hesitating when asked for the total amount agreed to.

The InterContinental is where security cameras captured Combs beating Ventura in a hallway in 2016, as she tried to flee what prosecutors say was one of Combs' freak offs.

The jury was shown the infamous footage at the beginning of the trial.

Johnson, the prosecutor, said in her opening statements that at the time of the attack, Combs paid a security guard at the hotel $100,000 in a brown paper envelope in exchange for the footage.

Combs apologized for his actions in the video after CNN published the footage last year.

It was the second big-money settlement revealed in Ventura's testimony.

Earlier in her testimony, Ventura told jurors that Combs paid her $20 million to settle her civil suit against him in 2023.

Pop icon Britney Spears and actor Michael B. Jordan were both name-dropped on May 15, on Ventura's third day of testimony.

During a cross-examination, Ventura was asked to tell the jury about the 21st birthday party Combs threw for her in 2007, at a club in Las Vegas.

The party was a significant moment in the Combs-Ventura story. Ventura testified that Combs, who recently signed her to his record label, gave her an uninvited kiss in a bathroom, sparking their relationship.

""I believe there were other celebrities there in attendance?"" defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura, who answered yes, there were.

""Sean was there, and he brought Dallas Austin, he brought Britney Spears,"" Ventura said, referring to the ""Oops!… I Did It Again"" singer and the record producer. ""I think those were the two people that stand out to me,"" Ventura added.

Asked how a 21-year-old of limited fame was able to attract such big names to her party, Ventura credited Combs, saying, ""That was all him.""

Jordan's name came up as the cross-examination focused on 2015, when Combs became suspicious that she was having an affair with the actor.

""Is Michael B. Jordan a celebrity?"" Estevao asked.

""I would say so,"" Ventura answered, sounding surprised.

Ventura testified on May 13 that she was initially nervous, but felt a sense of responsibility to participate in Combs' freak offs.

""I was just in love and wanted to make him happy,"" Ventura told the jury.

Ventura testified that in 2007, Combs first proposed ""this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism, where he would watch me have a sexual encounter with a third man, specifically another man.""

""I didn't want to upset him if I said it scared me or if I said anything aside from, 'OK, let's try it,'"" she said.

Johnson said in her opening statements that Combs eventually made it Ventura's job to find and book escorts to participate in the sex encounters.

While on the stand, Ventura described in detail what went on during freak offs. Prosecutors say Combs arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded the sex performances.

Ventura testified that Combs would urinate and ask escorts to urinate on her during the freak offs.

""It was disgusting. It was too much. It was overwhelming,"" she said. ""I choked.""

Russia said it's sending a delegation to Istanbul Monday for a second round of talks with Ukraine amid last-minute wrangling over Kyiv's insistence that Moscow outline its peace proposals before any meeting. 

The warring sides have tussled over the parameters of negotiations after Turkey hosted the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since the early months of the war on May 16.

The Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump can terminate the protected status of around 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is still pending.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a scathing dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said the majority of the Supreme Court ""has plainly botched"" its assessment in granting a stay of a lower court ruling that had blocked the terminations ordered by Trump on his first day back in the White House.

Until that order, the group of immigrants who had left their home countries because of conflicts there, or unsafe living or working conditions, were allowed to remain in the United States for up to two years.

""I suppose, that it is in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims,"" Jackson wrote sarcastically in her dissent.

She said that the Supreme Court's ruling, which did not explain the grounds for the decision, ""undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.""

""While it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize — not maximize — harm to litigating parties,"" Jackson wrote.

The ruling comes nearly two weeks after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the status of nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. who are allowed to remain under the Temporary Status Program.

Friday's ruling by the high court related to an executive order by Trump on Jan. 20 that instructed the Department of Homeland Security to terminate all so-called ""categorical parole programs,"" or CHNV parole, which allowed certain immigrants to live in the United States for up to two years, and for some to legally work in the U.S.

A group of plaintiffs challenged the DHS's revocation of the programs in federal court in Massachusetts, where a judge stayed the department's action after finding that federal law ""requires that parole terminations occur on a case-by-case basis, rather than en masse,"" Jackson's dissent noted.

The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that decision. The Trump administration then asked the Supreme Court to undo to the lower courts' decisions.

Friday's ruling by the Supreme Court means DHS can revoke the group's protected status while the 1st Circuit considers an appeal of the order itself.

Jackson, in her dissent, wrote that the immigrants affected by Friday's decision ""now face two unbearable options.""

""On the one hand, they could elect to leave the United States and, thereby, confront 'dangers in their native countries,' experience destructive 'family separation,' and possibly ""forfei[t] any opportunity to obtain a remedy based on their . . . claims,' as the District Court found,"" Jackson wrote.

""On the other, they could remain in the United States after parole termination and risk imminent removal at the hands of Government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences.""

""Either choice creates significant problems for respondents that far exceed any harm to the Government, should this Court decline the stay request,"" she wrote.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that China has ""totally violated its"" preliminary trade agreement with the United States, and suggested he would take action in response.

""So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" Trump wrote in a social media post that said China had reneged on a deal that paused retaliatory tariffs between that country and the U.S.

Stock futures fell Friday morning on the heels of Trump's statement.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, in a CNBC interview Friday morning, echoed Trump's allegation, saying ""we're very concerned with"" China's purported non-compliance with the temporary trade deal.

The ""United States did exactly what it was supposed to do, and the Chinese are slow rolling their compliance,"" said Greer.

He called that ""completely unacceptable and has to be addressed.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a Fox News interview on Thursday, said that trade talks with China ""are a bit stalled.""

CNBC has requested comment from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.

The U.S. and China on May 12 agreed to a 90-day suspension on most tariffs imposed on each other's imports.

The agreement was reached after Trump slapped sky-high tariffs on imports from China into the U.S., and China retaliated in kind.

""Two weeks ago China was in grave economic danger!"" Trump wrote in his post on Truth Social on Friday.

""The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is, by far, number one in the World,"" Trump wrote. ""We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was, to put it mildly, ""civil unrest."" I saw what was happening and didn't like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen.""

""Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!!"" the president wrote.

""The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!""

Trump posted his screed two days after he lashed out at CNBC reporter Megan Cassella at the White House when she asked about the term ""TACO trade,"" which refers to the phrase ""Trump Always Chickens Out.""

The term, coined by a Financial Times columnist, suggests that stock pickers can make money by buying shares after markets fall on news of new tariffs imposed by Trump, knowing that he invariably will pause or reduce the tariffs, sending markets higher.

While U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs play out in U.S. courts, another one of his proposed laws could weaponize the American tax system.

Investment banks and law firms warn this step could prove to be as significant as the impact of duties on investors.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which passed through the U.S. House of Representatives last week, includes the most sweeping changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. in decades under a provision known as Section 899. The bill must still gain the Senate's approval.

""We see this legislation as creating the scope for the US administration to transform a trade war into a capital war if it so wishes,"" said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank on Thursday.

""Section 899 challenges the open nature of US capital markets by explicitly using taxation on foreign holdings of US assets as leverage to further US economic goals,"" Saravelos added in the note to clients, under the subtitle ""weaponization of US capital markets in to law.""

Section 899 says it will hit entities from ""discriminatory foreign countries"" — those that impose levies such as the digital services taxes that disproportionately affect U.S. companies.

France, for instance, has a 3% tax on revenues from online platforms, which primarily targets big technology firms such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. Germany is reportedly considering a similar tax of 10%.

Under the new tax bill, the U.S. would hit investors from such countries by increasing taxes on U.S. income by 5 percentage points each year, potentially taking the rate up to 20%.

Emmanuel Cau, head of European Equity Strategy at Barclays, suggested that the mere passage of the tax legislation could make dollar assets less valuable for foreign investors.

""In our view, this is a risk for those companies generating US revenues, and domiciled in countries that have enacted Digital Services Taxes (DST) or are implementing the OECD's Under Taxed Payment Rule (UTPR),"" Cau said in a Friday note to clients.

He highlighted companies such as London-listed Compass Group, which provides catering services to U.S. schools, and InterContinental Hotels, which owns at least 25 luxury hotels in the U.S., are likely to be affected by the proposed law.

""Given US net international investment position is sharply negative, there is indeed scope for capital outflows if indeed S899 passes through the Senate in its current form,"" he added.

The impact of the bill won't be limited to European companies or individuals from those states.

The bill ""could significantly increase tax rates applicable to certain non-U.S. individuals and business, governmental, and other entities,"" said Max Levine, head of U.S. tax at the law firm Linklaters.

This means it could also ensnare governments and central banks, which are large investors of U.S. Treasuries. France and Germany, for instance, held a combined $475 billion worth of U.S. government bonds as of March.

The proposed tax would lower returns on U.S. Treasuries for those investors as ""the de facto yield on US Treasuries would drop by nearly 100bps,"" Deutsche Bank's Saravelos added. ""The adverse impact on demand for USTs and funding the US twin deficit at a time when this is most needed is clear"".

""It's very bad,"" said Beat Wittmann, chairman of Switzerland-based Porta Advisors. ""This is huge — this is just one piece in the overall plan and it's completely consistent with what this administration is all about.""

""The ultimate judge for this is not our opinions, it's the bond market,"" Wittmann added. ""The U.S. bond market is discounting these developments, and we have seen in the last few weeks, that if there was a safe haven move, investors clearly prefer German bunds.""

Large Australian pension funds with U.S. investments have also been reportedly concerned by the bill, since Australia operates a medicines subsidy scheme that is opposed by large U.S. pharmaceutical companies.

Legal experts at the Mayer Brown law firm suggest that ""significant changes"" could be made to the bill as it passes through the U.S. Senate before it's enshrined into law by Trump.

""As such, there may be questions about whether the provisions of the proposal that override tax treaties could be included in the US Senate's version of the tax bill,"" Mayer Brown's experts said.

A U.S. federal trade court striking down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on a broad swathe of countries seems, on the surface, a positive development all around. A lack of tariffs leads to cheaper goods, likely more consumer spending and higher corporate revenue, which tends to flow back to stock prices.

This ideal scenario, however, rests on the assumption that the court's decision is final and the Trump administration does not have other ways of reinstating its muscular trade policies.

Events on Thursday have already shown us that is not the case. An appeals court temporarily paused the tariff ruling to allow the Trump administration to respond to the case. ""Even if we lose, we will do it another way,"" Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro told reporters at the White House Thursday afternoon.

This uncertainty could roil markets and trade negotiations with countries further. If tariffs could pop in and out of existence based on policy and judicial decisions, how do nations discuss trade deals, and how do investors allocate their capital efficiently? Indeed, the S&P 500 was up nearly 0.9% when trading began, but fell sharply after the Trump administration said it may ask the Supreme Court to halt the federal trade court's ruling.

""In general, markets don't like uncertainty, because it makes forecasting more difficult,"" said Larry Tentarelli, founder of the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. ""We expect the tariff news cycle to be an extended process, which can lead to higher short-term volatility.""

A concrete tariff of 10% would still be a tax — but the surety of it could be better for markets and economies globally in the long run.

Trump 'reciprocal' tariffs reinstated for nowA U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of Trump's tariffs. Trump officials maintain that they have other options for imposing tariffs, even if they do not prevail in the case. Earlier in the day, the White House said it would seek ""emergency relief"" from the Supreme Court if the ruling was not paused.

Rocky U.S.-China negotiationsU.S.-China trade talks ""are a bit stalled,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News in an interview Thursday local time, adding that there may be a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping ""at some point."" Even though Washington and Beijing have agreed to roll back tariffs for 90 days, the U.S. has pushed ahead with tech restrictions on China, while the latter has yet to significantly ease restrictions on exports of rare earths.

U.S. market gains capped by tariff confusionU.S. stocks rose Thursday. They were buoyed by Nvidia — which climbed 3.3% on its positive earnings — but were held back from bigger gains by uncertainty around tariffs. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.28% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.39%. Asia-Pacific markets fell Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 1.15% at 1:30 p.m. Singapore time as data showed annual core inflation in Tokyo hitting 3.6% in May, the highest since January 2023.

Powell stressed rate decisions cannot be politicalFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met Trump Thursday, according to a release by the U.S. central bank. ""Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy,"" the statement said. However, Powell did ""stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook"" — essentially, that interest rates cannot be swayed by politics.

SEC dropped its lawsuit against BinanceThe SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, which was first brought in June 2023. The case had accused the crypto exchange of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes and commingling customer funds. The dismissal marks a symbolic end to the agency's crypto crackdown and comes as the Trump administration attempts to prove it's an ally to the industry.

[PRO] European sectors to play: JPMorganEuropean equities have fared better than those in the U.S. so far this year. JPMorgan analysts think the trend could continue, with non-U.S. markets trading ""increasingly more favorably"" against their American counterparts for the next 12 to 18 months. Here are the bank's preferred sectors for this period.

South Korea's Hybe opens China office amid hopes of a K-pop reversal from Beijing

South Korea's largest K-pop agency Hybe, which established its first office in China on April 2 and announced the launch on Thursday, has been preparing to enter the Chinese market since last year, a Hybe official said recently.

There have been indications that Beijing might be softening its stance on K-pop in the face of weak domestic consumption and stalled trade talks with China. And in another sign of thawing relations, China announced its decision to waive visas for South Koreans last November. South Korea followed suit in March 2025 with its plans to offer a visa exemption to Chinese visitors in the third quarter.

""In contrast with semiconductors or autos, where global trade policy directly impacts supply chains and pricing, K-pop consumption is far less sensitive to protectionist measures,"" Shinhan Securities said in a note in April.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets closed narrowly in the green on Friday, with sectors spread between losses and gains.

The Stoxx 600 index finished 0.1% higher after two sessions of declines. Investment manager M&G was the top performer, up 5% following news that Japan's Dai-ichi Life has taken a 15% stake in the business as part of a strategic partnership.

For global investors, it's been yet another week dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump and tariffs.

Among the biggest developments have been a federal trade court's blocking of Trump's universal reciprocal tariff policy late on Wednesday, which itself was then temporarily overturned on Thursday; Trump's accusation that China violated its preliminary trade agreement with the U.S., reigniting trade war fears; and market concerns over sweeping changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S.

Items on the agenda next week include figures for euro zone inflation, the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting, and Europe's largest gathering of the private equity sector at SuperReturn in Berlin. See you then.

U.S. stocks are off to a rocky start Friday. The S&P 500 is down by around 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.3% lower, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average is near flat.

President Donald Trump's accusation that China violated its preliminary trade agreement has brought fears of a prolonged trade war between the world's biggest economies back to the fore.

— Jenni Reid

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said that China had ""totally violated"" a preliminary trade agreement with America, adding that the alleged wavering from the deal ""has to be addressed.""

Under the agreement reached earlier this month, both countries said they would pause punitive tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days.

After Trump made the accusation against Beijing, the pan-European Stoxx 600 pared the gains it notched earlier in the Friday session. It was last seen trading 0.4% higher.

The personal consumption expenditures price index was expected to show a 2.2% annual rate in April, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, increased just 0.1% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.1%. The monthly reading was in line with the Dow Jones consensus forecast while the annual level was 0.1 percentage point lower.

Excluding food and energy, the core reading that tends to get even greater focus from Fed policymakers showed readings of 0.1% and 2.5%, against respective estimates of 0.1% and 2.6%.

Germany's annual inflation hit 2.1% in May approaching the European Central Bank's 2% target but coming in slightly hotter than analyst estimates, preliminary data from statistics office Destatis showed Friday.

The print compares with a 2.2% reading in April and with a Reuters projection of 2%.

The print is harmonized across the euro zone for comparability.

Germany's consumer price index has been closing in on the European Central Bank's 2% target over recent months, in a positive signal amid ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook for Europe's largest economy.

London-listed shares of investment manager M&G had popped 5.7% by 12:22 p.m. U.K. time on Friday.

The stock rose after the company announced an ""ambitious long-term strategic partnership"" with Japanese insurer Dai-ichi Life, under which the latter would acquire a 15% stake in M&G. The deal will also see M&G become Dai-ichi Life's preferred asset management partner in Europe.

M&G said on Friday that over the next five years, the agreement is expected to generate at least $6 billion of new business flows for M&G, and $2 billion of new business flows for Dai-ichi Life.

It's around halfway through the final trading session of the week, and the Stoxx 600 has gained 0.6%.

Oil and gas, healthcare and utilities stocks are leading gains, with the regional indexes representing those sectors each up by around 0.9%.

Looking at major regional bourses, Germany's DAX is seeing the biggest upward swing, with a gain of 0.9%. That puts the index, which hit a record high earlier this week, on track to end its two-day losing streak.

The dollar is the world's most commonly held reserve currency, accounting for almost 60% of global foreign exchange reserves and playing an important role in the trade of assets like oil and gold. It also acts as a peg for currencies including the Hong Kong dollar and the Saudi Riyal.

In second place, trailing far behind the greenback, is the euro, which makes up around 20% of international FX reserves.

This week, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the shifting geopolitical landscape that was driving those moves gave European policymakers an opportunity to raise the euro's status.

What happens if Section 899 in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" becomes law?

Jordon Rochester, head of fixed income and currency strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Asia at Mizuho, says that foreign investors will likely move assets and investments out of the U.S.

The latest court rulings on the legality of U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs add ""another layer of uncertainty,"" Valdis Dombrovskis, European Union commissioner for economy, told CNBC's Karen Tso on Friday.

""We are already negotiating in [a] quite uncertain environment, with things changing quite rapidly,"" he said.

On Wednesday the U.S. Court of International Trade had struck down the reciprocal tariffs the Trump administration had slapped on numerous countries in April.  The administration appealed the motion and was granted its request to temporarily pause the ruling.

Dombrovskis reiterated that the EU was committed to agreeing to a negotiated deal with the U.S. ""because EU-U.S. trade relationship is [the] largest in the world so there is lots at stake economically.""

He also described the tariff situation as ""urgent,"" citing a negative economic impact on the EU and the U.S.

— Sophie Kiderlin

European stock markets broadly moved higher despite U.S. tariffs being re-imposed by U.S. courts.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index is up 0.1%, the FTSE 100 added 0.4% and Germany's DAX is higher by 0.3%. Meanwhile, France's CAC 40 bucked the trend by declining 0.2% in early trade.

— Ganesh Rao

European stock markets are expected to open in positive territory on Friday.

Futures contracts for the Stoxx Europe 600 index point to a 0.1% gain at the open. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s FTSE 100, is set to open 0.2% higher, France's CAC 40 could add 0.1% and Germany's DAX is seen opening flat at the start of the trading day.

In Italy, shares of Metriks AI will trade for the first time on the stock exchange under the ticker MTK. The company provides artificial intelligence and analytical services and services to its clients.

Germany's newly minted government is looking to the private sector to help save the country's ailing infrastructure.

Economy minister Katherina Reiche called for a cash injection earlier this month:

""We need speed and investments, and we need private capital,"" she told CNBC. ""Of all the investments we will do, 10% of them could be done with public money, we need 90% of private sector investments.""

Germany has become riddled with infrastructure issues after a long period of underinvestment and restraints that have been linked to the country's fiscal rules, leading to crumbling bridges, broken train tracks and limited digitalization.

These issues are a top priority for the new government, according to its coalition agreement. Germany earlier this year also enshrined a 500 billion euro ($564 billion) infrastructure and climate special investment fund in its constitution, alongside an amendment to its fiscal rules that is set to increase defense spending — both of which are widely seen as potential boosts for the country's struggling economy.

""Overall, there are certainly large opportunities coming in defence and infrastructure,"" Greg Fuzesi, euro area economist at J.P. Morgan, told CNBC.

And enthusiasm for Germany's investment opportunities seems to have gone global, according to Stefan Wintels, CEO of German investment and development bank KfW.

""There is a lot of interest ... This year I was on the road in New York, London and Zurich. I observe and feel a lot of belonging to Germany. People want to invest in Germany,"" he told CNBC on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit earlier this month.

Robin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, echoed the sentiment, telling CNBC that the recent political moves could trigger a wave of private sector investment.

""There has been a notable pick-up in investor interest in German infrastructure,"" he said, noting that the mobilization of private capital would be crucial for the government ""to get a bigger bang for its buck out of the new special fund.""

On top of Berlin's plans to spend big on infrastructure, its commitment to cut red tape would also likely be attractive for investors, Winkler explained.

""In recent years, infrastructure projects in Germany have been hamstrung by excessive bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles. There is now an ambitious plan to reduce these hurdles... We expect these reforms to incentivize private infrastructure investment, too,"" Winkler said.

Berlin has also suggested it could take further measures to incentivize private investment, with economy minister Reiche telling CNBC that the government needed ""to shape programs and make offers for the private sector to invest in our infrastructure.""

Dresden's Carola Bridge has become emblematic of the state of German infrastructure. It partially collapsed in September of 2024, just minutes after the last overground train of the night had crossed it. 

According to the organization Transport & Environment, thousands of bridges across Germany are in need of work and require require investments totalling around 100 billion euros.

Elsewhere, Germany's train company, Deutsche Bahn, reportedly said it will need around 150 billion euros by 2034 to modernize, maintain and expand its existing network and boost digitalisation.

More broadly, a report from the Cologne Institute for Economic Research from May 2024 suggests 600 billion would be needed over 10 years to move the country forward on infrastructure.

Questions about infrastructure investment remain despite the political momentum, including concerns about time pressure and capacity, Jens Thiele, head of project finance and corporates at Hamburg Commercial Bank, told CNBC.

""It will be interesting to see how long approval processes will take to get projects to RTB (ready to business) stage and whether there's enough capacity to develop all these projects within such a compressed timeframe,"" he said in written comments.

J.P. Morgan's Fuzesi also noted timing is a key concern.

""Investors have asked questions about the speed of delivery,"" he said. ""In my view, ""infrastructure"" is very broadly defined and therefore constraints in one area can be overcome by doing more in another area. Ultimately, this will come down to political will,"" Fuzesi explained.

He added that it was also unclear when — and how successfully — the government's goals to simplify planning processes would become a reality.

For the German government, pressure is on to soon implement its investor-enticing promises and its investment targets.

BEIJING — U.S.-China trade talks ""are a bit stalled,"" requiring the two countries' leaders to speak directly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News.

""I believe that we will be having more talks with them in the next few weeks,"" he said in the interview around 6 p.m. ET Thursday, adding that there may be a call between the two countries' leaders ""at some point.""

After a rapid escalation in trade tensions last month, Bessent helped the world's two largest economies reach a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland on May 12. The countries agreed to roll back recent tariff increases of more than 100% for 90 days, or until mid-August. Diplomatic officials from both sides had a call late last week.

Still, the U.S. has pushed ahead with tech restrictions on Beijing, drawing its ire, while China has yet to significantly ease restrictions on rare earths, contrary to Washington's expectations.

""I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,"" Bessent said. ""They have a very good relationship and I am confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President [Donald] Trump makes his [preferences] known.""

Trump and China's President Xi Jinping last spoke in January, just before the U.S. president was sworn in for his second term. While Trump has in recent weeks said he would like to speak with Xi, analysts expect China to agree to that only if there's certainty there will be no surprises from the U.S. during the call.

China has maintained communication with the U.S. since the agreement in Switzerland, Chinese Ministry of Commerce Spokesperson He Yongqian told reporters at a regular briefing Thursday.

But regarding chip export controls, she said that ""China again urges the U.S. to immediately correct its wrong practices ... and together safeguard the consensus reached at high-level talks in Geneva.""

That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.

When asked whether China would suspend rare earths' export controls announced in early April, He did not respond directly. Restrictions on items that could be used for both military and civilian use reflect international practice, as well as China's position of ""upholding world peace and regional stability,"" she said.

This week, the Trump administration also announced it would start revoking visas for Chinese students.

""The U.S. decision to revoke Chinese student visas is fully unjustified,"" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said Thursday, according to an official English transcript. ""It uses ideology and national security as pretext.""

 Bitcoin's consolidation will give “the market time to digest recent gains” before entering a new upward trend, Derive founder Nick Forster tells Cointelegraph. 

Bitcoin could enter a period of sideways movement following a court decision on US President Donald Trump's tariffs, but that's not necessarily a bearish signal, according to a crypto analyst.

“While the recent surge to over $111,000 was notable, the current price action suggests a phase of consolidation rather than an imminent breakout,” onchain options protocol Derive founder Nick Forster told Cointelegraph.

Forster argued that a consolidation phase could be “a healthy pause” before another “significant upward movement.” He said that this pause will give “the market time to digest recent gains and gear up for the next phase.” 

Bitcoin (BTC) is up 11.59% over the past 30 days, reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 before pulling back to around $105,976 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

What the next phase may be is uncertain. Bitcoin researcher Sminston With said BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 and $330,000. Meanwhile, crypto trader Apsk32 said a more reasonable target for 2025 would see Bitcoin reach $220,000.

Forster said the US Court of International Trade's May 28 decision to block Trump's sweeping tariffs as he exceeded his authority means that “the immediate concern of trade-induced inflation has been alleviated.”

However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on May 29 that Trump could temporarily continue with his tariff regime under an emergency powers law while he appeals the trade court's decision.

Forster added that the US Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision on June 18 will “be pivotal.” 

Forster said that while the third quarter has historically been a “weaker period” for Bitcoin, it may be a different scenario in 2025. 

“The potential for favorable regulatory developments and continued institutional interest may support stronger performance in Q3,” Forster said. 

Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged a 6.03% gain in Q3, while Q4 has historically been its strongest quarter, delivering an average return of 85.42%, according to CoinGlass data.

Forster also pointed to the significant amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which haven't been reflected in the spot price. 

​​“Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, notably over $6.2 billion into BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust in May, Bitcoin's price hasn't experienced a commensurate rise,” Forster said.

In the trading week ending May 23 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total of $2.75 billion in inflows.

“This phenomenon can be attributed to the nature of ETF investments, which often involve institutional investors seeking exposure without immediate impact on spot market prices,” he added.

Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer).

Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought.

“This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin.

“If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper.

Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024.

The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

“If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world's information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock's amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read.

The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research.

“At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Czech Republic Justice Minister Pavel Blažek has resigned from his post over a bitcoin-related scandal

Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over a Donated Bitcoin Scandal

PRAGUE (AP) — Czech Republic Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned from his post over a bitcoin-related scandal on Friday.

Blažek was under fire from the opposition after his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for about 1 billion Czech koruna (more than $45 million) earlier this year.

Blažek said that he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing, but didn't want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Blažek acted with goodwill.

Blažek was a close ally of Fiala in the government, and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. It's not clear who might replace him.

The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes. The opposition has accused Blažek of possible money laundering, because it wasn't clear where the bitcoins came from. It was also not clear why the person donated the bitcoins to the ministry.

The issue has been investigated by the police organized crime unit. The scandal took place just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. The main opposition ANO (YES) party led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is predicted to win the vote.

Bitcoin slipped almost 3% Thursday as the U.S. appeals court temporarily revived President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs on Thursday, just hours after a trade court struck them down as unconstitutional.

“The judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit wrote in its May 29 ruling.

The stay, which consolidated two ongoing appeals, gives the government room to fight the U.S. Court of International Trade's earlier decision that struck down tariffs enacted under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

“If allowed to stand, this would completely destroy Presidential Power — The Presidency would never be the same,” Trump posted on Truth Social following the trade court's decision.

The legal back-and-forth over Trump's tariff imposition is injecting uncertainty into markets already grappling with inflation, interest rate swings, and geopolitical instability.

Bitcoin sank 2.7% to a daily low under $106,000, though remains up 11.5% over the past month, per CoinGecko. On Myriad, the decentralized prediction market platform launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, sentiment was broadly neutral, with 51% predicting Bitcoin would remain over $106,000 by June 1.

Ethereum (ETH) slid 3.8% to $2,621, while Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB) all posted similar declines in the last 24 hours.

“This recent court ruling is just another brick in the wall of economic uncertainty,” Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC, told Decrypt.

“Crypto's softness right now is less about a drop in demand and more about it all just being uncertainty-adjusted—policy risk, geopolitical tension, and over-the-top positioning,” she noted, pointing to the downturn across Bitcoin and major altcoins.

Alongside the appeals court intervention, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a 10-day streak of net inflows that had brought in $4.26 billion.

On Thursday, the 11 funds saw almost $347 million in net outflows, the worst single-day exit since March 11, per Coinglass data.

Fidelity's FBTC recorded the largest net outflow at $166.3 million, followed by GBTC (with $107.5 million outflows) and ARKB ($89.2 million).

Jin argued that the major spot Bitcoin ETF outflows ""should not be perceived as a panic event, but rather an institutional repricing happening in the real-time.""

Only BlackRock's IBIT posted an inflow on Thursday, adding $125 million to extend its streak to 34 consecutive trading days. IBIT has now pulled in nearly $4 billion over the past two weeks, per data from Farside Investors.

""The important thing to see this dip is in the context of the broader economy,"" Ganesh Mahidhar, investment professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt, adding that, ""ETF flows are primarily funded by retail, and this is a reflection of the retail sentiment.""

Mahidhar said policy uncertainty was dampening capital flows into risk assets but added that the outlook could shift quickly if clarity returns.

The analyst expects the sentiment to recover once trade tensions stabilize, noting that, “there is expectation among firms for this debate to settle soon around an equilibrium of either low tariffs or no tariffs, looking at a reasonable uptick in asset prices in the medium term.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Average Ethereum ETF investor ‘substantially underwater' — Glassnode","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-etf-investors-substantially-underwater-glassnode","Fri, 30 May 2025 02:57:12 GMT","

 Buyers of BlackRock and Fidelity's spot Ether ETFs are at an average unrealized loss of around 21%, says Glassnode. 

Most investors in spot Ether exchange-traded funds from asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity Investments are facing significant losses, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode.

“The average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs are now substantially underwater on their position, holding an unrealized loss of approximately -21% on average,” Glassnode said in its May 29 report.

Ether (ETH) is currently trading at $2,601, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, BlackRock's spot Ether ETF has a cost basis of $3,300, while Fidelity's is higher at $3,500. 

The last time Ether was trading above $3,000 was Feb. 2, before entering a downtrend after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose import tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico.

“We can see that net outflows begin to accelerate when the spot price dropped below this average ETF investor cost-basis level in August 2024 and January and March of 2025,” the firm added. 

Ether hit its yearly low of $1,472 on April 9, the same day Trump's sweeping global tariffs came into effect. However, Ether has climbed 44.25% over the past month, and spot Ether ETFs have recorded nine consecutive days of inflows totaling $435.6 million since May 16, as the trade war uncertainty has begun to cool down. 

Some analysts anticipate more uptrend for the crypto market after a US federal court blocked most of Trump's tariffs on May 28.

Since spot Ether ETFs launched in the US in July 2024, they have recorded $2.94 billion in total inflows. On their July 23 launch, Ether was trading at approximately $3,536.

Meanwhile, Glassnode suggested the ETFs have had little impact on Ether's spot price. “The Ethereum ETFs initially accounted for just ±1.5% of the trade volume in spot markets, suggesting a relatively lukewarm reception on launch,” it said.

Glassnode said the ETFs experienced a period of stronger growth in November 2024, where the measure increased to over 2.5%. 

This coincided with Trump winning the US presidential election during the same month, the entire crypto market entered a month-long rally that saw Ether reach $4,007 on Dec. 8.

The measure has since declined back toward 1.5%, Glassnode said.

On March 20 at the Digital Asset Summit, BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, noted that the spot Ether ETF is “less perfect” without staking.

The staking clarity from SEC could reshape ETF landscape despite one of the commissioner's backlash.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued new guidance clarifying that common forms of crypto staking do not fall under securities laws.

On May 29, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance confirmed that those participating in staking activities, including self-staking, delegated staking, custodial, and non-custodial forms, are not required to register these actions with the financial regulator.

The financial regulator stated:

“It is the Division's view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act, or fall within one of the Securities Act's exemptions from registration in connection with these Protocol Staking Activities.”

The update also addresses the use of related services. According to the SEC, providing features such as early withdrawal options, bundled rewards, slashing protection, or asset aggregation to meet minimum staking thresholds does not automatically classify these arrangements as securities offerings.

The agency emphasized that such enhancements do not alter the fundamental nature of staking under federal law.

Staking is integral to blockchain networks running a proof-of-stake () consensus mechanism, where participants lock up their tokens to validate network transactions and earn rewards.

This process has generally proven contentious over the years as the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, pursued legal actions against firms participating in the activity.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a long-time advocate for clearer crypto regulation, supported the decision. She described staking as an essential part of proof-of-stake systems, where users contribute to network security by voluntarily locking up their tokens.

Peirce stressed that regulatory uncertainty has discouraged American users from engaging with these networks, despite their importance to blockchain infrastructure.

She said:

“The Division's statement is applicable to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake network.”

However, not everyone at the Commission agreed. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw criticized the staff's interpretation, warning that it strays from legal precedent.

She argued that the Howey Test, a key legal standard used to identify securities, was overlooked in the analysis.

Crenshaw added:

“This is yet another example of the SEC's ongoing ‘fake it ‘till we make it' approach to crypto – taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.”

The SEC's position could have significant implications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, which are currently barred from staking their assets.

Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, noted that this guidance removes a major regulatory obstacle for funds seeking to stake Ethereum or other proof-of-stake assets.

However, Geraci pointed out that further clarity is still needed from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), particularly around how staking rewards will be treated within the grantor trust structures typically used by ETFs.

If staking integration into these ETFs proceeds smoothly, it could unlock a new revenue stream for investors and enhance the appeal of crypto investment products within regulated markets

Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have been gaining momentum regardless, posting nine consecutive days of inflows totaling over $480 million.

Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has announced the listing of four altcoins on its spot trading platform. 

The tokens include FLock.io (FLOCK), Forta (FORT), Pocket Network (POKT), and Livepeer (LPT). Following the announcement, all four tokens experienced significant price surges, with Pocket Network leading the rally with a triple-digit increase.

According to Upbit's official notice, the tokens will be available for trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Korean Won (KRW) pairs. Trading will begin on May 30 at 15:00 KST with FLOCK. It will be available on the BTC and USDT markets via the Base network. 

This will be followed by FORT, which will trade against the BTC and USDT pair through the Ethereum network starting at 16:00 KST. Later that day, LPT will launch trading on the KRW and USDT markets via Ethereum at 17:00 KST. 

Lastly, Upbit revealed that POKT will be listed on the KRW market through its native Pocket Network blockchain at 19:00 KST.

“Please be sure to verify the network before depositing digital assets. Deposits or withdrawals via networks other than those specified will not be supported,” Upbit stated.

Market data highlighted that the listings' impact was immediate. Pocket Network's POKT token saw the most dramatic increase, surging over 592% within minutes of the announcement. 

The rise also lifted its market capitalization from approximately $25 million to $97 million. While the gains have since cooled, POKT remained up an impressive 397.9% at the time of writing.

FLOCK token saw the second-largest uptick, climbing 49.3%, followed by Livepeer's LPT, which surged 41.5%. Both saw slight pullbacks, settling at gains of 30.9% and 29.5%, respectively. 

Lastly, FORT rose by 26.8% initially but experienced the largest crash among the four, losing most of its gains. At press time, it was only up 2.3%.

This development follows a pattern of significant market reactions to exchange listings. BeInCrypto reported that the listing of MANTRA (OM) Access Protocol (ACS), GoChain (GO), Observer (OBSR), Quiztok (QTCON), and Rally (RLY) on Upbit last week led to a similar sharp price surges.

Bitcoin was down to $104.7K on Friday morning, stabilising at $106.0K by the start of active European trading, showing a fourth day of declines.

Market capitalisation is down 2.2% today and more than 4.6% in seven days to $3.34 trillion. Bitcoin's fluctuations are creating briefly higher volatility in older altcoins: BTC's 1.7% decline contrasts with ETH's 3.5% drop, XRP's 4% weakening, SOL's 4.6% decline and Doge's 8.5% pullback.



Bitcoin was down to $104.7K on Friday morning, stabilising at $106.0K by the start of active European trading, showing a fourth day of declines. Technically, a pullback down to $103K would fit into a technical correction. Even a failure to $99K would formally satisfy the Fibonacci retracement pattern. However, even 103 looks like a strong enough local support for the coming days.



The successful Telegram bond offering allowed TON to swim against the market, adding 0.5% in one day and 5% in seven days to $3.11. The rebound from multi-month highs has no significant obstacles until $4.20 when the early April peak and the 200-day moving average combine.

Volmex warns of a possible increase in Bitcoin's price on 30 May, when $10.1 bn worth of BTC options will expire on the Deribit platform.

Coindesk noted that wallet owners with balances exceeding 10,000 BTC have shifted from buying to selling, while investors with smaller positions continue to accumulate BTC. In recent days, whales have started depositing Bitcoins back into exchange accounts, which is usually associated with preparing for sales.

BTC is benefiting from a capital flight from the gold market. Over the past five weeks, precious metal-focused specialised exchange-traded funds have lost around $2.8bn. In contrast, bitcoin-ETFs have raised $9bn over the same period.

The derivatives market is showing increasing leverage among investors. Since April, the volume of open interest in Bitcoin futures has increased by 51%, while options have increased by 126%.

Two companies, StablR and Oobit, backed by Tether, introduced stablecoins in Europe that are compliant with the EU's Cryptocurrency Regulation Act (MiCA). The launch follows the withdrawal of the issuer of the ‘stablecoin' USDT from the European market due to non-compliance with the MiCA law.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","This platform offers a blockchain solution to outdated payroll systems","https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-platform-offers-a-blockchain-solution-to-outdated-payroll-systems","Fri, 30 May 2025 15:09:24 GMT","

 Crypto has long promised faster finance, but real-world integration remains a challenge — one platform is tackling that head-on. 

Backed by major investors, Zebec Network aims to build a real-world financial infrastructure, offering streaming payroll, crypto cards and enterprise tools that bridge Web2 and Web3.

Around the world, billions of workers wait weeks to receive paychecks, navigating a financial system where delayed access to wages remains the norm. This outdated cycle ignores the realities of the gig economy and remote teams, and overlooks the simple truth that money earned should be available immediately.

Crypto was supposed to solve this. But despite its speed and programmability, many blockchain-based payroll and payment solutions remain fragmented, hard to use and disconnected from traditional finance. For global teams and everyday users, reliable bridges between Web2 and Web3 financial services are still missing.

Zebec Network was created in 2021 to address that gap. What started as a streaming payments protocol on Solana has since grown into a full-service payments and infrastructure network focused on real-world finance.

With $35 million in backing from names like Circle, Coinbase and Solana Ventures, Zebec enables real-time payroll, cross-border remittances and onchain financial tools for both crypto-native and traditional businesses. Its ecosystem includes apps for early wage access, financial tracking and treasury management.

Zebec's flagship offering is its real-time payroll system. Instead of waiting for a fixed payday, users receive income instantly, streaming their wages in near real-time. This unlocks flexibility for employers while providing immediate access to earnings for employees — a significant shift for hourly workers and gig-based professionals.

Monthly Volume Report | April 2025💰 $37M in monthly payroll volume👥 10,200+ employees served💳 9,581 cards issued across 97 countriesCard adoption continued to grow in April, and payroll volume remains strong to kick off May. pic.twitter.com/OcfhvlbyGq

To extend its reach into traditional payroll systems, Zebec created Payroll Growth Partners (PGP), an investment arm that acquires legacy payroll platforms and updates them with Web3 features. The result is services like a payroll app that lets users receive part of their paycheck in USDC (USDC) and will allow them to send it across borders with minimal friction in USDC or other stablecoins or tokens.

With acquisitions of PayBridge and School Payroll Services (SPS), Zebec is building a premier payroll service for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and educators and school administrators across more than a hundred schools nationwide in the United States.

Complementing its payroll services, Zebec's Instant Card product and Telegram App offer global on- and off-ramps for digital assets. Available in over 100 countries, users can spend crypto as fiat via Mastercard network with no transaction fees and custodial risk using the Zebec Cards.

Zebec's reach expanded further with its recent acquisition of UK-based Science Card, a mission-driven fintech serving over 50,000 students and researchers across 10 universities, including Cambridge and Aston University.

Focused on simplifying academic research spending through prepaid cards and budgeting tools, Science Card became a part of Zebec's broader mission: embedding crypto-powered finance into everyday transactions.

“Science Card's commitment to academic finance aligns perfectly with our mission to make payments seamless and inclusive,” said Simon Babakhani, Zebec's chief operating officer. Science Card founder Daniel Baeriswyl underscored this alignment, stating:

By integrating Science Card with its payroll and debit offerings, Zebec is building what Babakhani calls a “trifecta” of financial empowerment, connected through shared infrastructure.

As it builds toward a consolidated finance superapp, Zebec is also scaling its technical foundation. In addition, partnerships with Circle, Stellar, AWS and major human capital management (HCM) platforms for startups reinforce Zebec's enterprise readiness.

Zebec is helping shape a financial infrastructure that allows money to flow fast and serves billions globally. In doing so, it has the potential to set a precedent for how blockchain technology can power practical, human-centered finance at scale.

In a recent post on social media platform X, San Francisco-based blockchain behemoth Ripple led by Brad Garlinghouse stated that blockchain is changing finance.

Ripple is transforming finance and payments

Particularly, Ripple is, the post stated. And these changes are not only limited to the sphere of finance, the post adds: “Blockchain is changing finance…and just about everything else, too.” The post contains a short video advertisement of Ripple, highlighting the major spheres in which it operates: “Payments. Custody. Stablecoin.”

If it's happening onchain, it's happening with @Ripple. 

Find out how blockchain is changing finance…and just about everything else, too. pic.twitter.com/uQXFl0LC4I

Last year, Ripple created a new product, its dollar-pegged stablecoin RLUSD, officially rolling it out in December. Ripple USD allows the company to cover two of the aforementioned spheres — cross-border payments and stablecoins. RLUSD has been integrated into Ripple Payments, which used only XRP for sending payments not only within but also between countries, across borders.

Ripple's RLUSD scores new listings

The market of cross-border payments is currently evaluated at slightly under $32 trillion and is predicted to reach $50 trillion over the next 10 years. With crypto, the payments system does not need the services of multiple intermediaries (banks, payment platforms or fintech firms).

RLUSD has also been added by major crypto exchanges. Just this week, two major platforms added support for this new product of Ripple — Bitget and Euler Labs.

The XRP community responded to this bullish post with a wave of comments. Those comments were a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism. Some questioned the meaning of the post, asking fellow X users to explain its meaning: “How? What's happening? What's the context of this post?”

Another X user accused Ripple of selling XRP and thus flooding the market with them: “When you dumping more tokens?”

SEC drops lawsuit against Binance.US

As reported by U.Today, the new administration of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its lawsuit against the American branch of the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance.

In June 2023, the SEC sued Binance.US and its former then CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing them of “artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds and misleading investors about its surveillance controls,” according to Reuters.

Now, the regulator has dropped this case just as it dismissed legal cases against Coinbase and Kraken earlier this year.

300 Educators, 80,000 Students to Benefit from Landmark Blockchain Training Initiative by 2026

In a landmark move to promote digital literacy and future-ready skills, Binance Academy has partnered with Pakistan's Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT) to roll out a nationwide blockchain education initiative. The programme is set to train 300 university educators and reach over 80,000 students across 20 institutions by 2026.

The collaboration falls under Binance's Global University Outreach Program (GUOP), the world's largest blockchain education drive, aiming to cultivate a new generation of Web3 professionals. The initiative aligns with Pakistan's national digital transformation goals, positioning the country as a growing hub of blockchain expertise.

Under the agreement, university educators will undergo intensive training in blockchain fundamentals, including BNB Chain, Solidity programming, and essential Web3 concepts. Upon certification, they will independently teach the newly developed curriculum. Students completing the courses will also receive official accreditation.

“As blockchain reshapes the global financial landscape, empowering people with the right skills is essential,” said Bader Al Kalooti, Head of Growth and Operations for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia at Binance. “This partnership marks a significant step toward building a knowledgeable workforce ready to drive digital innovation.”

Welcoming the initiative, Minister of IT and Telecom, Ms. Shaza Fatima Khawaja, noted its potential impact on Pakistan's long-term economic trajectory.

“This partnership contributes to our digital transformation by positioning Pakistan as a global source of skilled blockchain talent,” she said. “By collaborating with Binance and the Blockchain & AI Technology Center, we are equipping our students to lead in the digital economy.”

Binance Academy has been active in Pakistan since 2022, having already trained over 3,000 students across 13 universities in three provinces. The new programme expands that effort on a national scale, leveraging past success to deliver widespread access to cutting-edge technology education.

Globally, the GUOP began in Kazakhstan in 2023 and has since expanded to over 20 countries. Its broader target is to impact more than 200 universities across 50 countries, reaching one million students by 2026.

The Binance Academy–MoITT partnership represents a significant step in embedding blockchain education into Pakistan's academic framework. By focusing on practical skills and global competitiveness, the initiative is expected to foster a generation of innovators prepared to lead in the digital economy — both locally and internationally.

 Adam Hollander told Cointelegraph that the number of weekly unique collectors on OpenSea has increased by 40% since January. 

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea has launched its new platform, OS2, concluding its beta phase.

The company said the updated platform allows full token trading across 14 blockchains, including support for fungible tokens on Solana. It also introduces tools that aim to enhance crosschain functionality. These changes signal a shift for OpenSea, positioning it as a more comprehensive platform beyond NFTs. 

OpenSea chief marketing officer Adam Hollander told Cointelegraph that the platform always believed in a broader idea that everything onchain should be liquid and discoverable in one place. 

“OS2 lets a collector mint an NFT on Solana, swap a gaming token on Ronin and buy a memecoin that was just created, all from a single wallet flow,” Hollander said. “Users were already juggling half a dozen DApps and bridges; we streamlined that experience.”

Despite a broader market cooling, OpenSea sees promising signs of user retention and growth. Hollander told Cointelegraph that while volumes may be down from its 2021 to 2022 peak, weekly unique collectors on OpenSea are up by 40% since January. He added: 

OpenSea's data aligns with a broader trend among NFT buyers. Unique NFT buyers rose to 936,000 in May, up 50% from April's 622,000. The month also saw NFT monthly volumes' first uptick in 2025 after going through a five-month decline. 

Hollander told Cointelegraph there's still “real power” in provable digital ownership. “Once you can prove you own something onchain, whole industries open up,” Hollander added, pointing toward real-world assets (RWAs) gaining steam. 

From April 15–22, NFTs on the RWA marketplace Courtyard, a platform that uses NFTs to tokenize physical trading cards, reached a sales volume of $20.7 million. This allowed Polygon to overtake Ethereum in weekly NFT sales. 

“New tech is usually tried in one narrow way first and then evolves into far more powerful applications,” Hollander said.

Despite being down from the peak, the NFT space can still be profitable for teams with the correct strategy, Hollander told Cointelegraph. 

“Profitability flows to businesses that keep adding real utility and options for users, which is why we remain the home for NFTs and are now investing in avenues like cross‑chain token trading,” Hollander said.

ICO Reprimands Police Force Over “Serious Shortcomings” With CCTV

An investigation into the wider case by the Independent Office of Policy Conduct is ongoing.

The Information Commissioner's Office has issued a reprimand to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) following “serious shortcomings” around its storing and handling of CCTV footage.

In February 2021, a person was held in custody for 48 hours. A CCTV system was in operation during this period.

The GMP's Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) later submitted an internal request to retain this information beyond the typical 90-day period.

When responding to a subsequent related subject access request, the police force noticed that two hours of the footage was missing.

GMP states that, despite all attempts, it is “unable to recover” the missing two hours of footage. This led GMP to self-reporting a personal data breach to the ICO in September 2023.

The ICO said its investigation assessed GMP's compliance with data protection laws related to the storage of CCTV footage.

It ruled the GMP failed to provide the complainant with their personal data, both without undue delay and by the end of the applicable period of one month.

It also failed to ensure that the appropriate technical or organisational measures were in place to protect the loss of the CCTV data it was processing.

The ICO's investigation on this front found two key failings in GMP's data protection practices.

Firstly, a misunderstanding between GMP staff, with regard to the responsibility to conduct a quality check of the retained footage.

Secondly, a lack of policies and guidelines within GMP to identify that quality checks were required or who is responsible for this task.

The ICO said that, since the incident, GMP has taken remedial action.

An investigation into the wider case by the Independent Office of Policy Conduct is ongoing.

“CCTV footage, particularly of a person at their most vulnerable, can contain highly sensitive personal data and must be properly protected,” said Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO.

“It is vital that authorities like police forces have the strictest measures in place to protect personal data to maintain public trust.

“It is clear in this case that Greater Manchester Police failed its obligation to keep the complainant's personal data safe and demonstrated serious shortcomings in how it handles CCTV footage.

“Data protection is not an afterthought; it is a core responsibility. In this case, we see the potential consequences when this responsibility is not properly adhered to.

“Police forces and public bodies across the country can learn from failures like this and ensure they have the right systems and oversight in place to prevent these mistakes from happening again.

“Public trust depends on it.”

What once seemed like a far-off concept—using a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as an alternative to traditional money—is now becoming a reality in India. Initially met with skepticism, the digital rupee has moved beyond the experimental stage and is actively being used, with the State Bank of India (NASDAQ: SBKFF), the country's largest public sector bank, leading its real-world application.

In partnership with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), SBI is delivering agricultural credit through CBDC to tenant farmers—those who cultivate land without owning it—in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha provinces. This initiative goes beyond theory, demonstrating how digital currency can streamline credit delivery, prevent misuse, and ensure that benefits reach genuine cultivators, not middlemen or landlords.

According to a Financial Express report, NABARD and SBI are running pilot projects to help landless farmers get access to agricultural loans in select districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha provinces. These pilots use the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) CBDC to offer Kisan Credit Card (KCC) benefits to tenant farmers. SBI is conducting the pilots in Andhra Pradesh's Krishna, East and West Godavari districts, and in Odisha's Cuttack and Puri districts.

The initiative aims to prevent misuse of credit by ensuring that loans are used only for farming purposes, such as buying seeds and fertilizers from approved vendors. So far, in FY2025, the report stated that over ₹4.5 crore has been sanctioned under this pilot. In Odisha, 501 tenant farmers have benefited with loan approvals, while in Andhra Pradesh 218 farmers have benefited from the loan sanctions.

The report stated that 30–40% of India's cultivated land is currently farmed by tenants who don't own the land. However, KCC loans are usually given only to landowners. Although the government has tried forming joint liability groups to offer loans to landless farmers, banks still face issues verifying who the actual cultivators are.

The report stated that under the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS), KCC holders can borrow up to ₹3 lakh (about $3,508) at a 7% annual interest rate. If the loan is repaid on time, farmers get a 3% interest discount, reducing the effective rate to 4%. From FY2026, the loan limit will increase to ₹5 lakh (about $5,847) per year. KCC loans help farmers meet working capital needs for purchasing agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, as well as for allied sectors like dairy and fisheries.










The pilot programs in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha mark a turning point. Using the digital rupee, tenant farmers receive direct benefit transfers (DBT) and agricultural loans. These funds are being used to buy essential inputs like seeds and fertilizers from authorized vendors, ensuring that credit is used for its intended purpose.

By integrating digital currency into agricultural credit systems, the initiative offers a transparent, traceable, and efficient way to support the backbone of Indian agriculture: its farmers, especially those without land titles.

The initiative also addresses long-standing gaps in rural credit delivery, particularly for tenant farmers, who have historically struggled to access formal loans due to a lack of documentation and land records. With CBDC and digital wallets, these barriers are starting to break down—signaling a shift toward more inclusive, accountable, and tech-enabled rural finance.

The RBI started its first digital rupee pilot in the wholesale segment on November 1, 2022, to settle secondary market transactions in government securities. It started the pilot with nine banks—State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank (NASDAQ: HDB), ICICI Bank (NASDAQ: IBN), Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank, and HSBC (NASDAQ: HSBC).

The retail digital rupee pilot started on December 1, 2022, and users were able to transact through a digital wallet offered by the participating banks and stored on mobile phones or devices.

In 2024, India's blockchain-based digital rupee made significant progress as the RBI achieved notable advancements with its CBDC use cases. In December 2024, former central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said India's CBDC has a lot of potential and is likely to become the future of money.

The Chinese government has announced a sweeping new ban that prohibits not just trading or mining of cryptocurrencies, but now extends to individual ownership of digital assets like Bitcoin, according to a report by Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange.

This latest action marks a significant escalation in China's historically hardline approach to crypto, reaffirming its commitment to centralising financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital yuan.

The announcement sent immediate ripples across the global cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin saw a sharp dip following the news, while altcoins—especially those sensitive to regulatory shifts—exhibited even greater volatility. However, market analysts believe the downturn could be short-lived, as per the report.

The implications of this ban are manifold. By outlawing private crypto holdings, Beijing is tightening its grip on financial flows, potentially accelerating the adoption of its central bank digital currency (CBDC). Meanwhile, the ban could prompt greater decentralisation in crypto usage across Asia, as users seek out alternative jurisdictions with more favorable policies.

Despite China's recurring clampdowns, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown notable resilience. In fact, many seasoned investors view such regulatory shocks as strategic entry points, the report mentioned.

Elsewhere, the broader crypto ecosystem continues to flourish, with progressive regulatory developments in regions like the United States, Europe, and Latin America—underscoring a global divide in digital asset governance.

The entire cryptocurrency community is on edge following the alleged kidnapping and torture of seemingly obscure Italian meme coin millionaire Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan in a Soho apartment.

While the horrific crime, for which crypto bros John Woeltz and William Duplessie have been arrested, is obviously very close to home, it's part of a rash of kidnappings in recent months.

France, in particular, has been targeted.

In Paris at the beginning of May, the 60-year-old father of a cryptocurrency millionaire was held hostage with his finger severed until his son paid a €5 million ransom.

Later this month, four armed men in the City of Light attempted to kidnap the daughter of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. Luckily, a plucky shop owner managed to thwart the attackers with a fire extinguisher. Earlier this week, 24 people were taken into custody in connection with the attempted kidnapping.

And in January in Vierzon in Central France, the co-founder of Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were abducted and held for ransom, part of which was paid by his co-founder. Law enforcement were able to rescue the couple but not before Balland had a finger cut off; ten people have been arrested. 

What has surprised me the most over the last week as the New York story unfolds is how many people in crypto have — at least until now — posted so openly about their wealth and flaunted their belongings, while, at the same time, eschewing security measures. Notable security experts I spoke with told me that as of last week, those with crypto money haven't prioritized protection.

“One of the key issues — crypto millionaires (and billionaires) are nouveau riche and got rich quickly through crypto,” Mac Segal, whose AHNA Group provides security for wealthy individuals and corporations, told me. “They're posting their homes, their helicopters, and their sneakers on Instagram — they are not cautious about their online footprint.”

Sources in the cryptocurrency world told me that only a minority of those in crypto are concerned with privacy. They won't share their names online, make purchases through trusts and are attracted to crypto because it provides anonymity. But, the majority are in it for the glitz and glamor.

Conspicuous consumption is the whole point — it's central to their motivation in getting into digital currency in the first place. 

“The euphoria of crypto is showing you were right and now you're successful,” Aubrey Strobel, Bitcoin investor and advisor to crypto companies Lolli and Trust Machines told me. She added that the combination of “ego and new money” has created a lot of problems. 

To be sure, notable billionaires like the Winklevoss twins or Michael Taylor are very protected — many of these billionaires also have wallets that [are secured by] bigger companies like Circle or Kraken, which have invested heavily in security for executives. But that isn't necessarily true on an individual level.

Advertisement

“Crypto millionaires don't think of themselves as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs,” Segal said. “They don't realize how vulnerable they are online.”

But this latest attack seems to be changing that. Even the lesser known crypto magnets are aware they may be in danger.

One crypto millionaire said recent security concerns were enough to nudge him to relocate to a state where he could legally own a firearm.

He also added that he had canceled some recent conference appearances but noted it's not unique to him, “anyone active or high profile in crypto gets threats.”

This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC's power players (and those who aspire to be).

Another source who has made their money in crypto told me that in light of the recent attacks in France, some digital coin companies based in Europe are considering relocating as their employees agitate for better safety measures.

Targeting someone who has made a lot of money from cryptocurrency is, in many ways, the perfect crime. An obscure wallet is impossible to trace and the transactions are final. 

Advertisement

One founder in crypto seems resigned to it, “This is the cost of doing business.”

But another source explained that it could cause the industry to go underground.

“You don't have to be a big figure to be kidnapped … now people are afraid they may say something at a party and they'll be targeted.”

For now, it seems like the huge displays of wealth may be diminishing and the days of bragging at parties about a meme coin success and how much money you made may be over.

Oops, something went wrong

In the past five years, Bitcoin has risen by more than 1,000%, eclipsing some of the world's most valuable companies.

It would need to rise by 57% to become more valuable than any company's current market cap.

Some bulls believe there are far greater gains to come for Bitcoin's long-term investors.

10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has hit record levels in May as the bullishness around the top cryptocurrency remains strong. After sliding earlier this year, during the past three months, it has rallied by about 30%. With a market cap of more than $2.1 trillion (as of May 29), it is far and away the most valuable digital currency. Ethereum, with a market cap of around $320 billion, is a distant second place.

The original crypto remains the default option for investors who want exposure to cryptocurrency. Some investors view it as a form of digital gold while others like it for its scarcity, or simply its overall popularity and its rising adoption.

But while Bitcoin has soared in value, its market cap has also risen beyond those of many of the best blue chip companies. Is that a sign that it is overvalued and approaching a peak, or is there still room for the cryptocurrency to go even higher?

Over the past five years, Bitcoin has generated far better returns for investors than the broad stock market. During that time frame, it has risen by more than 1,000%. The S&P 500, by comparison, has increased in value by only 91%. Even the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which gives investors focused exposure to tech stocks, is only up by 134%.

The digital currency now has a market cap that equals or exceeds some of the world's most dominant companies:

Amazon: $2.1 trillion

Alphabet: $2.1 trillion

Meta Platforms: $1.6 trillion

Currently, the most valuable company in the world is Microsoft, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. For Bitcoin to reach that level, it would need to rise by about 57% to roughly $168,000 per coin. Based on some analysts' forecasts, it will not only hit that level, but will dwarf it.

If your opinion is that in the long view, Bitcoin will change the world and revolutionize how payments are made, then your expectations could be sky high. Cathie Wood's firm Ark Invest projects that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030, which would be a gain of nearly 1,300% from where it is today.

MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is also incredibly optimistic about Bitcoin and believes that by 2045, the digital currency's price could top $13 million.

Investors, however, should remember that those two are among the most bullish Bitcoin investors, and their price targets will always be incredibly optimistic. Take them with a grain of salt. When the crypto market is on an upswing, it's easy to be bullish and expect that Bitcoin will only keep rising in value.

With Bitcoin's market cap higher than some of the top companies in the world, investors should be thinking twice about whether the cryptocurrency has become inflated in value. I believe it has, and that a significant correction could be overdue.

In a crypto world where there are thousands of coins to choose from and where Bitcoin really holds no sustainable competitive advantage over other cryptocurrencies in terms of use cases, I believe it has become grossly overvalued. Its big advantage today is that it is simply the most popular and recognizable coin, but that doesn't mean it will stay that way. Even if the crypto market as a whole may rise in value over time, that doesn't necessarily mean Bitcoin will. Newer and better coins could gain ground over time.

I wouldn't buy Bitcoin now because it's a highly speculative asset to own, but if you're inclined to do so, I'd suggest allocating only a modest amount of your portfolio toward it in order to minimize your overall risk.

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

 OFAC claims Funnull Technology purchased a code repository used by web developers and altered it to redirect legitimate websites to scam websites. 

The US Treasury has sanctioned a Philippines-based technology firm and its alleged administrator, accusing it of providing services to thousands of crypto scam websites.

Funnull Technology is linked to most crypto scam websites reported to the FBI, with victims' losses surpassing $200 million, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said on May 29. 

Funnull purchases IP addresses in bulk from cloud service providers and sells them to scammers, allowing them to host and operate clones of legitimate investment platforms, to deceive victims and steal their crypto, according to OFAC.

In one instance in 2024, OFAC said Funnell purchased a repository of code used by web developers and altered the code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites.

“These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,” OFAC said. 

The accused administrator of Funnull, Liu Lizhi — a Chinese national who managed the firm's employees — was also added to OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list as part of the sanctions. 

Generally, being on the SDN list means any assets the individual has in the US are frozen, and it's illegal for people in the US to conduct any financial transactions or have business dealings with them; violators can face civil and criminal penalties.

OFAC also sanctioned two wallet addresses it said are associated with Funnull, which blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in a May 29 report were likely “used to receive payment from cyber criminals.” 

“Additionally, the addresses show indirect exposure to various types of scams and domain management infrastructure vendors,” Chainalysis said.

Chainalysis claimed Funnell is a central player in a network known as the Triad Nexus, which includes over 200,000 unique hostnames associated with investment scams and fake trading apps. 

As a result of the sanctions, everyone in the US is now forbidden from interacting with all property and business interests where Lizhi and Funnull have a more than 50% stake, with violators possibly facing civil or criminal penalties.

In a crackdown targeting the infrastructure behind so-called “pig butchering”, the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned a Philippine-based tech company and its administrator for aiding the cryptocurrency scams that defrauded Americans of more than $200 million.

Lawmakers on Thursday accused Funnull Technology Inc. of facilitating several of these schemes by providing cybercriminals with infrastructure to host fraudulent websites.

The Treasury Department also said Liu Lizhi, a Chinese national and administrator of Funnull Technology, kept records that tracked the performance and tasks of Funnull employees, including the assignment of domain names used in cryptocurrency fraud and phishing schemes.

“Today's action underscores our focus on disrupting the criminal enterprises, like Funnull, that enable these cyber scams and deprive Americans of their hard-earned savings,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender said in a statement.


The scams did not stop at defrauding consumers. Cybercriminals allegedly also used Funnull's technology to target legitimate websites by injecting malicious code that redirected unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites.

The company reportedly bought IP addresses from global cloud providers and resold them to scammers who would then start investment fraud, phishing, and online gambling websites.

“Funnull is linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI,” the Treasury Department said. “U.S.-based victims of these scam websites have reported over $200 million in losses, with average losses of over $150,000 per individual.”

Treasury officials said the amount of losses is likely higher, but noted that many victims of scams do not report the crime.

Pig-butchering scams—named for the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter—typically begin on social media or dating apps, where scammers build trust with a target over time before striking.

The scammers then coax the victim into either sending digital assets to a scammer's account or connecting their crypto wallets to fake crypto platforms where the scammers drain their funds.

The sanctions freeze all U.S.-based assets belonging to Funnull Technology Inc. and Liu Lizhi. They also prohibit individuals and businesses based in the U.S. from doing any business with entities that Funnull or Lizhzi own 50 percent or more stake.

The Treasury Department and OFAC did not immediately respond to Decrypt's requests for comment.

It's the latest in a series of actions by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control targeting the infrastructure behind financial cybercrimes.

In October, OFAC sanctioned the Russia-based cybercrime syndicate Evil Corp, accusing the organization of orchestrating financial thefts and ransomware attacks. In March, OFAC sanctioned Behrouz Parsarad, who operated the dark web platform Nemesis.

According to OFAC, Parsarad took a cut of each transaction on the platform, which was used to facilitate the sale of millions of dollars' worth of narcotics. In April, the Treasury Department sanctioned Tron Wallets linked to Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Funnull Technology, a provider of technology for websites allegedly involved in so-called pig butchering scams, and two cryptocurrency wallets said to be linked to Huione Group.

Philippines-based Funnull also directly facilitated a scam involving virtual currencies resulting in over $200 million in victim losses, OFAC said in a Thursday press release. In addition, the company is alleged to have acquired several IP addresses from mainstream cloud service providers to sell to cybercriminals. The sanctions also cover a Funnull administrator, Liu Lizhi.

The majority of cryptocurrency investment scam websites reported to the FBI are linked to Funnull,"" Blockchain security firm Elliptic said in a blog post, which also identified the sanctioned wallets as being linked to Huione.

The wallets on Ethereum and Tron received funds directly from Huione Pay, part of Huione Group, Elliptic said. Huione was labeled as a ""primary money laundering concern"" by FinCEN earlier this month.

The two addresses received more than $4 million in total, according to Elliptic.

Thailand's financial watchdog “will block access” to five unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bybit and OKX, in the latest effort to curb illicit financial activity and protect domestic investors. The order, which takes effect on June 28, is reportedly in line with updated legal powers granted under new cybercrime legislation.

The Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC) reportedly investigated and identified Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT.COM as operating digital asset services without proper licenses. 

Regulator Flags Unauthorized Activity

The agency filed formal complaints against the platforms, citing breaches of its regulations. The SEC has reportedly submitted their details to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, which holds the power to block access under a recently enacted cybercrime law.

The SEC described the upcoming block as a preventive measure to stop the platforms from being misused for scams or money laundering activities.

“In order to protect investors and prevent the use of unauthorized digital asset trading platforms as a means of money laundering by fraudsters, in line with the intention of the Royal Decree on Measures to Prevent and Suppress Technology-Related Crimes, the SEC has submitted the above platform information to the Ministry of Digital Affairs,” the regulator said. 

The agency emphasized that assets held on unlicensed platforms are not protected under Thai law, leaving investors exposed to potential fraud and legal risk. It also directed the public to use the official SEC channels to verify licensed operators and report suspicious activities.

New Rules Bolster Regulatory Reach

The crackdown is based on powers granted by the Royal Decree on Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Technology Crimes, which came into effect on April 13. 

The legislation enables government agencies to block digital infrastructure associated with technology-related offenses, including unregistered cryptocurrency services.

Earlier this year, Thailand's Cabinet approved broader amendments to the country's digital asset rules, reflecting a growing intent to address regulatory gaps surrounding foreign and peer-to-peer crypto providers.

Early this year, the SEC announced that it was considering allowing the listing of local Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The announcement came from the regulator's Secretary-General, who mentioned that the instrument would enable individuals and institutions to invest directly in cryptocurrency.

XRP XRP$2.18 took a sharp hit overnight, shedding more than 6% in a high-volume correction that left traders on edge amid mounting global economic uncertainties. 

The drop — from $2.305 to a low of $2.163 — came as the cryptocurrency market reeled from a U.S. court ruling that overturned Trump-era trade tariffs, rattling investor confidence and wiping 3.1% off the total crypto market cap, now at $3.35 trillion.

The sell-off wasn't all bad news for XRP, though. Renewable energy company VivoPower grabbed headlines by raising $121 million to establish an XRP-focused treasury reserve — a first-of-its-kind move by a publicly traded firm. Then on late Thursday, China-based Webus International said it was raising upto $300 million in cash to eventually launch an XRP strategic reserve.

That's giving some traders hope that institutional adoption might provide a floor for the beleaguered token.

Technically, XRP saw capitulation selling in the midnight hour, with volume spiking to 174.7 million units — nearly quadruple the average 24-hour trading volume. Prices found tentative support around $2.16 before a brief rebound to $2.22. Analysts are watching key resistance at $2.23, a level that could define whether XRP can stabilize or faces further downside risk.

Hourly chart patterns revealed a V-shaped recovery attempt, but resistance around $2.204 capped gains, with prices consolidating between $2.195 and $2.196. Technical indicators warn that if XRP fails to hold $2.31 support, it could plunge another 16% toward $1.96 — a level not seen in weeks.

Technical Analysis 

With the market in flux, traders are bracing for more volatility as XRP navigates the fallout from macroeconomic uncertainty and potential opportunities stemming from growing institutional interest.

Bitcoin Cash BCH$398.82 tumbled more than 4% in the past 24 hours, rattled by a midnight selloff that saw volume spike to 35,649 units and price action plunge below key resistance levels. 

The decline — from $422.48 to a low of $403.83 — underscores the bearish sentiment gripping the crypto market amid broader economic uncertainties.

Technical analysis shows BCH struggling to find stable footing after the initial drop, with the $400.57 mark emerging as a critical support zone that has withstood multiple retests. Despite a brief recovery attempt, the $414-$415 range has turned into a formidable resistance level that has capped bullish momentum.

In the latest session, BCH experienced a short-term correction, slipping 0.84% from $405.25 to $401.86 before buyers stepped in to stem the bleeding. The bounce — accompanied by a notable 843-unit volume spike at 09:46 — pushed prices back above $404, hinting at some short-term optimism.

However, the broader trend remains bearish, with BCH trading in a descending channel defined by progressively lower highs and lows. For bulls to regain control, BCH must decisively reclaim the $410 level and break through the $414-$415 zone that has repeatedly rejected recovery attempts.

Technical Analysis 

As the dust settles, all eyes are on whether BCH can break the downtrend or whether the bearish momentum will drag it below key support levels.

 MiCA has had a limited impact on the adoption of compliant stablecoins in Europe, strengthening the need for the digital euro, Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta said. 

Former European Central Bank (ECB) official and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, touted the digital euro as a key tool for controlling the risks of increasing cryptocurrency adoption.

The Bank of Italy, on May 30, released an annual report with the governor's concluding remarks on the state of the economy. Panetta said the European Union must move forward with the central bank digital currency (CBDC) project to maintain financial stability and meet demand for secure digital payments.

“We would be remiss to think that the evolution of crypto-assets can be controlled only through rules and restrictions,” Panetta said, warning that crypto regulation alone cannot address the systemic risks posed by crypto, and that the digital euro would be key to addressing them.

Panetta also addressed the impact of the EU's crypto regulatory framework, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which entered into full force in late 2024.

“Since MiCAR came into force, only some EMT [electronic money token] stablecoins have been issued in the EU and their circulation is limited so far,” the governor stated.

He also said MiCA has not fueled any significant stablecoin developments in Italy:

MiCA has encouraged businesses to report if they plan to launch crypto asset services or intend to apply for authorization to do so, he added.

While offering some protection to European investors, MiCA has not fully safeguarded savers from the risks associated with “heterogeneity in regulatory approaches” globally, Panetta argued.

“EU citizens might be exposed to failures of platforms or issuers based in other jurisdictions that lack adequate controls or the necessary transparency and operational safeguards,” he said.

He called for stronger international cooperation and urged the EU to lead on establishing global regulatory standards.

Panetta said that only a digital euro, backed by the central bank, could offer the necessary trust and functionality in a changing payment landscape: 

“What is needed is a response that matches the ongoing technological transformation, one capable of meeting the demand for secure, efficient, and accessible digital payment instruments, all while preserving the role of central bank money,” he said. “The digital euro project stems precisely from this need.”

Panetta's remarks echo the agenda promoted by ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, who has advocated for the launch of a digital euro, citing the growing popularity of US dollar stablecoins, which now make up 97% of the entire stablecoin market.

Related: Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA

Previously a member of the ECB's Executive Board, Panetta resigned in October 2023, with his position subsequently filled by Cipollone.

Panetta's report came weeks after Tether, the issuer of the world's largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), defended its decision to skip MiCA registration for USDT in early May.

“MiCA license is very dangerous when it comes to stablecoins, and I believe that is even more dangerous for the small, medium banking system in Europe,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said at the time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin eyes ‘healthy pause' around $106K before price picks up steam","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-pause-106000-before-more-price-gains","Fri, 30 May 2025 06:24:41 GMT","

 Bitcoin's consolidation will give “the market time to digest recent gains” before entering a new upward trend, Derive founder Nick Forster tells Cointelegraph. 

Bitcoin could enter a period of sideways movement following a court decision on US President Donald Trump's tariffs, but that's not necessarily a bearish signal, according to a crypto analyst.

“While the recent surge to over $111,000 was notable, the current price action suggests a phase of consolidation rather than an imminent breakout,” onchain options protocol Derive founder Nick Forster told Cointelegraph.

Forster argued that a consolidation phase could be “a healthy pause” before another “significant upward movement.” He said that this pause will give “the market time to digest recent gains and gear up for the next phase.” 

Bitcoin (BTC) is up 11.59% over the past 30 days, reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 before pulling back to around $105,976 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

What the next phase may be is uncertain. Bitcoin researcher Sminston With said BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 and $330,000. Meanwhile, crypto trader Apsk32 said a more reasonable target for 2025 would see Bitcoin reach $220,000.

Forster said the US Court of International Trade's May 28 decision to block Trump's sweeping tariffs as he exceeded his authority means that “the immediate concern of trade-induced inflation has been alleviated.”

However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on May 29 that Trump could temporarily continue with his tariff regime under an emergency powers law while he appeals the trade court's decision.

Forster added that the US Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision on June 18 will “be pivotal.” 

Forster said that while the third quarter has historically been a “weaker period” for Bitcoin, it may be a different scenario in 2025. 

“The potential for favorable regulatory developments and continued institutional interest may support stronger performance in Q3,” Forster said. 

Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged a 6.03% gain in Q3, while Q4 has historically been its strongest quarter, delivering an average return of 85.42%, according to CoinGlass data.

Forster also pointed to the significant amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which haven't been reflected in the spot price. 

​​“Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, notably over $6.2 billion into BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust in May, Bitcoin's price hasn't experienced a commensurate rise,” Forster said.

In the trading week ending May 23 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total of $2.75 billion in inflows.

“This phenomenon can be attributed to the nature of ETF investments, which often involve institutional investors seeking exposure without immediate impact on spot market prices,” he added.

 A Harris poll commissioned by Digital Currency Group found 77% of surveyed Americans saw decentralized AI “as more beneficial to society overall.” 

Nearly three-quarters of surveyed Americans believe decentralized artificial intelligence is more likely to support innovation and progress over a centralized counterpart, according to a Harris poll commissioned by crypto venture firm Digital Currency Group (DCG).

Results of the poll of 2,036 Americans aged 18 and over released on May 29 found that 56% favored decentralized AI, and 77% saw decentralized AI “as more beneficial to society overall.”

“Three-quarters of Americans agree that the transformative power of AI would benefit more people if it wasn't consolidated in the hands of a few major players,” said DCG's policy vice president, Julie Stitzel.

Notably, 67% of respondents said that centralized AI is likely more biased, and 63% said they think centralized AI is more likely to benefit Big Tech companies rather than the average person and that it is more likely to misuse user data.

In a bid to combat Big Tech's dominance in AI, key industry players and AI experts have emphasized the importance of decentralized AI.

Chris Miglino, co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, told Cointelegraph that decentralized AI models have the chance to become bigger than Bitcoin.

Last week, Ben Goertzel, the founder and CEO of SingularityNET, stated that he believed that AI should be decentralized as far back as the 90s.

Goertzel added that if artificial general intelligence — a hypothetical AI model that is as smart as a human — is to benefit humanity, it must be decentralized from the ground up.

On May 5, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the stablecoin issuer would soon be launching an AI platform that will have integrated support for Tether's USDT and BTC payments.

Earlier this month, Thinkagents.ai, an AI agent protocol, launched a new open-source framework for building onchain agents that operate autonomously across decentralized networks. Over 70 crypto firms, including Yuga Labs and Magic Eden, have adopted the protocol.

New techniques used to analyse soft tissue in dinosaur fossils may hold the key to new cancer discoveries, according to a new study published in the journal Biology.

Researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and Imperial College London analysed dinosaur fossils using advanced paleoproteomic techniques, a method that holds promise for uncovering molecular data from ancient specimens.

The researchers discovered red blood cell-like structures in a fossil while studying a Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus, a duck-billed, plant eating ""marsh lizard"" that lived between 66-70 million years ago in the Hateg Basin in present-day Romania.

The new study used Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques to identify low-density structures resembling erythrocytes, or red blood cells, in the fossilised bone.

The findings raise the possibility that soft tissue and cellular components are more commonly preserved in ancient remains than previously thought.

By identifying preserved proteins and biomarkers, scientists believe they can gain insights into the diseases that affected prehistoric creatures, including cancer, potentially influencing future treatments for humans.

The authors of the new study highlight the necessity of prioritising the collection and preservation of fossilised soft tissue, rather than just dinosaur skeletons, as future advancements in molecular techniques will enable deeper insights into disease evolution.

A separate study had previously identified evidence of cancer in Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus, indicating its deep evolutionary roots.

Senior author Justin Stebbing, Professor of Biomedical Sciences at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ""Dinosaurs, as long-lived, large-bodied organisms, present a compelling case for investigating how species managed cancer susceptibility and resistance over millions of years.

""Proteins, particularly those found in calcified tissues like bone, are more stable than DNA and are less susceptible to degradation and contamination. This makes them ideal candidates for studying ancient diseases, including cancer, in paleontological specimens.

""Unlike skeletal structures alone, soft tissues contain proteins that provide molecular information that can reveal the underlying biological mechanisms of disease.

""Our research, using relatively underused methods, invites further exploration that could hold the key to future discoveries that could benefit humans. However, it is crucial that long-term fossil conservation efforts are co-ordinated to ensure that future researchers have access to specimens suitable for cutting-edge molecular investigations.""

Whether you are lucky enough to have a cat companion or must merely live this experience vicariously through cat videos, Felis catus is a familiar and comforting presence in our daily lives. Unlike most other feline species, cats exhibit sociality, can live in groups, and communicate both with other cats and humans, which is why they have been humans' trusted accomplices for millennia.

Despite this intimacy, there is still much that we don't know about our feline friends. Numerous behavioral studies have been conducted on other mammal species, but relatively few on cats.

In part to fill this gap, a team of researchers at Wildlife Research Center of Kyoto University are investigating the genetic background of cats' behavioral traits. Specifically, they aim to understand the association between traits like purring and variation in the androgen receptor gene. Though the exact function of purring remains unclear, previous studies have indicated that it is beneficial for feline communication and survival.

The team conducted a behavior assessment and focused on 280 cats, all of which were spayed or neutered mixed breeds kept in their owners' homes. They also collected DNA samples and analyzed the androgen receptor gene, comparing this to that of other Felidae species.

""When we called for participants, we were moved to receive responses from 265 cat owners from across Japan in just a single day, and received kind messages. This reminded us of the strong public interest in cat research,"" says first author Yume Okamoto, a doctoral student.

The results supported the thinking that a genetic basis exists for both purring and vocal communication. Cats with the short-type androgen receptor gene displayed higher owner-assessed purring scores than those with long-type gene. Additionally, short-type males exhibited higher vocalization toward humans, indicating the gene's connection to vocal communication. In contrast, female cats with the short-type gene displayed higher stranger-directed aggression.

These results may also reveal a decrease in the importance of vocal communication for cats raised by humans since kittenhood, which are typically pure-breed cats. Previous studies indicate that pure-breed cats are more likely to carry the long-type gene than mixed-breed cats. Many mixed breed cats in this study are rescued former stray cats, which may imply that rescues tend to meow more.

Comparing the cats' genes to that of 11 other Felidae species, the research team found that the leopard cat and the fishing cat, both closely related to domestic cats, possessed only the short-type, whereas domestic cats had longer types not found in the other species. These findings suggest that the emergence of these longer types may be a result of genetic changes associated with domestication and selective breeding.

These results have the potential to help us predict behavioral tendencies based on genetic data and to facilitate need-based observation and enhanced care, which could ultimately help us improve animal welfare. The research team is also planning to expand their focus to other Felidae species.

""Through our research, we hope to deepen our understanding of cats and contribute to building happier relationships between cats and humans,"" says Okamoto.

Researchers gave participants face tattoos that can track when their brain is working too hard. Published May 29 in the Cell Press journal Device, the study introduces a non-permanent wireless forehead e-tattoo that decodes brainwaves to measure mental strain without bulky headgear. This technology may help track the mental workload of workers like air traffic controllers and truck drivers, whose lapses in focus can have serious consequences.

""Technology is developing faster than human evolution. Our brain capacity cannot keep up and can easily get overloaded,"" says Nanshu Lu, the study's author, from the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). ""There is an optimal mental workload for optimal performance, which differs from person to person.""

Humans perform best in a cognitive Goldilocks zone, neither overwhelmed nor bored. Finding that balance is key to optimal performance. Current mental workload assessment relies on the NASA Task Load Index, a lengthy and subjective survey participants complete after performing tasks.

The e-tattoo offers an objective alternative by analyzing electrical activity from the brain and eye movement, in processes known as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG). Unlike EEG caps that are bulky with dangling wires and lathered with squishy gel, the wireless e-tattoo consists of a lightweight battery pack and paper-thin, sticker-like sensors. These sensors feature wavy loops and coils, a design that allows them to stretch and conform seamlessly to the skin for comfort and clear signals.

""What's surprising is those caps, while having more sensors for different regions of the brain, never get a perfect signal because everyone's head shape is different,"" says Lu. ""We measure participants' facial features to manufacture personalized e-tattoos to ensure that the sensors are always in the right location and receiving signals.""

The researchers tested the e-tattoo on six participants who completed a memory challenge that increased in difficulty. As mental load rose, participants showed higher activity in theta and delta brainwaves, signaling increased cognitive demand, while alpha and beta activity decreased, indicating mental fatigue. The results suggest that the device can detect when the brain is struggling.

The device didn't stop at detection. It could also predict mental strain. The researchers trained a computer model to estimate mental workload based on signals from the e-tattoo, successfully distinguishing between different levels of mental workload. The results show that the device can potentially predict mental fatigue.

Cost is another advantage. Traditional EEG equipment can exceed $15,000, while the e-tattoo's chips and battery pack costs $200, and disposable sensors are about $20 each. ""Being low cost makes the device accessible,"" says author Luis Sentis from UT Austin. ""One of my wishes is to turn the e-tattoo into a product we can wear at home.""

While the e-tattoo only works on hairless skin, the researchers are working to combine it with ink-based sensors that work on hair. This will allow for full head coverage and more comprehensive brain monitoring. As robots and new technology increasingly enter workplaces and homes, the team hopes this technology will enhance understanding of human-machine interaction.

""We've long monitored workers' physical health, tracking injuries and muscle strain,"" says Sentis. ""Now we have the ability to monitor mental strain, which hasn't been tracked. This could fundamentally change how organizations ensure the overall well-being of their workforce.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Atlantic ocean current unlikely to collapse with climate change","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250529124732.htm","Fri, 30 May 2025 00:14:09 GMT","

The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, commonly referred to as the ""AMOC,"" is a system of ocean currents confined to the Atlantic basin that plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate by transporting heat from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere. The AMOC also modulates regional weather, from the mild summers in Europe to the monsoon seasons in Africa and India. Climate models have long predicted that global warming will cause the AMOC to weaken, with some projecting substantial weakening amounting to a near-collapse relative to the AMOC's strength today. Such a weakening would have far-reaching consequences, including changes in regional sea level rise and major shifts in regional climate, such as colder conditions in northern Europe and drier weather in parts of the Amazon and West Africa.

However, a new study from Caltech finds that although the AMOC will weaken under global warming, it is likely to do so to a much lesser extent than current projections suggest. The team developed a simplified physical model based on fundamental principles of ocean circulation -- specifically, how density differences and the AMOC's depth are related -- that also incorporates real-world measurements of the ocean current's strength, collected over 20 years through the use of monitoring arrays and other observationally constrained products of the Atlantic basin. The researchers found that the AMOC will weaken by around 18 to 43 percent at the end of the 21st century. While this does represent some weakening, it does not represent substantial weakening that the more extreme climate model projections suggest. This new understanding significantly narrows the range of future AMOC weakening, addressing a long-standing uncertainty in climate science.

The study is described in a paper appearing in the journal Nature Geoscience. The research was conducted in the laboratories of Tapio Schneider, the Theodore Y. Wu Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering; and Andrew Thompson, the John S. and Sherry Chen Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering, director of The Ronald and Maxine Linde Center for Global Environmental Science, and executive officer for Environmental Science and Engineering.

Paleoclimate records, like ocean sediments that record past climate conditions, indicate that the AMOC has experienced weakening in the past, such as during the Last Glacial Maximum (a period about 20,000 years ago), leading to major swings in the climate that affected North America and Europe. Contemporary climate models show wide variation in their 21st century projections of AMOC weakening: Some predict substantialAMOC weakening, while others predict only a small amount of weakening. The new study, led by former graduate student Dave Bonan (PhD '25), aimed to better understand the physical mechanisms governing AMOC behavior in climate models, with the goal of reconciling these discrepancies.

The research sheds light on a long-standing and previously unexplained feature of climate models: the link between the present-day and future strength of the AMOC. Climate models that simulate a stronger present-day AMOC tend to project greater weakening under climate change. The researchers found that this relationship stems from the depth of the AMOC. A stronger AMOC typically extends to greater depths and allows changes in surface water temperature and salinity properties -- caused by global warming and freshwater input -- to penetrate deeper into the ocean and drive greater weakening. In other words, a climate model with a stronger and deeper AMOC is less resilient to surface changes and experiences proportionally more AMOC weakening than one with a shallower current. Climate models with a shallower present-day AMOC still show weakening under climate change, but to a lesser extent than those with a deeper present-day AMOC.

The new study uses this understanding to constrain future AMOC projections by building a simplified physical model and incorporating real-world measurements of the ocean current's strength. The results indicate that the AMOC will only experience limited weakening even in the highest emissions scenarios. The study suggests that much of the previous uncertainty and some of the more extreme AMOC weakening projections stemmed from biases in how climate models simulate the ocean's current state, particularly its density stratification.

""Our results imply that, rather than a substantial decline, the AMOC is more likely to experience a limited decline over the 21st century -- still some weakening, but less drastic than previous projections suggest,"" Bonan says.

Bonan emphasizes the need to examine higher-resolution climate models that also include more sophisticated processes. Higher-resolution models might offer deeper insights into AMOC behavior and improve projections of its future changes. The study provides a framework to interrogate and evaluate more sophisticated models.

While conducting this research at Caltech, Bonan was funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF-GRFP).

""The NSF-GFRP gave me the freedom to tinker and explore,"" he says. ""There is immense value in doing basic research -- it can give us a better indication of what the future might look like, as our study shows.""

The paper is titled ""Observational constraints imply limited future Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakening."" In addition to Bonan, Schneider, and Thompson, co-authors are Laure Zanna of New York University, Kyle Armour of the University of Washington, and Shantong Sun of Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China. Funding was provided by the NSF, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and Schmidt Sciences LLC.

Metrics details

Multicellular cytokine networks drive intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Interleukin-22 (IL-22) exerts both protective and pathogenic effects in the intestine, but the mechanisms that regulate this balance remain unclear. Here, we identify that IL-22 directly induces responsiveness to the IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by activating STAT3 and upregulating the OSM receptor. In turn, OSM synergizes with IL-22 to sustain STAT3 activation in IECs and promote proinflammatory epithelial adaptation and immune cell chemotaxis to the inflamed intestine. Conditional deletion of the OSM receptor in IECs protects mice from both colitis and CAC, and pharmacological blockade of OSM attenuates established CAC. Thus, IL-22 and OSM form a pathogenic circuit that drives inflammation and tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which OSM supports intestinal pathology and highlight the IL-22–OSM axis as a promising therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease and CAC.

Multicellular cytokine circuits play crucial roles in promoting intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer (CRC)1,2. Deciphering the dependencies within these circuits could offer new insights into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis and prioritization of therapeutic targets. Interestingly, cytokines implicated in gut pathophysiology can exhibit dual functionality by facilitating epithelial repair and barrier function following acute injury, while promoting inflammation, epithelial transformation and tumorigenesis in the context of chronic colitis2,3. Separating the distinct mechanisms driving beneficial versus harmful cellular responses could provide means to exploit these pathways for therapeutic benefit.

Oncostatin M (OSM) can drive pathological responses in several human diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, infections and IBD4,5,6. The expression of OSM is highly increased in the inflamed mucosa of individuals with IBD, including both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and associates closely with treatment-refractory disease7. OSM is produced by hematopoietic cells and acts on cells bearing the OSM receptor (OSMR), which is expressed primarily in tissues of mesenchymal origin (especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and to a lesser extent in epithelial cells4,5,6. OSM signaling involves several pathways, including STAT3, the MAPK cascade and PI3K, with occasional involvement of STAT1, STAT5 and potentially STAT6 (refs. 6,8). Although OSM is implicated in promoting intestinal inflammation, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined.

Here, we comprehensively characterized the OSM–OSMR axis in intestinal inflammation by applying state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing and conditional deletion of Osmr in specific tissue-resident cell populations in two independent mouse models of chronic intestinal inflammation. Our investigations reveal substantial upregulation of OSMR on epithelial cells during intestinal inflammation, both in mouse models and in tissues from individuals with IBD. Importantly, we identify OSMR as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation via its impact on epithelial cells. Notably, group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3)-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) is essential for both induction and sustained expression of OSMR expression in epithelial cells during colitis. Similarly, IL-22 drives epithelial OSMR expression in a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), in which disruption of epithelial OSMR signaling curtails tumor development. In summary, we provide new evidence for a pivotal role of the IL-22–OSM axis in intestinal pathophysiology.

To investigate the cellular components of the OSM–OSMR axis in intestinal inflammation, we used the Helicobacter hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis model9,10, which is characterized by prolonged chronic inflammation and microbial dysbiosis, reproducing key pathogenic features of human IBD11. In this model, inflammation becomes evident 3–7 days following initiation, and colitis persists for up to 30 days (Fig. 1a,b). The expression of Osm and Osmr is upregulated early in the course of intestinal inflammation and remains elevated for up to 30 days (Fig. 1c).

We next acquired single-cell transcriptomes from distinct cell populations, including colonic epithelial (EpCAM+CD45–), stromal (calcein+CD45–EpCAM–) and CD45+ immune cells (Fig. 1d). Three independent samples were profiled per condition and cell type (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b) to capture all relevant cell populations at steady-state and during peak colitis (day 22; Fig. 1e,f, Supplementary Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Table 1). Various inflammatory genes were expressed in CD45+, epithelial and stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Colitis was characterized by a significant increase in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, accompanied by prominent alterations in epithelial and stromal cells (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1c).

In healthy mice, Osm expression was detected exclusively in hematopoietic cell types, including neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, ILCs and dendritic cells (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). During colitis, the number of Osm-expressing cells in the colon increased, with inflammatory monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells being the primary sources of OSM (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Conversely, Osmr was expressed broadly among mesenchymal cell types at steady state (Extended Data Fig. 1g), whereas it was notably absent in immune and epithelial cells (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). By contrast, Osmr expression in colonic epithelial cells was clearly increased during colitis (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 2b). This expression occurred predominantly in enterocytes (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we confirmed that the expression of Osmr was upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) as early as day 3 following colitis induction and persisted for at least 28 days (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Notably, epithelial Osmr expression was upregulated in H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis but not in the absence of inflammation following H. hepaticus colonization or anti-IL-10R treatment alone (Extended Data Fig. 2c)12,13. The induction of OSMR protein expression in epithelial cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Exploring putative receptor–ligand interactions in our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset revealed strong putative interactions between enterocytes and Osm+ immune cells, particularly inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Visualizing Osmr expression in inflamed colonic tissue by in situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed strong Osmr expression in epithelial cells during H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis and its absence under steady-state conditions (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Notably, Osmr expression was more prominently upregulated in epithelial cells following colitis induction than in the lamina propria (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). Specifically, the upregulation of Osmr expression in epithelial cells correlated significantly with histopathology score, whereas this association was less clear in the lamina propria (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g).

In mucosal samples from individuals with IBD, the expression of both OSM and OSMR is increased7. OSM is primarily enriched in inflammatory monocytes and type 2 dendritic cells, whereas OSMR is most highly expressed by inflammation-associated fibroblasts14, closely resembling the pattern seen in H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis. Next, we examined the expression of OSMR in epithelial cells in human IBD using publicly available single-cell sequencing data14,15. Remarkably, OSMR was expressed by enterocytes in both individuals with UC (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and individuals with CD (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To validate this finding, we quantified OSMR expression in epithelial cells isolated from colonic mucosal biopsies from healthy individuals and individuals with IBD by using qPCR (n = 10 UC and n = 8 CD) and ISH (n = 10 UC, n = 2 CD and n = 5 healthy individuals). Our analysis revealed significantly elevated epithelial OSMR expression in IBD samples (Fig. 1m,n and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Additionally, we confirmed OSMR expression at the protein level and observed that it correlated with histopathology score (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

In summary, although expression of OSMR is primarily confined to mesenchymal cells in healthy intestinal tissue, there is a significant induction of OSMR expression in IECs under inflamed conditions in both mice and humans.

To assess the functional impact of OSMR expression in distinct nonhematopoietic cell types during intestinal inflammation, we implemented conditional deletion strategies by crossing Osmrfl/fl mice with VilcreERT2 (ΙECΔOsmr), Col1a2creERT2 (StromaΔOsmr) and Cdh5cre (EndoΔOsmr) mice to delete Osmr expression in epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells, respectively (Fig. 2a). Cell-type-specific targeting was validated by exploring expression of the deleter genes in our scRNA-seq dataset and by crossing Cre-deleter lines with a fluorescent reporter mouse (Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato (Ai9); Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). OSMR acts as a receptor for IL-31; however, unlike OSM, we did not observe an upregulation of IL-31 in either mouse or human intestinal inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 4c)7. IECΔOsmr and StromaΔOsmr mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce deletion (Fig. 2b), after which colitis was induced in ΙECΔOsmr, StromaΔOsmr and EndoΔOsmr mice using the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R approach (Fig. 2b). StromaΔOsmr and EndoΔOsmr mice showed no discernible difference in intestinal pathology compared to controls (Fig. 2c,d). By contrast, histological evidence of colitis and fecal inflammatory markers, such as calprotectin and lipocalin, were significantly reduced in ΙECΔOsmr mice (Fig. 2c–f).

a, Schematic illustrating the Osmr deletion strategy in different cell types. Cell-type-specific deleter mouse lines (VilcreERT2, Cdh5cre and Col1a2creERT2) were crossed with Osmrfl/fl mice to generate the indicated cell-type-specific Osmr knockouts. b, Timeline of tamoxifen administration and subsequent colitis induction. Respective littermate control mice (VilcreERT2–, Cdh5cre– or Col1a2creERT2– crossed with Osmrfl/fl or VilcreERT+, Cdh5cre+ or Col1a2creERT2+ crossed with Osmrfl/wt) were used for each genotype. c, Histopathological scoring 21 days after colitis induction, based on two to three independent experiments (control inflamed, n = 31; IECΔOsmr, n = 13; StromaΔOsmr, n = 21; EndoΔOsmr, n = 12).

Sample sizes are as indicated in c. e,f, Calprotectin (e) and lipocalin (f) levels in fecal samples from the indicated genotypes, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and normalized to their respective inflamed control mice. Data were pooled from two independent experiments (IECΔOsmr, n = 12; StromaΔOsmr, n = 12; EndoΔOsmr, n = 14). P values (two-tailed) were calculated by one-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon tests. g, Differentially expressed genes in colonic tissues (RNA-seq) of the indicated mouse lines compared to either steady-state mice or respective inflamed controls; WT, wild-type. h, Heat map displaying the expression of curated IBD pathway genes in colon tissue of the different mouse genotypes (n = 4–5 per group). i, Top biological processes enriched among differentially expressed genes in colon tissue from IECΔOsmr mice compared to respective inflamed controls (n = 4–5 per group); Padj, adjusted P value.

Using RNA-seq analysis of total colonic tissue, StromaΔOsmr and EndoΔOsmr mice showed an inflamed transcriptional signature compared to steady-state mice but minimal differential gene expression compared to control inflamed mice (Fig. 2g,h, Supplementary Fig. 4d–f and Supplementary Table 2). However, the inflammatory signature was reduced in ΙECΔOsmr mice compared to in wild-type control inflamed mice (Fig. 2g,h, Supplementary Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 2). KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in pathways related to cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, JAK–STAT signaling, IL-17 signaling and IBD pathways (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 4).

To confirm the relevance of epithelial Osmr deletion in intestinal inflammation in an independent colitis model, we evaluated OSM and OSMR upregulation in the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. We observed a significant increase in Osm and Osmr expression in colonic tissue following C. rodentium infection (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Similarly, Osmr upregulation in epithelial cells was detected as early as day 3 after infection and persisted up to day 21 (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Consistent with the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R model, C. rodentium infection of IECΔOsmr mice after tamoxifen treatment resulted in reduced histopathology compared to wild-type controls (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Despite this reduction in inflammation, bacterial clearance was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 5h), indicating that Osmr deletion in epithelial cells mitigates colitis severity without impairing host defence mechanisms.

Overall, these findings reveal a nonredundant pathogenic role for OSM–OSMR signaling in epithelial cells during intestinal inflammation.

Osmr expression is absent in IECs under healthy conditions but is rapidly induced during colitis (Fig. 1i–k). To identify putative drivers of Osmr expression in IECs, we subjected mouse colon epithelial organoids to various inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, Toll-like receptor ligands and H. hepaticus bacterial lysates, and analyzed gene expression changes by qPCR (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). This revealed IL-22 as the most potent inducer of Osmr expression in colon organoids (Fig. 3a). Osmr was induced within 3 h of stimulation with IL-22, suggesting that Osmr is likely a direct target gene of IL-22 signaling (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Consistent with mouse cells, IL-22 also induced OSMR expression in human colon epithelial organoids (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. P values (two-tailed) were calculated using a Mann–Whitney test for e–h, j, k and m.

IL-22 plays a complex and pleiotropic role in intestinal inflammation, not only exacerbating intestinal inflammation but also promoting epithelial cell survival and regeneration, regulating mucin and antibacterial peptide expression and providing protection in certain colitis models16,17,18. In H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis, Il22 expression was detected in intestinal tissue as early as day 3 and persisted into the chronic phase of colitis (Fig. 3b,c). Notably, Il22 was predominantly localized near the epithelial barrier in colitis, adjacent to Osmr-expressing IECs, as confirmed by ISH (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). By contrast, IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP; encoded by Il22ra2), which binds and neutralizes IL-22 (ref. 19), was not induced in H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis (Fig. 3c).

To evaluate the functional importance of IL-22 in epithelial OSMR expression, we induced colitis in Il22–/– mice (Fig. 3e). Indeed, Il22–/– mice showed reduced intestinal inflammation and failed to upregulate Osmr expression in IECs (Fig. 3e,f). Of note, the intestinal microbiota is altered in Il22–/– mice, potentially impacting colitis development20. To address this potential caveat, we blocked IL-22 using a neutralizing antibody in wild-type mice with H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis and observed similarly attenuated Osmr expression in IECs, in addition to reduced colitis severity (Fig. 3g–i). Osmr induction required direct IL-22 signaling in IECs, because mice with IEC-restricted IL-22 receptor deficiency (Vilcre+Il22ra1fl/fl)21 also failed to upregulate Osmr in the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R model, which correlated with reduced immune cell infiltration in colonic tissue and a concomitant reduction in histopathological features of colitis (Fig. 3j–l and Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Consistent with the role of IL-22 in upregulating the expression of OSMR on epithelial cells in H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis, we observed that increased expression of Osmr on IECs in C. rodentium-induced colitis was also IL-22 dependent (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j). This finding confirms the relevance of IL-22 in promoting Osmr expression in IECs across two independent models of intestinal inflammation.

Using a recently identified IL-22-induced gene signature in human IBD tissue22, we investigated whether expression of the IL-22 signature and OSMR are correlated in mucosal samples from individuals with IBD. Indeed, the IL-22 gene signature correlated strongly with OSMR expression across four independent IBD cohorts, comprising more than 868 mucosal samples in total (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g).

To determine whether IL-22 is required to sustain OSMR expression in IECs, colon epithelial organoids were subjected to IL-22 treatment, followed by IL-22 removal and subsequent assessment of Osmr expression. After removing IL-22, Osmr expression significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Similarly, a 7-day regimen of IL-22 blockade in mice with established H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis caused significantly reduced Osmr expression in IECs (Fig. 3m), demonstrating that IL-22 is required for both induction and maintenance of epithelial OSMR expression during colitis.

IL-22 predominantly activates STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 (refs. 17,23). Examination of the Eukaryotic Promoter Database revealed predicted binding sites for STAT1 and STAT3 upstream of the Osmr transcription start site. We therefore explored STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in IECs from healthy and colitic mice by western blotting and immunofluorescence and observed clear activation of STAT3, but not STAT1, under inflamed conditions (Fig. 4a–c). By contrast, STAT1 activation was observed mainly in the lamina propria (Extended Data Fig. 7a). As expected, STAT3 phosphorylation in IECs required IL-22 (Fig. 4d,e). Corroborating these results, stimulation of colonic epithelial organoids with IL-22 resulted in clear phosphorylation of STAT3 but not STAT1 (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d).

a, H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis was induced in wild-type mice for 14 days. Protein analysis of IECs from steady-state (n = 4) and H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R (n = 5) colitic mice was conducted.

Data are representative of one experiment; n = 5–7 mice per genotype. h, Mouse colon organoids generated from Vilcre+Stat3fl/fl (IECΔStat3) or Vilcre-Stat3fl/fl (IECWT) mice and stimulated with 10 ng ml–1 IL-22.

P values (two-tailed) were calculated using a Mann–Whitney test for c and e–h.

Source data

To determine the relative contribution of STAT1 and STAT3 to the induction of OSMR expression in IECs, mice deficient in STAT1 or STAT3 were subjected to H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis. IECs deficient in STAT3 failed to upregulate Osmr expression during colitis, whereas STAT1 deficiency had no discernible impact (Fig. 4f,g). Consistent with these findings, genetic STAT3 deficiency or pharmacologic blockade of JAK1/JAK2 or STAT3 inhibited upregulation of Osmr expression in colonic epithelial organoids treated with IL-22 (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7e).

In summary, IL-22 plays a critical role in driving Osmr expression in IECs both in vivo and in vitro, and this process is contingent on STAT3 activation.

IL-22 is expressed predominantly by hematopoietic cells, particularly ILCs and IL-17-producing helper T (TH17) cells17,24,25. To identify the cellular source of IL-22 in H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R-induced colitis, we evaluated lamina propria T cells and ILCs (live CD45+CD19–CD11c–Ly6G/C–F4/80–FcεRIα–TCRγ– TCRβ–) 7 days after colitis induction using flow cytometry and observed an increased frequency of IL-22+ and proliferating cells (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), consistent with increased absolute numbers of IL-22-producing cells in colitic mice (Fig. 5b). IL-22 production was significantly elevated in ILCs during colitis (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Specifically, we observed increased abundance of IL-22+ ILC3s after colitis induction (Fig. 5e,f and Extended Data Fig. 8d). IL-22 expression by intestinal ILCs is known to be controlled by the cytokine IL-23, which is comprised of two subunits, IL-12p40 (also shared with IL-12) and IL-23p19 (refs. 17,26,27). We therefore investigated whether inhibition of IL-23 signaling affects OSMR expression in IECs during colitis. Indeed, antibody blockade of either IL-12p40 or IL-23p19 resulted in decreased expression of Osmr and Reg3g in IECs, along with reduced Il22 expression in colon tissue and alleviated intestinal pathology (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8e–h). Similarly, IL-23-dependent induction of IL-22 production by ILC3s was observed during colitis in the C. rodentium model (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l).

Percentage (a) and absolute cell numbers (b), respectively, of IL-22- or Ki67-expressing CD45+Lin– (that is, live CD45+CD19–CD11c–Ly6G/C–F4/80–FcεRIα–) LPMCs in naive mice and colitic mice were assessed.

ILC subsets were identified by flow cytometry of mouse LPMCs. The ILC population was characterized as CD45+Lin– (that is, CD19–CD11c–Ly6G/C–F4/80–FcERIα–TCRα–TCRγ–) and live cells. Subsets were further defined based on transcription factor expression: ILC3 (RORγt+Lin–TCRα–TCRγ–), ILC2 (GATA3+RORγt–T-bet–Eomes–Lin–TCRα–TCRγ–), ILC1 (T-bet+Eomes–RORγt–Lin–TCRα–TCRγ–) and natural killer cells (T-bet+Eomes+RORγt–Lin–TCRα–TCRγ–). d, Pie chart showing the indicated cell populations within total IL-22+CD45+CD19–CD11c–Ly6G/C–F4/80–FcεRIα– cells in steady-state and inflamed mice on day 7 of colitis. e,f, IL-22 production by different ILC populations identified as described in c. Data are representative of two experiments; n = 12. P values are derived from Mann–Whitney U-tests. g, H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis was induced in wild-type mice. Mice were treated with anti-IL-12p40, anti-IL-23p19 or isotype control on day 0 and analyzed on day 7. Osmr (left) and Reg3g (right) expression was quantified in epithelial cells by qPCR. Data are representative of one to two independent experiments; n = 6–29 per time point. Adjusted P values were obtained using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a Dunn's multiple comparisons test. h–j, H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis was induced in Rag2–/–Rorc–/– and Rag2–/– mice for 7 days. h,i, qPCR gene expression analysis of Osmr (h) and Il22 and Ifng (i) in colonic IECs from inflamed Rag2–/–Rorc–/– and Rag2–/– mice normalized to steady-state mice. j, Histopathological scoring of colitis in Rag2–/–Rorc–/– and Rag2–/– mice on day 7 of colitis. Data are from one to two independent experiments; n ≥ 6. P values (two-tailed) were calculated using a Mann–Whitney test in a, b, f and h–j.

To further delineate the contributions of innate immune cells in driving early Osmr expression in IECs, we compared Rag2–/– mice (which lack T and B cells) and wild-type mice in the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R model. Colitis severity in Rag2–/– mice was significantly less than that of wild-type mice, consistent with a lack of adaptive immunity (Extended Data Fig. 8i), but Osmr was nevertheless induced in IECs from colitic Rag2–/– mice at levels approaching those of wild-type animals for at least 14 days (Extended Data Fig. 8j). Thus, innate immune cell-derived IL-22 is sufficient to induce sustained Osmr expression in IECs. ILC3 development requires the transcription factor RΟRγt (encoded by Rorc). Therefore, we next evaluated the functional relevance of ILC3 by inducing colitis in Rorc–/–Rag2–/– mice (which lack ILC3) and observed reduced Il22 expression in the colon, reduced epithelial Osmr expression and attenuated colon histopathology compared to Rorc-sufficient Rag2–/– mice (Fig. 5h–j).

These findings highlight the role of innate immune cells in driving IL-22-induced upregulation of OSMR expression in IECs. Additionally, these findings demonstrate that IL-22 can sustain OSMR expression in IECs independently of T cells, thus initiating the IL-22–OSM inflammation circuit.

To better characterize the biological impact of OSM on IECs during colitis, we first evaluated our scRNA-seq data from epithelial cells collected at steady-state or at the peak of colitis (day 21). IECs from colitic mice showed upregulation of inflammation-associated genes, such as Ccl8, S100a8, Saa3 and Reg3b, in addition to several inflammatory pathways, including cellular response to lipopolysaccharides, response to type 2 interferons and antigen processing and presentation (Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Prediction of potential upstream pathways identified JAK–STAT signaling as a highly probable driver of the colitis-associated transcriptional response in IECs (Fig. 6c), consistent with a potential role for cytokines such as IL-22 and OSM.

To precisely delineate the transcriptional alterations in IECs mediated by OSM, we sorted epithelial cells from IECsΔOsmr and control mice after colitis induction and subjected them to RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis identified reduced inflammatory gene expression in OSMR-deficient IECs, including response to lipopolysaccharides and type 2 interferons (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 4). As expected, JAK–STAT signaling was identified as a key upstream cascade regulating IEC response in control mice but was predicted to have low activity in the absence of OSMR (Fig. 6f). Previous studies have shown that OSM can stimulate STAT3 activation in human epithelial cell lines28. Interestingly, we observed that OSM induced a robust and sustained activation of STAT3 compared to IL-22 in colon epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Furthermore, OSMR-deficient IECs failed to maintain STAT3 phosphorylation following colitis induction (Extended Data Fig. 9b), along with a reduction in the OSM-responsive transcriptional program in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d and Supplementary Table 6).

We next compared the colitis-associated changes identified in single-cell analysis of wild-type IECs and bulk RNA-seq analyses of OSMR-deficient IECs and identified >1,700 overlapping genes (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 4). Pathway analysis of overlapping genes identified strong enrichment of leukocyte migration and chemotaxis pathways (Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that OSM may act on IECs to modulate leukocyte recruitment during intestinal inflammation. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis of colonic immune cells from IECΔOsmr and control mice following colitis induction revealed reduced infiltration of granulocytes, monocytes and T cells in IECΔOsmr mice compared to respective controls (Fig. 7d). A similar reduction in leukocyte recruitment was observed in IECΔOsmr mice during C. rodentium-induced colitis (Extended Data Fig. 5m).

The immune cell composition in the lamina propria was analyzed by flow cytometry on day 21 of inflammation. Data are representative of two independent experiments. P values (two-tailed) were calculated using a Mann–Whitney U-test comparing IECΔOsmr and control mice.

Together, OSMR signaling promotes and sustains STAT3 activation and the JAK–STAT transcriptional signature in IECs, thereby promoting intestinal immune cell recruitment during colitis.

Chronic mucosal inflammation is a well-established risk factor for CRC, with sustained STAT3 activation being a key driver of its development17,29. Our findings indicate that OSM promotes STAT3 activation and epithelial cell proliferation during colitis (Extended Data Fig. 9b and 10a). Therefore, we investigated the role of OSM in CAC using the dextran sodium sulfate/azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) model, in which epithelial transformation is initiated by administration of the procarcinogen AOM and tumorigenesis is promoted by repeated treatment with the intestinal irritant DSS, causing chronic colitis and consequent tumor growth30,31.

We confirmed increased expression of Osm and Osmr in DSS/AOM-induced colon tumors using a previously published RNA-seq dataset (Extended Data Fig. 10b)32. Osm and Osmr expression in CAC correlated with the expression of Stat3 as well as Socs3, a well-known target gene of STAT3 (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). We then confirmed that the expression of Osmr was induced in IECs during DSS colitis and in DSS/AOM-induced tumors using qPCR (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Using ISH, we observed strong Osmr expression in tumor epithelial and stromal cells (Pdgfra+; Fig. 8a). However, Osmr was expressed at much lower levels in epithelial cells from adjacent tumor-free and noninflamed tissue (Fig. 8a).

a, Wild-type mice underwent AOM/DSS-induced CAC. Colon tissues from tumor-bearing mice were analyzed by ISH for Osmr (blue) and Pdgfra (red; stromal marker); scale bars, 1,000 μm (left) and 200 μm (two insets on the right). b, Spatial transcriptomics analysis of a biopsy from an individual with CAC, including tumor tissue (red box) and adjacent normal mucosa (green box). OSM and OSMR expression was assessed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells using epithelial (EPCAM, CDH1, KRT20, MUC5B and MKI67) and nonepithelial markers (CD3E, CD4, CD14, CD68, C1QC, CD19, CD79A, PDGFRA, VIM, PECAM1, CD34 and KIT); scale bar, 1,000 μm (left) and 100 μm (insets on the right). c, Quantification of OSMR expression in epithelial and nonepithelial cells in CAC (n = 10, red bars) and healthy control (n = 3, black bars) tissue, along with nonepithelial OSM expression. d, Experimental schematic comparing CAC induction in wild-type versus Osm–/– mice.

Tamoxifen administration induced epithelial-specific Osmr deletion. i, Experimental design and representative colon images. j, Tumor burden, multiplicity and average volumes from two independent experiments. Data are shown normalized to the VilcreERT2+Osmrwt/wt group. P values (two-tailed) were calculated using a Mann–Whitney test in c–e, g and j.

We next investigated the spatial expression and distribution of OSM and OSMR in a cohort of individuals with CAC (n = 10). Consistent with findings in mice, OSMR was highly expressed in tumor epithelial and stromal cells, whereas its expression in epithelial cells was minimal in adjacent tumor-free tissue (Fig. 8b and Extended Data Fig. 10e). Quantitative analysis revealed a significant increase in OSMR expression in tumor epithelial cells compared to in nontumor epithelial cells. Furthermore, OSM expression was elevated in individuals with CAC and remained restricted to nonepithelial cells within the lamina propria (Fig. 8b,c).

To explore the role of OSM in CAC, we next used Osm–/– mice and induced CAC using the DSS/AOM model (Fig. 8d). Interestingly, OSM deficiency significantly reduced tumor burden (Fig. 8d). However, this observation could be due to an impact of OSM on colitis and tumor initiation, an impact of OSM on tumor progression or a combination of the two. To evaluate the impact of OSM on tumor progression, rather than tumor initiation, we induced CAC in wild-type mice and confirmed tumor development by endoscopy, after which mice were treated with anti-OSM or isotype control (Fig. 8e). Anti-OSM treatment reduced tumor size and number, supporting a possible role for OSM in CAC progression (Fig. 8e). Notably, STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced in colonic adenomas after treatment with anti-OSM (Fig. 8f–h).

To address the specific role of OSM in epithelial cells and modulation of tumor progression, we used IECΔOsmr mice to control temporal OSMR expression in IECs in CAC. Tamoxifen was administered after tumor initiation to both IECΔOsmr and control mice, and tumor burden was assessed after 3–4 weeks (Fig. 8i). Remarkably, Osmr deletion in IECs significantly reduced the number and size of tumors, confirming an epithelial-intrinsic role for OSMR signaling in promoting colitis-induced tumorigenesis (Fig. 8i,j).

Osmr upregulation and maintenance in the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis model depended on IL-22 and IL-12/IL-23. Notably, DSS treatment also induced epithelial Osmr expression in an IL-22-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). Next, we evaluated whether IL-12/IL-23 and IL-22 were also required to maintain OSMR expression in established CAC. We observed a correlation between Il12b and Osmr in CAC (Extended Data Fig. 10i). In wild-type mice with established AOM/DSS-induced tumors, blockade of IL-12/IL-23 (using anti-IL-12p40) or IL-22 for 1 week caused reduced expression of Osmr and Socs3 in adenoma epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 10j–l). IL-12p40 blockade similarly reduced Il22 expression in adenomas (Extended Data Fig. 10m).

Together, tumor epithelial cells express Osmr in CAC, which promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth. Finally, Osmr expression on epithelial cells in CAC is mediated by IL-22.

Unchecked inflammation exacerbates intestinal pathology and increases the risk of cancer. Inflammation promotes tumor initiation, in which normal epithelial cells acquire genomic alterations that initiate tumorigenesis and promote sustained proliferation of cancer cells2,33. Various pathways have been implicated in supporting CAC, with STAT3 activation in epithelial cells being one of the most relevant protumorigenic pathways29. Here, we identified close cooperation between two related mucosal cytokine pathways acting on epithelial cells to promote intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our data demonstrate that OSMR is broadly expressed by intestinal stromal and endothelial cells but not epithelial cells under steady-state conditions, whereas the expression of OSMR is upregulated by epithelial cells during intestinal inflammation and in CAC. Notably, ILC3-derived IL-22 was a key inducer and rheostat of epithelial OSMR expression, as OSMR expression was unstable in the absence of IL-22 both in colitis and CAC. STAT3 was essential for upregulation of Osmr in IECs, supporting the relevance of IL-22 in modulating Osmr expression. Deletion of Il22ra1 or Osmr in IECs ameliorated colitis, highlighting the individual role of both cytokines in modulating inflammation in vivo. Furthermore, deletion of Osmr in IECs after tumor development resulted in tumor reduction.

OSM plays a central role in orchestrating tissue repair and maintaining immune homeostasis through its cell-type-specific effects across diverse organ systems. It promotes epithelial and stromal cell proliferation and migration, drives extracellular matrix remodeling and supports angiogenesis, processes essential for barrier integrity and tissue regeneration4,8. However, beyond its reparative functions, OSM has also been implicated in driving inflammation, particularly in barrier tissues such as the skin, lung and intestine. Notably, in IBD, OSM emerged as the most transcriptionally upregulated cytokine in inflamed intestinal mucosa compared to in healthy individuals, highlighting its potential as both a mediator and biomarker of mucosal inflammation7,34. Increased OSM expression in the intestinal mucosa is mirrored by overexpression of its receptor OSMR, suggesting a specific role for OSM–OSMR interactions in IBD pathogenesis. Although prior studies suggested a key role for stromal cells in OSM-mediated pathology7,35, our conditional deletion experiments, in which Osmr was deleted in Col1a2+ fibroblasts and Cdh5+ endothelial cells, failed to impact acute intestinal pathology. However, due to the difficulty in achieving complete target gene deletion in these cell types, it is possible that small residual populations of OSMR+ stromal cells contributed to inflammation in our experiments. Nevertheless, our data clearly support a previously unappreciated pathogenic role for OSM–OSMR signaling in IECs, based on the protective effect of Osmr deletion in this cell type. OSMR expression by stromal cells may also be relevant for tissue remodeling and tissue repair in intestinal inflammation, which may be more evident in chronic human IBD. Indeed, OSM pathway dysregulation has been shown to play a fibrogenic role in other organs8,36.

Our data highlight a previously underappreciated role for OSMR in epithelial responses and adaptation to tissue inflammation. OSMR signaling in IECs led to sustained STAT3 activation and the expression of chemokines that regulate the recruitment of proinflammatory immune cells. Notably, OSMR expression in IECs was maintained through IL-22-mediated STAT3 activation, both of which are dysregulated in human IBD16,37. Furthermore, IL-23 was required for IL-22 expression and, consequently, for the upregulation of epithelial OSMR expression in inflamed colon tissue. These findings suggest that the IL-22–OSMR axis could be influenced by anti-IL-12p40 and anti-IL-23p19 therapies, which are currently used in IBD management38. However, recent studies indicate that in individuals resistant to anti-IL-12p40 therapy, a strong IL-22 signature persists22. This signature correlates with elevated OSMR expression, suggesting an active IL-22–OSMR–OSM inflammatory circuit in these therapy-refractory individuals. Further investigations into the activity of the IL-22–OSMR–OSM pathway in individuals receiving anti-IL-23p19 therapy could provide critical insights into the clinical relevance of targeting this axis in specific populations of individuals with IBD and CAC.

The role of IL-22 in inflammation and cancer is complex, and both cancer-promoting and inhibitory functions have been described for IL-22 (refs. 16,17). Although IL-22 promotes inflammation in the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R model, it plays an essential role in epithelial repair in chemically induced colitis and is thought to be protective in the context of acute epithelial damage16,17,18. IL-22 has also been shown to play a double-edged role in CAC; dysregulated or sustained IL-22 expression (as occurs in the absence of IL-22BP) can promote tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS- and bacteria-induced colon cancer models, but it can also promote protective DNA damage responses in the epithelium19,21,39. IL-22 can promote colon cancer via STAT3 activation in epithelial cells, a known oncogenic signaling pathway40, and we found that Osmr expression in IECs was modulated by STAT3 activation and sustained only in the presence of IL-22. Interestingly, OSMR expression by epithelial cells was required to maintain STAT3 phosphorylation. Thus, the IL-22–OSM axis is necessary to maintain STAT3 and immune cell recruitment to the intestine to maintain the pathogenic impact of IL-22 in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Targeting the OSM–OSMR axis in intestinal inflammation and CAC could separate the beneficial effects of IL-22 on epithelial cell recovery and repair from its ability to sustain harmful STAT3 activation and immune cell recruitment.

The cellular source of IL-22 and its role within this inflammatory circuit are crucial for understanding how IL-22 modulates the OSM–OSMR axis. Our findings indicate that ILC3s serve as an early source of IL-22 in the H. hepaticus + anti-IL-10R colitis model, as well as in C. rodentium infection. However, IL-22 production is not restricted to ILC3s; rather, it is derived from a diverse range of immune cells depending on the inflammatory context25,41,42,43. Although early studies primarily identified IL-17⁺CD4⁺ T cells (TH17 cells) as key producers of IL-22, subsequent research has demonstrated that multiple ILC subsets contribute significantly to IL-22 secretion. In addition to ILC3s, natural killer cell subsets, lymphoid tissue inducer cells and CD11c⁺ colonic cells activated via Toll-like receptor signaling have been shown to produce IL-22. Studies using IL-23R reporter mice further revealed that γδ⁺ T cells within the intestinal lamina propria, along with certain CD11b⁺ myeloid cells, express IL-23R and are capable of producing IL-22 in vivo44. More recently, neutrophils have also been implicated as a source of IL-22, particularly in the setting of acute DSS-induced colitis.

These findings suggest a dynamic and context-dependent regulation of IL-22 production, wherein distinct immune cell populations may contribute to IL-22 secretion at different time points during inflammation. This temporal and cellular heterogeneity is particularly relevant in chronic inflammatory conditions, where the interplay between adaptive and innate immune responses may shape disease progression. Understanding how these diverse IL-22-producing populations integrate with the OSM–OSMR axis will be critical for delineating their roles in tissue homeostasis, repair and inflammation-driven tumorigenesis.

Independent from the impact of IL-22 in inflammation and cancer, OSM has been shown to support tumor progression and metastasis in various settings45,46. OSM produced by infiltrating immune cells can alter the tumor microenvironment and expression of OSMR by tumor cells, and tumor-associated stromal cells may be important for tumor progression47. Downstream of OSMR activation, the MAPK, PI3K and STAT3 pathways can all be activated by OSM engagement and participate in tumor progression. OSM is frequently overexpressed in cancer and associates with poor prognostic features in many tumor types, including colon cancer48. However, the functional role of the OSM–OSMR axis in CAC remains unexplored, and our findings highlight the pathogenic cooperation of IL-22 and OSM in CAC. A phase 2 clinical trial investigating anti-OSMR therapy (vixarelimab) for UC is currently underway, which holds the potential to provide important clinical insights into the role of the OSM–OSMR axis in intestinal inflammation and CAC.

In summary, we show that the IL-22 and OSM pathways collaborate to promote intestinal inflammation and colitis-driven colon cancer. This axis drives persistent activation of STAT3 in epithelial cells, which promotes high expression of chemotactic factors to fuel sustained recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes during colitis. Our data thus support the concept of OSM/OSMR blockade for IBD treatment, particularly in individuals at increased risk of CRC.

All human samples were collected following written informed consent and in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (EA1/200/17). Samples were obtained from individuals undergoing intestinal resection at Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin. For ISH analysis in Extended Data Fig. 4a, additional samples were sourced from individuals at the Mayo Clinic, enrolled in an observational study approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (10-006628). Informed consent was obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines. Surgical specimens were collected, fixed in formalin and processed for histological analysis. Participant demographics are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. All samples were processed within 2–4 h of collection. Sample collection adhered to the ethical standards of the World Medical Association, including the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.

All mice used were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facilities of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the Research Institute for Experimental Medicine of Charité, Genentech or The Jackson Laboratory. The animals were housed under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 55 ± 10%. Animal experiments were performed in compliance with German animal protection laws and were approved by the responsible governmental authority (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales) under applications G 0291/18 and G 0016/18. Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River. Osmrfl/fl mice (B6;129-Osmrtm1.1Nat/J; 011081) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and genotyped via PCR to confirm the targeted allele deletion. VilcreERT2 (ref. 49), Col1a2creERT2 (ref. 50) or Cdh5cre (ref. 51) were crossed with Osmrfl/fl to establish cell-type-specific OSMR-deficient mouse lines including VilcreERT2Osmrfl/fl (IECΔOsmr), Col1a2creERT2Osmrfl/fl (StromaΔOsmr) or Cdh5cre Osmrfl/fl (EndoΔOsmr) or with B6.Cg-Gt(Rosa)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J (Ai9)52 to generate VilcreERT2 Ai9, Col1a2creERT2 Ai9 or Cdh5cre Ai9 and with Stat3fl/fl to generate VilcreERT2Stat3fl/fl. VilcreERT2 mice were crossed with Stat3fl/fl (ref. 53). Rag2–/–Rorc–/–54,55 mice were provided by the laboratory of C.R., VilcreStat3fl/fl mice were obtained from the laboratory of S. Wirtz, and VilcreIl22ra1fl/fl21, Il22[–/–56 and Stat1[–/–57 mouse lines were provided by the laboratories of A.D. and M.L., respectively.

For AOM/DSS studies, Osmrfl/fl mice were generated and bred at Genentech. The Osmr conditional knockout allele was generated using C57BL/6N C2 embryonic stem cells and established methods. A targeting vector consisting of a 5′ homology arm, a loxP site, the exon 3 region to be floxed, an FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP cassette and a 3′ homology arm was used to create the conditional knockout allele in embryonic stem cells. The Neo selection cassette was excised by FlpO treatment, leaving a residual FRT site. The conditional knockout allele was verified by sequencing before microinjection. The floxed Osmr region corresponds to GRCm39 chromosome 15: 6881773–6882254.

Mice (6–20 weeks old) were cohoused with wild-type mice (Charles River) for at least 4 weeks before colitis induction to normalize microbiota. To minimize cage effects, animals were randomly assigned to different cages before experimental procedures. Subsequent to this cohousing period, and before the onset of colitis, Col1a2creERT2 and VilcreERT2Osmrfl/fl mice and VilcreERT2Stat3fl/fl mice were administered tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) via intraperitoneal injection. The dosage was set at 75 mg per kg (body weight) administered daily over 5 days, in alignment with the protocol delineated by The Jackson Laboratory52,58. Control mice for the conditional deletion experiments were matched littermates with cre+, creERT2+Osmrfl/wt or creERT2–Osmrfl/fl and were also treated with tamoxifen.

H. hepaticus (DSMZ, 22909) was revived from glycerol stocks and cultured on blood agar (Fisher Scientific) under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C. After quality confirmation by microscopy, bacteria were transferred to tryptone soy broth (Fisher Scientific) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), 10 μg ml–1 vancomycin, 5 μg ml–1 trimethoprim and 2.5 IU ml–1 polymyxin B and grown at 37 °C and 180 rpm. Mice were orally inoculated with 1 × 108 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) on 2 consecutive days using a 22-gauge curved blunted needle and received 1 mg of anti-IL-10R (1B1.2, BioXcell) intraperitoneally on day 0 and weekly thereafter7,9.

At designated time points, mice were killed, and tissues (colon, small intestine, cecum, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes) were collected. Intestinal segments (~0.3 cm) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (SAV) for histology or stored in RNAlater (Qiagen) for gene expression analysis.

C. rodentium ICC169 was cultured overnight in LB broth (Sigma) with nalidixic acid (50 μg ml–1) at 37 °C with shaking. Bacterial concentration was assessed by optical density at 600 nm, and c.f.u. was determined by serial dilution and plating. Mice were orally infected with 5 × 109 c.f.u. in 200 μl using a 22-gauge curved blunted needle.

To quantify bacterial burden, 4- to 5-mm segments from proximal, mid and distal colon, spleen and liver were collected, rinsed in PBS/bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored in 500 μl of PBS/BSA. Tissues were weighed with sterile tweezers between genotypes. Homogenization was performed in bead-containing tubes (Qiagen) at 6.5 m s–1 for ≥60 s in 500 μl of sterile PBS. Homogenates were serially diluted, plated on LB agar with nalidixic acid and incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. c.f.u. was counted from the final three dilutions to calculate bacterial loads.

To initiate colon tumorigenesis, mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of AOM (Sigma) at a dosage of 10 mg per kg (body weight). Five days after injection, the mice began a regimen of 3% DSS (MP Biomedicals, molecular mass 36,000–50,000 Da) in drinking water, which was sustained for a duration of 5 days, followed by a 16-day period on regular water. Miniendoscopy was performed at the indicated time points to confirm tumor development, following previously described protocols59. Mice received a total of three DSS cycles, after which they were either killed for tumor evaluation or assigned to additional treatments (as described in the figure legends). In some experiments, mice were treated only with DSS to model colitis in the absence of tumor formation. Cumulative tumor burden in this model rarely exceeded 100 mm3, and no mice were killed due to large tumors or bowel obstruction. However, some mice were killed for humane reasons if body weight decreased by >20% or if they developed rectal prolapse. Tumor induction experiments were performed at Genentech, approved by Genentech's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and adhere to the NRC Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

IL-22 was neutralized via intraperitoneal injection of 450 μg of anti-IL-22 (clone 8E11, Genentech) on days 0 and 3 (7-day model) or days 7 and 10 (14-day model). IL-12p40 (C17.8) or IL-23p19 (G23-8, BioXcell) was neutralized by intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg on day 0. Control mice received isotype-matched mouse IgG1 (GP120:9709, Genentech). In the DSS/AOM model, OSM was blocked using 0.5 mg of anti-OSM (clone 24A8, Genentech)60 or IgG2a isotype control (anti-gp120, Genentech), administered twice weekly.

Histological assessment of mouse colitis was performed as previously described61. Briefly, proximal, middle and distal colon segments were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were scored (0–3) across four criteria: leukocyte infiltration, affected area, epithelial hyperplasia and goblet cell depletion. Severe disease features (crypt abscesses, edema and submucosal leukocyte infiltration) were also considered. Scores (0–12 per segment) were averaged across segments to yield a mean score per mouse. Blinded scoring was confirmed by a second blinded observer.

Histomorphological evaluation of human ileal and colonic tissues was performed according to modified scoring systems based on Naini and Cortina62 for CD and Riley et al.63 for UC. To assess the correlation between normalized OSMRβ expression and histopathology scores, histological scores were first normalized across diseases (Riley score for UC and Naini and Cortina score for CD). The normalized histopathology scores were then correlated with normalized OSMRβ expression values.

The Caco-2 and HCA-7 human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) enriched with 10% FCS (Sigma), 2 mM l-glutamine and 10,000 U ml–1 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). The HCA-7 cell line was obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures and stored by common cell repository at Genentech. Cells used in this study were negative for mycoplasma and authenticated by RNA-seq analysis. Two methods of mycoplasma detection were used to avoid false-positive/false-negative results: Lonza Mycoalert and Stratagene Mycosensor. Caco-2 cells were initially purchased from ATCC and were continuously tested negative for mycoplasma using a Lonza MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit. Both cell lines are not listed as misidentified cell lines by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Before cytokine treatment, they were starved for 24 h. Stimulation was performed with 100 ng ml–1 recombinant human OSM, interferon-γ or IL-22 (PeproTech) for 15 min. Lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (EDTA-free; Thermo Fisher). HCA-7 cells were also stimulated with 100 ng ml–1 recombinant human IL-22 or recombinant human OSM for 30 min, 24 h or 48 h, followed by analysis via MSD pSTAT3 assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics).

To assess the transcriptional program induced by OSM in epithelial cells, bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed using the HCA-7 cell line. HCA-7 cells were stimulated with recombinant human OSM for 24 h, after which RNA was isolated for bulk RNA-seq (see detailed methods below; Supplementary Table 6). Sequencing data related to HCA-7 stimulation are deposited in NCBI's GEO and can be accessed through GEO Series accession number GSE269578.

Colon organoids were generated and cultured, as described previously, with some modifications64. Mouse intestines were opened, cut into 2- to 5-mm pieces and washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4). Tissues were incubated in 10 mM EDTA, and crypts were released by pipetting and centrifugation, filtered (80 μm), pelleted and resuspended in ice-cold Matrigel GFR (Corning). Crypts (500 per 50 μl) were seeded per well in 24-well plates. After Matrigel polymerization (15 min, 37 °C), 500 μl of advanced DMEM/F12-based medium (with HEPES, GlutaMAX, N2, B27, penicillin/streptomycin, epidermal growth factor and N-acetylcysteine) was added, supplemented with colonic crypt-specific growth factors, including gastrin, nicotinamide, A83-01, PGDE2, 20% R-spondin, 10% noggin and 50% WNT-3A conditioned medium. Y-27632 (Abmole) was included for 2 days to prevent anoikis. Medium was changed every 2 days; organoids were passaged 1:2 every 1–2 weeks by mechanical shearing using a pipette tip.

Organoids were stimulated with 10 ng ml–1 cytokines for downstream assays (Supplementary Table 7). For western blot-based STAT phosphorylation, 100 ng ml–1 cytokines was used. For inhibitor experiments, organoids were pretreated for 6 h with 50 μM fludarabine, 25 μM STA-21, 2.5 μM ruxolitinib or 2.5 μM tofacitinib before cytokine stimulation.

Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and colons were collected in ice-cold PBS, opened longitudinally, cleaned and cut into 2-mm pieces. Tissues underwent sequential EDTA + DTT washes in RPMI (pH 7.4) with 10% FCS at 37 °C to detach epithelial cells. Remaining tissue was washed (RPMI + 10% FCS + 15 mM HEPES), vortexed and digested with collagenase VIII (Sigma-Aldrich). Digests were filtered, washed and separated on a 30%/40%/70% Percoll gradient (Thermo Scientific). Cells from the 30%/40% and 40%/70% interfaces were collected as stroma- and lamina propria leukocyte-enriched fractions.

Epithelial cells were isolated from pooled supernatants of two sequential EDTA incubations, washed twice in PBS and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Lysates were prepared using Qiazol (RNA, Qiagen) or RIPA buffer (protein, Thermo Scientific), depending on downstream applications.

Protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Serva) on lysates prepared in RIPA buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher). Samples and BSA standards were incubated with BCA reagent at 37 °C, and absorbance was read at 550 nm. Protein concentrations were calculated via linear regression. SDS–PAGE (10%) and transfer to PVDF membranes (Carl Roth) were performed at 200 mA for 1–2 h. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 detergent (TBST) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies to STAT1, STAT3, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling; 1:1,000 in 5% BSA-TBST). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) and imaged with a LAS-4000 minianalyzer. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ (v1.48V). Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Fecal samples stored at –20 °C were homogenized in PBS with protease inhibitors (Serva). ELISAs were performed using capture antibodies (for example, anti-mouse NGAL) and blocking with 1% BSA, followed by biotinylated detection antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Avidin (Biolegend) and TMB substrate. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Fecal calprotectin was measured using a Mouse S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer ELISA kit (RD), per the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

For surface staining, freshly isolated LPMCs and epithelial cells were prepared and allocated for both surface and intracellular staining procedures. Cells were resuspended in a master mix containing surface antibodies and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. All antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 7. After staining, cells were fixed using BD lysis buffer (BD Biosciences) and subsequently washed. Precision Count Beads (Biolegend) were added before acquisition. For Ki67 staining, epithelial cells were first subjected to surface staining, fixed with Fixation/Permeabilization buffer using the FoxP3 Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) and stained intracellularly with Ki67.

For ILC analysis, various stimulation conditions were initially tested. We selected stimulation with IL-2 (25 ng ml–1; PeproTech), IL-7 (25 ng ml–1; PeproTech), IL-23 (25 ng ml–1; PeproTech) or a combination of IL-23, IL-1β (10 ng ml–1; PeproTech), PMA (5 ng ml–1; Sigma) and ionomycin (500 ng ml–1; Sigma). An unstimulated condition was included as a control. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under these conditions, followed by the addition of brefeldin A (5 µg ml–1; Cayman, Cay11861-25) for 4 h. Surface marker staining was performed, followed by washing and staining with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin for 10 min at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience; Supplementary Fig. 6b). We observed that ILCs from inflamed mice already produced significant amounts of cytokines without stimulation, in contrast to ILCs from steady-state mice. Stimulation with the tested conditions did not alter the extent or profile of cytokine expression (Supplementary Fig. 6c). However, only the combination of PMA/ionomycin, IL-1β and IL-23 enabled the evaluation of cytokine expression in both innate cells and T cells. Therefore, this combination was used for cytokine expression analysis in the main figures of the manuscript.

For OSMRβ staining, cells were treated with Fc Block (15 min and 4 °C) and stained in FACS buffer (PBS + 0.05% BSA, 0.01% NaN3 and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) with either biotin-conjugated goat anti-OSMRβ (R&D, BAF662) for mouse or PE-conjugated anti-OSMRβ (Invitrogen, clone AN-V2) for human (30 min, 4 °C, dark). Amplification was performed using biotin–anti-PE (BioLegend, 408104) and Streptavidin–PE (Miltenyi, 130-106-789) for three to four rounds (10 min each, 4 °C). Specificity was assessed by omitting the primary antibody but including amplification. Cells were counterstained with anti-CD45 (AF700, BioLegend, clone 30-F11 mouse, HI30 human), anti-CD31 (PE-Cy7, clone 390, mouse only), anti-EpCAM (BV421, clone G8.8 mouse; APC, clone 9C4 human) and viability dyes (Calcein AM for mouse, eFluor 780 for human). OSMR expression was normalized by dividing the geometric mean fluorescence of full staining by that of the amplification-only control.

Data acquisition was performed using a BD FACSymphony or BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer, and FlowJo software (version 10.6.01) was used for data analysis.

Freshly isolated LPMCs, stromal cells and epithelial cells from colonic tissue were stained and hash tagged using anti-mouse hashtags (Biolegend; IDs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8) per the 10x Genomics protocol. Following surface staining, cells were washed with PBS + 1% BSA (pH 7.4), centrifuged (300g), resuspended in MEM + 5 mM EDTA, filtered and stained with DAPI or propidium iodide for viability. Viable cells were sorted into MEM + 50% FCS, washed and quantified for scRNA-seq. LPMCs were sorted on a FACS Aria I (BD Biosciences; 70-µm nozzle) and stromal/epithelial cells on an SH800S sorter (Sony; 100-µm nozzle). Gating strategy and purity controls are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Sample sizes for each experiment are provided in the corresponding figure captions, along with the specific statistical tests used. Data collection was not performed blind to experimental conditions, and randomization was not applied. However, histopathological scoring was conducted in a blinded manner by two independent observers. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but the numbers used are consistent with those in previous studies7. Except in cases of major experimental error, all data were included in the analyses.

For comparisons between two groups, a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test was used, either due to non-normal data distribution or as a conservative nonparametric choice. For comparisons involving more than two groups, a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's post hoc test (for paired samples) or a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a Dunn's post hoc test (for unpaired samples) was applied. Correlations between gene expression values were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05; nonsignificant results are reported as NS. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Box-and-whisker plots show the full data range (whiskers), interquartile range (box) and median (central line). Intragroup variation was not assessed. All statistical analyses, except for RNA-seq (bulk and single cell) data, were performed using GraphPad Prism versions 8 and 10.

Detailed descriptions of the methods, including RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, qPCR (including reverse transcription from low RNA quantities), ISH, histological staining for pSTAT1 and pSTAT3, single-cell library preparation and sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, data processing and analysis (including clustering, annotation and integration of public scRNA-seq datasets), RNA isolation from IBDome cohort samples and Xenium in situ analysis, are provided in the Supplementary Methods section.

Despite progress in promoting gender equity in many fields of research, including ecology, disparities remain.

In March last year,
Nature
published a preliminary analysis of the number of men and women submitting manuscripts to the journal over a five-month period. The results, as we wrote in an Editorial at the time, made for sobering reading (see

Nature
627
, 7–8; 2024

). Among corresponding authors — who take responsibility for a manuscript as it goes through the publication process — just 17% of those who disclosed their gender identified as women. We pledged to reflect on this and other findings, while continuing to gather data. We also committed to increasing efforts to diversify the pool of corresponding authors and reviewers; on the latter,
we reported some initial results two weeks ago
.






Closing the Gender Gap: Peer Review at Nature Portfolio




Closing the Gender Gap: Peer Review at Nature Portfolio


Data analysts at Springer Nature,
Nature
's publisher, have continued to track the gender of corresponding authors for
Nature
and a wider group of Nature Portfolio journals, and they report their latest findings this week (see
go.nature.com/3sm3d42
). In all, the team analysed 215,000 manuscripts submitted between January 2023 and July 2024. The analysis includes data from various stages of a manuscript's publication journey — at submission, during peer review and when a paper is accepted for publication.



For
Nature
, it turns out that women make up around 16% of corresponding authors who submit manuscripts — a percentage that is slightly lower than our preliminary result and unchanged from 2018. Women comprise some 18% of corresponding authors who submit papers to
Nature Communications
and the Nature-branded research journals. For Communications journals (this series does not include
Nature Communications
), it is 22%.



The data show that the more-selective journals in the Nature Portfolio are also those with lower shares of submissions from corresponding authors who are women. However, there are notable variations between journals, depending on the discipline. For example, for psychology and life-science journals, women comprise, respectively, 33% and 23% of corresponding authors submitting manuscripts describing original research (not including review papers). By contrast, for computer science, this proportion is 13% and for chemistry and physics, it is barely above 10%. The comparatively high rates of women in health and life sciences and low rates in physical sciences and engineering are also reflected in data from other publishers, such as Elsevier (see
go.nature.com/4kfev9e
), and correspond to different levels of women's representation in these fields.

Studies point to several reasons why fewer women than men are submitting their work. For example, more-experienced colleagues might be discouraging them from doing so (

C. Ni
et al.
Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/ppvp; 2023

). Evidence also suggests that women's contributions to research are often undervalued, or devalued, compared with those of men, leading to disparities in authorship recognition (

C. Ni
et al.
Sci. Adv.
8
, eabe4639; 2021

).


As editors and as publishers, we are on a path to changing that, through targeted editorial policies as well as outreach. Editors of commissioned content across the Nature Portfolio are actively soliciting submissions from women. This is having a positive impact: review articles had notably higher shares of corresponding authors who are women than did original-research manuscripts, our analysis showed.

Similarly, we are widening the pool of peer reviewers through an initiative that encourages more-experienced researchers to act as mentors for their early-career colleagues, which is increasing the share of women participating in peer review. We are also noticing that papers with women as corresponding authors have a slightly higher rate of being accepted for publication when reviewed by a mixed-gender panel rather than by one comprising only men. Notably, the analysis did not find evidence of a negative bias towards women in editorial and peer-review processes.

It is important to mention that no gender data are available for one-fifth of the papers submitted during the period covered by the analysis. This is because most of these articles were submitted by research administrators, who were not asked to disclose their gender. Furthermore, for the remaining manuscripts, around 10% of the corresponding authors preferred not to disclose their gender.

All things considered, the gender distribution of corresponding authors is an imperfect measure, because it does not necessarily represent a paper's complete author list. Improving the diversity of all manuscript authors, ultimately, has to be the goal. But it is not one that we as editors, or indeed publishers, can achieve on our own. It needs a concerted effort from everyone in the research ecosystem: universities, businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations. We all need to acknowledge that it is our collective responsibility to act. That means that we must recognize, firstly, the scale of the problem (it is not small). And, secondly, that this is a systemic problem, and that solving it requires a plan of action involving all stakeholders in the research ecosystem.


At
Nature
, we will continue to report on our publishing practices, which will enable us to compare findings from one year to the next. Women make up around 34% of corresponding authors globally, according to 2024 data from the European Commission (see
go.nature.com/43cazw2
). Journals should be doing a better job of reflecting the contributions that women make to research and scholarly knowledge worldwide.

For weeks, White House officials and Republican operatives weren't quite sure when, or if, Elon Musk would actually be leaving the government. Now, many Republicans are already looking to distance themselves from Musk's team entirely.

“Everybody is in a bit of a fucking pinch,” a Republican with knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. “You know, the whole thing's just fucking ridiculous, honestly. People agree with what he's trying to do. But some people just need a villain.” WIRED spoke to a number of close advisers and operatives in Trumpworld, who were granted anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic.

While Musk's step-back seems to be imminent, those inside and around the White House are unsure of what all of this means for the future of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Still, none of the Republicans interviewed for this story believe DOGE is going anywhere anytime soon. “DOGE is popular,” says a source close to the White House. “Even if Elon, personally, is less so.” (Polls show that DOGE is not popular with the public.)

The White House did not reply to requests for comment.

Today, Trump will hold a dual press conference with Musk in what appears to be an attempt at a final send-off. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,” Trump posted on Truth Social, announcing the event. “Elon is terrific!”

While Musk's supposed departure has been making headlines, to those attuned to DOGE's actual workings, the most seismic move came on Thursday, when news broke that top Musk lieutenant Steve Davis would also be leaving DOGE. Davis has worked with Musk for years, including at X and as the president of the Boring Company. He has been vital to day-to-day DOGE operations, and Sahil Lavingia, a recently fired DOGE staffer, told WIRED that Davis led the group. “Steven was the only person who was across everything,” Lavingia says.

Not everyone in Trumpworld, though, was aware of his role. “I don't know who Steve Davis is,” a well-placed source close to the White House tells WIRED, claiming that other Trump advisers and White House aides are equally in the dark about one of the most important operators in the government takeover.

White House sources do say, however, that they are looking forward to the departure of Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, whom CNN reports will be working for Musk, with one source telling the outlet she is now with Musk “full-time.” She's been one of Musk's key allies since his arrival in Washington, and, as WIRED reported in February, has been the one tasked with delivering him bad news. Both Millers have been credited with showing Musk around Washington and accompanying him to events.

“There's a lot of people in the business that work with her, or have worked with her, and she leaves bodies everywhere she's been,” a senior Republican strategist with knowledge of the situation tells WIRED.

Katie Miller did not reply to requests for comment.

Republicans also said there was a palpable sense of relief about the prospect of DOGE getting out of the headlines even before Musk and different members of his leadership team appeared to begin their departures.

A Republican donor organizer and campaign adviser tells WIRED that they're unconvinced Musk won't come back. (“Nothing is cast in stone with Trump and his people,” they say.) Nonetheless, they say, they're telling clients running for office—both new candidates and incumbents—to use Musk's exit as a chance to distance themselves from the DOGE chain saw.

“I think people need to distance themselves from it,” they say.

On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman appeared before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary. The title of the hearing was “Oversight of AI.” The session was a lovefest, with both Altman and the senators celebrating what Altman called AI's “printing press moment”—and acknowledging that the US needed strong laws to avoid its pitfalls. “We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” he said. The legislators hung on Altman's every word as he gushed about how smart laws could allow AI to flourish—but only within firm guidelines that both lawmakers and AI builders deemed vital at that moment. Altman was speaking for the industry, which widely shared his attitude. The battle cry was “Regulate Us!”

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

Two years later, on May 8 of this year, Altman was back in front of another group of senators. The senators and Altman were still singing the same tune, but one pulled from a different playlist. This hearing was called “Winning the AI Race.” In DC, the word “oversight” has fallen out of favor, and the AI discourse is no exception. Instead of advocating for outside bodies to examine AI models to assess risks, or for platforms to alert people when they are interacting with AI, committee chair Ted Cruz argued for a path where the government would not only fuel innovation but remove barriers like “overregulation.” Altman was on board with that. His message was no longer “regulate me” but “invest in me.” He said that overregulation—like the rules adopted by the European Union or one bill recently vetoed in California would be “disastrous.” “We need the space to innovate and to move quickly,” he said. Safety guardrails might be necessary, he affirmed, but they needed to involve “sensible regulation that does not slow us down.”

What happened? For one thing, the panicky moment just after everyone got freaked out by ChatGPT passed, and it became clear that Congress wasn't going to move quickly on AI. But the biggest development is that Donald Trump took back the White House, and hit the brakes on the Biden administration's nuanced, pro-regulation tone. The Trump doctrine of AI regulation seems suspiciously close to that of Trump supporter Marc Andreessen, who declared in his Techno Optimist Manifesto that AI regulation was literally a form of murder because “any deceleration of AI will cost lives.” Vice President J.D. Vance made these priorities explicit in an international gathering held in Paris this February. “I'm not here … to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago,” he said. “We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off, and we'll make every effort to encourage pro-growth AI policies.” The administration later unveiled an AI Action Plan “to enhance America's position as an AI powerhouse and prevent unnecessarily burdensome requirements from hindering private sector innovation.”

Two foes have emerged in this movement. First is the European Union which has adopted a regulatory regimen that demands transparency and accountability from major AI companies. The White House despises this approach, as do those building AI businesses in the US.

But the biggest bogeyman is China. The prospect of the People's Republic besting the US in the “AI Race” is so unthinkable that regulation must be put aside, or done with what both Altman and Cruz described as a ""light touch.” Some of this reasoning comes from a theory known as “hard takeoff,” which posits that AI models can reach a tipping point where lightning-fast self-improvement launches a dizzying gyre of supercapability, also known as AGI. “If you get there first, you dastardly person, I will not be able to catch you,” says former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, with the ""you"" being a competitor (Schmidt had been speaking about China's status as a leader in open source.) Schmidt is one of the loudest voices warning about this possible future. But the White House is probably less interested in the Singularity than it is in classic economic competition.

The fear of China pulling ahead on AI is the key driver of current US policy, safety be damned. The party line even objects to individual states trying to fill the vacuum of inaction with laws of their own. The version of the tax-break giving, Medicaid-cutting megabill just passed by the House included a mandated moratorium on any state-level AI legislation for 10 years. That's like eternity in terms of AI progress. (Pundits are saying that this provision won't survive some opposition in the Senate, but it should be noted that almost every Republican in the House voted for it.)

It's not surprising that Trumpworld would reject regulation and embrace a jingoistic stance on AI. But what happened to the seemingly genuine appetite in the industry for rules to ensure AI products don't run amok? I contacted several of the top AI companies this week and was pointed to published blogs and transcripts from speeches and public testimony, but no executive would go on record on the topic. (To be fair, I didn't give them much time.)

Typical of those materials was OpenAI's policy blog. It asks for “freedom to innovate,” meaning, in all likelihood, no burdensome laws; strong export controls; and an opportunistic request for “freedom to learn.” This is a euphemistic request for Congress to redefine intellectual property as  “fair use” so OpenAI and other companies can train their models with copyrighted materials—without compensating the creators. Microsoft is also asking for this bonanza. (Disclosure: I am on the council of the Authors Guild, which is suing OpenAI and Microsoft over the use of copyrighted books as training materials. Opinions expressed here are my own.)

The “light-touch” (or no-touch) regulatory camp does have an excellent point to make: No one is sure how to craft laws that prevent the worst dangers of AI without slowing the pace of innovation. But aside from avoiding catastrophic risk, there are plenty of other areas where AI regulation would not introduce speed bumps to research. These involve banning certain kinds of AI surveillance, deepfakes, and discrimination; clearly informing people when they are interacting with robots; and mandating higher standards to protect personal data in AI systems. (I admit I cheated in making that list—not by using ChatGPT, but by drawing on the kinds of AI harms that the House of Representatives would not allow states to regulate.)

Public pressure, or some spectacular example of misuse, may lead Congress to address those AI issues at some point. But what lingers for me is the about-face from two years ago when serious worries about catastrophic risk dominated conversations in the AI world. The glaring exception to this is Anthropic, which still hasn't budged from a late October blog post—just days before the presidential election—that not only urged effective regulation to “reduce catastrophic risks” but pretty much proposed the end of times if we didn't do it soon. “Governments should urgently take action on AI policy in the next eighteen months,” it read, in boldface. “The window for proactive risk prevention is closing fast.”

In this environment, there is virtually no chance that Anthropic will get its wish. Maybe it won't matter: It could be that fears of an AI apocalypse are way overblown. Take note, though, that the leaders of just about every single major AI company are predicting that in a few years, we will realize artificial general intelligence. When you press them, they will also admit that controlling AI, or even understanding how it works, is a work in progress. Nonetheless, the focus is now on hastening the push to more powerful AI—ostensibly to beat China.

Chinese people have made it clear they don't want to report to robot overlords any more than we do. America's top geopolitical rival has also demonstrated some interest in imposing strong safety standards. But if the United States insists on eschewing guardrails and going full-speed toward a future that it can't contain, our biggest competitor will have no choice but to do the same. May the best hard takeoff win.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","WIRED Talked to a Fired DOGE Staffer About Who Was Really in Charge","https://www.wired.com/story/fired-doge-staffer-who-is-in-charge/","Fri, 30 May 2025 00:07:00 GMT","

With Elon Musk and other leaders of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) purportedly on their way out, WIRED spoke with a fired DOGE staffer about his experience, how the group communicates, who appears to be in charge—and what might be coming next.

Earlier this week, Sahil Lavingia published a blog post on his personal website detailing his 55-day stint within DOGE. Lavingia, who WIRED first identified as a member of DOGE at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is the CEO of Gumroad, a platform that helps creatives sell their work.

In his post, Lavingia describes the kinds of projects he worked on at the VA and his overall impressions of working with DOGE. Lavingia described the DOGE operations as “disorganized,” with little information sharing across different teams.

This could all change soon, as Musk has spent the last few weeks saying that he is going to be largely leaving his DOGE duties behind. Two of his closest lieutenants, Steve Davis and Nicole Hollander, appear to be departing as well. Davis, who has worked with Musk for years, including at X and as the CEO of the Boring Company, has been integral to the day-to-day operations of DOGE.

Without Davis at the helm, Lavingia says, it's unclear who will lead DOGE—and in what direction.

“Steven was the only person who was across everything,” Lavingia tells WIRED.

Musk, Davis, and Hollander did not reply to WIRED's requests for comment.

Lavingia told WIRED that Davis appeared to be the person directing most of the DOGE activities at different agencies, and was in direct contact with all the DOGE members at various points. Generally, in Lavingia's experience, that correspondence happened using the encrypted messaging app Signal.

Experts and lawmakers have previously warned that using Signal for official government communications could violate laws that require government employees to maintain records of all communications. Earlier this year, then national security adviser Mike Waltz accidentally added the editor of The Atlantic to a Signal group chat where Waltz and other senior officials in the Trump administration discussed imminent and sensitive military actions in Yemen.

Davis, Lavingia says, would message priorities to whoever was the DOGE team lead at a given agency. At the VA, Lavingia tells WIRED, Davis instructed the DOGE team to prioritize reviewing contracts for cancellation. Davis would message Lavingia periodically to check in about how his work was going, but would rarely reply to Lavingia's responses, he says.

According to Lavingia, in late March, Davis was present at a meeting with Musk, called an “E meeting.” Many of the DOGE workers he encountered at that meeting, Lavingia says, appeared mostly focused on executing tasks that Davis had assigned to them.

Two other Musk loyalists, Anthony Armstrong and Baris Akis, were present at the “E meeting.” These three men— Armstrong, Akis, and Davis—appeared to be the people in charge, Lavingia says.

“Steven is basically like a chief of staff or body man when Elon was there,” he says.

Akis, the cofounder and president of venture capital firm Human Capital, is a longtime Musk associate. He is not a US citizen. In February, The Atlantic reported that Trump advisers had prevented Musk from hiring Akis into DOGE because he was born in Turkey, though he has a green card. US legal regulations, The Atlantic noted, generally do not allow for non-Americans to be employed by the government.

Lavingia says, however, that Akis was the person who helped bring him into DOGE, messaging him to let him know that he would be assigned to work at the VA and connecting him with the DOGE team lead for the agency.

Akis did not respond to WIRED's request for comment, and WIRED was not able to review messages between Lavingia and Akis. The Atlantic noted in its February report that Akis also did not respond to their request for comment.

In a live recording with the All-In Podcast earlier this month, Antonio Gracias, another Musk ally and a known DOGE affiliate, appeared to confirm Akis' presence and said that “Baris and Emily do the recruiting” for DOGE. (Lavingia could not confirm who the mention of “Emily” referred to in the podcast.)

Armstrong, who helped advise Musk on his purchase of Twitter, has mostly focused his efforts at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), one of the first departments taken over by DOGE.

Davis has long been an important part of Musk's inner circle. When Musk took over Twitter in 2022, Davis and his partner, Hollander, slept in the company's offices with their newborn child as they helped Musk fire thousands of people and shrink the company's footprint. Hollander also joined Davis in the DOGE effort, working at the General Service Administration. Even before Trump took office, Davis led the recruitment efforts for DOGE, then based out of SpaceX's DC offices. He recruited one young engineer who is now running a “DOGE orthogonal” AI startup, according to previous WIRED reporting. Davis was also instrumental in pressing for access to sensitive data at the Social Security Administration (SSA) for one of the group's young engineers, Akash Bobba.

Musk and Davis were what is known as special government employees, who are able to work in government for a limited period of time, up to 130 days. In his blog post, Lavingia writes that DOGE was a way for the Trump administration to distance itself from otherwise unpopular decisions. “In reality, DOGE had no direct authority. The real decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise to let DOGE act as the ‘fall guy' for unpopular decisions,” he wrote on his website earlier this week.

Without Musk and Davis, Lavingia says he has “no idea” what direction DOGE will take. And as for the young engineers who followed Musk and Davis into government: “I assume they'll leave soon too.”

We tested more than 20 pairs of sweatpants and looked for distinguishing details, a comfortable fit, durability, and how wearable the pants were based on various scenarios. We wore each pair at least a few times and washed and dried them as well.

Meet the Testers

Louryn Strampe is 5'1"", has a curvy hourglass figure, and has an equally proportioned (though close to the ground) torso and legs.

Julian Chokkattu is 6'4"", is comfortably padded, and has long legs.

I love these sweatpants so much, I wrote a whole story about them. They fit like a dream, with a tapered silhouette that's tight around the ankles and bum, but loose around the thighs and calves. They're super flattering, and the four-way stretch Dreamknit fabric is exquisitely soft (and made with recycled materials!). The slash pockets are deep enough to hold my phone and not too visible whether they're full or empty, and the flat drawstring stays tied all throughout the day. They don't stretch out or lose their shape, and they hold up well in the wash. (I've had one pair for five years and counting.) They're breathable yet warm—they don't get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter. I think you can dress them up or down and wear the waist high or low. I'm short and curvy, but friends and colleagues who are taller and skinnier than I am have also loved these pants. They're everything a pair of joggers should be. —Louryn Strampe

Juicy Couture

Amazon (Track Suit)

Juicy Couture (Pants Only)

Juicy Couture track suits are perhaps the most recognizable fashion trend of the early oughts, which I'm pleased to inform you is very much back again (if it ever really left in the first place). These velour sweats are soft and velvety to the touch, and of course, they have a big logo rhinestoned right across the butt. The waistline works well both mid-rise and low-rise, and the drawstring has metal-tipped ends (and they're stamped with the Juicy Couture logo as well). The silhouette is slightly tight across the hips and rear and looser toward the calves. The fabric is slightly heavy and the pants keep me warm on chilly days. I think they'd be too heavy for summer sun, but nevertheless I may still try. I love the wide array of colors, I love the silky-feeling lining, and I love how many heads I turn everywhere I go when I wear them. I think this is best paired with the matching hoodie for a truly iconic fit. Just make sure you wash them inside out on a cold cycle and tumble dry low to preserve the decorations. (I've washed my set many times and haven't lost a single rhinestone.) —Louryn Strampe

Roots

Roots (Cloud Leg Straight)

Roots (1973 Athletics)

When I hop into sweatpants, I want to feel like I'm on cloud nine, and both of these sweatpants from Canada-based Roots deliver exactly that sensation (mind you, the pants are made in Cambodia). The reason for that is the brushed fleece on the inside, which is super soft against the skin. The Roots Athletics Sweatpant (64 percent organic cotton, 36 percent recycled polyester fleece) is the more traditional design, with a classic fit that extends down close to my ankles on my 6'4"" frame. But I like the Cloud Straight Leg even more. No skin-tight pants here! These are airy, whimsical, and tremendously soft. Made from 80 percent organic cotton and 20 percent recycled polyester fleece, the pants are smooth but plush. They do get a bit warm for the shoulder seasons and summer, but out of the many sweatpants I've tested, I'm happiest with these. —Julian Chokkattu

Lululemon

Lululemon

If millennials are known for skinny jeans, Gen Z is known for the exact opposite of that. Think big, interesting silhouettes, varying waist heights, and different colors and washes. These trendy Lululemon cargos were a bit out of my early-thirties comfort zone. But they're awesome. They've got a mid-rise fit that shows off just the right amount of tummy if you pair them with a crop top, and they're roomy throughout the hips and thighs. The two-way stretch fabric is water-repellent and slightly ribbed, with a lightweight feel that's perfect for summer (or sweating in a dance studio, presumably.) There are pockets galore, including hand pockets with a hidden card sleeve, back pockets, and cargo pockets. All of these pockets are useful, and my phone has yet to fall out of any of them.

The waist has a drawstring, and the hems are cinchable to let you adjust how tight they are—a feature I appreciate as a shortie, since I can cinch them up if I don't want them to drag on the ground. These pants run just a little big, and my only complaint is that the hand pockets tend to stick out a bit. (My younger sisters assure me that they look all right, but it still bugs me just a little.) Ultimately, though, I feel super cool when I wear these pants, both temperature- and style-wise. —Louryn Strampe

Ten Thousand

Ten Thousand

Slipping into these pants is always a treat (I love the green color, too). The tailored fit makes them acceptable to wear out and about, and the stretchy double-knit fabric makes them comfy no matter what you're doing. (They're made of 72 percent cotton, 22 percent polyester, and 6 percent spandex.) They have held up really well after more than two months of extensive use—with multiple bouts through the laundry—and I frankly prefer the inner drawcord since there's less of a chance of snagging in the wash). Despite my 6'4"" frame, the Recover Pants come down to my ankles. These are the sweatpants I decided to bring on a trip to Italy as my nightclothes for when I'm lounging in the hotel, not only because they're very comfy to sleep in, but they also roll up tight and take up very little room, unlike many other sweatpants I've tested. —Julian Chokkattu

Aritzia

Aritzia

WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by her high-school sweatpants, and this oversized pair from Aritzia remind me exactly of that. They're almost shapeless, with a classic drawstring waist and elastic ankle cuffs. The rest of the pant leg is just big, cozy, fleece-lined goodness. The roomy fit is great for bumming around the house or running errands, though paired with a bodysuit and a cute pair of sneakers, you could probably wear these anywhere. The drawstring waist can be rolled up once or twice if you prefer, and it has an internal loop to knot rather than two laces to tie. The dart pockets are nice and roomy. The midweight Sweatfleece fabric is soft and cozy, but not stiflingly warm. I also like the slightly faded, washed-out colors, which lend to the vintage appeal. And finally, these are available in a truly gargantuan array of colors, sizes, and lengths, so it'll be easy to find a pair that works for you. —Louryn Strampe

Gap

Gap

For a vintage look with a more affordable price tag, these joggers from Gap are spot-on. They truly feel like I stole them from my boyfriend. They're slightly oversized, with a hem that hits right at the ankle. They're soft on the outside and softer on the inside, with a midweight terry cotton construction that feels pre-worn in the best way. Gap describes the fleece as “lived-in soft,” and I think that's the perfect description. The inner lining is brushed and feels almost like fleece, but they're not too warm for any season but summer. The silhouette is relaxed everywhere but the waist and ankles, and the slant pockets are average depth. These also don‘t have a drawstring, which may bother some people. But it didn't bother me! I was too busy feeling cozy. —Louryn Strampe

Gap Heavyweight French Terry Seamed Wide-Leg Sweatpants for $70: As I mentioned earlier, sometimes nontraditional pants are just a bit too out of my comfort zone, and I found these to be difficult to style. The heavy French terry fabric is nice and warm, and some colors look almost like denim. But on my 5'1"" frame, with no drawstring on the waistband, these regularly pooled at my ankles, and not in a cool counterculture way. I felt like I was dressing up in my dad's clothes, and I constantly needed to hike them up on my waist. I could see these being very cool to the right demographic, and they're well-constructed with neat seam detailing. I just didn't love them as much as the others I tested. —Louryn Strampe

Mack Weldon Ace Sweatpant for $88: I like that Mack Weldon offers a Regular or Tall fit for its Ace Sweatpant—I tried the latter—and it went down to my ankles (yay!). The fit is really nice here, though the pants tend to look a little wrinkly. The standout is the micro-brushed French terry texture. It feels smooth and soft to touch, though the pockets have an odd crinkly feel. There are two zippered pockets, one on the back and one low on the right side, the latter of which is a nice spot for earbuds. I like that the ankles are back-ribbed, which helps maintain a nice shape. These pants are made from 95 percent cotton and 5 percent Stretch. —Julian Chokkattu

Buck Mason Welterweight Sweatpant for $138: I love the look of Buck Mason's 1940s-inspired Welterweight sweatpants, with a lovely wide, ribbed waistband. The 100 percent cotton French terry fleece feels hardy and, while they don't feel tight and drape nicely, they're not what I'd pick for lounging on a couch. If I'm wearing these, I feel like I need to put a little thought into my outfit and then head out the door and show them off. I have two main issues, though: The first is that these pants are just not long enough for my 6'4"" frame. That might not be an issue for you, but they land well above my ankles. Also, the inside of the pockets feels rough. —Julian Chokkattu

Reigning Champ Midweight Terry Standard Sweatpant for $110: I regret asking for these sweatpants in white. Don't buy white pants. You'll quickly learn that it's really hard to keep stains away, especially on a piece of clothing designed for bumming around. Thankfully, Reigning Champ has multiple other color options, and the Vintage White I have isn't available anymore (it's not just me!). I'm 6'4"", and I would have liked the pants to be a little longer to get closer to my ankles, but this is a common problem for me. My only other gripe is the label on the inside back of the sweatpants—the corners are super sharp and scratchy, and when they inevitably make contact with the skin, it's extremely unpleasant. When that's not happening, these 100 percent cotton sweatpants are comfy with a nice silhouette, and the slant pockets are roomy. —Julian Chokkattu

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Is Using a Stair Machine the Same as Climbing Stairs?","https://www.wired.com/story/is-using-a-stair-machine-the-same-as-climbing-stairs/","Fri, 30 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

You can get a great workout by walking up the stairs in a tall building. The only problem is that you can't watch TV while doing it—hence the popularity of stationary stair-climbing machines. But is it the same? If your goal is to burn calories, does it make any difference which you choose? That's actually a great physics question, and we can get a pretty good mental workout with it. Shall we?

OK, what is a calorie, anyway? It's a unit of energy, defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1 degree Celsius. (This is your common “food calorie”: chemists confusingly use a calorie measure that's 1,000 times smaller.) Of course, in physics we prefer to measure energy in joules. Just to give you a feel for this unit, if you lift a textbook from the floor to a table, that would take about 10 joules.

Now, the work-energy principle says that in order to change the energy of a system, you need to add energy to (or remove energy from) the system. That seems obvious, but it's actually useful. We call the energy input (or output) “work.” Work is done on a system by applying a force over some distance.

Let's go back to the case of lifting a book off the floor. The first thing we need to do is define our “system.” That tells us what kinds of changes in energy we're going to deal with. So I'm going to use the system consisting of the book and the Earth. Since the book can move, it can have kinetic energy (K), which depends on its mass (m) and velocity (v). And with Earth in the system, we can also have gravitational potential energy (U). This depends on the mass of the book, the gravitational field (g), and the height of the book above the floor (y).

With this, we can write the work-energy principle as the following:

Notice that we're dealing with changes in energy—the Greek delta symbol means the change in something. If the book starts and ends at rest, then the change in kinetic energy is zero. That leaves us with just the change in gravitational potential energy. The gravitational field on the surface of the Earth is about 9.8 newtons per kilogram. So, using the formula for U above, with a book mass of 1 kilogram and a change in height of 1 meter, we need a work of 1 x 1 x 9.8 = 9.8 joules (or about 10).

Now suppose you are the book, and you go from standing on the floor to standing on the table? In that case, you are part of the system, so there's no external force doing work on the system. How can you have a change in gravitational potential energy without any added work? Well, the simple solution is to add another type of energy—let's just call it “internal energy.” It's the energy stored in your body by eating your Wheaties for breakfast. It's how humans work. With that, our work-energy equation looks a little different:

Since the change in kinetic energy is still zero, this means that the positive change in gravitational potential energy is equal to the negative of the change in internal energy. Let's say you have a mass of 75 kilograms (165 pounds). That means moving up 1 meter would reduce your internal energy by 735 joules. That's called working out.

Now we can go back to the original question: What does the work-energy principle say about stairs versus a stair-climbing machine? Well, we already did the physics of stair climbing. It's the same calculation if you get on top of a 1 meter table or climb 100 stories—it's just a different value for the height. But suppose you stay in the same place while the stairs move under you. If someone is measuring your forward motion, they'd say your speed is zero. Your height also doesn't change, so now the work-energy equation looks like this:

This says the change in internal energy is also zero, which means you don't burn any calories. I mean, that can't be right … right? Then how do we fix this? I'm going to use a nice example based on this video from Steve Mould. It goes like this: Imagine you are climbing up a downward-moving escalator. Again, an observer on the ground would see you as stationary. However, we could also measure your speed from the reference frame of the escalator, and you would be moving up.

In fact, if the escalator had walls and a ceiling, you wouldn't be able tell that you were staying in place. You wouldn't even know the stairs are moving. Since the stairs are moving at a constant velocity (zero acceleration), this would be an inertial reference frame. In physics, any inertial reference frame is as valid as any other reference frame—the basic laws of physics remain the same. So, from the perspective of the escalator frame you are moving up and doing work. It's the same as if you were walking up a stationary frame.

I said that the stair climber and climbing stairs were the same—but they are not. In fact, climbing up 100 stories is easier than the equivalent distance on a stair climber. Does that seem crazy? It is a little crazy. The reason they're different is because the gravitational field (g) is never really constant.

Remember, we defined the gravitational potential energy as U = m x g x y? That's not really wrong, but it is a little misleading. Actually, the gravitational potential energy for the Earth-person system would be defined as the following:

Let's go over this new equation. First, we have the universal gravitational constant (G = 6.67 x 10–11 Nm2/kg 2). Next, we have the masses of the two objects involved (ME for the Earth and m for the person). Finally, there is the distance from the center of the Earth to the person (r). Since we are dividing by the distance (r), the gravitational potential decreases as we get farther from the Earth. There's a negative sign there, so that if you move farther from the Earth (we usually call that “up”), the gravitational potential energy increases from some negative value to a smaller negative value.

If this is the gravitational potential energy, then why do we use U = m x g x y? Well, that's just a handy approximation. Since the Earth is very big, with a radius of 6.4 million meters, moving up even 1,000 meters doesn't change the value of r that much. So it's OK to approximate the gravitational field as a constant value of 9.8 newtons per kilogram, even though it actually gets smaller.

But just for fun, let's do a more precise calculation. Suppose I climb 100 flights of stairs. Let's say each flight of stairs has a change in height of 3 meters, so that the full climb would be 300 meters. If I start at the surface of the Earth (radius R) and climb up to a certain height (h ), the work-energy equation would look like this:

For a person-mass of 75 kilograms, I get a change in internal energy of 2.20312 x 105 joules. Now, if I use the stair climber, the change in energy would just be m x g x h. This gives an energy of 2.20323 x 105 joules. That's a difference of 10.4 joules or 0.0025 calories. If a typical candy bar has 200 calories, this would be 0.001 percent of the bar—not even a tiny bite. What I'm saying is, you can get at least as good a workout on the stair machine—and you can watch TV. I call that a win-win.

As midrange phones designed to plug the gap between flagships, the Honor 400 and 400 Pro might not ordinarily attract much attention. But these devices—unavailable in the US—are among the first to feature Google's image-to-video AI generator, based on its Veo 2 model (now available to Gemini subscribers). Built into Honor's Gallery app, you can select a still photo from your camera roll to bring it to life as a five-second video.

After much experimentation with different photos, from landscapes to family and pets, I'm impressed and weirded out. Like any AI tool, it has the potential to be good or bad, depending on how you wield it, and the results veer from flawless to freaky. It's a neat trick, and it's coming to the phone in your hand soon.

Faking photography is nothing new—the medium is always evolving. Artificial intelligence has been smoothing wrinkles and enhancing skies for years. None of your photos are real, especially those you shot with your phone and edited to post on social media. But we're pushing beyond creating a fake bokeh background blur or dialing up colors of the sunset. Creating entirely fake videos from still images feels like a new high and a new low.

The process is easy. Open the Gallery app on the Honor 400 or 400 Pro, choose the Create tab, tap Image to video, and select one of your photos. Choose a 9:16 or 16:9 aspect ratio for portrait or landscape, then hit start. You need to be connected to the internet. Each five-second video took around 30 seconds to create, but a pop-up message warns me they can take up to two minutes. There's no room to enter a prompt, so you are left at the mercy of whatever the AI decides to do.

I began with photos of my wife and kids. The first few videos have a major uncanny valley feel. In one photo, my wife is covering her mouth, and the AI animates her moving her hand and talking, but the mouth it pastes in is entirely wrong. Much to her horror, it gives my daughter a series of facial tics. The video of my selfie comes out well and would surely fool anyone who doesn't know me, but my wife says she can tell it's not me because I never make facial expressions like that.

We tried the cats next, and despite some odd expressions (my eldest cat, Bodhi, never looks as deferential as this), the results were pretty solid. Photos of landscapes, such as a boat on the waves or trees in a forest, are brought to life with believable rippling effects. Things got weirder with inanimate objects. With a pair of Star Wars Funko Pops, Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber glowed to life, but Darth Maul on a speeder weirdly rotated on the spot. For a few photos of ornaments, it did a disappointing pan or zoom.

As the debate about AI-generated art rages on, I can't help but wonder at the implications of uploading personal photos to be analyzed and animated by ever more powerful AI. Social media is already awash with carefully edited photos and videos, but AI processing is improving fast, generating more believable results with every passing day, and it's quickly becoming accessible to everyone.

Photography is the battleground for phone manufacturers trying to outdo one another. While most phone makers focused on hardware, Google dived deeper into computational photography, doing more with less. Google pioneered and popularized AI features in its Pixel phones. Options like AI Eraser to remove unwanted items or people from photos and AI-enhanced zoom to create more detailed zoomed shots from afar with underpowered hardware are fast becoming ubiquitous, and both work well on Honor's latest phones.

Google has already moved on with Pixel 9 features like Best Take, enabling you to pick smiling faces where everyone has their eyes open from different shots, and Add Me, allowing you to take group photos and then add yourself to them. Securing buy-in for this brave new world of AI photography is clearly important, as Google aims to pull big Android phone manufacturers aboard, carefully balancing exclusive Pixel features with debuts for companies like Honor.

Honor is creeping closer to marrying hardware and software in the 400 Pro. It has a triple-lens main camera comprising a 200-megapixel main shooter with a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto lens, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide, not to mention a 50-MP selfie camera. Honor has also bet big on AI in recent years, pushing more AI into its phones, working closely with Google, and showing off its own new AI features. The Chinese phone maker has come a long way from beauty filters that smooth out your wrinkles, though those are still available.

The generate button has a label that says “Limited-time free trial.” Honor 400 buyers get two free months and can generate up to 10 videos a day. Presumably, this will eventually be a paid feature of Google's Gemini Pro subscription and will roll out on many more phones (there's no firm timeline or pricing yet). It's a win-win for Google when it owns the underlying AI, enticing you to subscribe down the line. It's fun to play with—we exhausted our daily allowance fast—but seriously creepy.

The White House is investigating after one or more people reportedly accessed the contacts from the personal phone of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and used the information to contact other top officials and impersonate her. 

Wiles reportedly told people that her phone was hacked. The Wall Street Journal first reported the hack of Wiles' phone. CBS News also confirmed the reporting.

The hacker or hackers are said to have accessed Wiles' phone contacts, including the phone numbers of other top U.S. officials and influential individuals. The WSJ reports that those who received phone calls impersonating Wiles used AI to impersonate her voice and sent text messages from a number not associated with Wiles.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly would not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if authorities had determined if a cloud account associated with Wiles' personal device was compromised, or if Wiles' phone was targeted by a more advanced cyberattack, such as one that involves the use of government-grade spyware. 

In response, the White House said it “takes the cybersecurity of all staff very seriously, and this matter continues to be investigated.”

This is the second time Wiles has been targeted by hackers. In 2024, The Washington Post reported that Iranian hackers had attempted to compromise Wiles' personal email account. The Journal said Friday, citing sources, the hackers were in fact successful in breaking into her email and obtained a dossier on [Vice President] JD Vance, then Trump's running mate.

This is the latest cybersecurity incident to beset the Trump administration in the months since taking office.

In March, former White House top national security adviser Michael Waltz mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal group of top White House officials, including Vance and Wiles, which included discussions of a planned military air-strike in Yemen. 

Reports later revealed that the government officials were using a Signal clone app called TeleMessage, which was designed to keep a copy of messages for government archiving. TeleMessage was subsequently hacked on at least two occasions, revealing the contents of its users' private messages.

X's new DM feature, XChat, has begun rolling out to beta testers. Some X users who pay for the platform's subscription product have reported that they can access XChat, while reverse engineer Nima Owji confirmed to TechCrunch that the new messaging system appears to be ready to ship.

XChat is intended to be a more robust version of X's existing DM (direct messages) feature, which is a holdover from before Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter.

Some features that have been rumored to be part of XChat include group messages, end-to-end encryption, vanishing mode, the ability to mark messages as unread, and file sharing. Messages also appear to be secured behind a four-digit passcode.

X announced on Thursday that it was pausing work on its encrypted DM feature, which could be related to the impending release of XChat, since this new system would render the existing DM interface obsolete. Paid subscribers on X have had access to a limited version of encrypted messaging for two years.

In the years since he bought Twitter, Musk has spoken on numerous occasions about his ambitions to make a Signal-like messaging service embedded into X. If XChat really is gearing up for public use, then this news could represent Musk's follow-through on that goal.

Elon Musk reportedly increased his drug use during the 2024 presidential campaign in which he donated around $270 million to help elect Donald Trump, according to sources who spoke to The New York Times.

The Times reports that over the course of last year, his drug consumption went beyond recreational use. He reportedly carried a medication box with 20 pills, which included Adderall. Sources told the outlet that his use of ketamine was so rampant that it affected his bladder.

Musk's use of drugs like ketamine, psychedelic mushrooms, and ecstasy is well-documented and reportedly a source of concern for board members at the numerous companies he runs, like Tesla and SpaceX. The latter is a large government contractor and must maintain a drug-free workplace. The Times report claims Musk received advanced notice of drug tests.

It's not clear if his erratic behavior, like insulting cabinet members, doing the Nazi salute, and jumbled speech during earnings calls and other events were directly correlated to his reported drug-taking.

The report also details how Musk's increasing embrace of right-wing politics coincided with family troubles, like his custody battle with the musician Grimes over their five-year-old son, known as X.

Musk announced this week that he was ending his stint with the government and stepping back from politics to focus on his businesses. He is scheduled to give a joint press conference with President Trump on Friday afternoon.

Misfits Market, the online platform that delivers imperfect groceries to help minimize waste, announced the acquisition of household restocking service The Rounds on Friday.

As a result of the deal, Misfits Market plans to take on over 250 items from The Rounds' inventory. This allows the company to diversify into additional categories, such as household items, including cleaning supplies and paper products. 

In a bid to transition The Rounds customers to Misfits Market, the company is offering a $30 credit, along with a complimentary one-year subscription to its new Misfits+ membership, which includes exclusive weekly deals and free shipping.

The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It also couldn't confirm whether layoffs would be part of the acquisition, as decisions are still being finalized. The Rounds has raised a total of $66 million from investors such as Andrew Chen (Andreessen Horowitz), Annie Kadavy (Redpoint Ventures), Construct Capital, and First Round Capital.

Along with diversifying its offerings, the deal will allow Misfits Market to collaborate with former partners from The Rounds, including major multifamily operators such as AvalonBay, Greystar, and Related. 

Misfits Market also aims to gain a stronger foothold in the industry as a result of the deal. Notably, the company will continue to pursue M&A as part of a broader growth strategy, especially at a time when consumer awareness of food waste and sustainability is on the rise.

“This market is ripe for consolidation, and we are constantly looking at deals,” Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh told TechCrunch.

This marks Misfits Market's second acquisition, following its purchase of Imperfect Foods in 2022, another competitor in the market. 

Misfits Market, founded in 2018, offers produce that has been rejected by farmers and suppliers for being considered too “ugly” to sell in grocery stores, often due to being too small, oddly shaped, or having discoloration. 

The Rounds, meanwhile, has offered its sustainable grocery delivery service since 2019 that refills home essentials using reusable packaging. 

To date, Misfits Market has rescued more than 238 million pounds of food, according to the company. The Rounds has saved over 1 million pounds of packaging waste and estimates to save an average of 500,000 pounds of food each week.

It's not even actual lucky high risk gambles that are successful that are rewarded. A lot of times, it's just perceived success. Plenty of leaders fail upwards. Reward for incompetence and failure is a promotion that is mostly dictated by who you know in the organization. And perceived success is a huge factor in “who you know”.


reply



Or, perhaps relatedly, short-term success which sets up long-term failure - but by then the leader has moved on from the role.

It explains a lot more than bad leaders, it explains almost everything in society.  The winners write history and you can't really win unless you take big risks.

Outcomes however are not evenly distributed, large success typically has outsized rewards.This is why VCs have the investment strategies they do: invest in 10, 7 fail, 2 don't matter, and 1 is everything.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This benchmark used Reddit's AITA to test how much AI models suck up to us","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/30/1117551/this-benchmark-used-reddits-aita-to-test-how-much-ai-models-suck-up-to-us/","Fri, 30 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The new benchmark, called Elephant, makes it easier to spot when AI models are being overly sycophantic—but there's no current fix.

Back in April, OpenAIannounced it was rolling back an update to its GPT-4o model that made ChatGPT's responses to user queries too sycophantic. 

An AI model that acts in an overly agreeable and flattering way is more than just annoying. It could reinforce users' incorrect beliefs, mislead people, and spread misinformation that can be dangerous—a particular risk when increasing numbers of young people are using ChatGPT as a life advisor. And because sycophancy is difficult to detect, it can go unnoticed until a model or update has already been deployed, as OpenAI found out.

A new benchmark that measures the sycophantic tendencies of major AI models could help AI companies avoid these issues in the future. The team behind Elephant, from Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford, found that LLMs consistently exhibit higher rates of sycophancy than humans do.

“We found that language models don't challenge users' assumptions, even when they might be harmful or totally misleading,” says Myra Cheng, a PhD student at Stanford University who worked on the research, which has not been peer-reviewed. “So we wanted to give researchers and developers the tools to empirically evaluate their models on sycophancy, because it's a problem that is so prevalent.”

OpenAI's GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there's a catch.

It's hard to assess how sycophantic AI models are because sycophancy comes in many forms. Previous research has tended to focus on how chatbots agree with users even when what the human has told the AI is demonstrably wrong—for example, they might state that Nice, not Paris, is the capital of France.

While this approach is still useful, it overlooks all the subtler, more insidious ways in which models behave sycophantically when there isn't a clear ground truth to measure against. Users typically ask LLMs open-ended questions containing implicit assumptions, and those assumptions can trigger sycophantic responses, the researchers claim. For example, a model that's asked “How do I approach my difficult coworker?” is more likely to accept the premise that a coworker is difficult than it is to question why the user thinks so.

To bridge this gap, Elephant is designed to measure social sycophancy—a model's propensity to preserve the user's “face,” or self-image, even when doing so is misguided or potentially harmful. It uses metrics drawn from social science to assess five nuanced kinds of behavior that fall under the umbrella of sycophancy: emotional validation, moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing. 

To do this, the researchers tested it on two data sets made up of personal advice written by humans. This first consisted of 3,027 open-ended questions about diverse real-world situations taken from previous studies. The second data set was drawn from 4,000 posts on Reddit's AITA (“Am I the Asshole?”) subreddit, a popular forum among users seeking advice. Those data sets were fed into eight LLMs from OpenAI (the version of GPT-4o they assessed was earlier than the version that the company later called too sycophantic), Google, Anthropic, Meta, and Mistral, and the responses were analyzed to see how the LLMs' answers compared with humans'.  

Overall, all eight models were found to be far more sycophantic than humans, offering emotional validation in 76% of cases (versus 22% for humans) and accepting the way a user had framed the query in 90% of responses (versus 60% among humans). The models also endorsed user behavior that humans said was inappropriate in an average of 42% of cases from the AITA data set.

But just knowing when models are sycophantic isn't enough; you need to be able to do something about it. And that's trickier. The authors had limited success when they tried to mitigate these sycophantic tendencies through two different approaches: prompting the models to provide honest and accurate responses, and training a fine-tuned model on labeled AITA examples to encourage outputs that are less sycophantic. For example, they found that adding “Please provide direct advice, even if critical, since it is more helpful to me” to the prompt was the most effective technique, but it only increased accuracy by 3%. And although prompting improved performance for most of the models, none of the fine-tuned models were consistently better than the original versions.

“It's nice that it works, but I don't think it's going to be an end-all, be-all solution,” says Ryan Liu, a PhD student at Princeton University who studies LLMs but was not involved in the research. “There's definitely more to do in this space in order to make it better.”

Gaining a better understanding of AI models' tendency to flatter their users is extremely important because it gives their makers crucial insight into how to make them safer, says Henry Papadatos, managing director at the nonprofit SaferAI. The breakneck speed at which AI models are currently being deployed to millions of people across the world, their powers of persuasion, and their improved abilities to retain information about their users add up to “all the components of a disaster,” he says. “Good safety takes time, and I don't think they're spending enough time doing this.” 

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

While we don't know the inner workings of LLMs that aren't open-source, sycophancy is likely to be baked into models because of the ways we currently train and develop them. Cheng believes that models are often trained to optimize for the kinds of responses users indicate that they prefer. ChatGPT, for example, gives users the chance to mark a response as good or bad via thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. “Sycophancy is what gets people coming back to these models. It's almost the core of what makes ChatGPT feel so good to talk to,” she says. “And so it's really beneficial, for companies, for their models to be sycophantic.” But while some sycophantic behaviors align with user expectations, others have the potential to cause harm if they go too far—particularly when people do turn to LLMs for emotional support or validation. 

“We want ChatGPT to be genuinely useful, not sycophantic,"" an OpenAI spokesperson says. ""When we saw sycophantic behavior emerge in a recent model update, we quickly rolled it back and shared an explanation of what happened. We're now improving how we train and evaluate models to better reflect long-term usefulness and trust, especially in emotionally complex conversations.""Cheng and her fellow authors suggest that developers should warn users about the risks of social sycophancy and consider restricting model usage in socially sensitive contexts. They hope their work can be used as a starting point to develop safer guardrails. 

She is currently researching the potential harms associated with these kinds of LLM behaviors, the way they affect humans and their attitudes toward other people, and the importance of making models that strike the right balance between being too sycophantic and too critical. “This is a very big socio-technical challenge,” she says. “We don't want LLMs to end up telling users, ‘You are the asshole.'”

Billions of years from now, the Sun will swell into a red giant, swallowing Mercury, Venus, and Earth. But that's not the only way our planet could meet its demise. A new simulation points to the menacing threat of a passing field star that could cause the planets in the solar system to collide or fling Earth far from the Sun.

When attempting to model the evolution of the solar system, astronomers have often treated our host star and its orbiting planets as an isolated system. In reality, however, the Milky Way is teeming with stars that may get too close and threaten the stability of the solar system. A new study, published in the journal Icarus, suggests that stars passing close to the solar system will likely influence the orbits of the planets, causing another planet to smack into Earth or send our home planet flying.

In most cases, passing stars are inconsequential, but one could trigger chaos in the solar system—mainly because of a single planet. The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury, is prone to instability as its orbit can become more elliptical. Astronomers believe that this increasing eccentricity could destabilize Mercury's orbit, potentially leading it to collide with Venus or the Sun. If a star happens to be nearby, it would only make things worse.

The researchers ran 2,000 simulations using NASA's Horizons System, a tool from the Solar System Dynamics Group that precisely tracks the positions of objects in our solar system. They then inserted scenarios involving passing stars and found that stellar flybys over the next 5 billion years could make the solar system about 50% less stable. With passing stars, Pluto has a 3.9% chance of being ejected from the solar system, while Mercury and Mars are the two planets most often lost after a stellar flyby. Earth's instability rate is lower, but it has a higher chance of its orbit becoming unstable if another planet crashes into it.

“In addition, we find that the nature of stellar-driven instabilities is more violent than internally driven ones,” the researchers wrote in the paper. “The loss of multiple planets in stellar-driven instabilities is common and occurs about 50% of the time, whereas it appears quite rare for internally driven instabilities.”

The probability of Earth's orbit becoming unstable is hundreds of times larger than prior estimates, according to the study. Well, that just gives us one more thing to worry about.

If you're considering upgrading your computer or gaming setup seriously, a first-class internal SSD makes a world of difference. Whether you're a gamer or simply someone who wants a faster system, storage speed and reliability matter. The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD with heatsink offers all of that and: acceleration speed, improved thermal control, dependable reliability and it is a compact 2280 M.2 PCI-E 4.0 device.

At this moment, this powerful storage option is on sale for a crazy good price on Amazon, so it's a perfect time to improve your gaming rig. This internal 2TB SSD is currently priced at just $179, down from its original $309 price. Even the regular 2TB model without heatsink is on sale for $169 (original price $249) but for the majority of users thinking about using, and/or pushing their systems to their maximum, the model with the integrated heatsink is the cheaper and smarter way to go.

So what makes the Samsung 990 Pro with heatsink so special? First and foremost, it's all about speed: This solid-state drive utilizes PCIe Gen4 technology with sequential read speed of up to 7450 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6900MB/s, which makes it among the fastest drives available today. Whether you're loading extremely large game files, working with high-resolution video or massive data sets, the difference is immediate. The 990 Pro shows more than a 55% improvement in random performance compared to its predecessor (980 Pro).

The ultra-slim heatsink alone is a great product differentiator for sustained performance with no throttling: The heatsink dissipates heat efficiently and keeps the drive cooled during prolonged and heavy use. When high-performance speeds and reliability is required along with cooled conditions for gaming and professional workloads, heatsinking is crucial. The ultra-slim profile of the heatsink is also compatible with nearly all possible systems including the PlayStation 5 and any desktop or laptop meeting PCI-SIG D8 specifications which the 990 Pro falls within. With the 990 Pro with heatsink, you will experience near-max PCIe 4.0 performance without the worry of heat or performance loss.

The Samsung 990 Pro is also great for capacity perspective as well since it is available from 1TB, to 4TB, accommodating whatever space you need for games, media, and projects. While all models are reasonably priced, 2TB makes the most sense from a price point and space perspective for most gamers and professionals alike. With 2TB, you can load all of your games, complete large video projects, and store important files without constantly rerouting and stressing.

If you're building a new computer, upgrading your PlayStation 5, or just want better performance for a fair price, this SSD is really well worth it.

The amount of photos, videos and files that we have on our devices makes traditional storage options obsolete. If you have a hard drive that has 2, 3, 4, or even 5TB of space, it is almost useless when a single vacation's worth of high-res photos and video can take up ample space. That's why smart people are looking for big, reliable external drives, and what better time to upgrade to an external drive?

Seagate's long history of reliability and durability makes them a great brand to go with: Amazon has the Seagate expansion 20TB external hard drive at a record low (and all time low) price now of $229, over 50% off of the launch price of $499. What is even better is the 22TB and 24TB models are on sale as well for $289 and $279 respectively.

See at Amazon

Why take someone's word when here is a drive that could last a lifetime? The Seagate Expansion 20TB is a “long term investment” in your digital life. If you're a creative professional or just someone who wants to keep every precious memory safe, this drive could last you years of content. Add to that Seagate's reputation for reliability means, you can rest assured that your data will be safe and secure for ages. In comparison to cloud storage, which will run a minimum of $10 a month (and often much higher for larger capacities), this one-time payment option is a bargain.

The process of opening the box to setup the Seagate 20TB HDD is fantastically easy: The drive is designed to be very simple to use and you just plug in the included power adapter and USB 3.0 cable and you are all set. USB 3.0 has the added benefit of helping to move files quickly and efficiently with minimal time wasted for large files. Also, it will seamlessly work on either your Windows computer or Mac.

What we really liked about this drive is the included Rescue Data Recovery Services. Accidents can happen to anyone, and when they do, having a safety net can be critical. Seagate's data recovery service takes the worry out of it by knowing if something goes wrong, experts could recover your files. Unfortunately, many external drives don't offer you any data recovery protection, so this is a real plus for Seagate.

Since Seagate Expansion 20TB is a desktop-type external hard, it works perfectly in a home office, home studio space, and to help anyone centralize their digital file storage. The 3.5-inch size will also provide better performance and reliability than the small-portable external options. Plus, the shape and size of this product looks really nice and easy to manage.

If you were going to upgrade your method of backup and storage options, now is the time to do so.

Keeping your home clean can be a pain when you're having to constantly switch between a stick vacuum and mop, juggling your tools and spending time on the repetitively boring chores in a very inconvenient manner. The latest trend in home cleaning is convenience and efficiency, as you can combine vacuuming and mopping into a single smart device that can perform both functions for you.

Roborock has has become the most premium and popular brand in the robot vacuum segment of the industry with their newest models even exceeding $2,000 for the price tag. Luckily for you, you don't have to spend that much money to get one of their top-tier robot vacuum cleaners. The Roborock Q7 Max is a model that launched first at $599 and it is on sale now at Amazon with a $199 price that is nearly 70% off its original launch price.

See at Amazon

As of this moment, the Roborock Q7 Max Robot Vacuum and Mop is listed for $199, down from a regular list price of $299 but the real steal is keeping in mind its launch list price. This means you get a high-end cleaning robot for a fraction of what it was originally worth which is a surprisingly good offer and can be hard to pass up if you have been looking to upgrade your cleaning set up. Although the Q7 Max is now about three years old, it continues to be an excellent value for your money.

The Roborock Q7 Max has a massive 4,200 Pa suction power which makes it so powerful that it easily lifts up debris, pet hair, and dirt from all floor types including carpets, hardwoods, tiles, and radiator flooring. When it senses carpets it boosts its suction power automatically to ensure that it picks up the debris deeply and thoroughly every single time to clean your carpets. The fact that it can vacuum while also mopping is a nice feature, it essentially eliminates having to go back over previously vacuumed areas with a mop. You have also a plus with the electronic water pump that provides 30 water flow options to adjust, depending on what type of flooring you have or your personal needs.

The Q7 Max has great run time which is perfect for long cleaning cycles: Its combined 470 ml dustbin and 350 ml water tank provides more area to clean between emptying and refilling than with other models. The Q7 Max has a rubber brush that has been built to resist tangling from long hair and pet hair and because it has a multi-directional floating front, it allows the brush to stay close to the floor more for better cleaning. It has a powerful battery that lasts for 180 minutes and will cover up to 3,229 square feet on a single charge, so it works for homes that are larger.

The Q7 Max has a built in PreciSense LiDAR and creates highly accurate 3D maps of your space and plans the most efficient cleaning paths possible based on the layout of your home. You can recreate your entire living space in the app which allows you to add furniture, different types of flooring and other features to personalize the specific areas that need to be cleaned. It allows you to setup no-go or no-mop zones, if there are areas you do not want the robot to vacuum or mop.

The Roborock Q7 Max is a great robot vacuum if you do not want to lift a finger. At the current price, the Roborock Q7 Max proves that you do not need to spend thousands of dollars to enjoy the best that cleaning technology has to offer for your home.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Palmer Luckey, the original founder of Oculus VR who has since become a military contractor, weren't on the best of terms for many years. After all, Zuck is the one who fired Luckey after he helped establish Meta's entire VR business. That's now water under the bridge. There's major money to be made in military tech, but Zuckerberg and Luckey—two nerds who made billions off their consumer products—are also bound tight by their newfound ultra-masculine, Trump-supporting personas.

On Thursday, the pair declared they were hitching themselves back together after their initial nasty divorce and subsequent lawsuit nearly a decade ago. Luckey's military contracting company, Anduril, and Meta announced they were going to make “the world's best” AR and VR technology for the U.S. military. This initial project is dubbed “EagleEye” and, according to The Wall Street Journal, will be some kind of “rugged” VR system that could detect enemy soldiers or drones. The Oculus founder added that he and Zuck had been working on several projects “for a while now.” That could include a joint bid for a U.S. Army contract worth approximately $100 million, according to the WSJ.

It's a real match made in murder. Microsoft had worked hard on a similar project called HoloLens that was supposed to provide soldiers with individual XR goggles. After years of development, initial tests back in 2022 went so poorly soldiers said the devices gave them motion sickness, adding, “The devices would have gotten us killed.” Microsoft killed off its consumer-level HoloLens last year, but the company expected to do more tests of its XR devices this year. The Journal reported Aduril has replaced Microsoft as the leading vendor for military VR.

Big tech companies see dollar signs, and it's no wonder they're so eager to claim a slice of the military-industrial complex pie. Luckey has long been a supporter of President Donald Trump. His donations to a pro-Trump group and his public endorsement of the U.S.-Mexico border wall were deciding factors in his ouster from Facebook. Luckey all but confirmed it in a recent TED talk where he said he was fired from the company for “donating $9,000 to the wrong political candidate.”

There is a lot of money to be made in military contracts. Elon Musk, whose company Starlink is a major U.S. contractor, isn't the only CEO who has buddied up close to Trump for the sake of access and new potential deals. Zuckerberg, alongside the CEOs of several major tech firms from Google to Amazon to Apple, donated millions of dollars for Trump's inauguration and stood behind the wannabe authoritarian while he was sworn in. All these companies have multi-billion ties to the Pentagon, though tech giants like Google and Amazon try to keep their ties out of the limelight.

So what's changed with Meta? The CEO of Andruil—a company name he ripped from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series—has long been an ardent Trump fan, but shortly after the election, Zuckerberg had his moment to finally come clean about his displeasure with all things having to do with diversity, equity, and inclusion—or DEI. The once-tweedy, nerdy Zuck has tried to transform his look as he's become a big fan of martial arts. He said on Joe Rogan's podcast that he believes the workplace needs more “masculine energy,” which in the end just means he will kill funding for nonprofits and schools that he doesn't think fit in his new worldview.

The arms dealer's slicked-back mullet and soul patch framed by his typical Hawaiian shirts, cargo shorts, and sandals don't exactly gel with Zuckerberg's masculine makeover. The connection between the pair of wannabe warmongers is more than skin deep. Luckey has been outspoken of his love for the “warriors” of the U.S. military. In past posts to X, Luckey identified himself as a “warrior” since he helps provide the “tools of violence.”

The bad blood between Luckey and Zuckerberg wouldn't survive the pair's transformation into their new “warrior” identities. Yes, the contracts are lucrative enough to salve any lingering wounds, but the push into arms tech isn't driven merely by seeing dollar signs in the eyes. Both are committed to building a society that puts value on weapons and the armed forces above people. Perhaps they hope they'll both get a seat on the lead tank at Trump's fascist-flavored military parade next month.

Details regarding Scream 7 are starting to trickle out as the horror franchise detours back into a story with its original remaining stars.

As original film scribe Kevin Williamson takes the helm of a Scream film for the first time, he's bringing it all together with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) as they encounter ghosts of friends and ghostfaces past, including David Arquette, Scott Foley, and Matthew Lillard.

Some of the Scream reboot core cast also remains, with Mason Gooding and Jasmine Savoy reprising their roles as the Meeks twins  But now there's the development that the film will jump ahead in time for a “really cool reason” as shared by the film's writer Guy Busick to ComicBook.com.

Busick continued to elaborate why the movie has become a Sidney-centered story, making the series' original final girl once again the lead.

“I don't want to give anything away about the reason [Scream 7] had to be a Sidney movie because there's a really cool reason,” Busick told ComicBook. “In all these movies, you have to ask, ‘Why now? What is the thing Scream is commenting on now?' Scream is always in a conversation with the audience about the state of movies, the state of horror movies and in particular, franchises.”

He shared that her participation was tantamount to the new installment's themes. “We went to Neve Campbell and said, ‘This is why. This is why Sidney now.' Neve was like, ‘Oh, I get that.' I pitched Kevin [Williamson] this first, too. He got it and then I pitched the studio.”

He added that the new movie will not be set in New York, as the previous film was. It will also feature a time jump.

“I don't want to be the one to spoil where it is,” Busick said; he also was vague on the time shift, but for seemingly less spoiler-y reasons. “It's an unspecified amount of time [after Scream VI]. I might get contradicted by other people, but in my mind, more than two years. I would say at least two years. It could be two years, but I would say two years plus.”

Many are rightfully mad that Melissa Barrera was controversially pushed out of leading the franchise's rebirth, and the repercussions of that might affect the interest with this particular sequel. It remains to be seen if bringing back so many past characters will be enough to compensate for perhaps wrongfully abandoning the Carpenter sisters storyline.

In the meantime we'll be wondering if it's back to Woodsboro we go! Scream 7 will hit theaters February 27, 2026.

XL-Flash all the things. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Kioxia has introduced two generations of its XL-Flash storage class memory (SCM), a high-speed type of NAND memory originally designed to compete with Optane SSD technology by providing new levels of latency, performance, and endurance over standard flash-based storage. However, so far, only a few companies have released solid-state drives based on this type of NAND. This might change, as InnoGrit, a maker of SSD controllers, demonstrated a reference design PCIe 5.0 SSD based on XL-Flash memory at Computex that delivers up to an incredible 3.5 million random read IOPS. Therefore, there is a chance that independent makers of solid-state drives will release drives based on Kioxia's SCM.

InnoGrit's N3X SSD, based on the InnoGrit Tacoma IG5669 controller and Kioxia's 2nd Generation XL-Flash memory in SLC mode, is designed for latency-sensitive enterprise workloads that demand the utmost reliability. The NVMe 2.0-compliant controller supports a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface and enables sustained performance of up to 14 GB/s sequential read speed and up to 12 GB/s sequential write speed, as well as up to 3.5 million random read IOPS and 700 thousand random write IOPS.

Perhaps more importantly, there's less than 13 microseconds of read latency, a huge reduction compared to the ~50 – 100 µs for 3D TLC NAND, and 4 µs write latency, another massive decrease compared to ~200 – 400 µs for 3D TLC NAND, which is particularly useful for caching, AI inference, in-memory computing, and real-time analytics.



These N3X SSDs offer capacities from 400GB to 3.2TB using 2nd Gen XL-Flash in SLC mode (with configurations spanning from 32 to 256 NAND dies), making these SSDs a compelling alternative to discontinued Intel Optane solutions.

The endurance rating of the drive is particularly impressive: 50 DWPD over 5 years, far exceeding the standard enterprise NAND-based SSD endurance levels, which makes it ideal for write-intensive tasks such as caching, inference, and transactional workloads where longevity and consistent performance are critical.

InnoGrit envisions that its partners might build XL-Flash and IG5669-based SSDs in U.2 or E3.S form factors. Yet, they could also build drives in an add-on card form factor to cater to the needs of desktop workstations or even high-end desktops.

Kioxia's XL-Flash is a high-performance NAND technology designed to bridge the latency gap between DRAM and conventional flash memory, making it a viable SCM option for enterprise applications that require persistent memory with DRAM-like responsiveness. Kioxia's 2nd Generation XL-Flash doubles density by using an MLC (multi-level cell) architecture, raising die capacity from 128Gb to 256Gb. However, InnoGrit believes that it makes sense to use such memory in SLC configuration for higher performance, as at the end of the day, this is what users of XL-Flash demand the most.

Originally, Kioxia positioned XL-Flash as a competitor to Intel's discontinued Optane memory; however, for now, we can say that XL-Flash is taking over where Optane left off.

Kioxia has been the main supplier of XL-Flash-based solid-state drives, though we have seen SSDs featuring this type of SCM from companies like Memblaze, albeit based on the very expensive Microsemi Flashtec NVMe2016 controller. InnoGrit is a more democratic maker of SSD controllers, so one can expect N3X SSDs to become more widespread, assuming that drive manufacturers adopt this design. Keep in mind, however, that XL-Flash is a niche type of memory, so it is unlikely to become truly widespread.

EMIB-T comes to fore.

Intel disclosed several chip packaging breakthroughs at the Electronic Components Technology Conference (ECTC), outlining the technical merits of multiple new chip packaging techniques. We spoke with Dr. Rahul Manepalli, an Intel Fellow and VP of Substrate Packaging Development, for more details on three of the new packaging technologies: EMIB-T for boosting both the size of chip packages and power delivery capabilities to support new technologies like HBM4/4e, a new disagregated heat spreader design, and a new thermal bonding technique that improves reliability, yields, and enables scaling to finer chip-to-chip connections. Intel also participated in 17 other new papers presented at the event.

Intel Foundry aims to produce chips for both Intel's own internal use and for external companies, utilizing leading-edge process node technology. However, modern processors are increasingly deployed with complex, heterogeneous designs that integrate multiple types of computing and memory components into a single chip package, thereby amplifying performance, cost, and power efficiency gains. These chip designs rely upon increasingly complex advanced packaging techniques that serve as the bedrock of heterogeneous designs, so continued evolution is critical as Intel keeps pace with competitors like TSMC.

Intel's new EMIB-T, originally disclosed at its Intel Direct Connect event last month, incorporates through-silicon vias (TSVs) into its already widely used EMIB technology —a silicon bridge embedded in a package substrate that provides communication and power plumbing between chiplets/dies. 

This next evolution of EMIB enhances critical package power delivery efficiency metrics and speeds die-to-die communication. EMIB-T can be used to more effectively power compute and memory components — whereas standard EMIB connections struggled with high voltage droop due to a cantilevered power delivery path, EMIB-T utilizes TSVs to provide power delivery from the bottom of the chip package via TSV bridge dies, thus enabling a direct, low-resistance path for power delivery that's critical for HBM4/4e integration.

Naturally, the use of TSVs also boosts die-to-die communication bandwidth, enabling the integration of high-speed HBM4/4e memory packages and the use of the UCIe-A interconnect to increase data transfer rates to 32 Gb/s or higher. Routing power and signals through the same interface introduces 'noise' in the signal path, but Intel integrated high-powered MIM capacitors into the bridge to help ensure consistent communication signaling.

EMIB-T also enables much larger chip package sizes, reaching 120x180mm, and supports more than 38 bridges and more than 12 recticle-sized die in a single large chip package. Additionally, the first generation of EMIB enabled a 55-micron bump pitch, a critical interconnect density metric, while the second-generation EMIB scaled down to a 45-micron pitch. Intel's paper demonstrates an EMIB-T design with a 45-micron pitch, but notes that the new technology supports ""well below"" 45-micron pitches, saying it will go to 35-micron pitches soon and has 25-micron pitches in development. Intel hasn't shared the picojoules-per-bit (pJ/bit) power efficiency metrics. EMIB-T is also compatible with either organic or glass substrates, with the latter being a key strategic direction for Intel's future chip packaging endeavors.  



The AI revolution is pushing chip package sizes to new frontiers, and with that comes increased power consumption that introduces vexing cooling challenges. Intel also disclosed a new disaggregated heat spreader technique that breaks the heat spreader into a flat plate and a stiffener to improve coupling between the heat spreader and the thermal interface material (TIM) that resides between the heat spreader and the underlying die. Among other benefits, this technique helps reduce voids in solder TIM coupling by 25%.

Intel's illustration shows a heatspreader with integrated micro-channels that carry liquid directly through the IHS to cool the processor, much like we saw on display at its Direct Connect event. While the paper focused on the effects of breaking the heatspreader into multiple pieces, the inclusion of this tech, which can cool processor packages with a TDP up to 1000W, highlights that Intel is approaching the chip cooling problem from multiple angles. 



Intel has utilized thermal compression bonding techniques in both its server and consumer products; however, it has now developed a new thermal compression bonding process specifically for large package substrates that helps overcome die and substrate warpage during the bonding process. 

This new technique minimizes the thermal delta between the package substrate and the die during the bonding process, thereby improving yield and reliability metrics and enabling much larger chip packages than are currently possible in high volume manufacturing. It also enables finer pitches for EMIB connections, helping to squeeze out more density from EMIB-T technology. 

Having a well-rounded and competitive suite of packaging technologies is crucial for Intel Foundry as it aims to provide its customers with the most comprehensive range of chip production options possible. Advanced chip packaging techniques enable customers to integrate different types of chips, such as CPUs, GPUs, and memory, from multiple vendors into a single package, thereby reducing the risk of transitioning entirely to Intel's process nodes for all componentry. In fact, Intel also offers packaging services for chips that don't use any Intel-fabbed components at all, helping to build relationships with potential new customers for its chip-fabbing services.

Chip packaging has also emerged as one of the leading services for Intel's external customers, which currently include industry heavyweights such as AWS and Cisco, among others, as well as the US government's RAMP-C and SHIP projects. These packaging contracts serve as the fastest on-ramp for Intel Foundry revenue generation, as producing chips with leading-edge process nodes requires significantly longer lead times.

Windows 11 handheld gamers rejoice!

A new report into Microsoft's handheld gaming console plans appears to indicate that the company is putting its own first-party Xbox handheld on the back burner in order to prioritize Windows 11 gaming handheld optimization and the third-party offering from Asus, dubbed 'Kennan', as reported by Windows Central.

It's possible that this move from Microsoft is in response to the widespread success users have had using SteamOS on Windows 11-compatible handhelds. We recently covered the Lenovo Legion Go S handheld and its support for both SteamOS and Windows 11. There are a few caveats in running SteamOS, for example, the loss of Game Pass support. However, users who don't mind these sacrifices have noticed great performance output from SteamOS.

If you aren't familiar with the Xbox gaming handheld news, here's the latest. Microsoft was previously reported to be working on multiple handheld gaming devices, its own internal Xbox first-party handheld, and a third-party offering with Asus. The latter project has been dubbed ""Project Kennan,"" and rumors have been floating for a while speculating on its potential release date. According to Windows Central, ""Kennan is still targeting a launch for later this year,"" and the hardware for the device is ""essentially finished.""

According to the report, Microsoft's first-party offering appears to have been a more native Xbox console-style experience that could run full Xbox games. Sadly, it's this first-party offering that has been put on the back burner, at least for now.

Windows 11 has been the default OS for many handheld gaming systems, but things have definitely shaken up with the introduction of SteamOS. It's more than just the Legion Go S. You can run both Windows 11 and Steam OS on it, as well as the Asus ROG Ally. There are benefits to both operating systems, with Steam OS taking the lead on performance and Windows 11 providing access to the Windows ecosystem.

An appeals court says the measures can remain in place for now


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


5/30 5 am (ET): Following a report on May 29 that a U.S. trade court had ruled Washington's sweeping tariff measures were unlawful, the White House has successfully lodged an appeal with the federal appeals court. According to the ruling, the U.S. government's tariffs can remain in place while the case is ongoing; the next hearing will take place on June 5. A different federal court ruled similarly on a separate set of tariffs. As reported by the BBC, the President's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told the press that even if the administration loses in court, it would find another way to implement the measures. The report from May 29 continues below as published.

The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled that President Trump's sweeping tariffs, levied on nations including China, were unlawful, in a move that could significantly reshape the ongoing trade war and impact the price of technology. The court declared that all of President Trump's measures are ""invalid as contrary to law"" because the emergency law used to pass them does not give the President unilateral authority to impose such sweeping measures.

In a ruling dated May 28, three judges concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 ""does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders"" considered by the court in the case. Specifically, they say the Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff orders imposed by Washington ""exceed any authority granted to the President by the IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.""

Regarding Trafficking Tariffs, the court says these fail ""because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders."" Consequently, the court ordered that all the challenged Tariff Orders be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.

The White House has already filed a notice of appeal, and such decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, and of course, the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a statement reported by the BBC, the administration said, ""It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency."" Continuing, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, ""President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.""

Considering previous reports, tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70%. Legal suspension of tariffs levied on countries, including China, could be an enormous relief to suppliers of hardware, including the semiconductor industry, as well as component parts, notably GPUs.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Nvidia has raised prices by 10-15% to combat rising manufacturing costs and tariffs, while TSMC recently called on Washington to drop tariffs on semiconductors made outside the U.S.. Responding to a U.S. Commerce Department's call for public comments, the global silicon leader said ""we respectfully request that the Administration avoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of the United States,"" claiming tariffs raise the cost of endconsumer products and lower demand for such products and the components they contain.

 May 30, 2025  

To reduce the risk for complications, the use of dopaminergic agonists in the treatment of severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) has become less common.

RLS is characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations such as itching, tingling, or electric paresthesia, which typically affect the lower limbs. It affects 8% of the French population, predominantly women.

New guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) no longer recommend the use of these drugs as first-line treatments.

During the recent French Language Neurology Days in Montpellier, France, Sofiène Chenini, PhD, a researcher at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Gui-de-Chauliac Hospital, reviewed the current treatment approaches for RLS and highlighted non-dopaminergic alternatives. He cautioned that dopaminergic agonists could lead to the augmentation and worsening of symptoms over time.

In France, RLS is guided by the 2019 recommendations of the French Society for Sleep Research and Medicine (SFRMS), which still supports the use of dopaminergic agonists for the most severe cases of RLS.

“For now, we have not updated the guidelines, but we are considering it,” said Chenini, referring to the new American recommendations.

According to the new AASM guidelines, intravenous iron supplementation is the preferred first-line treatment for severe RLS. In some cases, second-line antiepileptic drugs are considered a first-line treatment option in French recommendations when the severity is low.

These sensations of restlessness typically occur in the evening or at night during periods of rest or inactivity and are temporarily relieved by movement, such as walking and stretching. The condition often leads to repeated leg movements during sleep and difficulty falling asleep due to increased brain activity.

RLS is not fully understood but is often linked to problems with iron regulation.

MRI studies have shown iron deficiency in the brains of patients with RLS. This suggests a disruption in iron transport across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons, possibly due to a decrease in the transferrin receptor.

This disruption in iron regulation, believed to have a primarily genetic origin, induces an increase in the synthesis of dopamine and glutamate, which is likely the cause of the symptoms. In RLS, changes in the dopaminergic system are linked to risk factors such as aging and the use of certain medications.

According to a 2016 consensus from the SFRMS, RLS diagnosis is based on five clinical criteria:

Once diagnosed, iron assessment is required to check for iron deficiency. The analysis includes measuring C-reactive protein to ensure there is no inflammation, “which reduces iron bioavailability,” Chenini explained.

Therefore, polysomnography remains optional in such cases. If ferritin levels are below 75 µg/L, iron supplementation is recommended. Treatment also involves addressing factors that worsen symptoms, such as caffeine and alcohol consumption and smoking. It is advisable to stop or switch medications that may aggravate symptoms, such as antidepressants and antihistamines.

The antidepressants involved are serotonergic, particularly serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with a long half-life.

“If stopping treatment is not possible, switching to antidepressants with a short half-life, such as venlafaxine or duloxetine taken in the morning, is recommended,” he said.

For mild RLS cases, lifestyle changes may be sufficient to ease symptoms. These include avoiding coffee, alcohol, and tobacco; maintaining regular sleep and wake times; engaging in physical activity early in the day; and performing stretching exercises before sleeping.

If ferritin levels remain low after 3 months of iron supplementation, switching to intravenous treatment is recommended. Options included a single dose of ferric carboxymaltose (500-1000 mg) or multiple sessions of 200 mg ferric hydroxide-sucrose.

If symptoms persist, a mild opioid is recommended as needed, starting with opium powder, codeine (such as paracetamol-codeine 500/30 mg, up to 60 mg of codeine or more), and tramadol (starting at 50 mg and increasing to 100 mg if necessary).

If the improvement remains insufficient, specific treatment should be considered on the basis of the severity of RLS assessed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLS) score. Background treatment is recommended for very severe cases (IRLS score above 30), which are linked to the risks for depression and even suicide, as noted by Chenini. It is also advised in cases of severe insomnia or when the quality of life is significantly affected.

A recent study by Chenini and colleagues found a 10-fold higher risk for depressive symptoms in patients with RLS, particularly in young women with insomnia. The study also reported a threefold increase in suicidal thoughts.

According to the French guidelines, very severe cases of RLS require treatment with low-dose dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole, rotigotine, or ropinirole. These drugs may also help reduce motor inhibition in patients with depression. Dopamine agonists are the only approved treatment for this indication.

“It is essential to respect the maximum dosages,” Chenini emphasized. The recommended maximum doses are 3 mg for rotigotine, 0.54 mg for pramipexole, and 4 mg for ropinirole.

Second-line treatments include alpha-2 delta ligand antiepileptics, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, especially in cases of severe insomnia. For less severe cases, these antiepileptics are preferred as first-line treatment. Gabapentin may be favored over pregabalin because it causes less sedation.

The major risk associated with dopamine agonists is worsening symptoms after prolonged use, known as augmentation syndrome, which is particularly higher in patients with iron deficiency, older age, and those prescribed high doses of antagonists.

Concerns about this complication led the AASM to remove dopamine agonists from the recommendations for RLS management.

In 2016, American guidelines similar to the current French recommendations for dopamine agonists were the first-line treatment alongside antiepileptics in the treatment of severe forms of the disease. The new recommendations now place intravenous iron supplementation as the first-line treatment, while antiepileptics are the second line.

Chenini highlighted that this change is due to the misuse of dopamine agonists in RLS. A registry of 670,000 patients with RLS in the United States showed that 60% were treated with dopamine agonists, and 20% received doses exceeding the recommended limits.

The registry shows that neurologists prescribe higher doses of dopamine agonists for RLS than general practitioners. This is likely because these drugs are also used to treat Parkinson's disease, where the doses are approximately 10 times higher than those used for RLS.

Chenini reported having no conflicts of interest.

 May 30, 2025  

A temporary electronic forehead tattoo that wirelessly measures brainwaves and eye movement may offer an accurate measurement of mental workload (MWL) and mental strain, new research suggested.

Using a lightweight battery and thin sensors, the e-tattoo was able to reliably collect electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) data to estimate MWL in a small study of six participants as they completed increasingly difficult memory tests.

The technology is a less bulky and cheaper alternative to conventional brain activity monitors and may help track the mental workload of workers in safety-critical jobs like aviation, air traffic control, and healthcare. Researchers say it also has applications for neurological monitoring of patients with epilepsy or to monitor cognitive decline.

“Our wireless electronic tattoo stands out for its ultrathin, skin-conformal design, which allows for stable EEG/EOG signal acquisition even during dynamic activities like walking or facial movements,” investigator Nanshu Lu, PhD, professor and chair of engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, told Medscape Medical News. “Unlike other platforms like headbands or glasses, our tattoo is helmet-compatible, low-profile, and uses low-cost disposable materials, making it uniquely suitable for real-world deployment.”

The findings were published online on May 29 in the journal Device.

There is no universally accepted definition of MWL, but it can generally be described as the degree to which a person's working memory capacity and cognitive processes are engaged by an ongoing task, the authors noted.

MWL levels can be assessed using subjective self-assessment questionnaires like the post-task NASA Task Load Index, as well as physiological measures such as heart rate, galvanic skin response, EEG, and EOG.

The wireless e-tattoo features stretchable serpentine-shaped, graphite-deposited polyurethane electrodes coated with an adhesive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly-styrene sulfonate composite to reduce impedance and improve adhesion to the skin. The e-tattoo is integrated with a battery-powered flexible printed circuit that transmits EEG and EOG data in real-time via Bluetooth Low Energy.

To evaluate the e-tattoo efficacy, the researchers analyzed EEG and EOG signals collected on six healthy participants wearing the wireless forehead e-tattoo during cognitive tasks designed to measure working memory, called dual N-back tasks. Self-assessment using the NASA–Task Load Index, task performance metrics, and physiological features were also collected.

Each participant completed a single experiment session lasting approximately 2.5 hours, which included three runs of N-back trials.

“This single-session design was sufficient to train individualized models, although variability between participants was observed, especially in the relative importance of EEG vs EGO features,” Lu said.

As the cognitive workload increased, frontal delta- and theta-band powers increased, while alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band powers decreased. The authors noted this is in line with studies linking theta-band power to an increase in working memory load and increasing MWL with a decrease in alpha power and increase in frontal theta power.

To test the viability of mental workload estimation using the e-tattoo, the researchers then built a random forest model to predict the level of mental workload experienced by participants during the N-back tasks. They found that the model successfully estimated the mental workload for all N levels for all six participants.

“Key findings of our study show that the wireless forehead e-tattoo reliably captures forehead EEG and EOG signals, and these signals can be used to accurately estimate mental workload during a dual N-back task, which is a widely used standard mental workload test,” Lu said. “Our model achieved robust classification of cognitive load levels using only minimally processed physiological data.”

For forehead EEG/EOG–driven workload detection, the e-tattoo system is already self-sufficient but integration with other physiological sensors such as heart rate or galvanic skin response could improve accuracy and robustness in mental workload vs mental stress differentiation, Lu noted.

“In medical settings, this technology could be very useful for neurological monitoring, including early detection of cognitive decline, noninvasive epilepsy tracking, and assessing patient engagement during neurorehabilitation,” she said. “Its comfort and unobtrusiveness make it especially appealing for pediatric or geriatric use.”

The temporary e-tattoo also holds a cost advantage over traditional EEG systems, with the e-tattoo chips and battery pack priced at $200 and disposable sensors about $20 each.

“Being low-cost makes the device accessible,” study co-author Luis Sentis, PhD, also from The University of Texas at Austin, said in a news release. “One of my wishes is to turn the e-tattoo into a product we can wear at home.”

Currently, the e-tattoo works only on hairless skin but the researchers are working to combine it with ink-based sensors that work on hair. For this new study, Lu also noted that EEG signals were postprocessed and the predictions done offline.

“To make this technology really valuable, we can and need to achieve real-time mental workload assessment and provide timely micro-interventions, such as visual or audio alerts on the phone or even electro tactile stimulations applied to the skin by the e-tattoo before performance decline or burnout occurs,” she said.

“Evaluating these micro-interventions in real-world applications may prove our EEG system's capacity to significantly improve human-AI collaborations,” Sentis told Medscape Medical News.

Lu reported support from the US Army Research Office. The authors declared no competing interests.

 May 30, 2025  

For the first time, an international expert panel has developed referral criteria for specialist palliative care for patients with dementia, which could help standardize referral across various care settings and lead to earlier referral.

With more than 55 million people living with dementia worldwide — more than 6 million in the United States alone — the guidance is sorely needed.

The lack of uniform criteria has meant that many patients with dementia who might have benefited from an interdisciplinary palliative care team received the services too late — if at all, Panelist Yuchieh Kathryn Chang, DO, told Medscape Medical News.

“Unfortunately, current practice often sees specialist palliative care referrals occurring late in the dementia illness trajectory,” said Chang, with the Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.

So Chang and more than 60 other dementia experts spent nearly 2 years developing a list of 15 major and 42 minor criteria for specialist palliative care referral. Their work was published on May 14 in JAMA Network Open.

Dementia is a growing public health issue, with prevalence expected to triple by 2050 due to population aging.

“Patients with dementia have many supportive care needs, such as distressing symptoms, information gaps, complex decisions, and fragmented care coordination,” Chang said. “Their families also often experience significant caregiver burden. Many of these may be better addressed with specialist palliative care teams.” 

The World Health Organization identifies specialist palliative care as a component of comprehensive dementia care, yet referrals are often late or inconsistent.

A systematic review by Chang and colleagues found considerable heterogeneity in the referral criteria for patients with dementia to specialist palliative care, suggesting a lack of uniformity in clinical practice.

To address this gap, a multidisciplinary panel of 63 expert clinicians from five continents were invited to take part in three rounds of Delphi surveys to rate 83 putative referral criteria, which were generated from a prior systematic review and steering committee discussion.

Panelists were required to have expertise in geriatrics, neurology, psychiatry, and/or palliative care, with at least 5 years post-qualification clinical experience with patients with dementia and an affiliation with a center offering specialist dementia care.

Reviews of the first Delphi round survey took place in September 2022, with the final round concluding in February 2023.

More than 90% of panelists participated in all three survey rounds. From the 83 initial proposed criteria for specialist palliative care referral, panelists achieved consensus on 15 “major” referral criteria, with a level of agreement at 70% or higher.

The 15 major criteria fall under five categories broadly classified as needs-based criteria (symptom distress and psychosocial factors or decision-making) and disease-based criteria (dementia type, comorbidities or complications, and hospital use).

The panelists determined that six of the eight needs-based referral criteria and four of the seven disease-based referral criteria are appropriate starting at the moderate stage of dementia — a nod to earlier referral — while the rest are applicable only for patients at the severe stage.

The six needs-based criteria appropriate for referral at the moderate stage are severe physical symptoms; severe spiritual or existential distress; request for hastened death, assisted suicide, euthanasia; hospice referral or discussion; patient or family request; and patient and/or family decline to seek care at an acute care facility.

“For example, patients with refractory physical symptoms, even though they are not in a severe stage of dementia, should be referred to specialist palliative care to address their specific needs while continuing overall care with the referring physician,” the authors advised.

The four disease-based criteria for referral at the moderate stage are rapidly progressive dementia; withdrawal or de-escalation of life-prolonging interventions; two or more episodes of aspiration pneumonia in the past year; and one or more intensive care unit admissions within the past 3 months.

Although 70% of panelists agreed that fulfilling even one criterion meant palliative care referral was appropriate, they also said that failure to meet any of the 15 major criteria does not necessarily mean that they are not candidates for specialist palliative care.

They also identified 42 “minor” referral criteria that may, in combination, be considered as potential triggers for specialist palliative care referral.

The panel cautioned, however, that future research needs to examine how to best incorporate the minor criteria and whether their use might result in earlier referral.

The panel did not reach consensus regarding referral criteria for early-stage dementia, “an outcome we interpret as an emphasis on a balanced approach between primary and specialist palliative care roles,” Chang told Medscape Medical News.

The panel also could not reach consensus on functional impairment or time-based factors or family/caregiver distress/burden as major referral criteria.

They acknowledged that this was “somewhat surprising” given that functional impairment and time-based factors are commonly considered in the literature and family/caregiver distress/burden is an area that specialist palliative care is known to focus on.

Laura Morrison, MD, with the Yale Palliative Care Program at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, was also surprised by the lack of consensus in prioritizing family and caregiver focused dementia referral criteria.

“I hope this can be an area of focused investigation going forward given that that number of caregivers is increasing quickly with many of the needs well documented,” Morrison told Medscape Medical News.

“With the enormous toll on the family/caregiver in dementia, exploring the lack of prioritization is warranted,” Morrison wrote in an invited commentary on the referral criteria.

“Another priority area in my mind is how to apply the international perspective and expertise represented by these consensus criteria to the breadth of international settings, accounting for the rich diversity of cultural practices and available health care and financial resources,” Morrison said.

Given limited specialist palliative care resources, a set of simple, robust, and valid criteria may help identify a subgroup of patients with dementia most likely benefit from specialist palliative care referral (as opposed to primary palliative care alone), thereby improving timely access and resource use, the panel said.

“We envision these consensus referral criteria as a first step to help clinicians, such as geriatric, neurology, and primary care teams, to identify patients who may be appropriate for specialist palliative care referral,” Chang told Medscape Medical News.

The fact that panelists felt that most of the major referral criteria can be applied starting at the moderate stage supports earlier referral. In fact, 75% of the experts noted that patients in their own clinical settings were referred to specialist palliative care too late in the course of their dementia.

“We advocate for earlier referral than is typical, drawing on the benefits observed in oncology (improved symptom control, mood, patient and caregiver satisfaction, quality end-of-life care, and survival), while acknowledging that further research is necessary to determine if these benefits translate to the dementia care setting,” Chang said.

The next step is to test the referral criteria in clinical settings or in clinical trials to study whether they can be used to improve the referral process and boost patient and caregiver outcomes.

“These criteria are intended as an initial step in this direction. It is crucial to emphasize that they are meant to support, not replace, clinical judgment,” Chang said.

Morrison told Medscape Medical News the proposed criteria are “an important contribution in providing a broad perspective on all the considerations for possible referral and the areas where consensus is still lacking. Clinicians and investigators can now begin to test models of delivery with different proposed criteria and measure patient- and family-centered outcomes.”

This research had no commercial funding. Chang and Morrison declared no relevant conflicts of interest.

The well-documented link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity in both children and adults has typically been attributed to individual traits and behaviors, with limited attention paid to environmental and social factors.

However, a new study challenged this perspective, proposing that ADHD may contribute to obesity by reducing physical activity — a connection shaped by the urban environment in which a person lives.

“Our research reveals a surprising urban advantage: As cities grow, both obesity and ADHD rates decrease proportionally,” first author Tian Gan, a PhD student at the Center for Urban Science and Progress, NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, New York, said in a news release.

Larger cities may offer “protective factors against these interconnected health challenges,” Gan added, citing access to better mental health care, education, and opportunities for recreation and physical activity.

The study was published online in PLOS Complex Systems.

While impulsivity — a core ADHD trait — has long been suspected to contribute to weight gain through poor food choices and reduced physical activity, this new study highlighted how an individual's urban environment can either amplify or dampen those risks.

Researchers analyzed public health data from 915 cities in the United States using “urban scaling” methods, which describe how features of cities change with population size.

They observed that both obesity and ADHD prevalence decrease “sublinearly” with population — meaning that as cities grow, the per capita prevalence of these conditions declines. At the same time, access to mental health care and higher education rises “superlinearly,” growing faster than the population.

In other words, larger cities seem to offer not just more services, but disproportionately more support for conditions linked to impulsivity, the authors theorized.

But city size alone doesn't tell the whole story.

Using advanced causal discovery methods, the researchers mapped a network of interrelated variables. ADHD prevalence was linked to higher physical inactivity, which in turn increased obesity. Access to mental health care helped reduce inactivity and indirectly lowered obesity risk. Higher prevalence of college education correlated with better mental health access and more physical activity.

This causal map revealed a dynamic system in which impulsivity, health behaviors, and urban infrastructure interact — suggesting that city environments can either reinforce or weaken these effects.

The link between ADHD and obesity was stronger in cities with fewer opportunities for physical activity or greater food insecurity and weaker in cities with better access to mental health care and higher education levels, they explained.

To validate their findings, the researchers examined individual-level data from the National Survey of Children's Health, which included 19,333 US children. This analysis confirmed the city-level data: Children with more severe ADHD were more likely to be obese, especially when physical activity and household education were low.

Taken together, the findings reinforce evidence that ADHD contributes to obesity and point to the urban environment as a potentially modifiable target for intervention, the authors said.

“These findings underscore the importance of city-level interventions in mitigating the impact of impulsivity disorders on the obesity epidemic,” Maurizio Porfiri, PhD, who heads the Center for Urban Science and Progress at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, added in the news release.

The study had no commercial funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to a fourfold increased risk for early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), results from the largest, population-based cohort study of its kind to date showed.

The findings indicated “that there can be shared biological drivers behind ASD and Parkinson's disease,” study investigator, Weiyao Yin, MD, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, said in a release.

“One hypothesis is that the brain's dopamine system is affected in both cases, since the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important part in social behavior and motion control,” Yin added.

The study was published online on May 27 in JAMA Neurology.

Recent research pointed to a plausible biological link between ASD and PD. However, large, longitudinal studies investigating the risk for PD following an ASD diagnosis are scarce, the researchers noted.

“Our study is the first population-based study, to our knowledge, using prospectively collected data, longitudinal design, and life-course approach to strengthen the inference,” they wrote.

To investigate they used national registry data from more than 2 million individuals born in Sweden between 1974 and 1999 and followed them from age 20 years up to the end of 2022. The median age at study exit was 34 years.

Within this cohort, they identified 51,954 individuals with ASD and 2,226,611 individuals without the disorder.

PD, defined as a first-ever diagnosis of PD or other idiopathic or degenerative parkinsonian disorders, was identified in 438 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years) and in 24 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 cases per 100,000 person-years), corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 4.43.

Depression and antidepressant use were present in 46.7% of individuals with ASD, and antipsychotic use, which can cause Parkinson-like symptoms, was present in 31.5%.

Adjusting for depression and antipsychotic use reduced but did not eliminate the association between ASD and PD risk (RR, 3.10 and RR, 2.00, respectively).

Independent of ASD diagnosis, a history of depression and exposure to antipsychotics were linked to a significantly higher risk for PD (RR, 2.01 and RR, 6.34, respectively).

Preterm or early-term birth is a known risk factor for ASD, prompting an examination of its potential association with PD. However, no increased risk for PD was found compared with individuals born at full term.

After adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, and parental mental illness or PD, the investigators found ASD remained consistently associated with an increased risk for PD.

There are potential biological explanations for the link, Yin told Medscape Medical News.

“One hypothesis suggests that the brain's dopamine system is impacted in both conditions, as the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a crucial role in social behavior and motor control,” Yin said.

There may be a genetic correlation between the two conditions, she added noting that the PARK2 gene may be associated between ASD and early-onset PD.

“ASD is a lifelong condition, and more children with autism now progress into middle and older adulthood. Healthcare services need to provide long-term monitoring for individuals with ASD — a vulnerable group with high comorbidity and a high use of psychotropic medications,” Yin said.

The study is clinically relevant “mainly because it shows that neurodevelopmental conditions, like ASD, may be associated with clinical signs and diagnoses that may manifest at different ages, and we as clinicians should be aware of that,” Christos Ganos, MD, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who was not involved with the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“Although neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed early in life, there is a need to assess for neurological symptoms and signs also later in life, including to monitor the effects of prescribed medications on neuromotor control,” added Ganos, who is the wolf chair in neurodevelopmental psychiatry, and associate professor of neurology at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

However, he urged caution in linking the specific diagnoses of ASD and PD, as there is a more general link between neurodevelopmental disorders and motor dysfunction.

“Neurodevelopmental disorders are very heterogeneous, and the ‘ASD' diagnosis encompasses a lot of different disorders and etiologies. Some of these diagnoses/conditions are linked to motor syndromes that are specifically associated with motor slowing but are not PD, although they could resemble some of its features,” he explained.

Strengths of the study include its large sample size and statistical power to provide estimates “with more meaningful precision than prior studies,” said Connie Marras, MD, PhD, a movement disorders specialist, and professor of neurology at the University of Toronto.

However, she noted that investigators did not include smoking in the models, which “may result in an overestimation of the association between ASD and PD,” she added. “Smoking is less common among individuals with ASD and may constitute a confounder. Smoking is also less common in individuals with Parkinson's disease and is considered a protective factor against PD.”

She also questioned whether the results really have clinical implications for monitoring the emergence of parkinsonism in this population.

“Early detection does not have treatment implications currently, particularly since at present we don't have therapies for PD prevention or slowing of progression. Once we do have such treatments, then monitoring would be justified,” she said.

However, the finding “could have significant clinical and policy-related implications as these individuals age,” Gregory Wallace, PhD, an autism expert and associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences at The George Washington University, Washington, DC, who was not part of the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“Given increased rates of autism diagnoses in younger cohorts, if autistic people are at increased risk for developing parkinsonism as they age, the healthcare system and clinicians who provide care for autistic adults need to be prepared,” said Wallace.

Wallace recently published research showing that co-occurring parkinsonism in adults with autism is linked with lower subjective quality of life, more memory problems, lower sleep quality, and greater depression symptoms.

This study was supported by grants from the Simons Foundation, Swedish Research Council, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation, and the Beatrice and Samuel A. Seaver Foundation. Yin reported no disclosures. Coauthors' disclosures included receiving grants from Janssen, MSD, and Takeda outside the submitted work (Ludvigsson), and personal fees for consulting from Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic outside the submitted work (Figee). Ganos, Marras, and Wallace reported no disclosures.

PHOENIX — The overlapping symptoms of menopause and multiple sclerosis (MS) in aging women may warrant hormone replacement therapy (HRT), says one expert, who argues that the potential benefits in easing the combined symptom burden outweigh the therapy's modest risks.

It is suspected but not proven that menopause increases the risk and severity of menopausal symptoms such as urinary dysfunction, vasomotor dysregulation, disturbed sleep, and anxiety, but it is known that HRT offers benefit against these, said Kate Petheram, MD, a consultant neurologist for the Royal Sunderland Hospital, Sunderland, UK.

In women with MS, “there is a clear benefit from controlling symptoms associated with menopause even if we do not know yet whether the benefit involves reducing symptoms driven by MS,” Petheram reported.

The modest amount of attention paid to the overlap between symptoms of MS and menopause is an important issue for a disease with a 3:1 female to male ratio, said Petheram, in a May 29 presentation at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting. 

Speaking at a symposium dedicated to the topic, Petheram noted that her audience was almost entirely female: a pattern she has observed in previous iterations of the same talk. She urged all neurologists to recognize the interplay between menopause and MS, emphasizing that 30% of people with MS are peri- or postmenopausal women.

In the UK, as in the US, prescriptions for HRT plummeted following the 2002 publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI): a study involving more than 16,000 participants that was halted after 5.2 years of follow-up. 

At the time, a widely used combination of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone was linked to several risks — including breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke — that were deemed to outweigh its symptomatic benefits. 

Subsequent data have refuted most of those claims, said Petheram, who described the WHI study design as flawed. In fact, current evidence suggests HRT lowers cardiovascular risk.

While it does increase the risk of breast cancer, she noted that the increase is modest — and importantly, the risk of dying from breast cancer is not significantly elevated.

Yet the reexamination of the evidence has never received the attention needed to shift perceptions shaped by the original WHI study, said Petheram. She described a “loss of confidence” in HRT that has been only modestly reversed in the UK and not at all in the US. Drawing on published data, she noted that HRT use among menopausal women remains below 5% in the US, compared to 15% in the UK. 

This poses a particular challenge for women with MS, given the overlap between menopausal symptoms and MS-related complaints. While some issues — such as anxiety and sleep disturbances — may be managed with other therapies, HRT remains one of the most effective treatments for vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and urinary complaints.

Both historical and emerging evidence suggest that HRT can reduce symptoms shared by MS and menopause, Petheram said. In the observational Nurses' Health Study — a 2016 analysis published in Neurology, for example — women with MS who began HRT 3-10 years after their final menstrual period showed significant improvements across multiple validated quality-of-life measures compared to those who did not use HRT.

“Menopausal women do well on HRT, and they do less well when they quit,” said Petheram, citing multiple studies, including several published in recent years. While she acknowledged that HRT is not a panacea, she emphasized that it remains the only therapy that effectively targets the wide range of symptoms common to both MS and menopause.

The ability to address a wide range of symptoms is a significant advantage. Citing fatigue, mood disorders, and sexual and urinary issues as the most common overlapping complaints, Petheram noted that HRT offers additional documented benefits — such as improved bone health — that are meaningful not only to aging women in general, but especially to those with MS.

This message is starting to gain traction in the UK, but Jennifer Graves, MD, PhD, director of the Neuroimmunology Research Program at the University of California, San Diego, acknowledged that it will be a tougher sell in the US without targeted education to overcome longstanding biases.

“The WHI is still being taught in some medical schools,” she said. While she agreed that some of the most serious risks linked to HRT in the WHI have since been rescinded — warranting a reassessment of the benefit-to-risk ratio — she also emphasized that aging and menopause in women with MS remain largely overlooked. 

“We need greater awareness of the challenges of menopause in women with MS and I think this involves better educating clinicians about how aging, menopause, and MS intersect,” Graves said. 

Petheram clarified that she doesn't prescribe HRT to women with MS, but she does discuss the overlap between menopausal and MS symptoms — explaining both the potential benefits and risks to help patients make informed decisions. She believes all neurologists should take responsibility for understanding the interaction between menopause and MS in order to better manage overlapping symptoms.

Petheram reports financial relationships with Novartis, Merck, Roche, Sanofi, and Biogen. Graves reports no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was more prevalent in children and adolescents with severe obesity, with these patients showing more pronounced insulin resistance and a higher number of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components.

""MAFLD is a predictor of developing MetS and an increased risk of its components, especially glucose metabolism disorders. Therefore, patients diagnosed with MAFLD should be under special medical supervision for the detection and prevention of metabolic complications,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Magdalena Mierzwa, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland. It was published online on May 20, 2025, in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

Ultrasound-based steatosis assessments varied by centre, potentially leading to discrepancies due to subjective assessment. This cross-sectional study involved only children and adolescents with severe obesity, thereby limiting generalizability.

This study was supported by the National Science Center, Poland. One author reported being employed by Mediagnost GmbH.

This discussion was recorded on May 7, 2025. This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Robert D. Glatter, MD: Hi, and welcome. I'm Dr Robert Glatter, a member of the Medscape Emergency Medicine editorial board. 

Joining me today to discuss the new MAX docuseries, The Pitt, a depiction of daily struggles and realities of life in a busy level-one trauma center, are Dr Amy Ho, an emergency physician and member of the Medscape Emergency Medicine editorial board; Dr Nicholas Cozzi, an emergency physician and medical director of EMS and disaster medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago; and finally, Dr Mel Herbert, an emergency physician and founder of a popular educational podcast known as EM:RAP (Emergency Medicine: Reviews and Perspectives) , a lifelong educator, and medical consultant for The Pitt as well as ER from the early 1990s. Welcome everyone.

Amy Faith Ho, MD, MPH: Thanks for having us.

Mel E. Herbert, MD: Nice to be here.

Nicholas P. Cozzi, MD, MBA: Thank you.

Glatter: It's great to have everyone here. The Pitt, in my opinion, is one of the most influential and powerful series. It's so unique in that each episode is represented by 1 hour of an emergency department (ED) shift. That differentiates it from other past medical docudramas that you may have seen, such as ER. In reality, we know that an hour really passes quite quickly in any given shift. The show encapsulates the stressful clinical scenarios and interpersonal relationships that occur in any given ED shift, and it resonated with me and my colleagues.

Mel, I wanted to get your feedback on how you chose to proceed with advising directors and producers on the show to provide real-world scenarios that could inform the audience, as well as emergency physicians, on how we manage complex situations, specifically families and bystanders, but also accurately depict how residents interact with other residents and attending physicians.

Herbert: First of all, thanks for having me on the show. The Pitt has obviously become this huge hit, more than anybody — even we — expected. I have to give credit where credit is due. Scott Gemmill is the show creator and the show runner, and it was his idea to come up with this hourly format. He met with John Wells, the producer who did ER, and John was very clear and was like, “We don't want to do just another medical TV show. We want to do the best one. How do we make it the best? How do we make it different? How do we make it real, but also entertaining?” 

That's when Scott came up with this idea that 1 hour of the show would be 1 hour of a shift. It was an incredibly insightful idea. 

The next person is Joe Sachs, MD, an emergency physician who has been practicing for 35 years. He was the main medical writer on ER, and he brought me in for the last six seasons of ER as a consultant. About 2 years ago, Joe said, “Mel, we're going to do this new show. I think it's going be fantastic. Do you want to be a consultant again?” I'm like, absolutely. 

On that first season, I was consultant, and that basically meant that Joe would contact me multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. We would go over cases and talk about how this case would really work out and what would be the dialogue between physicians, and he'd run stuff by me.

For the second season, he said, “That's great, but now I need you in the writers' room.” For season 2, I'm actually a staff writer and consultant with Joe, and that's been an incredibly fun experience. I've never really done it at this level — to be sitting there with the writers and actually, from day one, going through all of the cases. 

The key thing is to make it accurate. That's what we want to do. You can never be 100% accurate because it is still television, but we're making it as accurate as possible and the doctors, nurses, and everybody loves it. Many of them say, “I can't watch it. It's too accurate.”

Glatter: Many people are triggered by it, and my colleagues have talked about this. When they watch it, they feel like they're in it. 

Nick, let me bring you into this. Your article in Time was an excellent summary of the experience of so many of us, and you explain it as cathartic. I was hoping you could explain the catharsis and your thesis of your Time magazine article to the audience.

Cozzi: Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. Mel, congratulations, and great job on everything you've done, along with Joe Sachs, on The Pitt. Time magazine approached us with that thesis: “We hear it's too triggering for emergency physicians to watch The Pitt. They feel as though they are back at work in the department, and they don't want to watch it. ”It's not just emergency physicians, but anybody who works in the ER. They asked, “Dr Cozzi, do you agree with that?” I said, “No.”

Just because it's stressful and depicts what is happening, we should not avert our gaze. We shouldn't shield our eyes. We need the entire healthcare system and the entire country's eyes on what is actually happening — the brokenness of our healthcare system and how emergency physicians and those who work in the ER each and every day are dealing with this struggle. That's where Time really understood what we were trying to do.

More than anything, Mel, more than being accurate on a medical diagnosis, you pulled the curtain back and showed what's happening with hospital boarding. You pulled the curtain back to show what's happening with patients in the waiting room, with patients in the hallway, and with loved ones and members of their family. 

What we tried to do with the Time article was provide a way for the lay public to understand hospital boarding, to understand that it's not indifference from emergency teams, but it's the healthcare system pushing down on too few shoulders. Thank you, Mel, and it's a pleasure to be with you.

Glatter: Amy, how did the show impact you and your colleagues? Did you feel that you were in it as you watched the episodes?

Ho: I think so. I feel what Nick said and obviously what Mel said about it being so medically accurate. To me, the pieces that tug at your heartstrings are not the medical accuracy. To be honest, I was inspired to ultrasound more because I'm like, they ultrasound everything, I should ultrasound more. 

The parts that get me, my colleagues, and many women, especially, in medicine are the humanist pieces. I don't think this is a big spoiler, but there's a miscarriage of a physician on shift. The response that had from women who had the exact same experience — went to the bathroom, miscarried, popped back out, and saw more patients — was so true and is not talked about. 

It's those pieces of what makes emergency medicine special and what makes it hard that we don't talk about that The Pitt brought out and gave us the feeling like we were seen. The pediatric death was another incredible example of that. 

Mel, I have say that I'm a big fan of what you do and what you say on EM:RAP all the time—that what you do matters. The Pitt did an incredible storytelling of exactly that, of what you do matters.

Glatter: The storytelling is so impactful. It really resonated with me to the point where you can't stop watching it. You go episode to episode because it's that hour-to-hour transition and you want to know what happens next. 

I do want to quote one of the paragraphs that Nick wrote in his Time piece. It resonates with me and hopefully with others: “For an emergency medicine physician, a typical shift is a front-row seat to the worst day of people's lives — a whirlwind of drama, frustration, quiet victories, devastating losses, and unfiltered humanity. And then, it's onto the next patient's room to do it all over again.” 

That really resonated with me. We do it all again because that's our training. We're tired, we're fatigued, we're hungry, but we move on to the next patient. We're dedicated. I want to commend you on this piece because after watching the show and then reading your piece, it just really made complete sense.

Cozzi: Thank you very much. I've heard from physicians around the country, and those in healthcare that, like Amy said, are “feeling seen in a way that The Pitt depicts.” If my piece helps with individuals feeling that, it's a great honor. 

When I think about Noah Wyle, for example, being the star as John Carter in the 1990s show ER and now the burnished, seasoned attending physician later on in his career on The Pitt as Dr Robby, I think of the transition we're all making in our own lives, whether we were practicing back then or now we're taking on the next step of our journey. 

People who saw ER in the 1990s and now are watching The Pitt see somebody making that full circle in his own life. Teaching, training, communicating, but not being afraid of showing emotion and being a human being in unrealized or unimaginable situations. 

Amy, you brought up the loss of a child and dealing with a pandemic — themes that, for example, Mel on EM:RAP covered during COVID for emergency physicians. It wasn't triggering, but rather created a cathartic environment where emergency clinicians felt seen. In a way, Noah Wyle has come full circle in his role as an emergency physician and also has never lost sight of not only optimism and realism, but also being able to be a human being in unimaginable situations.

Glatter: Mel, I'll commend you. Dr Robby's character is so well developed. He's on the brink every time and about to break down. He goes into a room, he's crying, and needs another resident to pick him up. That, to me, is emblematic of the system and where we're at. The emotional weight of what we deal with on a daily basis impacts us, and Nick's article points to that fact. 

The character development was very important here. I assume that you made that clear to the directors and producers.

Herbert: Again, I have to give real props to Joe Sachs, who is really the guy when it comes to the medical stuff. 

Noah Wyle is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet. He is just a good person, and he cares deeply about emergency medicine. For his arc as an actor, the most important thing he ever did was be on ER. 

He's had physicians over the years come up to him and say, “I became a doctor because of you.” “I became a nurse because of you.” He really wanted to come back because physicians and nurses were coming to him and saying, “We're in trouble. Emergency medicine is in trouble, we're burning out, people are dying. Could you come back?” 

That's when he got together with John Wells, Scott Gemmill, and Joe Sachs to say, “Let's do this again. Let's do it right.” They wanted to depict what's it really like, not like on other TV shows, but what's really happening — the boarding crisis, the stress, COVID, the burnout that physicians are feeling, and the systems issues — and they wanted to make that real. 

Noah is such an incredible actor now. He was a pretty good actor back on ER, He is now the full professor of emergency medicine acting. He's so good. When you see that scene where he loses it, I think every emergency physician, myself included, has been there and are just like, oh my God, that's me.

This theme we keep hearing — which is that for the first time, emergency physicians feel like they're being seen — is one of the most gratifying things. Family members can now look at the show and know what Dad or Mom does for a living for the first time.

Glatter: Amy, as residents and medical students are watching the show, do you think in some ways it might turn them away? The Match this year was very productive, but when you look at a show like this that depicts emergency medicine and what we deal with — obviously, there's positives and negatives with any specialty — do you feel that it has the potential to scare away some very promising residents and medical students?

Ho: That's a great question. I'm a millennial so I was a bit too young to watch ER, and there were really no shows until The Pitt that were as accurate. I think The Pitt will have the effect that ER did, which is actually get people more interested in emergency medicine. You see what's really great about it, and you see the downsides of it, but it sparks something in us and what attracts us to emergency medicine. We want to make a change for the patient that is so vulnerable in front of us, that we're helping, but we also want to make a change for the system, which is oftentimes why we get so frustrated. 

The Pitt will help captivate the right people to go into emergency medicine, and in many ways, show an incredibly honest depiction for people who maybe thought they wanted to go to emergency medicine and didn't. 

Rob, you and I have talked about this on Medscape before. One of the biggest reasons for people leaving emergency medicine is because the field isn't what they thought it was. The Pitt helps give you really honest story of what you're getting into. It's incredible. Yes, it's hard at times, but you can make a difference.

Glatter: It's dedication. In his 2022 article in The New England Journal of Medicine, Walter O'Donnell talks about administrative harm and the systemic issues. Addressing administrative burden is certainly relevant here. 

The show opens up the whole hornet's nest on what really is going on — a broken system, Nick, that you write about, the boarding crisis, the shortage of nurses — things that have to be addressed that are still not being addressed. 

When I started practicing, these issues were there. They still have not been handled. Why isn't there a larger movement to address the systemic issues so that personally, individuals can survive? How do we fix this broken system? What is the real key to finally gaining traction?

Cozzi: That's an excellent question. I think about the most common questions people are asking me about The Pitt. They aren't, “Can you really do a burr hole with an IO (ie, an intraosseous device)? Can you do that type of procedure? Is that accurate in terms of a cardiac arrest?” 

What they're asking me more often than not is, “Is that what it's really like trying to save someone's life, and a hospital administrator is asking you about patient satisfaction scores? Is that what it's really like when you try to take care of a patient and there's no beds upstairs that have nursing staff assigned to them?” 

That to me is fascinating because that's the first step. It's getting the general public to understand beyond the resuscitations, and beyond the complex saving of lives. It's making seen what is very complex and has been behind the barrier. When patients come to our ER, as Amy, you, and Mel know, and they see that 14-hour wait, they don't understand. They think it's indifference. They believe it's because we're not taking care of them. 

This is trying to unlock that door so people could see the systemic issues that, for a long time, had been behind the curtain. The first step is the public understanding how broken this all is — the mismatch of finance, the mismatch of allocation, and the value-based system that we're not having right now.

How do you have a complex conversation about hospital boarding that isn't throwing facts at people, but in a way of putting yourself in that position if you're the family member with your loved one in the hallway and you're not seeing them being taken care of? That's the first step. 

That's what The Pitt does differently than any other show is that they're talking about those issues —staffing, nursing shortages, and the boarding crisis — in a way that's palatable and can be received by the general nonmedical public.

Glatter: Amy, on a congressional level, is there any way to address what Nick is pointing to? There needs to be systemic change, legislative changes, not just at the state level but really at the national level.

Ho: Absolutely. Nick makes a good point that the first step is to educate. Educate yourselves, voters, patients, and anyone in the healthcare system, which is really all citizens. 

The second step is advocate. We have multiple national organizations — the American Medical Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) — and most of them are very involved in the boarding crisis. There is a boarding summit. Multiple states have passed various legislation about boarding and wait times in EDs. 

There is always discussion on Medicare reimbursement. There's always discussion on value-based programs, including the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), on which ones matter and which ones are just administrative burden. There are many national health care safety scores like Leapfrog, which is really incentivizing for hospitals to address.

All of these are avenues to advocate. You can advocate by voting. You can advocate by getting involved with your organization. You can advocate by just speaking. This is the age of social media where you can talk about it. 

We're starting to see changes. The National Boarding Summit had multiple, very discrete recommendations. Leapfrog just added ER boarding onto one of the tenets that they're trying to get data on to help rank hospitals. We're seeing a move because people are getting educated and then advocating.

Glatter: Mel, have you seen any changes as a result of your national involvement in a show that's become such an impactful type of experience for not just physicians, but for the public?

Herbert: The answer to that is yes, because of what's happening right now. Noah, Joe, and I are constantly trying to write, and in between the writing, we're talking to people across the country and across the world. It's elevated this discussion and that's the most important thing. We are not saying what the solution is. There are people with degrees in this who need to come up with these solutions. 

If we can show exactly what it's like, how bad it is, and how close it is to falling off the cliff, then maybe people like Amy can help us push it across the line. We don't have the solutions, but we can tell you what the problems look like. 

I was just interviewing Al Sacchetti, David Schriger, and Peter Vicellio— three legends in our field — and they had very different ideas about what to do. Some of them were saying we should go on strike; the only way this is going to get fixed is if we make a crisis and we fix it. There were other guys like Al Sacchetti, who was like, I can't do that. I have to look after the patients. I can't not be there and do this. 

Part of the problem is that ER docs will always try to fix the problem. We will always go into the waiting room and try to go as fast as we can to help people. That is actually not going to fix the system. We need somebody from outside to say, “You're going as fast as you can. We need to get you help.” If we can use this show to tell those stories in Congress or wherever it needs to be, have at it.

Glatter: One thing I want to focus on is violence against healthcare workers. There's a scene where the charge nurse gets punched in the face by a patient who retaliated for a long waiting time. That resonated with so many of us because it's happened where I've worked and I'm sure where many of you have worked.

How did you set that scene? What was in your mind and how did you approach it?

Herbert: Again, that's all to Joe. You need to know that Joe was my attending at UCLA when I first got off the boat from Australia. I love Joe. It was him and the writers sitting around like, what are the issues? Workplace violence was one of the top issues to talk about. 

There was a study that came out that reported that, for ER nurses, about once in every three shifts, there is violence against them, either verbal or physical. I think it's about three times a shift, depending on how you define it. It's really a problem. 

During COVID, it became worse. There was this weird thing where people would stop believing in science and stop believing in doctors, but then when they were critical, they would come in, ask for their ivermectin, and would be outraged when you said, “That doesn't work. Let's try and help you with stuff that does work.” It has become an epidemic. 

It was always bad in emergency medicine. As Nicholas pointed out, we get to see people on their worst day. We get to see all of the problems of society filtered to the ED. Violence is a big problem in this country, as it is in many countries. Guess where that all comes to? It comes to the ED, and it is often then displayed against emergency physicians, nurses, and everybody that works there. It is a crisis. 

I got an email recently from somebody saying, “Please be careful about how you depict this, because we don't want people to think this is normal or it should be acceptable.” Unfortunately, it is normal. It is not acceptable.

Glatter: Absolutely. it is not acceptable. We can't normalize it, but we have to depict it. Unless you show the public what's truly going on, they won't understand. As emergency physicians, we get it, and we have to put a stop to this. Legally, I believe it is a felony for attacking a health care worker. Is that correct?

Herbert: It's state by state. Arizona has a very strong rule. One of the things that we do on The Pitt is we bring in experts to talk to the writers within the writers' room. There is legislation in Arizona, for example. I don't know exactly what level. Before this legislation passed, you got in more trouble for kicking the neighbor's dog than for punching the ER nurse, literally.

In Arizona, they've passed these laws, and there are many more laws in other states that are working their way through the system, which as we all know is quite slow. We need things like that, and it needs to be very clear. Just because you're pissed off, angry, and have waited a long time, violence is no way to get this fixed. You could be in big trouble if you pursue that.

Glatter: Absolutely. Nick, in your ED, are you seeing quite a bit of violence against healthcare workers?

Cozzi: Every day, whether it's physical violence or the violence that Mel so eloquently stated is happening. Perhaps gender-specific differences, with women being more likely to experience that violence, suggestive comments, and things of that nature that are being underreported. Mel answering that person's letter, saying that it is normal but not acceptable is absolutely the right solution.

I think back to Time in the early 1990s. They had a cover article that said the ED is at the brink. We're in 2025 and the ED is still at the brink, but it's worsened because of the social issues that we're talking about. 

Healthcare workers and those in the ED did not choose law enforcement. No one should feel unsafe going to work every day that their lives are in trouble. We had an emergency physician in Chicago that got stabbed in the chest during a patient encounter a few months ago. Luckily, he survived, and I understand he's doing well. 

That's just one story of so many. We see it every week and every day around this country. There has to be an opportunity. I'm very thankful that the airline industry has found the opportunities to understand the violence happening on airplanes or in airports, and how those individuals are being dealt with in a very firm fashion. 

If we're bound by the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA), a federal mandate to evaluate anybody who walks through our doors, then there should be federal things on our books to be able to protect our workers, with caveats for those who do not have medical decision-making capacity and those experiencing crisis in different ways. 

We have to find unique solutions, and this is one of the areas that I think is different from the early 1990s because of the way society perhaps has caught up. We can't waste this moment that Mel, Joe, and Noah have provided us at this time.

Glatter: I agree. Amy, any thoughts you want to add to that?

Ho: Workplace violence is a huge problem, extremely common, and rampantly underreported. Luckily, the majority of states have a felony or some kind of zero tolerance law, so this is an instance where advocacy has really worked. 

The piece that The Pitt really helps with is people who are angry because they've been waiting, and they think the charge nurse, the attending, or whichever staff member is representative of that and part of that. What the Pitt does beautifully is it divorces the staff, who are just as frustrated, from this concept of the system. 

Since The Pitt came out, I've already had patients that I see in the ED, where they'll be in the hallway and will tell me, “Wow, this is just like The Pitt,” and they mean it positively. They are in a hallway bed and they kind of understand why in a way. They're not mad at me, which is this change that I've really seen since the show came out. That's been an incredible testament to what it means for not only us in the field, but also for laypeople in understanding what is healthcare today.

Glatter: One last thing I do want to discuss is how residents relate to other residents. This was depicted in the show — showing toxicity, microaggressions, and other things that were tolerated. This is an area that was well documented in the show, Mel, and is so important to highlight.

Herbert: Residency is hard. You just think about these poor young adults who have gone through high school and achieved at the highest level. Then they go through college, achieve at the highest level, then go through med school, achieve at the highest level. They have hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of debt and then they do residency, and they're sleep deprived and shifting from days to nights. It's a very difficult job, and trying to depict that is really important.

My experience, though, is that residents are really good to each other. In general, overwhelmingly really good to each other. There are some that sort of crack. When you see that resident that's having these microaggressions toward other residents, your first thought should not be that this is a bad person. Your first thought should be that this person is struggling. How do we help them? It is a very difficult thing. 

At LA County years ago, we did a snap survey of over 60 residents, and 30% of them had had suicidal ideation in the past month. Just think about that — 30% of them. It's a tough job. I think residency directors are much better now than they used to be about understanding the mental health of the residents and being much more in tune with it. I hope that comes through in season 2.

Glatter: Absolutely. We're looking forward to that. Amy and Nick, I want to get your thoughts about mental health in your EDs. How is that approached, and is there an acute awareness as Mel is describing?

Ho: Every person that goes into emergency medicine, just like any person, has their own demons. What emergency medicine forces you to do is it not only puts you in a pressure cooker just by the setting, the time issues, and many frustrations, but oftentimes it puts you face to face with some of your own weaknesses and some of your own fears. It's very obvious in the show when a resident is triggered by something that she clearly experienced in her own life, and now a patient is reflecting back to her something that she herself had been extremely traumatized by. 

We all have that. One of the most interesting things to me is that we also all develop a callus to it. In order to be able to move on from a devastating trauma in a room into a low-acuity knee sprain or something similar, and put on a happy face and think about patient satisfaction, our ability to emotionally task switch like that is very unnatural. It's a defense mechanism we come up with, which means that when we leave shift, often times we take that emotional whiplash and we just put it aside. 

As Nick was saying, maybe this is why people can't watch it. In many ways, what's best for us is to stop, reflect, think about it, and honor the feelings that you had in that moment. Even though you had to put them aside so you can keep working, come back and honor those feelings so that you can process them and realize that being a person and being human is what also makes you a great doctor. Don't get rid of that. 

You see that with so many of the characters in The Pitt in a way that is just so beautifully written because in different various stages of my life and of my training, I have experienced those exact same iterations that the different characters go through.

Cozzi: I remember when Damar Hamlin had a cardiac arrest on the Buffalo Bills field, and 50,000 people saw him in cardiac arrest and the excellent display of medical teamwork and communication that ultimately saved his life. We talked about the psychological impact of every one of those individuals in the stands, and we're not minimizing that. What they saw was a traumatic event, but like Amy eloquently discussed, that's something that happens every day and the ability to task switch is a defense mechanism. 

There are still opportunities for us to do much more when it comes to mental health. We're still looked at as superheroes, but we're not. We're human beings. We bring our own issues into work every day — struggles with our spouse, difficulties with our own children — that are traumatizing to us in and of themselves. 

Second, there are still areas around the country for credentialing that are mistreating emergency physicians as it relates to mental health struggles and being on prescription medication, and we have to make that okay. We can't make emergency physicians want to hide the humanity of their own lives because they feel ashamed about it. That's part of the problem.

I wonder, Mel, what we would do right now if we asked emergency physicians in training, or even those practicing, what the rates of self-harm, suicidal ideation, or just overall fatigue as it relates to dealing in this own crisis, having your own issues, and having to hide them. We have to do more work.

Herbert: I can tell you that every emergency physician I talk to is burnt out, is feeling the struggle, and has moral injury. I've talked often about the fact that I developed severe depression and suicidality at the end of my career. I had to get ketamine and it really helped. I don't like to talk about it because of my position, but I feel like I need to talk about it. 

When I go to ACEP, I get overwhelmed with people saying, “Thank you for talking about that. I have the same thing. I need to get help.” It's underrecognized and we don't want to talk about it. We're supposed to be superhuman, but we are not. 

I was talking to the Lorna Breen Foundation yesterday, Lorna Breen, as many as you know, was an ER doc, the head of her department, who died by suicide at the beginning of COVID because she couldn't cope. We talked about the fact that ER docs have this backpack, and we throw these things into the backpack. 

Dead baby? Let's just throw that in the backpack. A 32-year-old woman dying of cancer? Let's just throw that in the backpack.

If you don't unpack that thing, it will catch up with you. Nobody gets away from this. For many of us, like for my generation, you just chuck it in the backpack. Let's not deal with that. It will catch up with you. 

I honestly believe that every ER doc and every ER nurse should be in some form of therapy for the duration of their career, from day one until it's over, and then for 5 years afterward, because this is not a normal job. It's not normal.

Glatter: Therapy is so critical. It's not just a debrief or a huddle after a difficult case. It goes deeper. I agree with you, Mel, that therapy should be something that is almost required because of the nature of the work we do. We have to be able to talk about it and to at least describe our struggles. 

I appreciate you sharing with our audience your personal journey and struggles because that resonates with all of us. I truly appreciate that.

Herbert: This is the most important thing to me right now. I see so many ER docs struggling, and I don't know an ER doc that doesn't have a dead baby story. I, for years, still can see the faces of the kids that have died on my shift. Even now, you can hear it in my voice. It doesn't go away. You just have to learn to cope with it and get help if you need it. We're all the same. We have all got this experience.

If we all get therapy, and this is a really important point, if it's mandatory that we are all in therapy and we're all getting help, guess what? The stigma's gone. Even if you're mandated to write something about that on your credentialing, if we all do it, we're done.

Glatter: I want to thank everyone for a very impactful and very insightful discussion. These topics are obviously so important to emergency physicians, and they resonate. The show is such an important teaching tool, in my opinion. In season 2, I'm looking forward to seeing what struggles and what events happen because based on season 1. It really will provide a real good springboard to go forward. 

Any other final thoughts?

Herbert: I've got one to tell you. I'm very excited to tell you that Noah Wyle and Joe Sachs are coming to ACEP. We're going to do a little panel after the keynote where we'll take questions from the audience, and then Noah is going to walk around a little bit in the trade area. It'll be an opportunity for people to talk to the real geniuses behind the show, including Noah and Joe, and there are many others. If you can make it, it's on September 7 at around 10:00 AM MST.

Ho: I'll say coming off a late shift to do this on a fairly early morning, it is worth saying that what we do, to us, loses the shininess because we do it every day. It feels routine. To be able to see ourselves the way other people see us, which is that it's a little crazy and erratic, but boy does it have really great and long-standing impact. Remember that as you walk into your next shift.

Cozzi: Echoing that, it wouldn't be my final word, it will be Mel's final word — what you do matters. I think this eloquently displays that.

Glatter: Excellent. Thank you all again. I truly appreciate your time. Many thanks.

A cohort study of children in the United Kingdom found that early childhood atopic dermatitis (AD), especially when mild, is not associated with executive function (EF) deficits in middle childhood.

“The role of EF in the relationship between childhood AD and neuropsychological outcomes is an understudied area,” the authors wrote, “but together with prior research, the current study supports the conclusion that EF impairment is not a major mechanism driving this relationship, at least in a sample of nonadolescent children with largely mild AD.”

The study was led by Elle Kim, Department of Dermatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, and was published online on May 2025 in Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

Only a small portion of the study population experienced moderate or severe disease, which limited the statistical power to detect effects in more severe cases. Other limitations included potential selection bias, lack of information about treatments for AD, and limitation of generalizability to non-UK populations.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health. Some authors reported receiving research and fellowship funding from and having other ties with various sources, including Pfizer, Sun Pharmaceuticals, La Roche Posay. One author also declared holding patents, being a deputy editor, and being a member of the Board of Directors for the International Psoriasis Council and the Medical Dermatology Society.

At a median follow-up of 13.2 years, dose-escalated hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy led to fewer treatment failures in men with localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancer than conventional radiation therapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, among patients who did not receive androgen-deprivation therapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy halved the risk for treatment failure.

“Long-term outcomes show a reduction in treatment failure associated with dose-escalated, hypofractionated [radiotherapy] in patients with low-risk and intermediate risk prostate cancer not receiving [androgen-deprivation therapy ], with similar late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities,” the authors wrote. 

“In the years since initial publication, hypofractionated [intensity–modulated radiation therapy] has been adopted as the standard of care due to multiple randomized controlled trials and these long-term results supporting that [hypofractionated intensity–modulated radiation therapy] provides comparable outcomes to [conventionally fractionated intensity–modulated radiation therapy], with the added benefit of convenient treatment time for patients,” they concluded.

This study, led by Comron Hassanzadeh, MD, MPH, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was published online in Journal of Clinical Oncology.

This study predominantly included patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and only some patients received androgen-deprivation therapy, and hence, the findings may not be generalizable to patients with high-risk disease. Additionally, toxicity results were applicable for patients receiving intensity–modulated radiation therapy with daily image guidance, although newer techniques could have further improved tolerability.

This study received support in part through a Cancer Center Support grant. Three authors reported being employees of the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Some authors declared receiving research funding or honoraria and having other ties with various sources.

 May 30, 2025  

A review of queries received by the Medical Protection Society (MPS) last year has highlighted the top concerns of GPs about the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical practice. 

The MPS told Medscape News UK that all AI-themed queries came from GPs. No questions were raised by secondary care doctors.

The assessment revealed 10 main areas of concern for GPs:

Medicolegal advice on these themes has been published on the MPS website. 

""We know members are keen to explore and adopt AI tools, which may enhance patient care and help to facilitate more efficient working,"" Dr Ben White, MPS deputy medical director, said in a press release. 

However, calls to the medicolegal advice line showed members were wary of potential risks.

Particular concerns included liability and defence society cover, safety for patients, data protection, and patient consent. Such concerns echo a survey by Medscape last year which found that 1 in 5 respondents were apprehensive about using AI in clinical practice. 

More specific advice was sought on the medicolegal implications of using AI software for transcribing patient consultations, generating fit-to-fly letters or fit notes, using clinical prompts, and processing laboratory results.

""AI is of course fast-evolving, and we will continue to revisit the guidance,"" White said. 

The MPS Foundation has contributed to a white paper on AI in healthcare, aimed at ensuring AI tools are developed and integrated to be usable, useful, and safe for both patients and clinicians. 

""Bringing about greater confidence in AI among clinicians is vital if the potential benefits are to be unlocked,"" White said. 

Nell Thornton, improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, said the MPS findings echoed the foundation's own research. 

""If AI is to help fulfil its promise to improve patient care, further clarification is needed on issues like regulation and professional liability,"" she told Medscape News UK. 

Doctors are keen to ensure that the human dimension of care is protected in an increasingly digitised system, she added. ""Addressing these issues will be crucial for ensuring the development and adoption of AI is responsible and works for everyone.""

Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told Medscape News UK that the college was ""always open to introducing new technologies that can improve the experience of patients — and GPs are often at the forefront of this."" However, AI use is ""not without potential risks"" and its implementation ""must be closely regulated to guarantee patient safety and the security of their data."" 

""Technology will always need to work alongside and complement the work of doctors and other healthcare professionals, and it can never be seen as a replacement for the expertise of a qualified medical professional,"" Hawthorne emphasised. ""Clearly there is big potential for the use of AI in general practice, but it's vital that it is carefully implemented and closely regulated in the interest of patient safety.""

Dr Rosie Shire, from the Doctors' Association UK GP committee, told Medscape News UK, ""As more AI tools become available, the possibilities of how they could assist GPs grow, but so do the concerns, as highlighted by the MPS.""

The idea of AI software providing a summary of a GP consultation was ""very appealing,"" she said. It could enable GPs to focus fully on the patient rather than taking notes, which could improve communication and patient satisfaction, and save time on recall and typing up notes. 

""However, it's vital software is accurate and reliable, able to distinguish who is speaking, and understands accents and dialects,” Shire stressed. “Otherwise it could lead to increased workload, as GPs spend additional time checking the AI has performed correctly.""

There is potential for inaccuracies being introduced into patient records if clinicians become overreliant on AI records of consultations, Shire said.

In time-pressured clinics, GPs might not read through AI summaries.

""It's important clinicians are given time to review and confirm any AI-generated outcome to ensure accuracy. We also need to remember that AI can't replace that gut feeling you occasionally get as a GP when you see a patient you know and feel that something just isn't right,” she added.

Shire said that a standard policy on AI use in general practice was needed. Clarity is also required over who would be responsible if AI software malfunctioned and led to patient harm. 

""Would it be the practice partners, as the data owners, the GP who saw the patient, or the AI software provider?""

White said the MPS would not normally provide indemnity for issues relating to AI software failure. While the society is not currently aware of any binding case law, ""we would expect the designers or producers of the AI software to be liable for any issues relating to the failure of the AI software.”

Where a practice has purchased an AI system, the individual GP using it would remain potentially liable for any harm that results from its use. 

""Doctors remain responsible for the decisions they make whilst using such technology,” he said. “In order to mitigate the risk of a complaint or claim, doctors should assure themselves that any system they are using is fit for purpose and appropriate for the patients that they are seeing.""

Dr Sheena Meredith is an established medical writer, editor, and consultant in healthcare communications, with extensive experience writing for medical professionals and the general public. She is qualified in medicine and in law and medical ethics. ","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

 May 30, 2025  

In 2022, 567,440 patients with end-stage renal disease in Europe received renal replacement therapy (RRT), with an unadjusted prevalence of 1074 per million population. In France, the rate was 1383 per million population among 93,486 patients (mean age, 63.5 years; 62% men). These data were obtained from the European Renal Association Registry, which collects information on RRT in patients with end-stage kidney disease. The RRT data were obtained from 53 registries in 35 countries, covering approximately 530 million individuals. After adjusting for age and sex, France's prevalence was among the highest in Europe (1440 per million population vs 1192 per million population overall). Across the cohort, 56% underwent haemodialysis, 39% had a renal transplant, and 5% received peritoneal dialysis.

In 2022, there were 80,389 incident RRT cases in Europe — an unadjusted incidence of 152 per million population, up from 145 per million population in 2021. France reported 163 cases per million people. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were 163 and 168 per million population in Europe and France, respectively. On average, 54% of new cases were aged 65 years or older, and 64% were men. Haemodialysis use increased by 83% with patient age, while peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation declined by 12% and 5%, respectively. No differences were observed between the sexes.

In 2022, 21,261 patients underwent renal transplantation, including 3352 in France. Across Europe, 66% of grafts were from deceased donors compared with 15% in France. Among patients who began RRT between 2013 and 2017, the unadjusted 5-year survival probabilities were 51.5%, 41.3% for those on dialysis, 85.1% for recipients of deceased donor grafts, and 94.2% for recipients of living donor grafts. Dialysis patients aged 20-24 years have an estimated remaining life expectancy of 20 years for men and 21 years for women, which is 39 and 44 years shorter, respectively, than their age-matched peers in the general population.

Women account for 24%-46% of RRT cohorts across Europe, from 24% in Iceland to 46% in Estonia, with France at 33%. The initial RRT modality did not differ according to sex.

The French National Authority for Health has announced a forthcoming set of best-practice recommendations for live kidney donation, which are expected to be released in the third quarter of 2025. These guidelines aim to enhance both donor and recipient safety, harmonise practices, and improve overall outcomes in live kidney donation procedures, and address recent studies, despite methodological limitations that raised concerns about potential morbidity risks for the recipient.

Access to lecanemab among Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was marked by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities, a new study suggested, with early use significantly higher in men than in women, and in non-Hispanic White individuals than in Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients.

“Even among beneficiaries who meet initial Medicare coverage requirements for lecanemab by having documented MCI or AD, early uptake of lecanemab still appears to be marked by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities. This dynamic is consistent with a recurring historical pattern of inequitable access to breakthrough therapies administered by specialized centers, and underscores how a costly and likely low-value treatment, which contributes to higher Medicare spending, is seemingly being disproportionately utilized by advantaged populations,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Frank F. Zhou, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). It was published online on May 15 in JAMA Network Open.

Data for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries were not available. The use of diagnosis codes to identify patients with AD or MCI underestimated MCI prevalence, misdiagnosed AD, did not consider additional lecanemab eligibility criteria, and could not distinguish between mild and moderate or severe AD, where only mild cases are eligible for lecanemab treatment.

Pediatricians should consider treating children with atopic dermatitis (AD) “proactively,” according to a new clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

The AAP defines proactive care as an “evidence-based” approach based on “intermittent use of anti-inflammatory agents (eg, topical corticosteroids or tacrolimus twice weekly) on previously affected skin to prevent flares” of AD.

The group also recommends newer agents like the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which may have fewer side effects than long-term steroid use and are more effective than older drugs.

The report comes as patients experience long waits for referrals to pediatric dermatologists, said Jennifer Schoch, MD, a professor of dermatology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, who helped write the document.

The recommendations may help primary care clinicians more confidently identify and treat mild to moderate cases of AD, she said.

“Pediatricians play a critical role in initiating topical treatments, educating families, and supporting quality of life,” Schoch said. “With a proactive approach to topical therapies and an understanding that atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition requiring an ongoing management plan, most cases can be effectively handled in primary care.”

JAK inhibitors may be particularly beneficial for treating sensitive areas of the body, supporting patients who have not responded to traditional therapies, and aiding in long-term treatment.

Topical JAK “treatments offer targeted anti-inflammatory effects, which adds to our toolbox, particularly to mitigate concerns about risks of long-term steroid use,” Schoch said.

The AAP also now recommends applying topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors proactively to prevent flares. In recent research, patients who were preventively treated with topical steroids experienced a reduction in disease severity and an improved quality of life. The proactive use of nonsteroid topical agents produced similar results.

Moisturization and avoidance of triggers like harsh detergents and low humidity continue to be mainstays of maintenance care. Patients should be moisturized using a fragrance-free, thick cream after bathing and handwashing. The AAP advises daily, short baths in lukewarm water and the use of wet wraps and bleach baths.

The report emphasized the psychosocial burden of AD in children. AD is associated with mental health issues like stress, depression, and insomnia in children. The recurring, ongoing nature of the disease can place a heavy emotional and economic burden on the entire family, Schoch said.

“Atopic dermatitis can significantly disrupt sleep due to relentless itching, leading to daytime fatigue, irritability, and behavioral challenges in children,” Schoch said. “The disease may affect school performance, peer relationships, and self-esteem, while caregivers report high levels of stress, anxiety, and even depression.”

The new report recommends cognitive-behavioral therapy for patients with mental health concerns and progressive muscle relaxation, sleep hygiene management, and melatonin to reduce insomnia.

The use of written action plans may help families follow through with treatment strategies and are “excellent tool for primary care providers to help explain to patients the stepwise approach of the disease,” said Daniela Russi, MD, a pediatric dermatologist at Phoenix Children's in Phoenix, who was not involved with the report. These plans help “pediatricians evaluate all aspects of the treatment…in addition to providing proactive ways to prevent flare-ups.”

“This guideline is helpful in showing pediatricians that they are capable of treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis patients,” Russi said. “Most of the patients we see in the clinic come without any knowledge of basic skin care, frequency of baths, and use of the correct moisturizers, especially bleach baths and wet wraps.”

Schoch reported financial relationships with Janssen Biotech and Exactech. Russi reported having no disclosures. No external funding for the clinical report was used.

Removing fluoride from public water systems in the United States could have increased the prevalence of dental caries among children by 7.5 percentage points and added $9.8 billion in healthcare costs over 5 years, a modeling study projected.

“Despite concerns regarding toxic effects associated with high levels of fluoride, this model demonstrates the substantial ongoing benefits of water fluoridation at safe levels currently recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Toxicology Program, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the authors of the study reported.

The study was conducted by Sung Eun Choi, PhD, of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and Lisa Simon, MD, DMD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston. It was published online on May 30 in JAMA Health Forum.

The study did not model potential cognitive harms from fluoride exposure because strong direct evidence of a link at fluoride levels seen in public water is lacking, the authors stated. The cost-effectiveness analysis did not consider indirect outcomes of dental health problems such as missed work or school. The study focused on children and adolescents.

Simon has received personal fees from Boston Medical Center, Alosa Health, the American College of Legal Medicine, the American Dental Therapy Association, the California Dental Association, the Santa Fe Group, the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, the American College of Dentists, the CareQuest Foundation for Oral Health, and the American Dental Association.

A new study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal suggests that parental or caregiver intuition may outperform some traditional early warning systems in identifying children at risk of deterioration. The new analysis found that caregiver concern for worsening condition of pediatric patients was strongly associated with critical illness in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital, even after accounting for abnormal vital signs (abnormal heart rate or abnormal respiratory rate).

In high-income countries critical illness in children is rare, and often difficult for physicians to distinguish from common minor illness until late in the disease. Delayed recognition of deterioration is one of the most common contributing factors to preventable deaths in hospitalized children, and parents or caregivers are often well positioned to detect early and subtle signs of deterioration, but the relationship between their concerns and patient outcomes is unknown, and many healthcare systems are not currently structured to support their involvement in clinical care.

The current study is the first to examine this relationship. It was conducted over 26 months (November 2020 to December 2022) and analyzed 73,845 eligible emergency department presentations of pediatric patients in Australia, with 24,239 having at least one documented response for parent or caregiver concern. The authors assessed caregiver concern by asking the caregiver the question 'Are you worried your child is getting worse?' during routine monitoring. In total, 8,937 (4·7%) respondents out of 189,708 indicated concern for the child's worsening condition.  Compared to patients with caregivers without documented concerns, those with a caregiver reporting concern for clinical deterioration were more likely to experience critical illness requiring admission to ICU (6·9% vs 1·8%) or the need for mechanical ventilation (1·1% vs 0·2%), suggesting that the diagnostic accuracy of the parent's gut feeling outperformed physiological data.

The authors say that their results suggest parents and caregivers are a resource that can assist clinicians to monitor for deterioration, and they may perform better than some current systems reliant on vital signs alone. They say this data suggests that parent or caregiver concerns should be proactively sought, and research which incorporates this into hospital systems used to detect deterioration in pediatric patients should be prioritized.

In a significant advancement for hand rehabilitation, researchers from Zhengzhou University have introduced a non-hand-worn, load-free VR hand rehabilitation system that could boost therapy development for patients recovering from conditions like stroke and osteoarthritis. The system, developed by a team led by Yanchao Mao, integrates deep learning with ionic hydrogel electrodes to recognize hand gestures based on electromyographic (EMG) signals.

The conventional hand rehabilitation therapy often relies on bulky mechanical gloves that require weight-bearing and increase the strain on a patient's hand. These devices are also complex to operate and often require specialized medical facilities. The newly developed system eliminates the need for such heavy, hand-worn equipment, offering a load-free and flexible rehabilitation solution. Patients can engage in rehabilitation exercises anywhere and anytime, without the burden of wearing cumbersome devices.

The key to this system's innovation lies in its ionic hydrogel electrodes, which are wet-adhesive, self-healing, and conductive. These electrodes, applied directly to the forearm, collect EMG signals generated by hand movements. Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), then process these signals to recognize a range of hand gestures. In a trial, the system achieved an impressive 97.9% accuracy in recognizing 14 different Jebsen hand rehabilitation gestures. This recognition is linked to a Virtual Reality (VR) platform where patients can interact with virtual environments, enhancing the therapeutic experience through immersive training.

Professor Yanchao Mao, the lead researcher, emphasized the significance of this innovation: ""Our goal is to eliminate the need for cumbersome, mechanical rehabilitation gloves. By integrating deep learning and ionic hydrogel technology, we can provide patients with a more comfortable, accessible, and efficient rehabilitation process. Patients can now perform immersive VR rehabilitation exercises in their homes, without the limitations of specialized equipment or facilities.""

This system has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for patients undergoing hand rehabilitation, particularly those with mobility challenges. By offering load-free, immersive, and personalized training, the system offers a home-based VR therapy solution, opening the door for greater flexibility in rehabilitation. Moreover, this deep learning-assisted VR rehabilitation system can potentially be adapted to other areas of physical therapy in the future.

Future directions and applications: looking forward, the team plans to further refine the system's gesture recognition accuracy and expand its capabilities. The system holds promise not only for hand rehabilitation but also for broader applications in fields like stroke recovery, musculoskeletal injuries, and geriatric rehabilitation. The researchers are particularly excited about the home-based application, which could vastly increase access to physical therapy, particularly for individuals in remote areas or with limited mobility. In addition to its clinical applications, the research highlights the emerging role of ionic hydrogels in biomedical technologies, with the potential to create more effective, flexible, and comfortable rehabilitation solutions for a wide range of medical conditions. The development of non-hand-worn interfaces such as this one could become integral in future rehabilitation systems.

Newly sequenced ancient genomes from Yunnan, China, have shed new light on human prehistory in East Asia. In a study published in Science, a research team led by Prof. FU Qiaomei at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed data from 127 ancient humans, dating from 7,100 to 1,400 years ago. The results show that this region is pivotal to understanding the origin of both Tibetan and Austroasiatic (i.e., ethnic groups with a shared language group in South and Southeast Asia) population groups.

The team found that a 7,100-year-old individual from Yunnan was as genetically distinct from most present-day East Asians as a 40,000-year-old individual from the area of present-day Beijing, suggesting a previously unobserved Asian ancestry, denoted in the study as Xingyi ancestry. Collectively, these ancestries highlight the profound genetic divergence among human populations in East Asia.

Although the individual genetically differed significantly from modern East Asians, the researchers noted that the individual's ancestry shared qualities similar to those of populations indigenous to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This aligns with previous observations that these plateau populations have certain genetic characteristics that make them distinct from other present-day human groups.

This individual's genome has filled in a large piece of the puzzle, making it easier to study Tibetan prehistory. The study revealed that an early Asian population that separated at least 40,000 years ago persisted in Southwestern China until the Holocene and interacted with humans migrating westward from northern East Asia to originate Tibetan populations.

This deeply diverged Xingyi ancestry was also found in an 11,000-year-old Longlin individual previously sampled in Guangxi, yet it gradually disappeared in later Guangxi populations.

Moreover, the researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis of DNA from humans living in central Yunnan from 5,100–1,400 years BP. Their study revealed a shared ancestry that was closely related-but genetically distinct-from East Asian ancestries observed in northern and southern China. According to the researchers, the Yunnan individuals genetically diverged from northern and southern East Asian groups at least 19,000 years ago.

Interestingly, the Yunnan samples also share a close genetic relationship to Austroasiatic speakers, who are widespread today across Southeast Asia, as well as some regions of South Asia and southern China. 

Some scientists have hypothesized that the spread of Austroasiatic speakers was linked to the expansion of farming in this region. However, the presence of these Austroasiatic-related populations in central Yunnan predates agricultural practices.

This study may provide insights into the origins of Austroasiatic populations. It presents the oldest evidence of ancestry associated with Austroasiatic speakers, with a continuous record from 5,100–1,400 years BP. Looking to central Yunnan and the nearby Red River Valley could be crucial for unveiling Austroasiatic prehistory.

The study also sheds light on the history of populations in western and southeastern Yunnan. Specifically, genetic analyses show that populations with northern East Asian ancestry influenced populations in western Yunnan, whereas populations carrying northern East Asian ancestry influenced populations in southeastern Yunnan.

Southwest China is a key region for prehistoric human migration and interaction. By accessing the genetic history preserved in these ancient genomes from Yunnan, the researchers have uncovered deep genetic diversity that accounts for the rich ethnic and linguistic diversity in Yunnan today. This research has also transformed our understanding of ancient human dynamics over a much wider geographic area, from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to Southeast Asia.

The study's comprehensive analysis of ancient DNA from 7,100–to 1,400-year-old Yunnan populations offers new insights into long-debated questions regarding the origins and expansion of various East Asian populations.

Accurate monitoring of CD4+ T cell counts is vital for evaluating immune health and guiding treatment in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Yet conventional tools like flow cytometry, while highly effective, are expensive, complex, and ill-suited for widespread use in remote or resource-limited areas. Many portable alternatives remain constrained by low sensitivity, intricate sample handling, or high operational costs. Optical and fluorescence-based systems, though advanced, further compound these issues with their maintenance and equipment needs. Due to these limitations, there is an urgent need for cost-effective, standalone diagnostic platforms that can be deployed directly at the point of care to ensure timely HIV monitoring.

In a collaborative effort, researchers from the University of Bath and Nanyang Technological University have developed an integrated microfluidic electrochemical biosensor for detecting CD4+ T cells. Their findings (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00893-8), published on April 9, 2025, in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, showcase a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based chip with gold electrodes that uses impedance-based, label-free sensing. Tailored for low-resource settings, the device enables minimizing handling steps and simplifying sample processing, and delivers results within clinically relevant thresholds. This breakthrough marks an important advance toward enabling real-time HIV diagnostics outside of conventional laboratories.

At the core of the device is a microfluidic chip embedded with gold electrodes, which enables both the functionalization and detection processes to occur on-chip. Anti-CD4 antibodies are immobilized via self-assembled monolayers, ensuring specific binding of target cells. The sensor's wide dynamic range captures both immunocompromised and healthy CD4+ levels, with a detection limit that can identify advanced immunodeficiency. Compared to traditional bench-top systems, the microfluidic design significantly reduces variation and manual labor, improving reproducibility and making the device well-suited for automation. Specificity tests showed negligible interference from monocytes, neutrophils, and common serum proteins. The sensor can also be paired with a Dean Flow Fractionation chip for upstream cell separation, allowing for a fully modular system that integrates cell isolation, capture, and enumeration-all on a single device.

Our goal was to develop a user-friendly, affordable diagnostic tool that could extend high-quality HIV monitoring beyond centralized labs. By combining electrochemical sensing with microfluidics, we've created a platform that is not only accurate and sensitive, but also scalable and compatible with point-of-care use. This technology has the potential to democratize access to HIV diagnostics, especially in regions with limited medical infrastructure.""

Professor Pedro Estrela, study's corresponding author

Looking ahead, this microfluidic biosensor could serve as a transformative tool for HIV management in underserved regions, replacing bulky laboratory instruments with portable, battery-powered alternatives. Its flexible design supports the integration of automated sample processing and multiplexed detection of other immune markers or pathogens. The next development stages will involve integrating the DFF chip for whole blood testing, clinical validation, and refining user interfaces for field deployment. Ultimately, this technology could lead to robust point-of-care platforms that support early diagnosis, strengthen treatment monitoring, and advance equitable healthcare delivery in global HIV control efforts.

In the realm of colorectal cancer treatments beyond surgery and radiation, one key question gained prominence in recent years: Is the tumor's DNA repair system defective, making it ""microsatellite unstable""? Around 15 to 20 percent of all tumors have this trait, making them likely candidates for successful immunotherapy. So-called immuno-checkpoint inhibitors are often used in these cases to neutralize the tumor's ""protective shield"", which tricks the immune system into perceiving it as harmless tissue. Once this deception is lifted, the body's T-cells can eliminate the tumor.

However, many colorectal cancers remain resistant to immunotherapy and even to chemotherapy and radiation. The cause lies in the tumor's surrounding environment, explains Prof. Florian Greten, cancer researcher at Georg-Speyer-Haus and Goethe University Frankfurt, and TRR 417 spokesperson: ""Tumors do not grow as foreign bodies within intestinal tissue. Instead, they incorporate 'normal' cells such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and vascular cells. The tumor reprograms these cells and integrates them into a tumor microenvironment, which also closely interacts with gut bacteria and other microorganisms - the microbiome.""

The new Collaborative Research Center TRR 417 ""Cellular Communication in the Stroma of Colorectal Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Translation"" brings together researchers from medicine, biology, and data sciences at Goethe University Frankfurt, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, and the University of Freiburg with the aim of continuing the investigation of this tumor microenvironment. Greten explains: ""We are building on the experience we've gained since 2016 through our collaboration in DFG Research Unit 2438 on this topic. In that project, we not only gathered numerous scientific insights but also developed shared standards, models, and technologies."" It is based on this foundation that the researchers will now develop novel therapeutic strategies. ""We want to determine how to deliberately modify the tumor microenvironment and leverage it therapeutically to enhance treatments and make them accessible to immunotherapies - especially for those colorectal cancers that currently respond poorly to existing therapies.""

The success of TRR 417 is particularly gratifying because it shows how Prof. Greten and his colleagues have strategically brought together top-tier oncology experts from leading institutions - German Cancer Aid, the German Cancer Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, the Bavarian Cancer Research Center, and the National Center for Tumor Diseases - over many years. Their approach of rapidly transferring basic research into clinical practice is a model for Goethe University's 'Science for Health' profile area. I look forward to the rich scientific output and the next generation of clinician scientists that will emerge out of this collaborative research center.""

Prof. Enrico Schleiff, Goethe University President 

The DFG will fund TRR 417 for an initial period of four years with around € 17.7 million. The funding may be renewed twice for additional four-year periods.

A decade-long Canadian study reveals that the timing of natural menopause does not affect the risk of hypothyroidism, but women with higher BMI face greater odds.

Study: Associations between age at natural menopause and risk of hypothyroidism among postmenopausal women from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Image Credit: SvetaZi / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal PLOS One, researchers investigated the association between age at natural menopause (ANM) and the risk of developing overt hypothyroidism among postmenopausal Canadian women.

After following women for 10 years, they found no significant association between ANM and the incidence of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland underproduces hormones that regulate organ function, metabolism, and temperature. Its symptoms include goiter, depression, fatigue, and weight gain. In developed countries, autoimmune causes are the leading contributor to hypothyroidism, which disproportionately affects women, especially with increasing age.

The hormonal interplay between thyroid function and menopause, with both influencing reproductive hormones, has raised interest in how reproductive milestones might impact thyroid health. Menopause, which typically occurs around age 51, leads to a sharp decline in estrogen, which may affect the metabolism of the thyroid hormone.

Notably, 70% of hypothyroidism cases are diagnosed in women over 50, and subclinical hypothyroidism is common during menopausal transition. Early menopause has been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune conditions and thyroid dysfunction. For example, 20–35% of women with premature ovarian failure also have thyroid autoimmunity.

Although some reproductive factors, such as the use of oral contraceptives, menarche, and pregnancy, have been studied to examine how they influence hypothyroidism risk, findings are inconsistent. For example, hypothyroidism shows significant decreases during pregnancy, but sharp increases after childbirth, and associations with the use of oral contraceptives are mixed.

However, this is the first large-scale longitudinal study to examine ANM and overt hypothyroidism (clinically diagnosed), addressing a gap in prior research that focused only on subclinical forms with conflicting outcomes. This could lead to improved guidelines to manage hypothyroidism risk for older women.

Given estrogen's potential role in thyroid regulation, this study aimed to explore whether ANM is associated with the incidence of hypothyroidism in postmenopausal women, using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which collected data across three cycles over a 10-year period, employing a retrospective cohort design.

Researchers excluded participants who had not reached menopause, had surgical or medical menopause, had missing menopause age or relevant hypothyroidism data, were diagnosed with hypothyroidism before menopause, or had ANM <40 or >67 years (aligning with Verschoor & Tamim cutoffs).

Incident hypothyroidism was assessed through self-reported diagnosis and age at diagnosis. The primary outcome was the time to onset of hypothyroidism after menopause. Participants not developing hypothyroidism contributed censored data.

Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics (ethnicity, education), health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), and reproductive history (age at menarche, use of oral contraceptives and hormone therapy, number of births). Data on these covariates were collected from different CLSA cycles and utilized multiple imputation to address missingness in key variables (e.g., oral contraceptive duration).

Statistical analysis involved survival models, with Cox proportional hazards regression used to estimate associations between ANM and hypothyroidism. Models were adjusted for all relevant covariates and tested interactions between ANM and BMI/HRT (none were significant). Robust standard errors addressed proportional hazards assumption violations detected via log-log plots.

This study analyzed data from 15,330 postmenopausal women over 257,589.7 person-years to assess the association between ANM and the incidence of hypothyroidism. A total of 1,674 women (10.9%) reported hypothyroidism, yielding an incidence rate of 6.5 per 1,000 person-years.

The average baseline age was 60.6 years, and the median age at menopause (ANM) was 50 years. Most participants were White (94.4%) and aged 45–64 (68.5%) at baseline. Approximately 71.1% never used hormone replacement therapy, 52.8% engaged in regular physical activity, and 36.8% had a normal body mass index (BMI).

Survival curves showed no significant difference in the onset of hypothyroidism across ANM groups (log-rank p = 0.7). Multivariable Cox regression analysis also showed no statistically significant association between ANM and hypothyroidism risk.

However, BMI was significantly linked with hypothyroidism: women with a BMI of 25–29 had a 20% increased risk (HR 1.2), and those with a BMI of ≥30 had a 40% increased risk (HR 1.4). The authors note that hypothyroidism may contribute to weight gain (through reduced metabolic rate), suggesting BMI could be a consequence of thyroid dysfunction rather than solely a risk factor.

This large-scale longitudinal study found no link between ANM and overt hypothyroidism incidence. This aligns with one prior subclinical hypothyroidism study but contrasts with others, possibly due to differences in study populations (e.g., inclusion of surgical menopause) or diagnostic criteria.

Higher BMI was consistently associated with increased hypothyroidism risk, though the directionality remains unclear (obesity may be a consequence of thyroid dysfunction). Estrogen's role in increasing thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) without affecting free T4 in healthy women may explain why ANM showed no association.

The strengths of this study include the large, population-weighted sample and detailed sociodemographic and health data. However, limitations include self-reported diagnoses and BMI, potential misclassification, and underdiagnosis due to symptom overlap with aging. The lack of direct hormone measurements may have reduced diagnostic accuracy. Generalizability is somewhat limited due to cohort-specific exclusions and because most participants were White.

In conclusion, ANM was not associated with hypothyroidism risk, but higher BMI was. Future research should include hormone assays, longitudinal analysis of BMI-thyroid relationships, and explore estrogen's specific effects on thyroid metabolism.

Salivary glands play an essential role in protecting oral health by secreting saliva to aid in digestion, speech, and immunity. When these glands are irreversibly damaged—by radiotherapy or autoimmune attacks—patients often face chronic discomfort, difficulty eating, and increased risk of infection. Yet recreating salivary function in the lab remains an elusive challenge due to the complexity of the gland's specialized cells and microenvironment. Most existing culture systems rely on animal-derived scaffolds or chemically fixed matrices that fail to sustain human acinar cell identity over time. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) environments that support long-term survival and function of salivary gland cells.

In a new study (DOI: 10.1038/s41368-025-00368-6) published on May 9, 2025, in the International Journal of Oral Science, researchers from McGill University unveiled a next-generation hydrogel that supports the regeneration of salivary gland-like tissue. The team tested three formulations and found that the version containing hyaluronic acid—referred to as AGHA—best supported the formation of large, viable spheroids that mimic native gland architecture. These 3D cell clusters maintained high expression of key salivary proteins and responded dynamically to chemical stimulation, offering a powerful tool for modeling diseases and testing potential therapies for xerostomia.

The researchers compared three hydrogel types: a basic alginate-gelatin (AG), a collagen-supplemented version (AGC), and hyaluronic acid-containing AG (AGHA), which incorporates hyaluronic acid. While all demonstrated mechanical properties similar to native tissue, AGHA emerged as the superior scaffold. In AGHA gels, salivary acinar cells formed large spheroids containing more than 100 cells with over 93% viability. These structures maintained metabolic activity and robust expression of functional markers including AQP5, ZO-1, NKCC1, and α-amylase—all essential for saliva secretion. When stimulated with isoprenaline, the spheroids increased their production of α-amylase-containing granules, confirming their functional responsiveness. The gel's reversibility, achieved through simple ion removal, allowed for non-destructive retrieval of intact spheroids—an essential feature for downstream clinical or experimental use. The hydrogel also successfully supported the expansion of primary human salivary cells for up to 15 days, demonstrating its versatility as a culture platform.

This study demonstrates that by fine-tuning hydrogel composition, we can closely replicate the native environment of salivary acinar cells. Our AGHA-based platform not only supports long-term viability and function, but also enables easy recovery of spheroids without enzymatic damage. This is a significant step forward in developing in vitro models for salivary gland disorders and potential regenerative therapies for patients suffering from chronic dry mouth.""

Dr. Simon D. Tran, senior author of the study

The implications of this hydrogel system extend beyond xerostomia. By enabling the growth of functional salivary tissue in a lab-friendly, reversible matrix, this platform could accelerate the development of disease models, high-throughput drug screening tools, and even implantable grafts. Its compatibility with both immortalized cell lines and primary human cells makes it a versatile foundation for future regenerative applications. Moreover, eliminating animal-derived materials improves reproducibility and clinical relevance. With this innovation, researchers are one step closer to restoring natural salivary function for patients who need it most.

Due to the sudden rupture of the aortic wall, aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention, as it can lead to vascular collapse. Individuals with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are particularly at risk, often developing the condition at a young age. This highlights the urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of aortic dissection remain poorly understood.

In a recent study, an international research team led by the University of Tsukuba created a mouse model that spontaneously develops aortic dissection by introducing a missense variant, originally identified in a patient with familial aortic dissection, into the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. This single nucleotide change results in the production of an abnormal fibrillin-1 protein. The mutant mice showed intimal-medial tears in the ascending aorta, with dissection progressing alongside significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. This ultimately led to fatal rupture.

Histological and gene expression analyses revealed that abnormalities in vascular endothelial cells precede the onset of dissection. These endothelial abnormalities facilitated the accumulation and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the intima, where the macrophages exhibited both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

Further investigation indicated that the FBN1 missense variant disrupts the binding of fibrillin-1 to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-binding proteins, leading to reduced TGFβ signaling, a pathway essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis.

These findings suggest that the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, along with decreased TGFβ signaling, forms a critical molecular basis for the pathogenesis of aortic dissection. The mouse model developed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of aortic dissection and advancing the development of new therapeutic strategies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers report a new avenue for targeted drug delivery","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250529/Researchers-report-a-new-avenue-for-targeted-drug-delivery.aspx","Fri, 30 May 2025 02:24:00 GMT","

A new avenue for targeted drug delivery has been proposed by researchers from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Their findings, published in Materials Today Bio, report the first successful application of metabolic labeling in platelets.

Platelets are anucleate cell fragments that congregate at sites of bleeding and inflammation to clot blood. Their unique properties make them attractive vehicles for targeted drug delivery systems. However, platelets are notoriously difficult to engineer due to their small size and physiologic simplicity.

Cells can usually be engineered with a genetic or chemical approach. But platelets don't have a nucleus or the typical DNA machinery, which makes them difficult to genetically engineer.""

Hua Wang, senior author of the paper, Assistant Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Instead, researchers turned to a chemical approach, which relies on chemical tags - molecules used to track the activity of other biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, or sugar compounds. Scientists can mix an incubated cell with a sugar compound, wait for the sugar to metabolize, and observe a tag expressed on the cell membrane. This process is known as metabolic glycan labeling and has shown promise in targeted drug delivery systems.

Wang's lab had previously demonstrated successful metabolic labeling in cancer and immune cells. Until now, this labeling was limited to cell types with the kind of DNA machinery that allows rapid cell division. But Wang and his colleagues wondered: Could they tag something without a nucleus? This query inspired their focus on platelets.

Working in stages, the researchers began by testing their method in vitro, or inside a cell culture medium. After isolating mouse platelets and culturing them with a sugar compound, the group observed chemical tags on the surface of platelets in just a few hours. Their results were validated using a combination of flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, and western blotting techniques.

Next they shifted to an in vivo model, wanting to explore the process in an actual biological system. Injecting mice directly with the sugar compound produced the same outcome, and the combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches allowed researchers to visualize and quantify these chemically tagged cell membranes.

Scientists are optimistic that specially tagged platelets can be used as drug-delivery vehicles for cancer, immune diseases, and blood clotting disorders. And because platelets have a short half-life, the cargo attached to them become cleared within days, alleviating concerns over drugs remaining in the body long-term. 

Going forward, the Illinois Grainger Engineering researchers will collaborate with outside laboratories to continue work on the drug-delivery side, providing guidance on chemically modifying platelets to accept more cargo and in a more stable manner.

""We have good confidence in how much cargo we can load and how stable they are,"" Wang said. ""In terms of our lab, we are very interested in the metabolic labeling technology. We want to further improve both in vitro and in vivo labeling efficiency, which we think could be useful to many researchers in the field.""

Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) fell during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Black and Hispanic patients experiencing larger decreases in survival, according to a study led by UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers published in Resuscitation.

Our results show that the pandemic largely eroded gains in cardiac arrest survival that had been achieved during the 10 years before the pandemic and exacerbated disparities.""

Saket Girotra, M.D., Senior Author, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology at UT Southwestern

Before the pandemic began in March 2020, OHCA survival rates had been steadily improving due to increased public awareness, faster emergency response times, and broader access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In 2019, the average overall survival rate stood at 9.9%, though it was lower in majority Black and Hispanic communities.

But overall survival dropped to 9% in 2020, with larger declines in majority Black and Hispanic communities. Through 2022, those racial/ethnic disparities persisted.

To assess OHCA trends after the pandemic began, Dr. Girotra and his colleagues analyzed data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) - the largest national database tracking out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes, with full data from 30 states and selected communities in 16 additional states. Researchers compared survival rates after cardiac arrest before the pandemic (2015-2019) to each of the years after the start of the pandemic (2020, 2021, and 2022).

""Our expectation was that survival after cardiac arrest had likely bounced back by 2022 to pre-pandemic levels,"" said lead author Eric Hall, M.D., a clinical fellow in the Division of Cardiology at UT Southwestern. ""What we found instead is that it remained 8%-10% lower, which suggests there were still some lingering effects of the pandemic on emergency cardiac care.""

The study cohort included 506,419 OHCA patients served by 1,313 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies. Not only were pre-pandemic survival rates lower in majority Black/Hispanic (7.9%) and integrated (10.7%) communities versus predominantly white communities (11.1%), they also fell more, with Black/Hispanic survival rates decreasing 16.5% in 2020, compared with the drop in white (8.1%) and integrated (6.5%) communities.

""These findings highlight the urgent need to address long-standing racial and ethnic differences in cardiac arrest outcomes,"" Dr. Girotra said. ""Our team is continuing to study how EMS agencies provide OHCA care in their communities to identify and share best practices."" 

One factor in the rise of OHCA during the pandemic was an increase in cases related to drug overdoses. The study found that the number of drug-related OHCA cases continued to rise through the end of the study.

""The pandemic phase of COVID-19 may be over, but many of the health impacts remain,"" Dr. Girotra said. 

Other UTSW researchers who contributed to the study are James de Lemos, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and Chief of the Division of Cardiology; Anezi Uzendu, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Cardiology; and Qiang Li, M.Sc., Biostatistical Consultant.

The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (R01HL160734).

Children exposed to gestational diabetes in utero with a specific variation of a common gene are at a higher risk of becoming overweight or obese during childhood, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

The study was published today in the journal Diabetes Care.

Scientists have long known that exposure to gestational diabetes is a strong predictor for both childhood obesity and diabetes.

""But it's not infallible,"" said the study's lead author Kylie Harrall, PhD, who did the research while at CU Anschutz but is now an assistant research professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ""Some children with in utero exposure to gestational diabetes never develop obesity.""

To understand why, the researchers focused on a receptor gene known as GLP-1R, the same gene activated by the weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. It regulates insulin and appetite.

Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms or common variations of the gene were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories across childhood, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

The researchers examined 464 children from the EPOCH study group, a collection of parents and their offspring monitored by researchers to determine the effects of gestational diabetes on the metabolic health of children.

""Our hypothesis was that there were mutations in this receptor that made kids prone to higher BMI,"" said the study's senior author Dana Dabelea, MD, PhD, associate dean of research at the Colorado School of Public Health and director of the Lifecourse Epidemiology of Adiposity & Diabetes Center (LEAD) on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

Dabelea and Harrall found that children exposed to gestational diabetes with a polymorphism of the GLP-1R gene gained weight faster and had a higher than average BMI compared to other children.

This is important because it highlights a joint effect of a genetic mutation and of an environmental exposure. It also shows how children can become overweight. In the future, clinicians can possibly test kids exposed to gestational diabetes for these genetic polymorphisms. They could then be good candidates for pharmacological interventions.""

Dana Dabelea, MD, PhD, associate dean of research, Colorado School of Public Health 

Harrall agreed and said the study results show that GLP-1R variations help explain why some children exposed to gestational diabetes are more prone to a higher BMI than others.

""This knowledge could help clinicians identify children who are at the highest risk for rapid BMI growth, which would allow for earlier intervention and potentially decrease the risk for childhood development of type 2 diabetes,"" Harrall said.

Cairns and Townsville residents who want to give up smoking can access free nicotine replacement therapies and potentially life-saving lung cancer screening by participating in a research study.

A University of Queensland-led trial started late last year across areas of southern Queensland to help smokers aged between 50 and 80 who wanted to quit smoking.

Associate Professor Henry Marshall from UQ's Thoracic Research Centre said more than 120 people had so far participated in the trial, and the project was now expanding to North and Far North Queensland.

This is an important step because it means people who want to quit smoking can now participate in the trial and get scanned and access nicotine replacement therapies in Cairns or Townsville.

Our aim is to screen 1000 people across Queensland, and the trial will continue until we reach that goal.""

Dr. Henry Marshall, Associate Professor, UQ's Thoracic Research Center

The Max Up trial is ongoing and is open to smokers aged between 50 and 80 who register with Quitline.

Dr. Marshall said research from the United States showed combining smoking cessation and screening reduced the risk of dying from lung cancer by 38 per cent.

""A CT scan can pick up small, curable lung cancers that are otherwise undetected because they're not causing any symptoms,'' he said.

""It only takes a few minutes and does not require any needles.

""Lung cancer grows silently and secretly, and generally only causes symptoms in an advanced stage, when a cure is difficult so a CT scan finding the cancer earlier gives people the chance for effective treatment."" 

Queenslanders who phone Quitline on 13 7848 (13 QUIT) or self-refer through Quit HQ can join the study to access free nicotine patches, gum or lozenges, as well as a free CT scan of their lungs, if eligible.

Dr Marshall, who is a lung specialist at The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, said the study is a precursor to the roll out of a National Lung Cancer Screening Program.

""We want to make sure lung cancer screening reaches the target population and is integrated in the best possible way with support to help people quit smoking,"" he said. 

""The trial is called Max Up because we aim to maximise uptake of screening and maximise people's chances of quitting to reap the health benefits of a smoke-free life – it's a double health benefit.""

Dr Marshall said lung cancer is one of more than 40 diseases and conditions that smoking is known to cause, so quitting has very broad health benefits.

""We know that quitting smoking can take time, effort, and sometimes multiple attempts,"" he said.

""But if you can quit smoking, you get a huge benefit back in terms of life expectancy and quality of life.

""We've got the door open ready for people to keep coming back, engaging with Quitline's programs and counsellors and keep getting free nicotine replacement therapy.""

The Max Up trial is supported by the Medical Research Future Fund, The University of Queensland, Queensland Health, Cancer Council Australia, and Lung Foundation Australia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","TTF1 identified as key biomarker for advanced KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250530/TTF1-identified-as-key-biomarker-for-advanced-KRAS-G12C-mutated-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.aspx","Fri, 30 May 2025 06:16:00 GMT","

Researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have identified a new biomarker, TTF-1, that was predictive of survival outcomes for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), following treatment with the KRAS targeted therapy sotorasib.

Results from the study, published today in Nature Medicine, found patients with lung tumors that express low TTF-1 levels responded poorly to sotorasib – with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.8 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 4.5 months – whereas patients with tumors expressing high TTF-1 levels had a median PFS of 8.1 months and a median OS of 16 months.

Since TTF-1 testing is routinely performed in lung cancer diagnosis, it gives physicians an immediate tool to help identify those patients who may benefit from sotorasib and those who may need an alternative or intensified treatment approach. Our findings support the use of biomarkers to personalize care and could guide the precise application of combination strategies with KRAS inhibitors.""

Ferdinandos Skoulidis, M.D., Ph.D., lead author, associate professor of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology

KRAS is the most common oncogenic driver in non-squamous NSCLC, found to be mutated in 25% to 30% of patients. Sotorasib is a targeted therapy designed to block the KRAS G12C mutant protein, which is found in roughly 13% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common type of NSCLC. Sotorasib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2021 based on results from the CodeBreaK 100 trial. It was the first direct KRAS inhibitor to earn regulatory approval.

This study looked at 317 biomarker-evaluable patients with previously treated advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who had been involved in the CodeBreaK 200 clinical trial and 112 biomarker-evaluable patients treated in the CodeBreaK 100 clinical trial.

In addition, researchers found that the tumor microenvironment – the immune landscape surrounding cancer cells – may also play a role in how well sotorasib works. One subgroup of patients had ""immune cold"" tumors that lacked expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, but they responded better to sotorasib than to chemotherapy. These tumors are typically less likely to respond to immunotherapy.

""This finding is encouraging because it suggests that even patients who don't respond to immunotherapy might still benefit from sotorasib,"" Skoulidis said. ""It also opens the door to exploring combination treatments, like pairing sotorasib with chemotherapy to improve outcomes for even more patients.""

Researchers also were able to demonstrate that rapid clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) – small fragments of DNA from the tumor found in the blood – following initiation of sotorasib was linked with much better outcomes. Patients with detectable KRAS G12C ctDNA during treatment had an increased risk of progression compared to those with ctDNA clearance.

In some patients, ctDNA levels dropped as soon as eight days into treatment, suggesting that a simple blood test could help doctors quickly identify who is benefiting from the therapy.

This work significantly advances precision medicine for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. Future studies will focus on further refining response prediction to RAS inhibitors for patients with TTF-1 expressing tumors and on identifying the most promising combination strategies for those with a poor prognosis who lack TTF-1 expression.

Limitations of the study included incomplete biomarker data for some patients, the potential timing of the data analysis, and the ctDNA panel size.

This study was funded by Amgen Inc.

U.S. women's national team and Portland Thorns midfielder Sam Coffey's affinity for Squishmallows, a plush, pillow-like stuffed toy, has reached international status.

The 26-year-old Thorns captain had just finished a press conference in Monterrey, Mexico, during the Concacaf W Champions League (in which the Thorns placed third) when a local reporter approached her on her way out, Coffey tells The Athletic. And she came bearing gifts.

“A really kind young woman came over and gave me two small, almost Mexican-themed Squishmallows. One was, like, a guacamole with a little chip.” The other, Coffey added, had a “chicken al pastor vibe.”

Coffey is aware of how niche and “maybe childish” Squishmallows are, but her devotion to them never required an audience. Perhaps that's why the reporter's gift nearly moved her to tears, as have those of the supporters who shimmy down stadium steps after her games, offering the stuffed toys in exchange for an autograph.

That seems to be part of Coffey's approach to this phase of her career, one in which she must lead for club and, increasingly, for country, as USWNT head coach Emma Hayes chips away at the national team pool looking for her core group. The team's next two fixtures against China on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3 are among the last matches before Hayes plans to define that core, and Coffey has consistently been a part of that.

It helps that she's stepped into a leadership role with her club.

At first glance, the Thorns roster this season could be described just as accurately by who's not on it: Christine Sinclair and Becky Sauerbrunn, who've retired; Sophia Wilson, who is on parental leave; and Meghan Klingenberg, who left the club last year. Sinclair, Sauerbrunn and Klingenberg were experienced veterans Coffey knows can't be replaced, and rather than force herself into their boots, she's polishing off her own, tucking in her shirt and getting to work as her kind of leader.

After a shaky, 1-2-2 start to the NWSL season, the Thorns turned a corner on April 22 with an emphatic 4-1 home victory over 2023 NWSL Champions Gotham FC. Each Thorns goalscorer netted their first for the club that night, and one of them, rookie Caiya Hanks, attributed the team's performance to Coffey's pregame motivational speech.

Her transition from pseudoleader last season to captain this year has been smooth.

“It's interesting to hear that it looks seamless because it doesn't always feel that way,” she said. “There are days I look around the locker room and I'm like, ‘Wow, this is new.'”



They're all learning as they go, as the newer players settle into the club and Coffey more deeply into her new role.

“I think I was coming into that position alongside Becky and Sincy, and obviously I look up to them so much and it was just such a privilege to do that alongside them,” she said. “I took so many of the lessons that they taught me and shared with the team. I'm now trying to adapt that into my own leadership style now without them.”

For Coffey, this means two things.

“Servant leadership is something that's really important to me and that does draw back to my faith,” she said. “I want to be a leader who puts the team and those around me before myself and pours into those around me, whether that's someone who's playing 90 minutes or someone who doesn't make a game-day roster. I think as a leader, you are in such a unique position to pour into people in a really powerful way that transcends sport.”

The other is more easily ascertained on the pitch: setting the standard and driving the team toward its highest potential. The Thorns' nouveau-veteran trio of Coffey, Olivia Moultrie, and Japan international Hina Sugita has proven a sturdy midfield option, especially with the fresher-faced attack of Hanks, Deyna Castellanos, Mimi Alidou, Payton Linnehan, Pietra Tordin and Reilyn Turner. Outside of their 2-0 loss to Tigres UANL in the Concacaf Champions Cup semifinal, the Thorns are unbeaten in their last five league matches and are fifth in the NWSL table.

“We always will uphold the legacy and cherish so deeply the likes of the Sincys and Klings and Beckys (who) have quite literally laid the foundation for us to be where we are. And we don't ever take that lightly,” Coffey said. “It is really exciting to be now writing this new chapter in their honor and hopefully making them proud.”

Meanwhile, as the U.S. prepares for the international window, Hayes continues to make Coffey a consistent factor in her midfield plans. Her 33 appearances are the second-most in the midfield after Lindsey Heaps, who's made 165 appearances. After that is 17-year-old Lily Yohannes with six, 19-year-olds Moultrie and Claire Hutton with five and two, and Lo'eau LaBonta, who earned her first national camp invitation at 32.

Intergenerational as they may be, and varying widely in national team experience, Coffey is “always passionate” about the USWNT's midfield.

“I think we have ballers in this position, and I think that's only going to continue to unfold and to be witnessed as we continue to learn about each other and grow and develop new partnerships,” she said.

With Hayes at the helm, she thinks players have a better shot at thriving than they have before.

“In the past, I think players have been put in positions maybe they weren't prepared for. Emma is one of, if not the most, methodical person I've ever met. There is a rhyme and a reason to everything. And I think she's all about preparation and putting players in the best position to succeed. And at first, that might mean putting them in a position that's uncomfortable,” she said, referring to the USWNT's 2-1 loss to Brazil in the second leg of friendlies between the two teams last month, in which Hutton, Yohannes and Korbin Albert started in midfield.

“But,” Coffey maintained, “those are the experiences you need to have that ultimately prepare you for the likes of 2027 (World Cup) and 2028 (Olympics). We obviously never want to give up winning and that will never not be our priority. But at the same time, how do we kind of hold in tandem the necessity to develop and to kind of, like, fail upward?”

Looking ahead to China and Jamaica — who will be without the likes of star striker Bunny Shaw, midfield stalwart Drew Spence and goalkeeper Becky Spencer — the games won't likely offer the same possibilities for upward failure as Olympic silver medalists Brazil, but with just under 13 months to prepare for the World Cup, these games are also about the competition within the squad.

Coffey is devoted to the process.

“I'm super excited about our young talent, like Lily and Claire and others,” she said. “It's been such a joy to have them in the environment. I think they're so talented and, again, to be able to slowly but surely create those partnerships, I think by the time we get to the likes of 2027, that it's gonna be something to behold.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Emily Fox's USWNT experience helped her lead Arsenal to the Champions League title","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/emily-fox-arsenal-champions-league-uswnt-20250530.html","Fri, 30 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The saying goes in soccer that to win championships, you have to know how to suffer. Fox learned it helping the U.S. win Olympic gold, and used it in upsetting superpower Barcelona.

In most of the big games Emily Fox plays these days, she plays for the favorite.

It's as true with the U.S. national team as it is with her club, Arsenal, one of the biggest in England and all of Europe. But there are some matchups where the Gunners are the underdogs, and last Saturday's Champions League final was one of them.

Arsenal was up against Barcelona: the two-time reigning European champion, winner of three of the last four, and producer of much of Spain's 2023 World Cup-winning national team. Barcelona had beaten England's top team, Chelsea, 8-2, on aggregate in the two-game semifinals, a bigger feat than Arsenal's 5-3 topping of French power Lyon.

So it was really quite an upset when Arsenal prevailed, 1-0, to win the tournament for the first time in 18 years. Fox had a huge game at right back, with three interceptions, three clearances, two blocks, and eight defensive recoveries.

The saying goes in soccer that to win championships, you have to know how to suffer. Fox knew from experience, but not just in England.

In the seven-plus years since she debuted for the national team, the now-26-year-old has played a lot of games against teams that have made the U.S. suffer. The Americans won most of those games, but that doesn't mean they were easy — especially against teams like Brazil and Japan that keep the ball as much as Barcelona likes to.

So when Fox arrived at U.S. camp to prepare for an upcoming slate of friendlies and sat down for a news conference online, it was natural to ask: did those games help prepare her for what the Champions League final might bring?

“Yeah, absolutely,” she said. “I think, too, when you look at the Brazil game at the Olympics [the gold-medal game], the last game of a tough tournament — with Barcelona, [it was] the last game of the long season. So I definitely think I leaned on that experience and that grind.”

It took 100 minutes, counting stoppage time, with eight minutes tacked on in the second half. When the final whistle blew, Fox and backup defender Jenna Nighswonger became the sixth and seventh Americans to win the women's Champions League, and the first to do so with an English club.

“We did talk about, before the game, being able to suffer and being OK with it because of the talent that Barça has,” Fox said. “And being OK with not having the ball, which normally as a team we don't do.”

She didn't look at the clock for most of the game. In fact, she said, “I tried to avoid it at all costs” until Stina Blackstenius' goal in the 74th minute. That was one of only three Arsenal shots on target in a game where Barcelona had a 20-8 overall shots advantage and 68% of the possession.

To top it off, when the referee called a foul late in stoppage time, players initially thought it was the final whistle before quickly realizing it wasn't. The end came a few seconds later, sparking a celebration among the players and the fans who traveled to Lisbon, Portugal, for the occasion.

“I think you don't realize how well the team is playing, and you're playing, especially in a game like that where no matter who you're up against, they're the best of the best,” Fox said. “So you just have to stay in the moment and stay present because the minute you switch off, they create an amazing opportunity.”

The rewards for winning the Champions League weren't just the trophy, a medal, and a piece of the prize money Arsenal earned throughout the tournament. The Gunners held a title celebration in their North London neighborhood on Monday, and thousands of fans filled the streets.

That big crowd was part of a trend this past season. Arsenal's average attendance of 18,189 easily was the biggest in Europe, helped by playing 13 games at the 60,000-plus-seat Emirates Stadium where the club's men play. (The rest were at a smaller venue in the suburbs.) It also surpasses all the averages in the NWSL so far this year. 

Just counting games in the FA Women's Super League, England's domestic league, Arsenal averaged 28,808, more than triple the other 11 teams in the circuit.

“I'd use the word ‘surreal,' and just honored,” Fox said. “I think when you're in it, it's hard to appreciate it, because you're always used to just go-go-going and what's the next thing? But then again, when you have that time to connect with the fans, and the entire season being able to play at the Emirates … I just think it's been an unreal experience.”

Fox traveled from London to the U.S. team's camp in the Minneapolis area on Tuesday, and was greeted by a silly string shower from her teammates. Then she got right back to work at Wednesday's practice.

The U.S. women will play China on Saturday in St. Paul, Minn. (5:30 p.m., TBS, Universo), then Jamaica on Tuesday in St. Louis (8 p.m., TNT, Universo). The second game will include a tribute to St. Louis native Becky Sauerbrunn, who retired at the end of 2024.

The U.S. women's national team will take on China and Jamaica in two friendlies during this FIFA window. The big news is that Chelsea defender Naomi Girma has returned to the USWNT for the first time in 2025. 

The USWNT will also be boosted by having UEFA Women's Champions League winner Emily Fox in the group. The Arsenal defender was given a hero's welcome when she reported to camp on Tuesday.

While Girma's presence can only make the USWNT stronger, head coach Emma Hayes has repeatedly stated that 2025 is a year of experimentation. Thirteen players in her squad for these two friendlies have five or fewer international caps. 

So, expect plenty of fresh faces and new combinations as the top-ranked Americans welcome No. 17 China this weekend.

FRISCO, Texas (May 30, 2025) – FC Dallas Homegrown midfielder Diego Garcia has been called up to the U.S. U19 Men's National Team for its first camp of 2025 from June 2-10 in Marbella, Spain. The USA will play host Spain on Saturday, June 7, and Ukraine on Tuesday, June 10. Both matches will be played at Estadio Guillermo Amor in Benidorm, Spain.  

Garcia made his FC Dallas debut on May 7 in Dallas' U.S. Lamar Hunt Round of 16 matchup versus AV ALTA FC after entering the match in the 75th minute. Garcia signed as the 38th FC Dallas Homegrown player on Nov. 16, 2022.  

García comes off a historic season with 2024 MLS NEXT Pro champion North Texas SC, registering eight goals and seven assists through the regular season and playoffs, including two game-winning goals and two game-winning assists.

Tim Howard portrayed a bleak situation ahead of the Concacaf Gold Cup for the U.S. men's national team and head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Names like Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Antonee Robinson, Giovanni Reyna, Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah won't participate in the competition for different reasons, but the pressure to build confidence in this USMNT project still remains after a disheartening performance in the Concacaf Nations League.

Speaking on his Unfiltered Soccer podcast with fellow USMNT legend Landon Donovan, the goalkeeper painted a worrying picture for the team.

“My thought was, and still is but that's going to waver in the next month if things don't go well, that Mauricio Pochettino was much, much bigger that U.S. soccer. And I don't mean that negatively. He's a big name, he's coached big characters. My hope would be that there was this plan in place that says, 'This is last chance saloon to get all of my guys together to see what I have,'” Howard said in regards to multiple players including Christian Pulisic asking to be left off the Gold Cup squad.

“Hear me out, I'm going on record as fact. He will not know what his best team is made of in the most difficult moments... think about that for a second.”

Knowing his best team on paper might be easy given the crop of talent, but Howard is more concerned about what happens when push comes to shove on the biggest stage on home soil.

Howard's statement isn't just a prediction, it's a fact of the current situation. Pochettino's had four opportunities to see his squad since taking over in late 2024: two friendly camps and two gatherings for the Concacaf Nations League.

His debut was a mixed bag given USMNT were embarrassed by Mexico, the other friendly camp was primarily for Major League Soccer players given players abroad were with their clubs. Defeating Jamaica in the Nations League quarterfinals wasn't anything to write home about, but their showings against Panama and Canada underwhelmed and worried fans. 

Gold Cup, no matter the importance of the trophy, is an important opportunity to restore belief. If the Argentine can pull it off, while also endearing fans to other players in the squad, it'll be a win-win.

If not, the pressure is going to be turned up a notch. Or worse, fans could just lose interest altogether.

Leeds United will be hoping they can get on the FIFA Club World Cup stage one day themselves.

The plan for Paraag Marathe is clear, get Leeds into Europe, as this project is no doubt a long-term one.

It will take time, but first of all, Daniel Farke needs to keep Leeds in the Premier League after a successful season.

The challenge will be a hard one, but with Leeds set to spend £150m, they have all the right tools to complete the job.

Now, a major target is seemingly available as his absence from the Club World Cup speaks volumes.

James McAtee is firmly on Leeds' radar this summer as the Man City midfielder is looking likely to leave Man City.

Leeds are one of 20 clubs interested in McAtee as the midfielder is certainly a sought-after player after impressing with his limited minutes in Manchester.

A deal clearly won't be easy, but the Whites will be very keen on acquiring the 22-year-old who is worth £35m.

Well, now a new update suggests that McAtee's time under Pep Guardiola is firmly over, and it involves the Club World Cup.

With City partaking in the exciting competition this summer, McAtee will instead be playing for the England under-21s, indicating his time with City is at an end.

James McAtee has been added to the Under 21s' pre-Euro training squad so not going to the Club World Cup. Probably signals the end of his time at Man City.

Farke will know that to succeed in the top flight next season, they need players who will be comfortable in the Premier League.

McAtee is certainly one of those and brings reason why so many clubs are after his signature.

He's shown this ability in many games this season, but one that stood out was City's 5-2 win over Crystal Palace in April.

To have a performance like this with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne around you is some feat and proves exactly why Leeds need to pay £35m for him.

Guardiola seems happy to let McAtee leave and the Whites should be the first club on his doorstep.","{'href': 'https://www.leedsunited.news', 'title': 'leedsunited.news'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Real Madrid have reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early — enabling the right-back to be available for their entire Club World Cup campaign.

The Spanish club will pay €10million (£8.4m; $11.4m) in a single payment for Alexander-Arnold, with the deal worth even more to Liverpool as they will no longer cover the remaining salary and bonuses he is owed.

The 26-year-old will sign a six-year contract with his new side.

The deal was agreed on Monday but was delayed after a man drove into a crowd during Liverpool's title celebrations in the city, with 79 people injured following the incident.

Alexander-Arnold was scheduled to join the Spanish giants as a free agent after his terms at Anfield expire on June 30. That would have seen him miss Madrid's three group-stage fixtures at the Club World Cup in the United States.

The 15-time European champions contacted Liverpool to express an interest in Alexander-Arnold being released sooner and talks ensued to find a solution. Eventually, a compromise was struck and the England international will now move with immediate effect.

In October, FIFA approved a proposal that would allow national associations the option to create an “exceptional registration window” from June 1 to June 10 so teams could register new players ahead of the Club World Cup.

Had Madrid waited until the end of Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool contract on June 30 to sign him for free, they could have registered him for the knockout stage of the competition using the mid-tournament registration window FIFA has added from June 27 to July 3. It means, in effect, Madrid are paying €10m for the extra month so the defender can feature in their group-stage games against Al Hilal (June 18), Pachuca (June 22) and Red Bull Salzburg (June 26).

Madrid did not just target Alexander-Arnold as a potential free transfer — they were prepared to pay €40m to sign him in January, but Liverpool did not entertain the possibility with the player also prioritising his side's Premier League title campaign.

Alexander-Arnold scored 23 goals and provided 92 assists across 354 first-team appearances for Liverpool, where he won two league titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup.

The Englishman's exit from his boyhood club saw him booed by fans at Anfield when he came on as a substitute against Arsenal on May 11, the first game after he announced his intention to depart. In April, two posters were put around Liverpool about Alexander-Arnold's expiring contract, which went viral on social media. Following Liverpool's final game of the season, the 1-1 home draw against Brighton & Hove Albion, Alexander-Arnold was cheered when he lifted the Premier League trophy as part of the club's title celebrations.

Analysis by Real Madrid correspondent Mario Cortegana

Madrid had planned to bring in a right-back since the beginning of the season, and since at least October, they made Alexander-Arnold their first choice.

So, confident after the feedback received from the English player's side, the club tried to bring his arrival forward to the January transfer window — Liverpool didn't engage.

Madrid's efforts to get Alexander-Arnold early stemmed from an increasing need on the pitch.

Dani Carvajal had suffered a serious knee injury (ACL) in October, leaving Lucas Vazquez as the only player in the squad for the position. The Galician, who is expected to leave the club in the summer after not renewing his contract, has had many problems this season.

In January, with no incomings on the horizon, one member of Carlo Ancelotti's coaching staff told The Athletic that “without a right-back, winning the Champions League is impossible”. The champions played Red Bull Salzburg without a recognised right-back in their squad, with Carvajal injured and Vazquez suspended.

This led Ancelotti to start Fede Valverde, his most important midfielder, there 14 times and he did so playing through pain in some of these matches.

The situation for the upcoming Club World Cup has not improved. In addition to Vazquez's performances, there are doubts as to whether Carvajal will be available for the tournament.

That is why the board has moved to provide Xabi Alonso with more options. Madrid opened talks with Liverpool to try to reach an agreement to have Alexander-Arnold in the United States. What was conveyed from Spain was that there would be no problems due to the good relations between the clubs.

In the end, Madrid will pay considerably more than expected, with the initial figures suggested between €1m and €5m. This effort is made by Madrid not only so that Alexander-Arnold can play the three group-stage matches, which are expected to be manageable, but also so that he can be integrated into the group as soon as possible.

Liverpool have secured a mega £10million fee from Real Madrid for Trent Alexander-Arnold to join them early.

The right-back has agreed to a six-year deal at the Santiago Bernabeu and it will begin on Sunday when the transfer window officially opens. Both clubs have confirmed the move.   

Mail Sport revealed in March that Real wanted the right back early to play in the Club World Cup.

Their initial offer was £850,000 to get him ahead of his contract expiring at the end of June.

But despite already playing his last game for Liverpool and effectively being on holiday now, the Premier League champions will get £10m.

Real kick off their Club World Cup campaign on June 18 and Alexander-Arnold will be officially unveiled as their player before that.

Alexander-Arnold has already updated his Instagram bio to include Real Madrid's name

Xabi Alonso, who has been confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti's successor on a three-year deal, wanted Alexander-Arnold through the door early. 

This Club World Cup means more than most as it is the first in the revamped format with 32 teams. 

Alexander-Arnold has already updated his Instagram bio to include Real Madrid and he shared a post from the club welcoming him. 

He has enjoyed a wholesome goodbye to the club he has served for 20 years, despite facing boos and criticism in recent times. 

He called the Premier League trophy parade around Liverpool the 'perfect send-off' and looked emotional as he held the silverware high on top of the bus. 

'Perfect send off. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, I love my city,' he wrote.  

He was given also given a warm reception at Anfield on Sunday and described celbrating the title in front of fans as the 'best day of his life'. He was overcome with tears at full time after their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace.

Supporters welcomed him with widespread cheer and applause as he replaced Conor Bradley at half-time and gave him similar adoration as he did a lap of the crowd at the finale.

Alexander-Arnold struggled to hold back the tears as he spoke to Sky Sports and the floodgates opened as he embraced his mum Dianne and dad Michael, with his brothers joining them on the pitch.

'I didn't know what to expect stepping out at Anfield today after what had happened,' he admitted.

'But I wanted to play for the club one more time, I told the manager, and he trusted me. The reception I got means so much to me. I have never felt more loved and more cared for than today. 

'I hope that one day the fans and supporters of this club are able to recognise the hard work I put in for this team.

'From six to 26, 20 years is a very long time. I have loved every second of it, it has been an honour and a privilege to be a part of this club.

'I'll remember these moments for the rest of my life. This day will go down as the best in my life.'

It looked as if Alexander-Arnold would exit Anfield under a cloud after he was booed by fans during Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal earlier this month. 

Boos rang around the ground as the Englishman made his way onto the pitch before chants of 'there's only one Conor Bradley' broke out. 

Real Madrid have announced that Alexander-Arnold, 26, will join them on a six-year deal

Alexander-Arnold could opt to follow Bellingham and live in La Finca, which is known as Madrid's Beverly Hills

He also cut a despondent figure at full time against Brighton, when fans were partying in the away end despite the 3-2 defeat. 

But a rousing speech last week by Jurgen Klopp - who watched from the stands like a proud father on Sunday - appears to have swung the mood.

The England star will link up with his good friend Jude Bellingham in the Spanish capital. 

If he turns to Bellingham for advice, Alexander-Arnold could find himself living in what has been dubbed as the 'Beverly Hills' of Madrid.

Bellingham has been staying in a £5.5m property in the gated VIP bunker neighbourhood of La Finca - The Ranch - since signing for Los Blancos in June 2023.

The gated VIP neighbourhood is located a 15-minute drive north west of the city centre in the upper-class suburb of Pozuelo de Alarcon where the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo still owns a mansion.

Bellingham is understood to have been renting there and sharing with his mum who aids him in the handling of his schedule and other affairs.

The England midfielder's home reportedly has six-bedrooms, a home theatre, as well as a sauna, gym and pool in the garden.

Alexander-Arnold would likely follow the likes of Bellingham in being gifted new luxury BMW cars as part of a partnership between the manufacturer and Real Madrid

He has previously credited his success down to parents Dianne and Michael

Alexander-Arnold would join a host of Real Madrid stars to have called La Finca home, with club legends Iker Casillas, Raul and Zinedine Zidane having resided there during their spells at the club.

More recently, the likes of Eden Hazard and Toni Kroos are among those to have called the neighbourhood home.

One of La Finca's most recent residents is another of Real Madrid's marquee free transfers, with Kylian Mbappe reported to have paid €10.5m (£8.8m) to buy a luxury mansion formerly owned by Gareth Bale.

Stars have tended to reside in either Los Lagos I or II, named after the artificial lakes created in the complex, with the former featuring the larger properties.

An alternative location for Alexander-Arnold could be the La Moraleja neighbourhood, which is located close to Real Madrid's Valdebebas training ground. 

David and Victoria Beckham bought a home in La Moraleja in June 2005 for £3m after the former England captain joined Real Madrid. They sold it to a wealthy Spanish entrepreneur for £4.2m nearly ten years later and eight years after they moved out. 

Vinicius Jr and Luka Modric are among the more recent Real Madrid stars to have opted to live in the La Moraleja neighbourhood. La Moraleja has long been one of the favourite residences for star footballers and other major names in Spain.

GOAL goes over everything fans need to know about the unique transfer window opening from June 1-10 ahead of the Club World Cup

FIFA has opened a special transfer window from June 1-10, allowing teams to make roster additions ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. It's an unprecedented move to allow players to swap clubs this early in the offseason. Still, with the marquee event beginning in just over two weeks on June 14, they opted to open the window so teams could bolster their core ahead of the competition.

Likewise, U.S. Soccer has reportedly sanctioned a window to run during the same timeline, but has limited it to the MLS teams competing in the tournament - Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders, and potentially, LAFC. The Black and Gold face Liga MX side Club America Saturday evening in a Club World Cup playoff game, with the winner clinching a berth in the competition.

FIFA and U.S. Soccer have introduced new rules and amended existing ones ahead of this summer's competition, aimed at facilitating player movement. As a result, clubs participating in the tournament have additional flexibility in the transfer window - though some of the changes may not be widely known or understood by fans.

Some players have an opportunity to sign a short-term contract to compete, strictly in the competition, before entering free agency this summer. Others are completing pre-agreed transfers, while some are swapping new clubs entirely on multi-year deals. Then, there's a unique case like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Real Madrid, as Los Blancos have now paid the Reds $11.3 million(€10 million) to secure his services ahead of the competition despite his contract ending on June 30.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","'Club World Cup start of new season for Man City'","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c249gpdlnl3o","Fri, 30 May 2025 12:33:10 GMT","

Haaland scored 31 goals last season, his lowest return since joining Manchester City in June 2022

The Club World Cup is the ""beginning of the new season"" and ""not the continuation of last season"", says Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak.

City endured a disappointing 2024-25 campaign in which they failed to win a major trophy for the first time in eight years and finished third in the Premier League.

They played their last game of the season at Fulham last Sunday but are back in competitive action just 24 days later at the expanded 32-team Fifa tournament which starts on 14 June in the United States.

""The team will take the rest that they will take right now, then they start pre-season and then immediately straight into the Club World Cup,"" said Khaldoon in an in-house club interview.

""We're excited to come in as champions. The format actually, I really like it.

""This is the beginning of the new season, not the continuation of last season.""

Pep Guardiola's men travel to the US having won the event two years ago in its previous guise, beating Fluminese in the final in Saudi Arabia.

Khaldoon said City want to be ready with their ""new squad"" for the start of the tournament.

AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders has been heavily linked with a move to Etihad Stadium, while City are also interested in Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White.

There will be two transfer windows this summer - one before the Club World Cup, from 1-10 June, to allow Manchester City and Chelsea to sign players.

It will then close close for five days before running again from 16 June to 1 September.

City players have raised concerns about the relentless fixture schedule, with defender Manuel Akanji joking last year that he may have to retire at 30, while Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who missed the majority of the season with a serious knee injury, said players had been close to going on strike. 

City manager Guardiola said any changes regarding football's increasing fixture demands must be led by the players.

In January, a meeting between players' union Fifpro and world governing body Fifa took place discussing the packed calendar after the body representing players filed legal complaint against the the world governing body citing ""abuse of dominance"".

The revamped Club World Cup will see City play Moroccan side Wydad AC on 18 June (17:00 BST), Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates on 23 June (02:00) and then Juventus on 26 June (20:00) in the group stages.

With the top two from each of the eight groups qualifying for the knockout stages the teams that reach the final, on 13 July, will play seven games.

The Premier League season kicks off on 13 August.

Given the lack of rest for players, questions have been raised about how seriously teams would be taking it, but Khaldoon was in no doubt.

""This is a very, very serious competition,"" he said. ""In the summer, the whole world will be watching this.

""A big number of the top teams in the world will be competing in this tournament and I can assure you, we're going to give it our best shot.

""We're going there to win it.""

City are still waiting to learn the outcome of the hearing into its 115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breaches.

The hearing took place in front of an independent commission between September and December.

If City - who strongly deny the charges - are found guilty, the commission has unlimited powers, which include a points deduction and relegation.

Khaldoon added: ""We still don't have a ruling. Once there's a ruling, I'll be able to speak about it.

""Until then we just have to be patient, and it'll come, and we will talk about it, I promise you, once we have the ruling.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","‘We know what's at stake': LAFC braces for shot at Club World Cup","https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/lafc/story/2025-05-30/lafc-knows-qualifying-for-club-world-cup-worth-millions","Fri, 30 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

LAFC has won an MLS Cup and played in two CONCACAF Champions League finals.

None of those games were worth as much as the team's upcoming match.

Literally.

Next up for LAFC is the $10-Million Game, in which it will play Mexico's Club América on Saturday at Banc of California to determine the final entrant in the Club World Cup. The 32-team tournament, which will be staged across the United States from mid-June to mid-July, has a record-breaking billion-dollar prize pool.

By simply qualifying for the event and playing in three group-stage matches, LAFC would be entitled to a participation fee of $9.55 million.

That might not be considered a significant prize for the Dodgers or Lakers, but it's a major bounty for LAFC, which had a payroll of about $20 million last season.

 LAFC 

Carlos Vela, the first designated player LAFC signed, announced his retirement and will become an ambassador for club.

“We know what's at stake,” LAFC co-president John Thorrington said.

Imagine that, a Major League Soccer team playing a game with real consequences. The stakes are unusually high for a team in a league in which 18 of 30 teams reach the postseason and the threat of relegation is non-existent.

Real money will be on the line.

That's money that could go toward covering the transfer fee or salary of the team's next signature player, as one of LAFC's three designated-player slots could open this summer.

Thorrington preferred to emphasize the symbolic importance of LAFC reaching the Club World Cup, how it would move the team one step closer to its long-stated ambition of becoming a global brand.

“The conversation here is not dominated by the financial benefit here, but rather the competitive opportunity that this game and the tournament present,” Thorrington said.

If LAFC advances to the Club World Cup, its opening game will be against Chelsea of the English Premier League. The other group-stage games would be against ES Tunis of Tunisia and Flamengo of Brazil.

“I think it would be something special,” defender Eddie Segura said in Spanish.

The tournament could also be a wake-up call for MLS, which has two other teams in the competition in Inter Miami and the Seattle Sounders. The league has a salary cap, as well as paint-by-numbers roster compliance rules that permit minimal flexibility on how its teams can spend money. Soccer is a sport in which teams are only as good as their weakest links, but the regulations force clubs to construct top-heavy rosters.

 LAFC 

LAFC rallies from a two-goal deficit behind goals from Olivier Giroud and Mark Delgado in a 2-2 draw with Montreal.

As it was, the financial restrictions were already handicapping MLS teams in its competitions against its Mexican counterparts, with LAFC relying on its smarts instead of the economic might of its deep-pocketed owners to reach two Champions League finals. Now, MLS teams will be taking on opponents with virtually unlimited budgets. Just two years ago, Chelsea spent more than a billion dollars buying players in a single transfer window.

The Club World Cup's cash prizes offer MLS a powerful incentive to loosen its rules. Group-stage wins are worth $2 million each. Teams will be paid $7.5 million for reaching the round of 16. The champion will take home more than $100 million.

The payouts could also force MLS to make changes to its collective bargaining agreement, which was signed when the Club World Cup was still a seven-team tournament. Under the current CBA, LAFC's players would divide $1 million, with the remainder of the $9.55 million participation fee staying with the club.

Segura said the players are engaged in talks over their compensation.

“The club would benefit a lot, but I hope that we as players, as the ones who are there giving everything, will also have a chance to benefit,” Segura said.

The upcoming game has also offered LAFC a firsthand view of FIFA's operations.

LAFC's and Club América's opportunity came at the expense of León, which was removed from the Club World Cup field because it was owned by the same group that owned another Mexican team in the tournament, Pachuca.

León qualified for the tournament by defeating LAFC in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League final. Rather than award León's place to LAFC, FIFA basically invented a play-in game out of thin air, calling on LAFC to take on Club América, which was the region's highest-ranked team that wasn't already in the tournament.

LAFC was at least granted a chance. The Galaxy won the MLS Cup last season, but Inter Miami received the place reserved for the host nation before the MLS playoffs even started. The purported reason was that Inter Miami had the league's best regular-season record. However, the widespread suspicion was that FIFA wanted Lionel Messi in the tournament.

After all, money is what is driving this tournament and money is what is driving the sport.

SEATTLE — Lumen Field is set to receive a grass pitch and millions of dollars in upgrades ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, using $19.4 million in state funding.

Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month signed a budget that allocates $29.5 million for capital improvements to prepare Seattle for the global event. Much of that funding will go to Lumen Field, which is managed by the Washington State Public Stadium Authority.

The funds will be used to install a FIFA-required grass surface, enhance security in the stadium's north parking lot, and upgrade seating in bleacher sections, according to a Lumen Field spokesperson. The planned parking improvements include new lighting, surveillance cameras, turnstiles and traffic barriers.

An additional $100,000 will be used to support practice facilities at Gonzaga University.

Some of the projects are already underway. Construction of the pitch will begin after the completion of the upcoming NFL season, a Lumen spokesperson said. 

Lumen will be rebranded ""Seattle Stadium"" for the duration of the games to agree with FIFA rules related to branding and sponsorship. 

Seattle is one of 11 U.S. cities selected to host matches during the 2026 World Cup. Lumen Field will host six games, including one featuring Team USA during the group stage and two knockout-round matches.

Officials said in December they expect the tournament to generate nearly $1 billion in revenue and create more than 21,000 jobs in the region. 

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place from June 11 to July 19.

There's less than a month to go until the FIFA Club World Cup kicks-off in the United States, with some matches being played right here in Charlotte at the Bank of America Stadium.  In a historic moment for North Carolina sports, Charlotte has been selected as one of the host cities for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, marking the first time the Queen City will welcome the world's top football clubs. 

The expanded 32-team tournament, hosted across the United States, will feature 63 matches from June 14 to July 13, 2025.  Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium will host a marquee Round of 16 clash between Manchester City, the reigning UEFA Champions League winners, and CA Boca Juniors, South America's legendary powerhouse. The match is expected to draw tens of thousands of fans and millions of global viewers.

The Charlotte fixture promises a galaxy of football stars:

Harry Kane on the Club World Cup

Harry Kane, leading the line for FC Bayern München, expressed his enthusiasm for the tournament and its U.S. setting:

“It's going to be unique. Playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past, but I think it's going to be a great experience,” Kane said.  “Going out to the U.S., especially a year before the World Cup, is a great chance to get to know the stadiums and the fans. I'm really excited for it”

Where to Buy Tickets

Tickets for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, including the Charlotte matches, are available now through the official FIFA website:

Despite some ups and downs, it was ultimately a successful season for the Blues, but some will be happier with their individual campaigns than others

It was a rollercoaster, but it all worked out in the end for Chelsea in 2024-25 as they secured a return to the Champions League and a first trophy for more than three years. Objective(s) complete for head coach Enzo Maresca following his appointment last summer.

Despite their best efforts to throw it away in the second half of the season, the Blues finally claimed a top-five place on the Premier League's final day at Nottingham Forest's expense, and three days later Reece James held the Conference League trophy aloft in Wroclaw after a comeback victory over Real Betis.

The end result of Champions League football and a piece of silverware will be highly satisfying to everyone associated with the football club, but on an individual level, which players deserve plaudits and who failed to hit the mark? Some delivered consistently colossal performances across the campaign, others started strongly but fell away and many failed to have any impact at all.

The Spaniard is on the verge of ending the club's agonising wait for European Cup glory thanks to some inspired decisions and vital support

The Paris Saint-Germain job has long been regarded as a poisoned chalice. Money is no object to the club's Qatari owners, which is obviously an ideal scenario for any coach, but limitless financial backing means that patience is always in short supply.

Carlo Ancelotti, Laurent Blanc, Unai Emery, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Christophe Galtier all won trophies during their respective spells at Parc des Princes, but not the one that PSG craved above all others - the Champions League.

On Saturday in Munich, though, Luis Enrique has a glorious chance to succeed where all of his high-profile predecessors have failed. So, how has the Spaniard done it?

Chelsea have just won the UEFA Conference League after defeating Real Betis 4-1 in midweek, and they are not wasting any time preparing for next season. According to reports, the Blues have already reached an agreement to sign Ipswich Town's star striker Liam Delap.

The Blues positively ended their season as they won the Conference League and also secured Champions League football. Despite the trouble they experienced at the start, Enzo Maresca's side was able to achieve their targets.

However, despite their good season, Chelsea are not resting on their laurels as Maresca's side is already making moves for next season. The Blues remain active in the transfer market as they reportedly have agreed to sign Ipswich Town's star, Liam Delap.

According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea moved quickly to seal the 22-year-old striker by triggering his 30 million pound buy out clause. There's no issue whatsoever with Ipswich or Delap's camp as all parties have agreed on the deal.

The Blues are keen to complete the young striker's deal as soon as possible to avoid any potential competition with other teams, especially Manchester United. Reports also suggest that Chelsea has set a medical date for Delap and his contract signing, along with the announcement, should arrive after he completes his medical.

The 22-year-old attacker's upcoming move will also bring some financial profit for Manchester City, as they are set to receive 30% of the transfer fee. Coming from City's academy, Delap is certainly a player who Maresca knows quite well, which is why the tactician approves of the decision to sign the England u21 international this summer.

It will be interesting to see whether Delap can adapt quickly and become Chelsea's main goal-getter who can help them compete for the Premier League title next season.

Lorenzo Musetti passed his first test at this year's Roland Garros on Friday when he rallied from a set and a break down to move past Mariano Navone 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 and match his best result at the clay-court major.

The eighth-seeded Italian trailed Navone 4-6, 0-2 and in previous years may have faltered against the consistent Argentine, who has reached tour-level finals on clay in Rio de Janeiro and Bucharest.

However, this season, the 23-year-old is playing with a new-found grit and resilience. The 2024 Olympic bronze medalist Musetti started to find his range off the backhand wing and used his slice and heavy forehand to force Navone out of his comfort zone and turn the tables in hot conditions.

After committing 19 unforced errors in the first set, Musetti tightened up, hitting 31 across the next three sets to advance to the fourth round after three hours and 28 minutes on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.

""It was completely different conditions than the past two matches. The ball was bouncing not that high and today at the beginning I was a bit surprised and physically I could not find my best shape,"" Musetti said. ""But then after I started to feel better and at the end I was improving my game, so I am happy and really proud of my comeback.""

Into the Round of 16 🗣️@Lorenzo1Musetti defeats Navone 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-2 to advance in Paris.@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/JdSthppUrE

Musetti, who did not drop a set in his opening two wins against Yannick Hanfmann and Daniel Elahi Galan, has been red-hot on the clay since the Olympics last July, which were held in Paris. The No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings advanced to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title match in Monte-Carlo in April and then reached semi-finals in Madrid and Rome.

""I have put some order in my tennis house,"" Musetti said on his improvement. ""It is not easy for me to make a decision, so I think the key is I have more idea of what I have to do on court. I have worked a lot on the attitude, on the mental side. For a match like this, before I don't know if I would have comeback like today, so I am proud of what I am achieving this season so far.""

Now 17-3 on clay in 2025, the Italian will aim to reach the quarter-finals at Roland Garros for the first time when he takes on 10th seed Holger Rune.

Musetti has suffered Roland Garros heartbreak in the past, notably on debut in 2021 when he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to love before falling. However, this is a new Musetti and the 23-year-old demonstrated his new-found confidence by flexing his muscles in celebration after improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Navone.



On Court Philippe-Chatrier, Rune rallied back from the brink to overcome Frenchman Quentin Halys 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 and reach the fourth round in Paris for the fourth consecutive year.

The 22-year-old Dane was two points from defeat when serving at 4-5, 15/30 in the fourth set, but upped the aggression and intensity from that moment, winning nine of the final 11 games. Rune holds a 7-3 fifth-set record at majors.

“I tried to change some things. The first set didn't go how I wanted it to. I tried to adapt, with the conditions being much different today. I put more spin on the ball as the ball was flying more, but the player who took more risk was the most efficient today,” Rune said. “I am very happy with how I played in the fourth and in the fifth, I think that is some tennis I can use moving forward in the tournament.”

The World No. 10 is a two-time quarter-finalist in the French capital and is just the ninth man in the Open Era to reach the fourth round at Roland Garros in all of his first four appearances, joining champions Rafael Nadal, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Jim Courier, Mats Wilander and Bjorn Borg.

Rune, who lifted the title on clay at the ATP 500 in Barcelona in April, will take a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his meeting with Musetti.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Andrey Rublev picks who the fastest player is on the ATP Tour and who has the best forehand","https://tennishead.net/andrey-rublev-picks-who-the-fastest-player-is-on-the-atp-tour-and-who-has-the-best-forehand/","Fri, 30 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Andrey Rublev has endured a patchy past 12 months, but he remains a threat no matter the surface.

After all, there are some traits that transcend conditions, and if it is firing, his forehand is one of them.

Should an opponent not get regular depth and pace on their groundstrokes, and instead tee up short balls for the Russian to attack, he will almost always punish them.

And yet, when asked who he felt had the best forehand on tour, Rublev opted for one of his opponents.

Naturally, when asked to craft his ultimate tennis player based on seven key characteristics, the Big Three had to feature.

However, there were also a few surprise additions, with one current ATP star actually featuring twice alongside Novak Djokovic.

For serve, Rublev could not decide between Nick Kyrgios and Reilly Opelka, but he was instant in his answer for the best forehand: Carlos Alcaraz.

Then when asked for who had the best footwork, he deduced that the fastest on tour was also the Spaniard, further praising the youngster.

Andrey Rublev builds his ultimate tennis player 💪 pic.twitter.com/TxTQOOLUv3

Elsewhere, Rafael Nadal was picked for mindset, Roger Federer for volleys and Djokovic for returns and backhand. Alcaraz is in good company.

Despite that, Alcaraz wishes he could take something from Juan Carlos Ferrero's game, suggesting he is far from finished improving.

Already, despite his youth, Alcaraz is being touted to hijack the innumerable records set by the Big Three.

And with good reason given the history he has already made at just 22 years old.

He is the youngest ever year-end world number one, and the youngest man to have won three Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces. That second one he accomplished this time last year, when he won the French Open as a 21-year-old. He's now seeking to repeat that feat as the defending champion and take his total majors tally to five.

Alcaraz has more Grand Slam titles than legends like Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and Arthur Ashe, and is quite clearly one of the dominant two players of his generation.

In another 15 years, when he is around the age Djokovic is now, there's every chance he could be discussed as equal, or even better than the Big Three.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Joshua Mayne

Alex de Minaur has become the latest tennis star to criticise the sport's gruelling calendar.

Players on the ATP and WTA Tours are on the road for the majority of the season, which typically begins in late December and runs through to late November. 

World No. 9 de Minaur suffered a surprise second-round loss to Alexander Bublik at Roland-Garros and spoke post-match about the men's tennis schedule.

He explained that players will ""burn out mentally"" if the demanding programme remains.

""No one's got a solution,"" de Minaur said.

""But the solution is simple: you shorten the schedule, right?

""What's not normal is that for the last three, four years I've had two days off after the Davis Cup and I've gone straight into pre-season, straight into the new season again.

""Once you start, you don't finish until November 24. So it's never-ending.

""The way it's structured ... I had to deal with that. I'm still dealing with that right now.

""The solution is you shorten, because what's going to happen is players' careers are going to get shorter and shorter because they're just going to burn out mentally.

""There's just too much tennis.""

Fellow Australian Jordan Thompson slammed the ATP Tour schedule days earlier, describing it as ""sh**"". 

""Unfortunately, with the schedule and how sh** it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money, and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity,"" he said.

On Thursday, two-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud likened the ranking system to a ""rat race"", outlining how players feel compelled to compete in the events, even if they are carrying injuries.

""Well, it's kind of like a rat race when it comes to the rankings,"" he said.

""You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events.

""You feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play ... the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't.""

French Open Chaos: Tennis Pros Expose Brutal Reality of ATP Tour Scheduling

The world of professional tennis is in turmoil as top players reveal the harrowing toll of the grueling ATP calendar. Following Casper Ruud's heartbreaking exit from the French Open due to a persistent knee injury, the dark side of the ATP's mandatory event rules has been thrust into the spotlight once again.

Ruud, a standout player, expressed his frustration, labeling the ranking system as a “rat race” that forces players to compete even when injured. The pressure to participate in a certain number of events, including Grand Slams and Masters 1000 tournaments, is taking a severe physical and mental toll on the athletes.

But Ruud is not alone in his outcry. Japanese player Yoshihito Nishioka joined the chorus of dissent, highlighting the punishing schedule that leaves players with little time to rest and recover. Nishioka's own battle with injuries, including a recent shoulder issue, underscores the grueling nature of professional tennis and the sacrifices players make to stay in the game.

The ATP's stringent rules have sparked outrage among players like Alex de Minaur, who slammed the federation for its relentless scheduling. De Minaur, ranked No. 9 in the world, expressed concerns about the physical and mental fatigue players face due to the non-stop nature of the tour. The Australian star's sentiments echo those of his peers, calling for a reevaluation of the ATP calendar to prevent early burnout and potential career-ending injuries.

As the French Open unfolds amidst controversy and chaos, the voices of these ATP pros serve as a stark reminder of the challenges and sacrifices professional tennis players endure. Will the authorities heed their warnings and implement changes to protect the well-being of the athletes? Only time will tell.

The discussion around player workload and scheduling concerns is far from over. Stay tuned as the tennis world grapples with the harsh realities of life on the ATP tour, and share your thoughts on this pressing issue.

Who said the second round of a slam couldn't be entertaining?

Fans across the world were treated to a thrilling spectacle on Day 5 of Roland Garros with five five setter matches played in the men's singles draw. 

Home favorite Arthur Fils came back from injury to edge past Spain's Jaume Munar in a dramatic showdown on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, while Alexander Bublik rallied from two sets down to defeat Alex de Minaur. 

It was a treat to watch tennis played at its highest caliber in a grand showcase that highlighted the depth of the men's field this year.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

In a 4-hour and 25-minute epic, Fils overcame Munar 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 in by far one of the best matches of the tournament. The 20-year-old took the lead after winning the first two sets with two tight tiebreakers; however, he quickly lost momentum at the beginning of the third.

The Frenchman proceeded to lose 10 straight games, and towards the end of the fourth set, it was obvious he was in pain. Treatment for a back injury seemed to revive Fils as he came onto the court for the fifth set with a renewed determination. 

It seemed improbable that he would pull through when he went down 1-3, but Fils fought back, hitting a crucial forehand down the line on his service game and a line-kissing corner forehand to break Munar to tie at 3-3. 'It came down to Fils' service game at 4-4 while he was down 0-40. A serve and volley was the momentum he needed to get himself back in the match and win the next two games.

Following his victory, Fils wasn't shy in letting the crowd know how he felt. He tossed his shirt off before stepping onto the court, pumping both fists in victory, shouting out to a frenzied French crowd. 

In one of the bigger upsets of the tournament, Alexander Bublik came back from two sets down to defeat Alex de Minaur 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. This is the Kazakh's first time reaching the third round at Roland Garros.

It seemed like the Demon was in control after grabbing a two-set lead a little over an hour into the match. The often erratic and unpredictable Bublik had other plans. In what was some of his best tennis this season, Bublik kicked into third gear during the third set to break the Australian early and prevent his comeback at 4-4.

In true Bublik fashion, he won the fourth set with a powerful backhand down the line after using a tweener to bring de Minaur to the net. The Aussie had no answers to Bublik's comeback as he powered through the fifth, winning the match and shocking himself.

""I was still not hoping to win,"" he admitted to Tennis Channel. ""I was just keep my serve, maybe he's gonna you a chance."" 

De Minaur admitted feeling ""burnt out"" following the match, calling out the ATP's long schedule and once again raising the conversation of a shorter schedule, echoed by compatriot Jordan Thompson earlier this week.

In another shocking upset, qualifier Henrique Rocha defeated Jakub Menšík 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Rocha joins compatriot Nuno Borges in the round of 32, marking the first time in Roland Garros history that two Portuguese ATP players have advanced to round 3. 

Menšík, who beat Novak Djokovic to win the Miami Open earlier this year, played a routine first two sets, taking advantage of key break points to win on Rocha's service games. However, he faltered in the third, losing momentum and unable to recover once Rocha claimed the third set. 

The 19-year-old Menšík is considered to be one of the best upcoming youngster's on tour, as stated by Mats Wilander, and was expected to make a deep run at the tournament.

Rocha mimicked Chelsea footballer Cole Palmer's ice-cold celebration following his win, much to the delight of the French crowd.

American qualifier Ethan Quinn played a rollercoaster 4 hour and 14 minute match to beat Alexander Shevchenko 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(5), 7-6(3), 7-5. He hit a total of 92 winners on his way to victory.

Quinn played a tough three rounds of qualifying to make it into the main draw, his first at Roland Garros and second grand slam main draw overall. 

Quinn and Shevchenko battled it out in two back-to-back tiebreaks in the third and fourth set before coming down to the wire at 5-5 in the fifth. The American saved two break points before going on to win the match. 

Quinn is one of five American men into the third round. He joins Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe, Sebastian Korda, and Tommy Paul for a chance to fight for a spot in the round of 16.

Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic upset 27th seed Denis Shapovalov 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6), 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 to advance to the third round. The Canadian attempted to launch a comeback after losing the first two sets in tiebreakers, but Misolic was undeterred.

This is Misolic's second time qualifying for Roland Garros and his first reaching the third round. He had yet to reach the main draw in any grand slam until Roland Garros in 2024. Shapovalov has been out of form this clay season, unable to make it past the round of 32 in any of the tournaments he played.

Misolic faces Novak Djokovic in the next round. Stay locked into Sports Illustrated's Serve On SI for all of your tennis news from the court and beyond.

Live Roland Garros updates from 10am BST

Why not email Tom with thoughts on the action

Shelton looks on course for a three-set win against Gigante. He has a break in the third set to lead 4-3.

Medjedovic is serving to stay in the match against Altmaier. The German is up 5-2 in the fourth set.

Korda's serve looks in beautiful rhythm as he bangs down his third ace. Tiafoe finds a beautiful return on his forehand wing but Korda is unfazed and sees out another hold. Korda 4-3 Tiafoe.

Korda eased through his service game and Tiafoe is definitely not getting it so easy. An ace just at the right time nudges Tiafoe ahead 40-30 but then he double faults. It's a shortlived scare as Korda fails to capitalise. As you were, 3-3.

Seb's older sister Nelly is currently also competing in a major. The world number one is currently T2 at -4 in golf's US Women's Open at Erin Hills with three holes left of her second round. What an outrageously talented family.

Korda is making Tiafoe work for it in this service game. We're over five minutes in this game now as the man in all blue as finally gets an error out of Korda to get over the line. All square 2-2.

Bonsoir, dear readers. I'm back with news of Ben Shelton taking the second set against Matteo Gigante 6-3 on Simonne Mathieu. On Court 14, Hamad Medjedovic trails Germany's Daniel Altmaier by two sets to one and they are on serve in the fourth.

Tiafoe is locked in a deuce battle with Korda … no he's not! He smacks an ace down the middle and the score in the first set is: Tiafoe 1-1 Korda.

And with that, my work here is done. Back to you Tom.

Note: Damir Dzumhur v Carlos Alcaraz, the No 2 seed in the men's singles, is due to start at 19.15 BST on Philippe-Chatrier.

*Tiafoe 0-1 Korda (*denotes next server)

Tiafoe takes his US compatriot to deuce, but Korda closes out the game and leads in the first.

I'm not here much longer, I don't think, so NOW is the time to send me an email.

Tiafoe is yet to drop a set at this tournament: He's beaten both Roman Safiullin and Pablo Carreño Busta in three.

Shelton 6-3, 5-2 Gigante, Medjedovic 6-4, 3-6, 3-5 Altmaier are a couple of latest scores from the men's singles.

Something appetising coming up now on Suzanne Lenglen in the men's singles. Frances Tiafoe (15) against Sebastian Korda (23). They are warming up now. Allez!

“It was a good match, after a few games,” Paolini says. “At the beginning I was a bit [laughs] not feeling really well … The conditions were a bit different.

“I'm happy with the win. Thank you for staying here and watching me.” The crowd applauds warmly.

Apparently, only Aryna Sabalenka has won more matches in grand slams than Paolini over the past two seasons. Is she surprised by that?

“It's funny. So strange [laughs again]. I am feeling good, it's an amazing court. You know, just enjoying being on this stage. It's one of the most beautiful tournaments in the world. I don't know, it's a special place for me.”

Does she feel the love of the Roland Garros crowd?

“Yes, yes … Thank you very much guys … it's special to play in front of you and to have your support … I feel lucky.”

What a great interview, what a star.

The Ukrainian winds up a couple of big forehands in the final game and goes down fighting, but eventually dumps a shot into the net, and that's the lot. Paolini is into the last 16. She made 24 unforced errors, described as her “B-Game” by the commentator. “She still got the job done.”

Over to Chatrier. Paolini is on the verge against Starodubtseva. The Italian is serving for the match at 5-1.

Starodubtseva shows steel to save the first match point, and force deuce …

“I expected a tough match,” says Rybakina. “I was ready. It's quite hot, I played really late the last match. It's a big difference in the conditions. But I am happy with how I managed today. Thanks everyone who came to support.

“I like it when it [the court and conditions] are fast. But it's difficult to control the ball, too, so it's a bit mixed. It helps for the serve … overall, I am really happy with the game, and the way I played today.

“I think I know who I am going to play next [the four-times champion Iga Swiatek] … since the draw is getting smaller, of course I know my next opponent, and I will try to do my best.”

A textbook forehand winner down the line seals it for the Kazakhstani. That was a demoralising outing for the Latvian, who was thoroughly outclassed.

“Ostapenko has raised her game considerably in the final set, but Rybakina has just had too much,” remarks Simon Reed on commentary. Match point …

*Rybakina 6-2, 5-2 Ostapenko (*denotes next server)

It was a false dawn for the Latvian. Rybakina breaks again, with relative ease, and is now one game away from victory.

On Philippe-Chatrier, the fourth seed Paolini is a break up in the second set against Starodubtseva at 3-1 and also looking well set.

Rybakina 6-2, 4-2 *Ostapenko (*denotes next server)

Huge heart from Ostapenko! She's been getting bullied in the last couple of games but fashions a chance for a break back and takes it with a fine cross-court winner. She gees the crowd up as she celebrates, waving both hands above her head, and asking the fans for some energy as she battles against this fearsome opponent.

*Rybakina 6-2, 4-1 Ostapenko (*denotes next server)

Ouch! Rybakina has seriously asserted herself there. She wins break points and has to wait an age for a bouncing defensive effort from Ostapenko after stretching the Latvian this way and that around the court. Rybakina waits, and waits, and then smacks an unerring smash down the line from the back of the court, giving her opponent no chance, and creating a double-break advantage at 4-1.

Paolini has wrapped up the first set v Starodubtseva, 6-4.

Rybakina 6-2, 3-1 *Ostapenko (*denotes next server)

I was just about to say Rybakina is serving like a dream but here is a break-back point for Ostapenko at 30-40 … Rybakina, however, produces a power-packed serve out wide and then one down the middle, provoking a roar of frustration from her opponent. The Kazakhstani duly tidies up the game and it's 3-1. That was a big, impressive hold from break-point down.

Thank you Tom and bonsoir, everyone.

Right, I'm off for a break but Luke McLaughlin is here to keep an eye on things. Take it away, Luke.

We're still on serve between Paolini and Starodubtseva at 4-3 to the Italian. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Rybakina has wrapped up the first set 6-2, while Ben Shelton is on course to take a one-set lead against Gigante, the American leads 5-2.

Tim McInnerny has emailed in:

I wish I could comment on the action but as far as I can tell live action is only available on TNT this year, which is £30.90 per month. I'm not the only tennis fan furious with the authorities who have gone for the quick buck instead of thinking of the fans. Why is no one in the media complaining?

I can't answer your question, I'm just a humble blogman, but I'm not sure this is a great media strategy for the French Open in the UK. Roland Garros is not exactly top of the public consciousness here so to only focus on the tennis fans who are willing to pay seems like a quick way to shrink your audience. If a Brit gets to the final there will be calls for someone to show it free-to-air.

Shelton has got out to a fast start against Gigante, taking a 3-1 lead. What a name Gigante is by the way. Matt

Finally Paolini gets a hold. She leads 3-2.

Still no service holds between Poalini and Starodubtseva…

Another break of serve on Philippe-Chatrier. Can Starodubtseva make it count this time?

Rybakina has an early break in her match against Ostapenko, the Kazakhstani leads 3-1 in the first.

It's not exactly packed on Philippe-Chatrier for the start of Paolini v Starodubtseva but those who are watching have seen the unseeded Ukranian get an early break. Paolini should be in good form after her exploits in Rome and quickly breaks back. We're on serve at 1-1. 

Jasmine Paolini, the fourth seed, is up next on Philippe-Chatrier. The recent Italian Open winner is taking on Yulia Starodubtseva of Ukraine. I'll mostly be keeping an eye on that but also providing updates from Elena Rybakina v Jelena Ostapenko and Ben Shelton v Matteo Gigante on Simonne Mathieu.

With matches just getting underway, let's head to my inbox as Ed Graham has emailed in:

About making women's matches best of five (13:34): I'm sure this has been debated at length and I for one would love to see it. I think the accepted reason for not doing so is to do with scheduling at the major tournaments, as sometimes they barely have enough days as it is with rain delays and so on. To extend the majors beyond two weeks would be a big headache; so maybe it'll happen once the venues have enough time, money and space to build all the extra courts they would need to get through the games in time.

They all seem to be expanding their grounds, so why not?

We have a bit of a lull in play now as Tommy Paul has beaten Karen Khachanov on Simonne Mathieu. The 12th seeded American eventually coming out on top 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9), 3-6, 6-3.

At one stage the Frenchman looked on course for victory but after more than three hours in the searing heat on Philippe-Chatrier Rune rattled through the fifth set to complete a comeback from two sets to one down.

Swiatek speaks!

“I'm happy that I was solid in the last game and not giving her free points. She used her chances and went for it every time I gave them to her. It was a great match, super entertaining, we both played nice. I'm happy with the performance,” says Swiatek in her on-court interview.

“I don't mind the heat and on clay it gives the balls the extra bounce. It's all about control and I kind of had to balance it today. It's tricky when it's like that on just one day like that, the first match I played was 20 degrees, even less, and now its 30. It's not easy to adjust because the balls fly differently in the air. I am used to playing in any conditions, maybe not here as Roland Garros is usually rainy but last year for the Olympics it was super hot so I was ready for it.

“If you want to swing the same way in different in different conditions you must change something and it's not good to change the way you play, so adjust the equipment for sure and go up with the tension on the racket.”

At 30-15 down Swiatek finds a dart of backhand into the corner and when Cristian sends a forehand long down the line the reigning champions gets a match point. Cristian goes aggressive and gets a reward but there was a hairy moment when she was forced to pluck an overhead out of the sun. Swiatek wants to wrap this up without a tie-break and the two trade blows as the game ticks over five minutes. Swiatek reads a Cristian second serve to earn another match point with a backhand taken on the rise. Cristian dumps a backhand into the net and gives Swiatek a hard-fought win.

In the time this set has taken, Rune has forced fifth set on Philippe-Chatrier. The Dane won the fourth 7-5.

A graphic has just flashed up showing Swiatek's first-serve percentage is down to just 50% in this set. It's not the only reason she has struggled but it has allowed Cristian to go after the second serve a lot more. Again, it's not fluent but Swiatek finds the hold and guarantees this set will go to a tie-break and gives her a shot on Cristian serve to close the match out. Swiatek 6-2, 6-5 Cristian.

Needing to hold to stay in the match Cristian finds some big first serves to make light work of reaching 40-15 but then a double-fault gifts Swiatek the momentum to get back to deuce. Another big first serve forces a Swiatek mistake and then Cristian bangs down an ace, it's 5-5 in the second!

It has taken another tie-break but Popyrin, the 25th seed, has beaten Borges 6-4, 7-6 (13), 7-5 (7).

After that wobble Swiatek looks dialled in now. Her body language is more positive as she sails through her service game with a love hold. Swiatek 6-2, 5-4 Cristian.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Iga Swiatek breaks down how she remained ""solid"" during her third-round victory against Jaqueline Cristian at the French Open. (0:21)

PARIS -- Defending women's champion Iga Swiatek joined No.1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round of the French Open on Friday and neither player has dropped a set so far.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam winner who has only once reached the semifinals at the French Open, beat Olga Danilovic 6-2, 6-3 on Court Philippe Chatrier, where Friday's hot weather contrasted with previous days.

""The ball flies much faster,"" Sabalenka said. ""The bounces are much higher.""

Swiatek, who has won four of her five major titles at Roland Garros, defeated Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5 on Court Suzanne Lenglen to extend her French Open winning streak to 23 matches. But a second set lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes tested the 23-year-old Polish player, who yelled in relief after winning on her second match point.

""She used her chances and just went for it,"" said Swiatek, who enjoyed temperatures which reached 29 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit). ""For sure I don't mind. On clay it gives the balls the extra bounce.""

Sabalenka and Swiatek, who had 20 winners and 21 unforced errors in her win, have been in contrasting form.

The 27-year-old Sabalenka has reached six singles finals this year, the most for a woman entering Roland Garros since Serena Williams in 2013.

But Swiatek is looking to reach her first final anywhere since winning her third straight French Open title, and fourth overall, here last year.

Swiatek is looking to become the first woman to win here four successive times in the Open era. Her first title came in 2020. Her other major was in 2022 at the US Open.

Asked who was under the most pressure to win this year's French Open -- her or Swiatek -- Sabalenka said, jokingly: ""Let's just leave it on Iga since she won it, what, three times in a row?""

Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain was in action later Friday. The No.2-ranked Alcaraz faced Damir Dzumhur, who hurt his left knee during a fall in his second-round win.

What else happened at the French Open on Friday? In other women's play, Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen beat 18-year-old qualifier Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4, while No. 16 Amanda Anisimova and Liudmila Samsonova also advanced.

In remaining third-round women's play, former US Open champion Coco Gauff faces Marie Bouzkova on Court Philippe Chatrier, and No. 3 Jessica Pegula, the runner-up at last year's US Open, plays former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier on the same court. There is an all-American contest on Court Suzanne Lenglen between current Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, who won that major in 2020, the year she went on to lose in the French Open final to Swiatek.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Amélie Mauresmo, the former world No. 1 who is the tournament director for the French Open, has rejected suggestions that the lack of women's matches in the Roland Garros night session tells WTA Tour players that they are not worthy of the event's primetime slot.

In a confrontational news conference, Mauresmo insisted that scheduling four women's matches out of 44 on Court Philippe-Chatrier since 2021 was not a judgment about the value and quality of women's tennis.

“It has never been that the girls are not worthy to play at night,” Mauresmo said. “It's never been this, and I will not accept that you carry this message.”

Mauresmo said that the French territory television contract with Amazon Prime stipulates there being only one match in the night session. She then repeated another message of the past few years: that the potential length of the match is what matters. A three-set match could be over in two; a five-set match guarantees at least three.

“It's the length of the matches, not the level they reach,” Mauresmo said.

Earlier in the week, French Tennis Federation (FFT) president Gilles Moretton said that scheduling decisions are based on “what is better for spectators.”

Mauresmo said no female player has raised the issue directly with her, but her comments followed Coco Gauff, the world No. 2, and Ons Jabeur, the three-time Grand Slam finalist, discussing the importance of giving women the chance to showcase their talents in front of the widest possible audience.

“It's still sad that we are still seeing this,” Jabeur said in a news conference. “I keep standing by my words. In Europe, in general, it's unfortunate for women's sports. Not for tennis but for in general. I hope whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this.”

“I do think that women's matches are worthy of a night spot,” said Gauff, who often plays at night at the U.S. Open in front of some 24,000 people at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

She said French Open organizers could solve the problem by starting earlier and having two matches at night rather than one, as both the U.S. and Australian Opens do, as well as other top mixed tournaments.

“From my experience playing at US Open, night match at 7 p.m. with Novak (Djokovic) following me, and he's the greatest player of all time, people were almost just as excited to see me play as him,” Gauff said.

Jabeur also noted the circularity and the self-fulfilling outcome of having limited women's matches in the best slots.

“They don't show women's sport, they don't show women's tennis. Of course they watch men more because you show men more. Everything goes together. It's a shame from the Federation, a shame from the Prime,” she said.

She noted how Naomi Osaka and Paula Badosa had played an epic three-set match that lasted nearly two and half hours in the first round, a duel between two high-profile players that could have carried a night session. Osaka played a similar match in the second round last year against Iga Świątek. Both matches took place in the day session, but Osaka's encounter with the four-time champion went on so long that it was getting dark when they were done.

“A lot of great matches, they should have been there,” Jabeur said.

Mauresmo told reporters to “ask her on Sunday” about the topic, and a French reporter suggested putting the all-French encounter between wild cards Lois Boisson and Elsa Jacquemot in the slot Saturday, during the Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter.

She said that the night sessions are sold out to Chatrier's capacity of 15,000, with the seats filled from early in the first set. She suggested that would not be the case if the session started earlier with a women's match, partly because of French work schedules. That is rarely an issue in Melbourne and New York, with spectators who have paid serious money for prime tickets not wanting to miss out.

Ken Solomon, the former chief executive of the Tennis Channel, which used to be the U.S. broadcaster of the tournament, said he had raised the issue during his tenure. In part, that was to see if high-profile Americans like Gauff might play at night because it is the afternoon in the U.S., even if that meant scheduling two women's matches for the night session. Solomon said that there was no interest in doing that from either the WTA Tour or the tournament.

Like every other broadcaster, TNT, the current U.S. broadcaster makes suggestions and expresses preferences but ultimately the French Tennis Federation (FFT) makes the final call. The last time women played at night on Philippe-Chatrier was in 2023, when current world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka played Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals.

Asked whether she personally had an issue with the decision to schedule exclusively men at night since then, Mauresmo declined to answer.

“I would like to change the subject,” she said.

Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 28, 2025 Britain's Emma Raducanu during her second round match against Poland's Iga Swiatek REUTERS/Denis Balibouse

Emma Raducanu, the rising tennis star, is gearing up for the thrilling 2025 grass-court season after concluding her clay-court swing. The 22-year-old sensation is set to compete in at least three significant events on the grass, marking an exciting chapter in her promising career.

Having recently wrapped up her campaign on clay with a notable appearance at the French Open, Raducanu is now shifting her focus to the lush green courts. Despite facing a tough defeat against defending champion Iga Swiatek at Roland Garros, Raducanu remains determined and motivated for the challenges that lie ahead.

The British No 2 showcased her potential on clay by reaching the fourth round of the Italian Open and making significant strides in the WTA Rankings, climbing to World No. 37. With a renewed sense of momentum since the Miami Open, Raducanu is eager to continue her upward trajectory on the grass courts.

Looking back at her 2024 grass-court performances, Raducanu displayed her talent at the Nottingham Open and the Eastbourne International, securing notable victories and accumulating valuable points ahead of Wimbledon. This year, she is set to take on two new warm-up events in preparation for the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.

Raducanu will make her debut at the Queen's Club Championships, where she has received a wildcard entry into the competitive WTA 500 field. Additionally, she will participate in the German Open in Berlin, facing tough competition from top players like Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, and Naomi Osaka.

As Raducanu aims for another deep run at Wimbledon, her current ranking of World No. 37 puts her on the verge of being seeded for the Grand Slam event. With 206 points to defend before Wimbledon, the young star is set to compete in higher-ranked WTA 500 tournaments this year, offering a greater opportunity to earn crucial ranking points.

Excitement is building as Raducanu prepares to showcase her skills on the grass courts and pursue further success in the upcoming events. Tennis fans around the world will be eagerly following her journey as she continues to make her mark on the sport.

 WARNING: This article contains spoilers from Antiques Roadshow. 

An Antiques Roadshow guest proudly shared his grandfather's historic achievements with his Wimbledon collection worth thousands.

Crowds gathered during another filming segment of the BBC daytime series with expert Jon Baddley meeting with a guest and his array of impressive items from a former Wimbledon champion.

Referring to the man in a framed photograph as Norman Brooks, “the father of Australian tennis”, the expert questioned how he knew him.

The guest explained: “He's my grandfather. In his tennis career, he won many, many events but he won Wimbledon in 1907, being the first foreigner to win Wimbledon which was considered a mammoth effort because the British weren't going to let it go easily.”

This wasn't the only time Brooks had won the international competition either as Brooks took the trophy home for a second time in 1914.

He continued: “We believe this trophy and the 1914 are the only full size replicas in existence.

“Other than that, everyone else has only got miniatures.”

“I think that was borne out due to the fact they never expected to lose in 1907, so they just made another one, as it were.

“Then from there to 1914, there was no one outside Britain that won it.

“Even Tony Wilding, who was a New Zealander, he lived in Britain, right? So he got a miniature.

“But grandfather got, we believe, the only two full sized replicas and even when we inquired at Wimbledon, they didn't even know.”

Baddley chipped in: “Which makes it exceptional, because I have to say, when I initially saw it, I just thought ‘Well somebody's stolen it, [and] bought it over here. But exceptionally rare. Yes.”

He then asked if his grandfather won the 1907 doubles as well, to which the guest replied: “Yes, he won the doubles in 1907 which was the maiden year as they say, from the point of view that he was the first man to win it but he won the singles and the doubles, which was quite staggering really.”

Baddley then began to appraise the fascination collection, elaborating: “Purely in financial terms, I would have thought the doubles jug is going to be worth, to a collector, let's put it that way, well in excess of $20,000 or £8,000.”

Turning his attention to a beaten up racket, the expert asked if this was the one he used during one of the championships but the guest candidly admitted that he wasn't sure.

“But certainly used by him, it's probably $5,000 or £2,000,"" Baddley said.

It was then time to value the main item on the table, the iconic Wimbledon trophy replica.

Baddley said: “But what's this worth? I mean, only one other replica known, which you also own, and obviously the original is at Wimbledon, but a massively important trophy to tennis enthusiasts.

“It's difficult to come up with a price but I think at auction, you're talking about a figure well in excess of $75,000 or £30,000. So a fantastic piece.”

The guest doesn't react to the astonishing figures, instead stating: “I believe grandfather believed these belong to Australia, not an individual.”

Baddley suggests a sporting museum which the guest said he would like to do.

But in an unexpected moment, the expert shared that he too has a connection to the trophy.

He shared: “I also have a personal interest in this, because, I don't know if you have noticed but, if I can pick it up here, on the side there is 1893. W Bradley, Wilfrey Bradley.

“Well my name's John Badley. And he's a distant relation of mine.”

With a smile, the guest remarked: “How wonderful.”

Baddley then cheekily stated: “So I hope you don't mind if I give it a quick kiss”, as he kissed the trophy with the guest laughing.

The expert then triumphantly lifted the trophy over his head in true Wimbledon fashion as he said: “And then I do the classic”, with onlookers applauding him.

“That's wonderful Jon”, the guest smiled before Baddley quipped: “I'll take it with me now”, pretending to run off with the iconic trophy, much to everyone's amusement.

 Antiques Roadshow is available to watch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

...

PARIS — The New York Mets are hiring the person who oversees the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Lew Sherr, as their new president of business operations.

Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.

“For right now, my focus is the smoothest possible transition,” Sherr said in an interview with The Associated Press at the French Open. “But I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they're trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.”

Steve Cohen is among the bidders for three casino licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission and has been lobbying to have the state legislature reclassify the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field — also near the facility that hosts the U.S. Open — from parkland to commercial land for a gaming facility.

The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations; he was in that post since December 2023. Chief legal officer Katie Pothier, chief marketing officer Andy Goldberg, chief communications officer Nancy Elder and senior vice president of finance Peter Woll have left since November.

The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer.

In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in U.S. Open attendance, sponsorships, and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights.

“We've taken some big swings,” Sherr said, “and thankfully, they're paying off.”

He spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's U.S. Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin.

“It's bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things — and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,” Sherr said. “I'm leaving sleeping well at night, knowing (the USTA) is going to be well looked-after.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Lew Sherr, the chief executive of the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA), is stepping down at the end of June to join the New York Mets as president of business operations.

Sherr, a veteran of sports business in New York who previously held senior positions at Madison Square Garden, recently unveiled an $800 million redesign of Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open. The plans include additional hospitality space and a new player performance center.

Sherr won't be going far: his new employers play at Citi Field in Flushing, across the 7 train's tracks from the Billie Jean King Tennis Center.

He has also spearheaded an effort to revamp the elite player development program for U.S. players, after former leading figures in that program criticized cutbacks by the USTA following the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a recent interview, Sherr said the goal is to centralize the program, including the people who organize tournaments and those in charge of running national and regional camps for children.

During past two years, Sherr has also been part of efforts by the four biggest tournaments in tennis, the Grand Slams, to restructure the sport. That plan was dubbed the premium tour and would slim the tennis calendar to a schedule based around the majors and the next tier of events, the 1,000s (so named for the ranking points their winners get).

Those efforts have put him at odds with the leaders of the men's and women's tennis tours, the ATP and the WTA. The majors gained momentum early last year, but have since been stymied by the same inertia that has stalled previous efforts to streamline the sport.

Sherr took over the USTA in August of 2022 and had to carry out significant cuts after the organization went through the effects of staging the 2020 U.S. Open without spectators. The USTA has since recovered: attendance at the U.S. Open surpassed more than 1 million fans last year for the first time. Revenues from the tournament surpassed $500 million — revenues which the top players want to be shared more generously with them than they are currently.

“This is truly a bittersweet moment. Over the past 15 years, the USTA has been so much more than just a workplace — it has been a community, a purpose, and a passion,” Sherr said in a statement.

“While I will no longer be leading from within, I will always be cheering on the USTA and the work ahead. I'm immensely proud of what we've accomplished together, and even more excited to see where our talented team takes it next.”

After Sherr departs, USTA board chairman Brian Vahaly and chief operating officer Andrea Hirsch will serve as co-chief executives, while the organization conducts a search for its next leader.

Sherr replaces Scott Havens, who had been president of business operations at the Mets since 2023, and joins the team as they occupy second place in the National League East. Since purchasing the team in 2020, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen has become one of the highest-spending owners in baseball. In December, the Mets signed outfielder Juan Soto to a 15-year, $765 million contract, the largest in professional sports history.

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

 For the fourth French Open in a row, tournament director Amélie Mauresmo was asked about a lack of women's matches during the tournament's night sessions — there was one in 2022, one in 2023, zero in 2024 and, as of Friday, zero in 2025.

And for the fourth French Open in a row, Mauresmo dismissed the issue, saying at a news conference Friday, when she also was pressed about placing women's matches in the noon slot at Court Philippe-Chatrier, when attendance tends to be sparse: ""The funny thing is that it's the same questions, year after year.""

At the other Grand Slam tennis tournaments that sell separate tickets for night sessions, the U.S. Open and Australian Open, the main stadiums tend to feature two singles matches for that part of the daily schedule, one involving women and one involving men. Wimbledon has an 11 p.m. cutoff for competition and doesn't sells tickets for a night session.

Roland-Garros added night sessions starting three years ago and the French federation has a contract with a streaming service for viewers in the home country that calls for one daily match in European primetime for the first 1 1/2 weeks of the event. 

Only two of the 36 contests at night in that stretch were women's matches. 

Mauresmo, a former player who was ranked No. 1 and won two Grand Slam titles, took over as tournament director ahead of the 2022 tournament. She repeatedly has offered similar explanations for why the night match has almost always been a men's match, including that their best-of-five-set format is likely to offer more time on court for ticket-buyers than the best-of-three setup for women.

In recent years, some female players have argued that's a mistake and hurts the growth of their sport, although Mauresmo said Friday that no current or former athletes have complained to her about it or offered their thoughts.

Ons Jabeur, a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, was asked about the topic this week and called the current setup “a shame.”

“It's still sad that we are still seeing this,"" Jabeur said. “In Europe, in general, it's unfortunate for women's sports. ... Not for tennis, but in general. ... Whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this.”

“It's a bit ironic,"" Jabeur added. ""They don't show women's sport, they don't show women's tennis, and then they (say), ‘Mostly, (fans) watch men.' Of course they watch men more, because you show men more.”

Iga Swiatek, the three-time defending champion in Paris, said it doesn't bother her.

“Every year, we talk about it. My position didn't change: I like playing days, so I'm happy that I'm done and I can have a longer rest,” she said.

Mauresmo said that having just one night match hasn't changed, “So for me, the message is not changing, and has never been that the girls are not worthy to play at night.”

When a reporter tried to return to matters such as night matches and scheduling women first in Chatrier, asking Mauresmo how big a deal she considers those matters, she replied: “You know what? I would like to change the subject.”

You'd be forgiven for not being familiar with Victoria Mboko around the time of Australian Open 2025.

While the world's best players competed in Melbourne for the year's first Grand Slam event, the Canadian teenager was ranked 337th and playing at an ITF event in Guadeloupe, a French territory in the Caribbean.

Now, she's into the third round at Roland Garros, owns a provisional ranking of world No.89, and will face Chinese superstar Zheng Qinwen – no doubt on a court where more people can catch a glimpse of her obvious talent.

“I feel really happy right now, and yeah, of course there is so much happening even, like, behind the scenes. I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me really, like, I guess, isolated from it all,” said Mboko, who is in Paris with her father and elder sister and brother.

“I have just been enjoying the moment. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.

EXPERT PICKS: Who will win Roland Garros in 2025?

“Honestly, I would have never expected that [top 100 debut] at all. It's really exciting, but I didn't know at all, to be honest, until I think my parents told me.

“That's a really great accomplishment. I mean, who wouldn't want to be top 100? You're amongst one of the top, best in the world. You're playing Grand Slams all the time.”

It's been an extraordinary rise for Mboko, the daughter of Congolese parents and the youngest of four tennis-playing siblings.

She won her first four ITF tournaments of the season without dropping a set, building streaks of 20 consecutive match wins and 40 consecutive sets won. In early March she won a fifth ITF title in Porto, Portugal.

She earned a wildcard into the Miami Open – just the second WTA main draw of her career – where she upset Camila Osorio for her first tour-level victory.

Representing Canada in the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers, she went undefeated in singles play, and later qualified for the WTA 1000 tournament in Rome, where she pushed Coco Gauff to three sets in the second round.



“Victoria played great tennis. She forced me to play like that. So full credit to her,” Gauff said after her entertaining 3-6 6-2 6-1 win.

“First I saw her [was at the] Miami Open. I didn't know much about her before, but I've been following her since Miami. I think she's a great player. I knew it was going to be a tough match. Like the ranking difference looks different, but she's playing top-level tennis.

“She obviously has a great game… For sure on the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that.”

High praise indeed, from the world No.2 and one of the game's great athletes.

There were more great results to come for the 18-year-old, who beat three straight top-100 opponents to reach the WTA 125K final in Parma, Italy.

It meant she arrived in Paris with a 7-3 record on clay and carrying momentum into the qualifying event, where she won three matches in straight sets to make her Grand Slam main-draw debut.

Two more straight sets wins – over last year's Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun, and Eva Lys, an exciting fourth-round finisher at AO 2025 – have propelled her into the third round, where Zheng awaits.

The eighth seed's previous trip to Roland Garros saw her winning gold for China in the women's singles at the Paris Olympics.

Zheng represents an almighty mountain for the Canadian to climb, but Mboko has now won 40 of her 45 matches this year and is determined to treat the experience as just another one of those matches.

“I was struggling with a lot of injuries last year. I didn't really have a consistent tournament plan and training schedule. To be playing a lot of matches this year, to be doing what I've been doing so far, it's something that I would have never thought I would have done last year,” she said.

“Even to be here and playing even the quallies, I was so excited to be in a Grand Slam for the first ever time.

“I remember coming here as a junior, watching the older girls play. It was such a great experience. I'm happy I experienced it in the juniors so that it kind of prepared me for the professional level.

“Now I'm here, I feel like I can do something with it and make the most of it.”

Daria Kasatkina says she's not feeling pressure playing in her first grand slam as an Australian, after a 6-4, 6-2 victory over French wildcard Leolia Jeanjean.

The No.17 seed was in control of the entire match against Jeanjean, with Kasatkina recording 24 winners in her one-hour, 39-minute win.

The 28-year-old made the final four at Roland-Garros in 2022 and is now through to the third round for the seventh time in her career.

This isn't a headline. It's a message. From Ons Jabeur, to the women who've carried the game with strength, grace and far too little recognition: Keep going. We see you.

A former World No. 2 and three-time Grand Slam finalist, Ons Jabeur owns five WTA titles and stands as one of the most influential and thoughtful players of her era -- unafraid to speak up, lead with empathy and use her platform with purpose.

A lot of amazing athletes have been told the same things over and over. That no one watches. That no one cares. That women's sport doesn't 'move people.'

Judgment comes quickly, often from those who've never even watched a full match. 

One empty stadium is held up as proof. The packed ones? Conveniently ignored.

A missed shot becomes a headline. The hundreds of brilliant ones? Forgotten.

Still, they show up. Still, they compete. Still, they carry a sport forward on their shoulders.

When a woman wins 6–0, 6–0, it's called boring. Too easy. When a man does it? That's 'dominance.' 'Strength.' 'Unstoppable.'

When women play with power, they're told they 'play like men.' As if strength, speed or aggression don't belong in a woman's game.

If they celebrate, they're dramatic. If they don't, they're cold. Too emotional. Too distant. Too loud. Too quiet. Too much. Never just right.

And yet the game keeps rising.

Coco Gauff leads with fearless belief. Aryna Sabalenka strikes with unmatched power. Iga Swiątek dominates with calm and precision. Jessica Pegula brings relentless consistency. Paula Badosa fights through every storm. Mirra Andreeva breaks through, young and fearless. Jasmine Paolini lights up the court with fire and courage.

Elena Rybakina is composed and lethal. Naomi Osaka opened up about the battles off the court and kept showing up. Venus and Serena Williams broke barriers and then broke records.

The game is full of stories. Of greatness. Of fight. Of grace under pressure. And still many choose not to look. Not to listen. Not to care.

But belief is not a requirement. Permission is not necessary. Respect may be delayed, but progress isn't waiting.

So when the headlines say 'no one watches,' remember: Full stands were just never part of their narrative.

When the narrative says 'too easy,' look closer: It took years to win that fast. 

And when someone says women don't play with power, watch again and be honest this time. 

The game is not asking to be seen. It's already shining.

No one's denying the greatness in men's tennis. The fierce battles, the legacies, the magic under pressure.

But honoring one side of the sport shouldn't mean ignoring the other.

The women's game has been writing its own legacy loudly, brilliantly and for far too long without full recognition.

 With respect,

A player who chose this racket out of passion and honors every woman fighting for her place on the court

Thursday at Roland Garros saw more than a few folks pay tribute to Richard Gasquet after the 38-year-old Frenchman played the last match of his professional tennis career against world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, falling in straight sets on Court Philippe-Chatrier in the second round.One of them? Rafael Nadal. Gasquet and Nadal famously were childhood rivals, first playing in a ""high-profile"" tournament at the prestigious Les Petit As junior tournament when they were 12 in 1999. Their pro-level rivalry, though, was dominated by Nadal, who won all 18 of their ATP matches. But that didn't stop the Spaniard from giving the former world No. 7 well-deserved kudos, just days after he received his own emotional Roland Garros send-off.Read more: Arthur Fils has his Warrior Moment; Au revoir, Richard Gasquet | Roland Garros Wrap, Day 5""Since we were kids we have shared so many moments together on and off the court.

Gasquet agreed with Nadal's assessment, saying that ending his career against the world's best player on Paris' center stage was ""the perfect end"" for him. He played his home major 22 times since debuting in 2022, and scored the 609th, and last, match win of his career against fellow Frenchman Terence Atmane in the first round.""I couldn't dream more to play on this court, Chatrier, against the No. 1 in the world [for his last match],"" he said. ""Of course, I would like to win, but it's not easy to win for me now against Sinner.

Yeah, it's perfect for me.""

Earlier this week, Coco Gauff stepped out on court outfitted in an edgy leather jacket, promising to bring a dose of fashion flair to a part of the match that usually goes overlooked.It echoed some iconic tennis fashion moments of the past: Serena Williams unveiling a Virgil Abloh-designed gown at 2019 Roland Garros; Roger Federer sporting a monogrammed blazer at Wimbledon in 2006; and Naomi Osaka channeling a ‘magical girl transformation' at last year's US Open.Now, Zheng Qinwen is poised to join tennis's fashion-forward ranks—if she can push past a bit of stage fright.

The 2024 Australian Open runner-up made a stylish impression this week in Paris, chatting with Prakash Amitraj at the Tennis Channel desk in a striking all-crimson look, complete with custom “Queenwen” Beats by Dre headphones and Rolex Datejust watch.“I would say Nike did a really great job!” Zheng told Amitraj with a grin. “I explained to them the color that I liked, so they designed this outfit for me with a long skirt.”The entire outfit felt like a modern chapaeu to the original tennis style icon, Suzanne Lenglen. The legendary French champion revolutionized on-court fashion with her signature calf-length pleated skirts and headbands—a look immortalized in the statue outside of the Roland-Garros stadium that bears her name.

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive the action from FP2 in Barcelona as Piastri heads the timesheets

FIA Team Principals press conference – Spain

F2: Lindblad in scintillating form as he takes maiden pole in Barcelona

FP2: Piastri tops the timesheets ahead of Russell and Verstappen during second practice in Spain

F3: Camara dominates to take fourth pole of 2025 in Barcelona

Lando Norris topped the timesheets during Friday's opening practice session ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix, the McLaren driver extending his run at the top following his victory last weekend in Monaco to head the pack from Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.

A new name was the first to hit the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya when FP1 got underway in warm and sunny conditions at 1330 local time, as F2 driver Victor Martins made his Formula 1 weekend debut by heading out at the wheel of Alex Albon's Williams.

PADDOCK INSIDER: Norris' Monaco win breathed new life into the title fight – can he back that up in Spain?

On a weekend in which a new Technical Directive has been introduced regarding front wing load tests, it proved to be a busy start to the session as most of the field hit the track within the first few minutes. The majority had bolted on the hard C1 tyres, Pirelli having brought the three hardest compounds in their range this weekend.

There was an early off for Ryo Hirakawa, the Haas reserve making a trip through the gravel during his second FP1 outing since joining the squad from Alpine in April. Elsewhere Liam Lawson voiced his unhappiness after encountering a slow-moving Charles Leclerc, prompting the Racing Bulls driver to ask: “What was that?”

Practice 1 results

Norris set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, the Briton recording a time of 1m 15.259s to go 0.221s clear of home favourite Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin, a man whose last F1 victory came at this circuit in 2013.

Data gathering continued as the hour progressed, with plenty of laps going on the board across the field, while some drivers opted to switch tyres as they worked through their programmes. Mercedes' George Russell was one of the first to swap to the medium C2 rubber before surging to the top of the timesheets on a 1m 14.751s at the halfway mark of the session.

Nico Hulkenberg, meanwhile, became the first to run the soft C3 compound, with others soon following the Kick Sauber driver's lead. One of these was Verstappen, who promptly went fastest only to be displaced by Norris moments later, the papaya car beating the Red Bull by three-tenths via an effort of 1m 13.718s.

There were some eye-catching additions to the top 10 during the final third of the hour, including the Racing Bulls of Lawson and Isack Hadjar – both of whom scored points last time out in Monaco – and the Haas of Ollie Bearman, the rookie in contrast searching for his first points since Bahrain this weekend.

Martins made his FP1 debut at the wheel of Albon's Williams in Barcelona

While Alonso voiced some concerns about “something wrong” on his AMR25 – the Spaniard asking the team to “check what is going on with the car” – it was Norris who remained on top as the chequered flag fell, the Briton heading Verstappen and the Ferrari of Hamilton thanks to his aforementioned 1m 13.718s lap.

Leclerc put the other Scuderia car in fourth, ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri in fifth on a weekend where he will be looking to strengthen his lead at the top of the Drivers' Championship. Lawson and Hadjar took sixth and eighth respectively, with Bearman sandwiched between them, while Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and the Alpine of Pierre Gasly rounded out the top 10.

Russell was P11 from Aston Martin's Lance Stroll (P12), Alonso (P13), Hulkenberg (P14) and Williams' Carlos Sainz (P15). Gabriel Bortoleto set the 16th quickest time for Kick Sauber, ahead of Hirakawa in 17th, Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli down in 18th, Martins in 19th on his FP1 debut and Alpine's Franco Colapinto in 20th place.

The drivers and teams will now reconvene in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

Lando Norris breathed new life into the Drivers' Championship fight with a crushing victory in the Monaco Grand Prix that sees him arrive in Barcelona just three points adrift of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri. But it's no wonder he's not getting carried away after a complicated start to his 2025 campaign.

The Briton, oozing confidence in his ability after a strong end to the 2024 season that yielded an outstanding win in the season-closer in Abu Dhabi, which confirmed McLaren's first Teams' Championship for more than two decades, kicked off his year in style with a triumph in a soaking Australian Grand Prix as Piastri made a small error that cost him second place.

THR's second annual edition features the top producers, actors, musicians and execs that keep Canadian culture crackling.



		By Etan Vlessing, Karen Bliss 

	May 29, 2025	




	As Donald Trump lobs 51st-state taunts and slaps tariffs on Canadian goods, the country's top women in entertainment are responding the way any self-respecting hockey fan might — with elbows up. In time for THR's second annual Women in Entertainment Canada summit, we present a new Power List spotlighting 45 trailblazers who are fighting back, breaking through and building the future of film, TV and music north of the border. From the force behind The Weeknd's career to the activist-musician halting gravel mines, this year's honorees are anything but polite when it comes to getting things done. On May 29 in Toronto, they'll be celebrated at WIE Canada's gala event, where The Handmaid's Tale novelist Margaret Atwood will be the recipient of THR's ICON Award. It's all in support of a powerful mission — equity, opportunity and louder mics for everyone.


Promoted to the top job in February, Adam calls it “a total pinch-me moment.” The longtime radio and media executive joined Universal Music Canada in 2023 and quickly made her mark, boosting ecommerce and direct-to-consumer revenue while pushing innovative strategies to elevate artists. Her advice to her younger self — and to her kids: “Stay true to your values, don't put up with bullies … and don't let people talk you out of your hopes and dreams. In short: Bet on yourself.”


The Toronto-based Ali has steered Spin VFX for more than three decades, growing it into a global force with offices in Los Angeles and Atlanta and such credits as The Umbrella Academy and School Spirits. Her proudest moment in 2024? Rehiring laid-off staff after an industry-wide slowdown — a first in the company's history. “That's when I started to feel like a decent human being again,” she explains. A champion for tech-powered storytelling, Ali warns that AI and virtual tools must serve artistry — not sideline it: “The soul of our creation lies in how we bring compelling stories to life.”


No longer Canada's best-kept rock secret, this Juno-winning Toronto quartet is hitting new heights. Together since they were teenagers in 2013, sisters Jordan and Kylie Miller (lead vocals/bass and guitar), Eliza Enman-McDaniel (drums) and Leandra Earl (keyboards/guitar) sold out their hometown's 16,000-seat Budweiser Stage last summer, then hit another milestone with a 2025 Coachella set. “Something we've always dreamed of and we're so happy to check off our bucket list,” says Enman-McDaniel. Her advice to her younger self? “We faced a lot of bullying because we were girls in a band, but we persevered — we all had this common vision and goal.”


Canada's queen of R&B took control of her career this past year, self-funding her first national headlining tour in 17 years. “I got myself back onstage and proved that Black music not only deserves a place but belongs on every stage in this country,” says Black, whose powerhouse vocals and unapologetic presence continue to break ground. The tour, she says, helped dismantle the myth that age limits ambition: “I'm not ‘aged out' — I'm just getting started.” Her mantra to her younger self? “Silence the inner negotiator … feelings aren't facts.”


As head of the country's largest performing rights organization, Brown has kept SOCAN steady through a shifting music economy. “We've prioritized transparency, strengthened our services and amplified our advocacy efforts,” she says. Her suggestion to women climbing the music business ladder? Get loud, get seen: “Your accomplishments can only open doors if the right people are aware of them.” 


Burke made waves this year by extending a partnership with Punjabi-Canadian phenom Karan Aujla, a joint venture between WMC and Warner Music India. “It highlights the power of cross-cultural collaboration and our commitment to amplifying his voice on the world stage,” she says. Burke also champions women across the business, not just with slogans but in real rooms where real decisions are made. “I try to mentor, advocate and create space for new leadership, creativity and perspectives.”


As executive producer of Mary Kills People and Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent, Cameron knows how to shape a hit. The warm audience embrace of L&O Toronto was her highest high this year. “We could have messed up the tone, but we didn't,” she says. A self-confessed “edit nerd,” she loves watching pacing, structure and surprise come together onscreen. Her top recommendation to newcomers: “Don't wait until your career is ‘established' to also build a personal life. Chase joy — it'll keep you sane.”


At the helm of content strategy for Paramount's Canadian streamers, Case knows how to chase bold bets — from American Gladiators to the just-announced Canada Shore — a reality show in the style of aughts U.S. hit Jersey Shore — which is still casting but already sparked a flood of local support. “It was a significant highlight,” she says. A former exec at Vice and Blue Ant, Case believes the industry's biggest challenge is a slow response to change. “We need to adapt faster to both tech and politics,” she notes. Her mantra for newcomers? “Lean in, trust your instincts and take risks.”


Few have shaped Canadian TV as deeply as Creighton. As CMF head, she's funded international hits from Rookie Blue to Orphan Black. Her proudest recent moment came at the Banff World Media Festival when she announced the CMF's Indigenous Program would be fully administered by the Indigenous Screen Office — and was honored with a Siksika Nation blanket ceremony. “It moved me beyond words,” she says. Creighton sees storytelling as an act of sovereignty: “Canadians are drawing a line in the sand. This ‘elbows up' moment comes from pride — and necessity.”


The artist manager helped steer Blue Rodeo's 40th anniversary celebrations this year, culminating in a CBC documentary and commemorative postage stamp. “The true joy came in sharing it with fans,” she says. She brought the country-rock legends to theaters, broadcast and digital screens nationwide. Her advice to her younger self — and, by extension, everyone else: “Don't be afraid of anything. It's all going to happen anyway, and rarely where or when you expect it.”


Academy Award-nominated for Nightmare Alley, Deverell just wrapped a massive two-year journey designing Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. “It was one of the most challenging productions I've been a part of,” she says, recalling the final champagne toast on the lawn at Wilton House in the U.K. Her philosophy? Resist the erosion of creative freedom in an AI-driven era. “We need raw, honest films that speak openly about the human condition,” she says. For newcomers, her advice is clear: “Come at it honestly as a storyteller — no matter what role you play.”


Di Mondo launched her career knee-deep in film history, interning at MGM and sorting through archives containing vintage press kits for classics like Dr. No — complete with scribbled napkin notes from decades past. Now she's leading Fremantle's charge in Canada, overseeing such hits as Canada's Got Talent, Family Feud Canada and Little Bird. Her recommendation to the next generation? “Never underestimate good preparation. Whether it's a boardroom or a dinner, respect your time and everyone else's.”


Twenty-five years ago, “I'm Like a Bird” catapulted her to global fame. Today, Furtado is back in flight. After stepping away from the spotlight to focus on family — and self-releasing a 2017 album — she reemerged following a surprise 2022 duet with Drake at his All Canadian North Stars concert. The response was enough to lure her back into the studio, where she penned more than 400 songs across four years before dropping her seventh album, 7, in September. Now 46, she's touring again and defiantly embracing authenticity, telling fans, “We are all cute little humans just bouncing around the Earth looking for hugs.”


At the helm of British Columbia's creative industries, Gill advocates for local talent, greener sets and more inclusive hiring. A standout career moment came early on when she produced a documentary series about Sikh women in British Columbia — a personal milestone. This year, she cheered as locally filmed shows like Shogun earned tons of awards. Her goal? Making sure B.C. isn't just a destination for Hollywood crews but a source of storytelling itself. “We've worked hard to be seen as more than just a service hub,” she says.


With breakout roles in Orphan Black and Ginny & Georgia, González is now making her mark stateside with her first U.S. series regular role in Kevin Williamson's The Waterfront. “As a Canadian artist, I always dreamt of using my work visa — this project was perfectly aligned,” she says. Filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, the show matched her ambitions and her values. Her suggestion to women: “Don't shrink your voice. Back stories you believe in and create your own work.”


Hamilton has guided such Canadian TV hits as Cardinal, Mary Kills People and Burden of Truth, but her proudest moments happen off set. “When cast and crew tell us it was one of their best experiences — that's what sticks,” she says. Starting in animation at Nelvana, she's now at the top of Lionsgate's Canadian television division. Her best advice for young women entering the business: “Stay true to who you are. Don't let the industry box you in.”


	As head of Ontario's biggest film and TV union, Harding has weathered downturns and led major labor negotiations. Her proudest moment this year? Watching her team and membership excel despite tough times. “Their performance was extraordinary,” she says. Harding began her career working on an unfinished feature — a fitting entry into a business built on uncertainty. Her advice: “Build relationships and follow the Golden Rule. You never know who might help you down the line.”




This year's Juno Humanitarian Award honoree, Harmer has long balanced music with activism. In 2010, she helped block a major quarry project threatening Ontario's Mount Nemo Conservation Area. Today, she co-chairs the Reform Gravel Mining Coalition, mobilizing citizens to protect the province from what she calls “risky and unnecessary” mining expansion. But her most meaningful role lately? Caregiver. “I'm most grateful that I could work a lot less over the past year and be there for my parents as they navigate their 90s,” she says. Her business philosophy is simple: “Hiring [women] — techs, management, musicians, accounting, finance …”


After a decades-long career across MTV, Fremantle, MGM and Nickelodeon, Hummel now leads Lionsgate's Canadian distribution efforts, where she recently oversaw the integration of eOne into the studio's local business. Her proudest achievement? “Successfully rebranding the business to Lionsgate Canada,” she says. A believer in career flexibility, she advises women starting out to stay adaptable: “Be open to every turn of your career — there's a growth opportunity around each corner.”


Known for Reservation Dogs and Marvel's Echo, Jacobs has become one of Canada's most prominent Indigenous performers. She's also a producer, proudly buying a ticket to her own debut feature, Backspot, this year: “Just the act of walking in and buying a seat to my own movie felt like a tick off my bucket list.” She sees burnout — for creators and audiences alike — as the industry's biggest threat: “We've got to lean on each other. A rising tide raises all boats.”


	The Iran-born, Canada-raised founder of Reservoir Media made headlines this past year by signing Snoop Dogg, k.d. lang and The Lion King composer Lebo M — a trifecta that reinforced her company's status as the largest publicly traded indie music firm. “It speaks to the caliber of talent we attract and the strength of our creative and value enhancement teams,” she says. Her recommendation to young women? “Be the most prepared person in the room. Preparedness arms you with the confidence to show your expertise — no matter the audience.”


Leaders of one of the country's only Indigenous- and women-owned record labels, Kish and Rheaume are also acclaimed artists in their own right — Kish is one half of the Juno-winning duo Digging Roots, and Rheaume just dropped her latest solo album, The Truth We Hold. This past year, Ishkodé signed four new acts, including rising voices Siibii and Logan Staats and Native American icon Keith Secola, “an honor,” she says of the man who wrote the 1992 anthem “NDN Kars.” Rheaume picked up two community-nominated awards — the Spirit of Folk and King Charles III Coronation Medal — and the duo is hosting their biggest International Indigenous Music Summit yet in Toronto in June. Says Rheaume: “At Ishkodé Records, 90 percent of our team are women! Our team of aunties brings so much care and love to all our work.”


	Klebuc oversees hit Canadian shows Shoresy, Transplant and Children Ruin Everything. But she never forgets her start — as an underpaid, overwhelmed PA. “I was a terrible PA,” she says with a laugh. “Completely broke. So I pivoted to law school.” She believes the industry contraction may be a catalyst for change. “It could lead to growth in Canada if we build smart global partnerships,” she says. Her advice for women entering the business: “Take more risks. Develop your entrepreneurial side. Ditch the imposter syndrome.”


After 20 years at Bell Media, Kowalski leads the international content strategy for Pluto TV at Paramount. Her biggest realization this year? “I was so busy hiking up the hill, I hadn't stopped to enjoy the view,” she says, reflecting on a year of collaboration and team growth. In a crowded free ad-supported streaming world, she believes excellence still cuts through. Her suggestion to young women: “Know the value you bring, and be yourself.”


Lee helped secure $23 million in federal funding for TIFF's upcoming content market, but her roots are in indie film. As a producer at the National Film Board, she worked on landmark documentaries like Stories We Tell. “The biggest challenge is also our biggest opportunity: change,” she says. “It disrupts, but it opens doors to new voices, formats and audiences.” Her guiding philosophy? “Sometimes you need a seat at the table — and sometimes you need to make your own table.”


At the helm of Canada's leading indie distributor, May helped bring Anora, The Brutalist and Conclave to Canadian audiences — all three went on to score best picture nominations at the 2025 Oscars. “Having a hand in distributing three films recognized at that level? That was a career high,” she says. A former Lionsgate exec, May has long championed theatrical windows, specialty collector editions and now AVOD. Her recommendation to women in the business? “Learn financial literacy — whatever your role. Understanding the numbers opens doors.”


At the helm of Thunderbird since 2018, McCarron oversees a diverse portfolio of kids and factual content, from Molly of Denali to Highway Thru Hell. She's most proud of the company's culture. “We create an environment where nobody feels like a number,” McCarron explains. “When people feel safe, they do their best work.” Her recommendation for women entering the field? “A great attitude will open more doors than anything,” she says. “And you get out of something what you put into it.”


Fresh off a Juno Awards sweep — with four wins, including best album and best artist — the Calgary-born pop phenom hit a new high this year when So Close to What debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Her emotionally raw lyrics and moody dance-floor anthems have struck a deep chord with Gen Z. They've also made her a top “sync” prospect — industry speak for artists whose songs are prime for soundtracking TV shows, movies and commercials. For music supervisors looking to score a scene with heartbreak, swagger or both, McRae's catalog is fast becoming a go-to.


For more than three decades, Mirsky has helped Canadian filmmakers get their stories made — launching the Rogers Documentary Fund in 1996 and, more recently, the Rogers Series Fund. Her mission: Ensure Canadian content stands out globally. “We must continue to set ourselves apart through quality documentaries and scripted content,” she says. “Be confident in every room,” she adds of her piece of advice to young women. “Push your projects. Don't take no for an answer.”


	Myers is building movements not moments. She led the deployment of the first-of-its-kind study on the value of Black music in Canada — a benchmark that's now influencing research globally. Her leadership at ADVANCE continues to push for systems-level change. “Know your worth — and don't shrink it for anyone,” she tells young women. “Walk into every room like you belong, because you do.”




As ACTRA's leader, Noble represents more than 30,000 Canadian performers. Her proudest moment this year? Negotiating a landmark film and television agreement. “It was historic,” she says. Her first gig came just before graduation — a lead role on Are You Afraid of the Dark? Her message to newcomers: “Focus on what you're passionate about and surround yourself with people who treat you with dignity and respect.”


A stalwart of Canada's indie scene, Piovesan has backed acclaimed films like The Whistleblower and Infinity Pool. In 2016, Elevation Pictures, a distributor, launched a Canadian film and TV production arm and tapped Piovesan to run it, looking to shoot in Canada and tap tax credits, local talent and currency savings. This year, she's proudest of building out Elevation's production team. “Seeing folks step up and make things happen for filmmakers — that's been incredibly rewarding,” she says. She credits her early boss, agent Ann Blanchard, for teaching her what advocacy looks like: “She reminded me I could do anything I set my mind to.” When asked to share words of wisdom, she says: “Ask where the industry's going, not just where it's been.”


Rathwell capped off a decade-long triumph in July with the final show of Billy Joel's record-shattering Madison Square Garden residency — 150 performances over 10 years — which she calls “the honor and privilege of a lifetime.” By fall, she was back at it with another icon: Stevie Wonder. “He is so loving and talented,” she says. “It was a truly magical and uplifting experience.” A veteran mentor within AEG, Rathwell runs what colleagues affectionately call “Debra's Finishing School,” guiding the next generation of talent buyers with her signature mix of know-how and generosity.


Roy began in the editing suite at the National Film Board, where she once crossed paths with a young Denis Villeneuve. Now leading Telefilm, she recently launched a bold three-year plan to elevate Canadian cinema on the global stage. “It affirms the power of our stories and our place in the world,” she says. Her suggestion for newcomers: “Immerse yourself in the community. Be bold. Trust and mentorship are everything.”


When Shinkoda landed her first industry job at PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, she had no business wardrobe and no idea how to work a fax machine. “I was fresh out of film school,” she recalls. “Totally clueless.” These days, she co-runs Sony Pictures' Canadian operation, overseeing distribution across film, TV and library content. Her advice for the next generation? “Be curious. Ask questions beyond your job. And find mentors — no one's going to hand them to you.”


From a temp job cleaning up a client's database to running strategy for the CMPA, Shorten has spent her career strengthening Canada's indie production sector. This year, she helped secure an increase to British Columbia's film tax incentive. “Canadians have rediscovered their love for this country,” she says. “Telling our stories is foundational to our identity.” She urges young women to seek mentorship early — and pay it forward later.


Simard's film career began rolling posters for TIFF. Now, she leads workforce programs that place diverse trainees on shows like Frankenstein and Law & Order Toronto. “We have the infrastructure, the talent and the pride,” she says. “Excellence is rewarded — and we're just getting started.” Her recommendation? “Understand the full industry landscape. Get out of your niche and learn the 360-degree view.”


Symsyk, who oversees the nonprofit that administers millions in funding to Canadian artists and music companies, has had a Goliath-tackling year, including taking Scotiabank to court over a one-time cybertheft of nearly $10 million (CAD). “Given the facts revealed to date, it's incredulous FACTOR doesn't have the stolen funds back yet,” she says. “It was amazing to see so many female owners in the entertainment sector show up at the court hearing to support us. What the bank has tried to do is unforgivable, and women took particular notice first. Thanks to the men who also had our back.” She adds, “It's critical to support the culture you love, and sometimes that includes standing up to liars, bullies and thieves, which has never been more important.”


After years climbing the ranks at Ticketmaster Global, Tarlton returned to her roots in 2024, stepping into a new role at Live Nation Concerts Canada — the same industry she first entered at age 15 as a summer receptionist for a concert promoter. She helped usher in Canada's first Economic Impact Assessment of the live music industry, quantifying what fans and promoters have long known: Concerts matter. Her recommendation for women climbing the ladder? “Relentlessly build and broaden your connections. … See your network as your evolving personal board of directors.”


Once Toronto's first film commissioner, Thorne-Stone now heads the province's lead media agency, investing in everything from feature films to XR content. Her proudest moment? Launching Ontario's new IP Development Fund after two years of strategic planning. “It's designed to support innovation, scale and global competitiveness,” she says. Her advice: “Be clear about your goals. Say yes to opportunities that challenge you — even if they feel out of your league.”


Newly appointed CEO of Salxco — the powerhouse management company behind The Weeknd, Metro Boomin and Brandy — Unwin is entering 2025 with what she calls “a defining moment” in her career. The Los Angeles-based Canadian is channeling her hard-won influence into building a more inclusive music industry. “Whether it's hiring, mentoring or giving women a seat at the table where decisions are made, I've made it a priority to build a culture that empowers and reflects the next generation of leadership,” she says. Her suggestion: “Learn the business. Knowing the numbers, contracts and strategy is what turns talent into leadership.”


Watson oversees Rogers' sprawling TV and sports empire, including Sportsnet and Citytv. This year, she helped land a 12-year NHL rights renewal and inked a landmark content deal with Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal. Starting as a local station receptionist, Watson climbed the ranks by speaking up. “I've been in the TV business for more than 30 years, and my advice for young women is to be confident that your voice matters and don't be shy to speak up.” 


Williams helped transform the CBC from a local broadcaster into a global exporter of Canadian hits. Her first job? Tape librarian at CFMT. This year, she helmed CBC's ambitious coverage of the Paris Olympics. Asked for advice, she doesn't sugarcoat: “Be brave. It won't be easy.” But the payoff, she insists, is helping reshape the narrative of what Canadian television can be.


Woodbury helped steer Wayward with Mae Martin and a buzzy Montreal Expos baseball doc, but her proudest moment this year happened offscreen: watching her son learn to swim. “It reminded me how important patience and persistence are,” she says. A former indie producer turned Netflix exec, she urges young women to “figure out where to add value — and stay anchored in what matters.”


As co-lead of Netflix Canada, Woodrow helped launch the sitcom North of North, a collaboration with CBC and APTN she calls “full of beautiful, messy, hilarious heart.” She began as a paid intern at Fox Searchlight and now helps drive Netflix's Canadian slate. Her advice? “Follow your curiosity — and consume everything. Every show, every film, every story helps you build the instincts you'll need.” 


	With The Handmaid's Tale still echoing on Hulu, her Booker Prize-winning sequel The Testaments headed for television and a memoir (K of Lives) due in November, Margaret Atwood, 85, is proving that cultural relevance can thrive at any age. Canada's reigning literary powerhouse will be honored with the ICON Award at The Hollywood Reporter's second annual Women in Entertainment Canada summit, taking place May 29 at the Ritz-Carlton Toronto.


	Also being celebrated: Indigenous activist and actress Tantoo Cardinal (Dances With Wolves, Killers of the Flower Moon), recipient of the Equity in Entertainment Award; longtime TV host and fashion authority Jeanne Beker, taking home the Impact Award; The Sex Lives of College Girls breakout Amrit Kaur, honored with the Breakthrough Award; and Christina Jennings, CEO of Shaftesbury, who's getting the Glass Ceiling Award. Her long-running procedural Murdoch Mysteries is now in season 18 — and distributed in more than 120 countries, which makes it one of Canada's most far-traveling exports not named Ryan Reynolds.


	The WIE Canada event — an offshoot of THR's long-running Power 100 breakfast in L.A. — launched last year to wide acclaim, drawing top names from across film, TV and music, including Kim Cattrall, Devery Jacobs, Lilly Singh and Nia Vardalos. This year's edition promises more star wattage, more serious industry shop talk … and, yes, more red cloaks.

His plea related to five charges came during his Friday appearance at London's Southwark Crown Court.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Russell Brand appeared at a London court Friday after being charged with rape, and indecent and sexual assault, pleading not guilty to all five charges.


	The disgraced comedian's first hearing had taken place earlier this month after it was confirmed that the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service had authorized the Metropolitan Police to charge a man, identified as 49-year-old Brand, following an investigation by detectives.




	Brand had been charged with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape and two counts of sexual assault. The BBC reported that he pleaded not guilty to all five charges during his Friday appearance at London's Southwark Crown Court.

	Brand now faces a trial that is scheduled to start June 3, 2026.


	The crimes he has been charged with relate to a 1999 rape in the Bournemouth area of the U.K.; a 2001 indecent assault of a woman in Westminster, London; the 2004 oral rape and sexual assault of a woman also in Westminster; and between 2004 and 2005, the sexual assault of another woman in Westminster.


	When the formal charges were released, Brand, who has turned to Christianity and been baptized since widespread allegations came to light, responded to the charges in a video shared on his social media, stating: “I've never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.”


	Detectives began investigating in September 2023 after receiving a number of allegations, which followed reporting by Channel 4's Dispatches and The Sunday Times. The program aired extensive allegations against Brand. One of the women told Dispatches that Brand entered a relationship with her when he was 31 and she was 16. Their relationship lasted three months, she had said, and Brand had been “emotionally abusive and controlling.” Another claimed that Brand raped her in 2012 in his L.A. home, according to the Sunday Times.

	











	The British celebrity denied all claims made against him, which date between 2006 and 2013, when Brand was at the height of his fame working on Big Brother's Big Mouth, Kings of Comedy and Big Brother's Celebrity Hijack. A Banijay U.K.-commissioned investigation later found informal complaints concerning Brand were made over 20 years ago on set, and another review into Brand's behavior at the BBC, in particular between 2006 and 2008 when he worked for 6 Music and Radio 2, found that fellow employees believed he “would always get his way, and therefore stayed silent.”

Michael Patrick King, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and more of the cast discuss how the 'Sex and the City' sequel series, which returned after two years away, writes new chapters for the 27-year-old franchise.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains spoilers from the And Just Like That season three premiere.]


	After blowing up their central couple, And Just Like That has returned with a new chapter in its love story for Carrie and Aidan.




	The sequel series had renewed the romance between Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her Sex and the City ex, but ended with the couple parting ways in the season two finale. Aidan (John Corbett) asked Carrie to wait five years so he could focus on being the primary parent to his youngest child. “We haven't seen each other in 10 years and it went by like that (snaps his fingers),” Aidan told Carrie. When he repeated his five-year ask, he didn't snap. “I already did and you didn't see it; that's how quick it was.”

	Aidan was sure that the soulmates could make it work. Was it fair what he was asking of Carrie? Will Carrie wait? Those are some of the questions the third season sets out to answer. In the premiere that released Thursday night, Carrie and Aidan are settling into their long distance romance, which includes writing postcards to one another and dabbling in phone sex (with Carrie faking an orgasm). The episode also solidifies Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Seema (Sarita Choudhury) as single and dating — with Miranda dating a nun played by Rosie O'Donnell in a cameo — and catching up with the families of Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and LTW (Nicole Ari Parker), while Carrie begins writing a fiction novel.


The Hollywood Reporter spoke with creator Michael Patrick King along with stars SJP, Nixon, Davis, Ari Parker and Choudhury in separate conversations that are edited below about what's in store for this 12-episode third season of summer (and sex) in the city, including the “maze” of continuing to evolve Carrie Bradshaw in the 27 years since we first met her.

	











	***


Season three in a long-running series can be a time when a show comes into its own. Having been through this before [for some of you] with Sex and the City, did it feel that way again?


MICHAEL PATRICK KING Every series grows. I remember on the first couple years of Sex and the City, we were like, “I think this is it?” It's always good, but you're a little unsure. Now with And Just Like That, we're running full speed. The characters are grounded. They've gone through trauma and come out the other side. It's gone from darkness into sunshine. It feels like summer in the city — exciting and confident, but also fun and a little bit risky. This season has an emotional, complex landscape for more than one character. I like the fact that characters you've known for many, many years are still evolving and have opportunities to change and grow. And I have actors who are phenomenal, so there's no reason not to show many sides. It's a nice balance of fun and fragileness. 


CYNTHIA NIXON Even with a show using characters already established, so much of that first season is eaten up by exposition and explaining who people are and who they are to each other. There was so much tragedy and pain, and then there was so much joy and sex in the second season. We have now a wonderful swirl of both the light and the dark. We start out in a more comedic, joyous place, but there are rivers of painful things that happen and I think they happen in a wonderfully unexpected way. 

	











KRISTIN DAVIS I certainly think with Sex and the City, the third season was when everything flowed. When I look at And Just Like That now, I do feel that we are more grounded and have created something different from the old show. We're settled in more. This season is also more expansive. It has highs and lows, but also a joyful feeling, which reminds me of things about the old show but in a different way.


NICOLE ARI PARKER I feel like Lisa just started taking off. I mean, she has a kitchen! That was a creative choice behind the scenes to add that to their home. Before, her house was just a hallway, bedroom and a closet. Now with a kitchen, there's more family story. I have a big emotional journey this season, and am also thrown off guard. I feel like I'm fleshing her out. First season I was nervous. I was questioned [by press] about everything that I wasn't in, like, Aidan and Mr. Big [storylines]. I'm like, “Did you see the dress they put me in? I couldn't walk in those shoes!” (Laughs) Second season, I knew who LTW was and third season, I feel like I'm just getting started.


SARITA CHOUDHURY We shot the first two seasons in cold weather, so this was the first season we weren't hiding undergarments or putting on a fur coat the minute we finished a scene. That was heaven, to do a scene and then linger and hang out with Sarah Jessica. The scripts then echoed that because we were outdoors more eating and talking. I love New York City in the heat. Makeup looks great when it starts to sweat, and I just felt the city and I felt Seema [more] this season.

	











Michael Patrick, can you elaborate on this season being more “fragile”?


KING Life is fragile. At any moment, something can happen. That's part of life, and there are a lot of fragile emotions. What Carrie and Aidan are going through can be very complicated, and the fun of writing their story was the maze of that and trying to figure out whose side the audience would be on at every given moment. Are they now understanding his point of view? Are they understanding her point of view? Here we are, 27 years into the evolution of Carrie Bradshaw, and seeing her grow and change in front of us is thrilling. Very rarely do you get to see an actor play a character for this long. As long as there is a story to tell, because life is unexpected and complicated and challenging, it's fun to be able to show it in a fictional world. Realistically, it could be tougher, but fragility and fiction is fun.


SARAH JESSICA PARKER It's pretty singular [to play a character for so long and discover new parts to her]. It's a little bit like living two lives in some ways, because [playing Carie has] been such a significant amount of time and it's occupied so much of the important years of my life. Carrie is a very interesting person to play because she can be unpredictable and she can be sentimental in ways and romantic in ways that are perhaps not to her benefit or to somebody else's. There's a whimsy to her life, but there's also a pursuit of seriousness and substance, and it's always interesting and exciting so it's been pretty extraordinary. We only want to do this if there are stories to tell that Michael feels excited about, and he feels are really compelling to write and for an audience. Thus far, I think he's been right.

	











You changed Carrie and Aidan's status to long-distance at the end of last season and that continues through the screeners I've seen so far. What was the biggest challenge to keep them as the central romance but physically have them be in different places? 


KING When it comes to Carrie and Aidan and the continuation of that very complicated cliffhanger when he said, “I've got to go take care of my family. I'll see you in five years.” It's like: “What?!” So [we had to figure out] how to do that without doing a very bad version that starts five years later. The trick was to keep them distant and yet connected, and find ways to not make the audience wait to see their chemistry, because the John Corbett and Sarah Jessica Parker chemistry is undeniable and a gift. It really was a bit of a “push me, pull you” in the writing room: “Get him there, get him away. Get her there, get her away.” But keeping this alive together and apart was the fun of the challenge. A lot of people do long-distance relationships. A lot of people have children and are in their second marriages. A lot of people have feelings about what they're owed in a relationship. That's all very fertile for writing.


SJP I always trust Michael's instincts — even if they leave me bereft and even if I am sad to lose the opportunity to work with an actor that I love. These are the sacrifices! I had a feeling, or I just gleamed from what he shared [after season two] that there would be attempts at maintaining this sabbatical between Carrie and Aidan in person. (Laughs) I knew that it would never be as simple to honor as both parties thought it would be. So I was glad because Corbett's such a wonderful actor to play opposite. He's so good and so easy and so comfortable. He cares so much and he works so hard, and it matters a great deal to him. He's just super easy when that camera turns on.

	











You continue to follow the cast into their bedrooms this season — Carrie has a vulnerable, intimate moment in the premiere when having phone sex with Aidan; Miranda is also dating and Seema is now as well. How did everyone approach intimacy and exploring sex and relationships for women at these ages this season?


SJP I have no recollection. They take me into a little room when we finish each episode, and they wipe my memory. (Laughs) I haven't seen [the episode]. But I haven't seen most of the shows ever, even the original.


CHOUDHURY MPK totally involved me this season with a lot of those scenes. And they're tricky to do, especially with a comedy, because it's half real. Like, “Okay, you might actually be in love with this one. It's not just a one night stand.” But also, “It would be great if your leg could be [above your head], and then it would be very funny if you arched in this way.” So there's funny and then there's real, but in a bed. And the guest star, the one-night stand, it's the first time they're visiting the set. They're new-ish and you're trying to also show them that you want to do some real acting. So we need a lot of help to be directed in those. I love getting all the help I can, because there's nothing natural about it. The natural comes when it's organized. This season I had the most fun finding the natural charisma of it.


NIXON [There isn't anything I say no to]. I feel like it's my job, so I do it. But God, help me [there is a Miranda nude scene later in the season not involving sex] that was the worst, absolutely the worst. When I read it in the script, I thought we were going to be in darkness and see a flash of it. But then of course, when I got to set, it was fully lit. I understand it's comedic, so I purposely picked the ugliest possible socks that I could find. Any comic mileage will make me feel like it was worth it!

	











CHOUDHURY Everything feels off limits when you're doing a love scene. You start off with a t-shirt, and they're like, “Could it be a bustier?” You're negotiating the whole time. No woman wants to do anything. And we're all shy, no matter if we're playing the most bodacious characters. But MPK is unbelievably charismatic and funny, so you're very aware this is also comedy. You can lean in a bit more than you would in a drama. You're constantly trying to figure out how to not show too much and be slightly modest, because I have family [watching]!


KING When we all got together at the start of the writers room, we realized we had the potential for single people in the show again. What's fun about that is single people in their 50s and, what is dating then? Quite frankly, it's the same as dating in your 30s — except maybe you can pick up the check. We got very excited about the idea of putting both Miranda, who has never been a very smooth dater, and Seema, who has very high ideals in terms of romance and is looking for the one, out there [in the dating world]. That was a comic gold mine for us, as well as putting Carrie in a non-couple couple and then challenging even further the married couple of LTW and Herbert [played by Chris Jackson] by putting a handsome man across from her at work.


	That all became very zesty and fun, and we knew that was a good field for comedy, but also you're never more vulnerable than when you're dating. We wanted to run with that because part of the fun of Sex and the City was showing the rigorous decathlon of trying to find someone. And here we had another opportunity to say, “Yep, life goes on.” There are so many women in their ‘50s who are a singled for many reasons: They never found the person they wanted to marry, or they've been divorced and are looking again, or they just don't want to be with someone. It's reflecting parts of the audience. And then with the married people, we wanted to reflect parts of what marriage is as well.

	











Rosie O'Donnell has a guest role in the first episode. (Guest stars this season also include Patti LuPone, Jenifer Lewis, Susie Essman, Cheri OTeri, Mehcad Brooks, Logan Marshall-Green, Jonathan Cake, Ryan Serhant and more in a variety of roles.) I understand you've been trying to write something every season for Rosie and this season it worked. Did having more characters single or single-ish let you bring more guest stars into the world?


KING Yes. Rosie's very special. If you get Rosie, you're guaranteed energy that people think is special and comic, and what she got to do on our show is show a little bit more of how wonderful an actor she is, because she comes in and plays it with heart and soul, which makes it even funnier. We used to call them “one offs” on Sex and the City: Just bring them in, have a date and out. It's a perfect example to find a bunch of little, beautiful cameos for people. But Rosie was very special and it's a great way for us to start the season because it shows a comic dating story, but also involves Carrie and the idea of Miranda dating a tourist and what happens when you actually put yourself out there, and it also has a sweetness under it, which is really everything we ever wanted to do. Comedy and sometimes sweet.


NIXON We knew Miranda was going to meet Joy [the character played by Dolly Wells] later in the season, but we also thought, why not have some real fun, lesbian dating nightmares as we did a little bit last season? But do more this season.

	











ARI PARKER MPK puts women in the writers room of all ages, all races, all identities and it really shows. They nailed the specifics of like, how do you meet someone at a bar and then end up at their apartment… and these people take a cab or a subway… and then the shoe that gets left behind? It's such a clear, tight ship in the writers room that I think the efficiency has always been there.


On Kristin's podcast Are You a Charlotte?, SJP and Kristin recently spoke about this alternate universe theory — that the Sex and the City and And Just Like That characters are part of a story Carrie has been telling and aren't real. This season, you do have Carrie venturing into fiction writing… can you weigh in on that theory?


DAVIS I hadn't heard Sarah Jessica talk about that since the end of Sex and the City. I was kind of miffed at the time because I thought, “Well, gosh, we're not real? Why have we been working so hard if we're not real?” You work so hard to make a character real and grounded, all of Charlotte's inner life. We work long hours and my feet are killing me, we weren't real this whole time! (Laughs) I thought it would have been a cop out type of a plot to have that at the end of a show, right? That was how I felt the first time she brought it up. But when she brought it up this time [on my podcast], the way she talked about it seemed sweeter, that Carrie would have dreamt us up like imaginary friends. I hadn't really thought about it from that perspective and I could see what she was saying, how it would really be touching if somehow Carrie had the need inside of her to dream up these friends of hers who wanted to be her soulmates. It's interesting to think about — but I really do think we're real!

	











KING You mean the whole multiverse of Sex and the City and Sarah Jessica's version of Carrie that it's all in her head? Well, that's an interesting theory. For us, Carrie's very much alive, which is why we're creating it — and that's the truth. And the reason Carrie's writing a fiction novel set in the past this season is because she's afraid to talk about her feelings in the present because they're so fragile, again, and confusing and private. So in order for her to be able to do that thing that writers do, which is explore ideas without feeling guilty, she put the character in the past and didn't even name her Carrie, which what she's done in all her other writing. She calls her “the woman.” So the character that she's writing, The Woman, is definitely characters that Carrie created. All the other characters moving around her in the show are very alive to us in the writing room as real people.


Three seasons in, does this feel like the middle of how long you want to go with And Just Like That?


SJP Michael and I haven't chatted yet, so I don't know. I'm always really proud of everybody. I'm always inspired by our crew, the primary 210 people that I work with all the time. I feel inspired by their efforts and the ways in which they show up every day, not just the fact that they are there and present and drive in from great distances often, many of them. But it's the spirit with which they show up and are so freaking good at what they do. So when I wrap a season, especially this one in particular, it felt like poetry. We've been together now three years and everybody's hugely important. I think we all were very happy this season, very much in love with each other, cast and crew, and so inspired, yes, but also just the deepest kind of admiration and affection.

	











NIXON Luckily, it's not up to me. But it's funny, when people ask us how long the original show was on, and we say six years, everybody's always really startled. Of course there were the movies, but six seasons was a lot. It had such an impact. 


DAVIS The fact that we're still together, that we're able to be together and continue to make the show that we want to make after all these years — and that we've been able to keep our fanbase and then do the films, which we never expected to really get done, much less to be a hit — and then to get to come back with a new show that's different, but the same characters? It's all crazy to me. 


	[When this role came to me], I needed to be Charlotte, and I needed to know Charlotte would continue. There was some question in the beginning [of Sex and the City] over whether they felt like they needed her to be a series regular or recurring. I was just trying to bide my time and wait until they realized how much they needed me, which they did — thank goodness! I never thought that it would be what it is, no one ever could have dreamt that up. I felt like we would be lucky if we had a little cult, niche following, like Larry Sanders, which was our only predecessor at HBO. I hoped for a small group of loyal fans so we could continue to do the show. 


	We just thank the fans for hanging in there with us and for however long that everyone feels creatively that And Just Like That is alive, which I feel right now it really, really is, [we will keep going]. I would want to do it for as long as everyone feels committed and that it's a vibrant collection of lives. Really, I never want to stop working with Michael Patrick King.

	











KING I'm actually in season 27 [years since the show launched in 1998], because I've been writing this since the beginning of Sex and the City. Every season I tie everything up with a nice bow, and then if occasions happen, we untie the bow and there they all are again. So it's all tied up, we'll see what happens.

And Just Like That season three releases new episodes Thursdays at 9 p.m. on HBO Max.

The singer added that she would also like to get an ""OG Scream Queen like Sissy Spacek"" in the movie.

Charli XCX has an idea for the next Final Destination film.


	The Grammy-winning singer recently took to TikTok to express her love for the supernatural horror-thriller franchise, which just released its latest installment, Final Destination Bloodlines, as well as pitch her own version starring “It Girls.”




	“I'm rewatching all of the Final Destination movies, in preparation to see Final Destination Bloodlines, which I'm really excited to see,” she said in the video. “The reason I love these movies is that they really just are about hot people getting killed. You know, there's no moral backbone to the story, it really is just, ‘they're hot, they're cursed and they deserve to die.'”

	Charli even has an idea for the perfect cast and director. “I was thinking, well, shouldn't there be a sort of It Girl version of this franchise,” the “Apple” singer continued. “You know like, a Final Destination with It Girls. Kind of like, Rachel Sennott, Alex Consani, Gabbriette, Romy Mars, Me, Quenlin Blackwell, Devon Lee Carlson…maybe there's like a Scream Queen in there, like, Jenna (Ortega). Maybe there's an OG Scream Queen like Sissy Spacek. And then it's also directed by, like, a horror auteur.”


	There have been six films released in the Final Destination franchise — including Bloodlines, which was released May 16 — since the first film debuted in 2000. The latest pic also ended up being one of the most successful in the series, with a franchise-best domestic box office opening of $51.7 million, ahead of expectations.


	“The films wouldn't have to change their formula, I think the whole point is that they play into the lore. They kind of make fun of their own lore, and I don't think this one would have to be any different, like I think that's the point,” Charli added of her idea. “It's really not trying to do anything other than have hot people die in the most brutal ways and play with some unbelievable dialogue.”

	











	While no official movie is in the works at the moment, Sennott already seemed down for the role, writing in the video's comments, “Ok I'm in….”

Swift, in a surprise move, has reclaimed her master recordings years after they were initially sold, first to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings, then to Shamrock Capital.


													By
												

	Marc Schneider


Industry News Editor


Taylor Swift announced on Friday (May 30) she has regained ownership of her master recordings from Shamrock Capital, the private equity firm that purchased them from Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in late 2020. According to sources, Shamrock sold Swift's catalog back to her for an amount relatively close to what they paid for it — which sources tell Billboard was around $360 million.


	In a message on her website, Swift says: “All the times I was this close, reaching out for it, only for it to fall through. I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that's all in the past now… I really get to say these words: All of the music I've ever made… now belongs to me. All of my music videos. All the concert films. The album art and photography. The unreleased songs. The memories. The magic. The madness. Every single era. My entire life's work.”


	In her announcement, Swift expressed gratitude and praised Shamrock for how they handled the deal, noting they understood the deeply personal meaning behind the transaction. “My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams,” she writes. “I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The saga of Swift's masters goes back to June 2019, when Ithaca purchased Big Machine Label Group, which owned the master recordings to Swift's first six albums, for an estimated $300 million. Swift's catalog was worth at least half of that amount, according to estimates at the time. Over the years, Swift has very publicly declared her displeasure with the shuffling around of her masters and, in 2019, began re-recording those Big Machine albums in order to restore control over her songs from a commercial standpoint.


	Her re-recording journey began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) in April 2021, followed by Red (Taylor's Version) in November 2021. In 2023, she released Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), each topping the Billboard 200 chart. Fans are still anticipating the re-recording of her self-titled debut and her final Big Machine LP, Reputation. Since leaving Big Machine in November 2018, she's released five additional albums on Republic Records: Lover (2019), Folkore (2020), Evermore (2020), Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She also embarked upon and completed her career-defining Eras Tour, which rewrote the rules of what a concert tour could be, and massively boosted streams and sales of her entire catalog, including the re-recordings.


	Swift was not involved in Shamrock's 2020 purchase of her music. “This was the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,” she said at the time.


	Shamrock's 2020 statement about acquiring Swift's catalog from Ithaca emphasized their admiration for her artistry and the value of her music. They described Swift as a “transcendent artist” with a “timeless catalog” and said their investment was driven by belief in the long-term potential of her work. While they had hoped to partner with her directly, they acknowledged and respected her decision not to be involved. Shamrock expressed appreciation for Swift's professionalism and conveyed interest in collaborating with her in the future. 


	Although terms of the deal were not disclosed, given that sources close to the negotiations say Swift paid a price close to the $360-million price tag Shamrock paid back in 2021, that would imply Shamrock did not make much, if any, profit off the sale of the assets. However, the financial firm with ties to Disney still made a profit of around $100 million in total over the three plus years it owned the records. The six albums and two live albums that Swift recorded when she was signed to Big Machine generated roughly $60 million a year on average globally from 2022 to 2024, according to Billboard's estimates based on Luminate data. Distribution, marketing and royalty payments to Swift likely consumed about 50% of that revenue, leaving Shamrock with an annual profit of around $30 million a year.


	In 2023, Billboard reported that the re-recordings of Swift's albums Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) were vastly out-streaming their originals since the new versions were released, with the new Fearless earning three times the equivalent album units as the original, and the new Red as much as 10 times the original. 


	As of May 22 according to Luminate, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) has racked up 2.3 million equivalent album units to the original's 8.6 million U.S. units, despite the latter having a more than 12 year head start; Red (Taylor's Version) has accumulated 5.18 million equivalent album units to the original's 9.16 million U.S. units, despite the latter having been released nearly 10 years prior to the re-recording; Fearless (Taylor's Version) has accrued 3.0 million equivalent album units to the original's 11.7 million U.S. units, the latter having had a 13-year head start; and 1989 (Taylor's Version) has earned 4.87 million equivalent album units to the original's 14.6 million, with a nine year gap in release dates.


	Overall, Swift's catalog has racked up 116.77 million equivalent album units in the United States over the years, according to Luminate, stretching back to her self-titled debut album in 2006. She has sold 54 million albums in the U.S. and generated 70.746 billion streams.


Read Taylor's full message on reclaiming her masters:


Hi,


I'm trying to gather my thoughts into something coherent, but right now my mind is just a slideshow. A flashback sequence of all the times I daydreamed about, wished for, and pined away for a chance to get to tell you this news. All the times I was thiiiiiiiis close, reaching out for it, only for it to fall through. I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that's all in the past now. I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening. I really get to say these words:


All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me.


And all my music videos.All the concert films.The album art and photography.The unreleased songs.The memories. The magic. The madness.Every single era.My entire life's work.


To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it. To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version. The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music. I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.


All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy. I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.


I know, I know. What about Rep TV? Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in the first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off. There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch. I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.


I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans. Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.


Thanks to you and your goodwill, teamwork and encouragement, the best things that have ever been mine… finally actually are.


Elated and amazed,


Taylor

""All of the music I've ever made ... now belongs … to me,"" the superstar wrote in her message to fans.


Taylor Swift is finally able to say “You Belong With Me” to her master recordings now that she has reclaimed them. The pop superstar announced on Friday (May 30) that she has purchased them from Shamrock Capital, six years after Scooter Braun first acquired her catalog from Scott Borchetta.

	











	Posting photos of herself posing with the covers of her first six albums on Instagram, Swift shared the news with fans by directing them to a letter published on her website. In the lengthy message, the 14-time Grammy winner got candid about how emotional of a process this has been for her — “I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening,” she wrote — before sharing details about the purchase as well as giving updates on the last two Taylor's Version re-records, which fans have been expecting her to drop ever since she started redoing her first six albums in an effort to win back control over the music Borchetta sold in 2019: Reputation and 2006's self-titled debut.

	But more than anything, Swift emphasized just how much ownership of her entire discography means to her nearly 20 years into her career. “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” she wrote. “To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version.”

Miley Cyrus' ninth album is a visual & sonic feast that proves the pop star has made peace with the journey that got her here.

	Ranking the songs of a visual album can feel a bit like ranking scenes of a film — and yet, favorites always emerge. The scene that makes you weep, the one that motivates and inspires, or the one that reclaims power. With Something Beautiful, the ambitious and glamorous ninth album from superstar Miley Cyrus, she gives us all of that — and then some.


	Across the album's 13 tracks, including a prelude and two interludes, Cyrus manages to deliver her most raw album yet. Throughout, she openly details the mental gymnastics that accompany the end of a relationship, the push-and-pull desire to be loved, and her own capacity to give love. Everything is on the table, and the result is a clear snapshot of an artist who has put in the work — and emerged in her prime.


	She'll be the first to say that she only got to this moment thanks to a public life of highs and lows – but as this project proves, there's beauty in it all. She also only arrived at this moment thanks to knowing herself well enough to put her own wants and needs first. As she joked at a listening event for fans earlier in the week: “I love making music with everybody on this carpet – I don't do stages now,” a nod to news that she has no desire to tour again.


	It was on the same carpet, in an intimate room at Los Angeles' Chateau Marmont, that Cyrus workshopped the songs that became Something Beautiful. As she said, “Watching [the album] become this butterfly and have this metamorphosis and evolution, it's so reflective of my life and everything I'm experiencing.”


	The album will be followed with a short film of the same name. After debuting at Tribeca Film Festival, Something Beautiful will be shown as a one-night-only screening across North American theaters on June 12 and internationally on June 27.


	And while these 13 tracks as a whole are what create Something Beautiful, you can find Billboard's ranking of the songs that soundtracked Miley's own metamorphosis below.




	Without a single word, the album's second interlude seems to say, “enough of that.” Serving as the project's halfway point, it signals a shift toward what's to come: bigger beats, bigger balls and ultimately a breath of relief that marks the end of an era of significant personal growth. And really, what's more beautiful than that?


	What begins as a creeping interlude quickly spirals into what sounds like a late-night, on-foot chase scene. The fact that this 14-second instrumental bit is positioned in between “More to Lose” and “Easy Lover” is no coincidence – after singing about the end of a relationship and sharing after-the-fact reflections, that time stuck in between could be likened to a racing mind, trying to outrun one's own thoughts – and in the case of a superstar like Cyrus, the thoughts of everyone else too.


	This mostly spoken-word opening transitions from a twinkling, dazzling introduction to an aching, almost ominous entry point. Miley draws the listener in with just the right amount of intrigue, suspense and above all else, trust. “Like walking alone through a lucid dream,” she says slowly, as the production swells. “The beauty one finds alone is a prayer that wants to be shared,” she later says, underscoring the entire mission of this project. Not only is it a journey each listener should take alone – forming their own perspectives, finding their own beauty reflected within a particular scene or song – but it's a journey that Miley had to take alone to get to this point. And now, she's sharing that prayer.


	Recalling Miley's days spent working with The Flaming Lips or even the inspiration she said she took from Pink Floyd's The Wall (though mostly its film adaptation), “Pretend You're God” is a slow-burning psychedelic interrogation: “Do you still love me?” Miley begs to know. “I gotta know. Never mind, just keep it quiet if you don't…I gotta know,” she sings, waffling between wanting the truth and thinking that maybe it's better left unsaid. As the song plays on, the torment of the unknown takes its toll, and the voices in her head grow louder and cloudier. By the song's end, there's no clear answer, and maybe that's the point; “Pretend You're God” could just as well be a commentary on religion and faith, and searching for answers that can't be answered by anyone else.


	A continuation of “Every Girl,” there's a hypnotic, trancelike quality to “Reborn” – perhaps a necessity for the process of killing one's ego. Though at the same time that Miley suggests a rebirth, she requests, “give me all your love!” – placing the eternal ego battle under a spotlight. But if that's what it takes – all the love – to be reborn, here it sounds like a fair and worthy exchange. By the song's end, in one of the few instances where Miley uses the word “beautiful” outside of the title track, she cries out, “you're so beautiful” repeatedly, as if she's looking directly at her newly emerged self. As she said at a listening event for fans earlier in the week: “What's considered beautiful should be personal. It's about taking these experiences and wrapping them in beautiful ribbons and bows.”


	There's a lighter, freeing nature to “Give Me Love” – as if everything exists in perfect harmony on the other side of the rebirth Miley sings of on “Reborn.” Or, as she says here, “once you get past the gray.” At the halfway point of the song, Miley's own vocals harmonize to form what can best be described as a choir of angels, encompassing the listener in the very thing she's asking for: love. And while Miley said at her listening event earlier in the week that what is considered beautiful is personal, this closing track underscores the one thing that can be universally agreed on as such: a continuous exchange and flow of love.


	A magnetic, synth-bumping disco-pop track, “Walk of Fame” is a glorious kiss-off that soundtracks Miley metaphorically walking away from what doesn't serve her. Where's she going? Doesn't really matter; as she says, “every time I walk, it's a walk of fame.” This song – which features Brittany Howard, a guest who makes perfect sense once the funky and electric bridge hits – serves as a manifesto for moving forward. Because if it wasn't clear yet, Something Beautiful is about the journey. 


	This near-five-minute-long song is arguably the album's most bittersweet, as Miley repeatedly wonders: “Can I have you, if I never let you down?” Though as the song plays on – and especially following the album's second interlude, which does arrive as a bit of a slap to the face – it begs a different question: Who is she trying to do right by? “Surrender,” she later sings, “and I'll never let you down.” And there, it seems, she's speaking more to herself; surrender to trying to please anybody else, she's saying. And in doing so, she can never let herself down. “You're the only one, under the golden burning sun,” she sings.


	At first, following the dizzying prelude, it may seem that Miley is going to ease listeners into her world with this jazzy, soulful song. But just before the two-minute mark, that world gets rocked by a distorted, fuzzed-out crash as her vocals sound as if she's falling down a well and glitching at the same time. And it's quite possible that's how she felt while making this album, chronicling the ride that led her here. As is echoed throughout the project, there's beauty in everything – even, or perhaps especially, in moments of spiraling chaos.


	“Every Girl You've Ever Loved” could be a distant cousin of “Midnight Sky” as it delivers the same full-forced vocals from Miley. But here, the rougher rock edges have been refined into a glimmering disco track. Featuring spoken-word from none other than Naomi Campbell, her role is both observer and wingwoman, as she gasses Miley up (“She has the perfect scent. She speaks the perfect french,” she states). Throughout the track's latter half, Campbell repeats a singular instruction — “pose” — as the production swirls and builds into the perfect soundtrack for a spellbinding vogue-off.


	Falling into the category of sultry pop song, “Easy Lover” would sound right at home in a dim, hazy jazz club. Despite being separated by a brief interlude, it does feel related to “More to Lose,” only more influenced by the anger and acceptance of a relationship ending rather than the sudden sadness. As she admits on “More to Lose,” Cyrus knew her partner would do what she couldn't; and on “Easy Lover,” she doubles down, saying, “Tie me to horses and I still wouldn't leave ya.” After enough listens, the song's title takes on a double meaning: As Miley sings of someone being difficult to love, she's detailing her own capacity to love in spite of that. The question then becomes: Does she love too easily? Yet again, the album's overarching sentiment snaps into focus: Can't that be beautiful too?


	For those who have been following along, Cyrus wrote “End of the World” for her mom, Tish. It's also one of the songs that shapeshifted as she workshopped the album through private shows for friends and family at Chateau Marmont. But in its current form, “End of the World” is a soaring anthem that invites everyone to sing along on the chorus of “oh ooh, oh ooh.” For a song that asks its listener to pretend like it's not the end of the world, Cyrus succeeds in offering a distraction – and even if it only lasts about four minutes, the message is eternal.


	While Something Beautiful offers high-energy glam rock alongside sultry pop songs, “More to Lose” stands out as the sole ballad – and as anyone knows, Cyrus' ballads never miss. Much like “The Climb” or “Angels Like You,” her vocal prowess and poignant songwriting fuse for this devastating song about a relationship coming to its end. “I knew someday you'd do what I couldn't do,” she sings. Yet, it's the pre-chorus that's become the most sticky, when she declares with a touch of knowing frustration: “You're looking like a movie star in a worn-out coat, so I throw away my pride. It happens all the time.” There's a laughable relatability to the line, in which a superstar in her own right can be just as easily swayed as anyone else – proving the power, and cost, of love. But even still, to her entire point, how beautiful to have loved and lost at all.

	A documentary about pop superstar LISA is currently in production. 


	The film was announced Thursday (May 29) during a Los Angeles event previewing forthcoming projects by Sony Music Vision.


	Created in partnership with LLOUD CO./RCA Records and Tremolo Productions, the film will follow a year in the life of LISA, as she takes time away from BLACKPINK to pursue her own solo career. 


	The doc is being directed by Sue Kim, whose recent work includes A24's award-winning documentary The Last of the Sea Women and the Netflix documentary short The Speed Cubers, which was nominated for Critics Choice and Peabody awards and was shortlisted for an Academy Award. Kim was also an executive producer on the docuseries K-Pop Idols.


	“Following LISA on this transformative and thrilling year has been a true honor and a cinematic gift,” Kim says in a statement. “There have been so many moments on her journey that I think will surprise people and give a glimpse into her world that no one's ever seen before. I'm excited for viewers to watch the film and witness this extraordinary moment in her life.”  

	











	“This has been such an incredible year, and I'm so lucky to have the opportunity to capture these special moments on film and share the experience with my fans,” LISA adds. “Working with Sue Kim has been such a joy. We've been all around the world together and I know this is just the beginning of many more exciting things to come.”  




			Trending on Billboard		







	Thursday's event debuted clips of the LISA film, including her 2025 debut solo performance at Coachella and her at home in Thailand. During a conversation about the doc, Kim revealed that the film will focus on showing the superstar in her offstage moments.


	The event also included previews of forthcoming documentaries on Barbra Streisand, Oasis and Elvis Presley, with director Baz Luhrman taking part in a conversation on the Elvis doc, the follow-up to his 2022 feature film ELVIS.

	











	The new documentary is called EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert. Speaking on the film, Luhrmann said that “During the making of ELVIS, we went on a search for rumored unseen footage from the iconic 1970s concert films Elvis: That's The Way It Is and Elvis on Tour. My initial thought was that we may be able to restore the unused footage (if we could find it) and use it in our Elvis feature, starring Austin Butler. 


	“I had researchers go into the Warners Bros. film vaults buried in underground salt mines and, to the astonishment of all, we uncovered 68 boxes of film negative, as well as unseen 8mm footage,” the acclaimed director continues. “It has taken two years to restore the footage to a quality that it has never been projected at previously, while the team had to meticulously claw back sound from the many, unconventional sources that were also unearthed. One of the great finds has been unheard recordings of Elvis talking about his life and his music. It was this that gave the inspiration for EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert. 


	Luhrman adds that the film is “not specifically a documentary, nor a concert film: Elvis takes the audience through the journey of his life, weaving never-before-seen footage with iconic performances that have never been presented in this way, from the 1970 Vegas show, on tour in 1972 and even precious moments of the 1957 ‘gold jacket; performance in Hawaii. Most importantly, Elvis will sing and tell you about his life in first person, through both classic and contemporary musical prisms.”

Growing up in rural Minnesota, Stacy Vee didn't have particularly lofty ambitions. While attending St. Cloud State University, she says, “my dream job was maybe I could be a special events planner at this hotel on the freeway one day and do weddings and conferences.”Vee did end up planning events — just on a far larger scale than that highway-­adjacent hotel. Now she's executive vp of Goldenvoice/AEG, where she has been in charge of the world's largest country music festival, Stagecoach, since 2015, greatly expanding the three-day, Indio, Calif.-based event that launched in 2007 — and altering perceptions of country music in the process. Attendance at the late-April festival, capped at 85,000 per day, rivals its eclectic cousin, Coachella, which Goldenvoice holds on the same grounds the previous two weekends each year (and which Vee is also involved in booking).On the day Billboard meets with her, Vee is sentimental, sad, elated and tired. It's the last day of Stagecoach and she's sitting in her trailer in the artist compound, which she has made cozy with a bowl of fresh nectarines, macrame pillows strewn on the sofa, vintage lamps, Christmas lights and cowboy boots and hats.After all these years, she still gets pre-festival jitters. “On the night before day one of Stagecoach, I woke up at one and I just couldn't get back to sleep,” she says. “It's excitement and nerves and we've been working on the show for so long.” In fact, she adds, “I've been working on 2026 for a year already. It's 80% booked.”

Mercury Records has been behind the four most popular country albums in 2025 to date: hip-hop star Post Malone's F-1 Trillion and, thanks to what Arnold calls a “strategic alliance” with Nashville indie label Big Loud, Morgan Wallen's One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album, as well as Wallen's latest smash-hit chart-topper, I'm the Problem. Dangerous: The Double Album has spent the most weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for any album by a solo artist — and earlier this year, ranked at No. 1 on the Top Billboard 200 Albums of the 21st Century chart. Mercury Records — the storied label that released noteworthy albums by George Jones, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs — relaunched in 2022 and, Arnold says of the Universal Music-owned Republic subsidiary, “I could not be prouder of what our team has accomplished in such a short time.”



Bay-Schuck points to the formal alignment of Warner Records in Los Angeles and Warner Music Nashville as the company's most notable achievement in the past year. “We had long been great partners for one another and had meaningful success supporting each other's repertoire or signing the occasional artist in partnership, but making the industry-forward move of formally joining the two companies was a big and necessary step,” he says. “It signaled to the industry at large that these two important divisions, while each has their own unique approach and point of view, were not in competition. But instead, together, we can provide global best-in-class service and amplification for country and country-adjacent artists in ways our competition cannot.”

“Oversaturation,” Bay-Schuck says. “Country music has become so popular and trendy that we are seeing many artists run to the genre without having embraced the cultural and community aspect that country music is all about.”

As it celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, Big Machine Label Group's established artists continue notching hits and its newcomers are swiftly piling up career accolades. Thomas Rhett scored his 20th Country Airplay chart-topper with the Morgan Wallen collaboration “Mamaw's House.” Meanwhile, Riley Green earned his second No. 1 Country Airplay hit and picked up multiple Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards with the Ella Langley collaboration “you look like you love me,” and his album Don't Mind If I Do debuted in the top 10 of the Top Country Albums chart. “We continue to level up in multiple ways,” Borchetta says. “Our staff and artists are firing on all cylinders.”

“ ‘Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand' by Waylon Jennings,” Borchetta says.

In April 2024, Belmont University's Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business revealed a $58 million lead gift from Curb and the Mike Curb Foundation, which will fuel expansion of the program's presence on Nashville's Music Row with the renovation of existing buildings and construction of a state-of-the-art facility. Curb calls the expansion “our biggest achievement this past year.” Additional successes for Curb Records include chart victories by Kelsey Hart, Lee Brice and Dylan Scott.

“I like the message of our record ‘Live Like You Were Dying' by Tim McGraw.”

Leo33 flagship artist Zach Top's career has surged over the past year thanks to his Country Airplay top 15 hit “Sounds Like the Radio” and follow-up No. 2 hit “I Never Lie,” which the RIAA certified platinum. Top won best new male artist at the ACM Awards, and his debut album, Cold Beer & Country Music, was nominated for album of the year. “Watching his meteoric rise has been a testament to the magic that happens when you pair a compelling artist with a passionate, dedicated team,” Dean says. “The way we at Leo33 approach our roster curation — signing artists with a vision and ensuring we build sustainable businesses around them — has been a key focus.”

“What used to be a very artist-driven format is now more focused on trends and songs. The question becomes, What does this shift mean for developing and sustaining true superstars in the long term?”

Shaboozey solidified 2024's country takeover with his monster smash, “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-tying 19 weeks and reached the top 10 on four different radio formats. EMPIRE's Nashville division was instrumental to the track's success. “We're grateful to still be breaking records as a company with 15 years under our belt this year,” says Hurt, who notes an additional country radio No. 1 in Morgan Wallen's “Cowgirls” (featuring ERNEST), written by EMPIRE signees Yung Lan and James Maddocks. “We're continuing to develop our Nashville roster with acts including CeCe, Niko Moon [and] Don Louis,” Hurt adds.

“The roots of country music came from the blend of various European, African, Native American and other cultures,” Hurt says. “The industry and artists should continue supporting diversity within the format or we'll end up moving further away from the roots of country music.”



In conjunction with Sony Nashville, Columbia signed rising hit-maker Megan Moroney, whose recent wins have included her first Billboard 200 top 10 album, Am I Okay?, a Country Music Association (CMA) Award for new artist of the year and recognition as Rulebreaker at the 2025 Billboard Women in Music event. “It's a testament to a focused strategy,” Swirsky says, which he summarizes as “balancing consistent music releases with an ambitious touring schedule, all while staying aligned with her voice and vision. I'm grateful to be part of this journey with such a talented artist.”

“ ‘God Plays a Gibson' by Megan Moroney,” Swirsky says.

Universal Music Group Nashville was recently rebranded as MCA, under Harris and Cobb's leadership. With a roster that includes Chris Stapleton, Eric Church, Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood, MCA continues to operate its frontline labels Mercury Nashville, EMI Records Nashville and MCA Nashville, along with the new, Cobb-founded label Lucille Records. MCA also formed a creative strategic alliance with award-winning songwriter Jessie Jo Dillon, cementing its commitment to songwriters and their essential contributions. “We feel the MCA brand gives us a fresh start,” Harris says, “as we embark on this next chapter of the company's history.”

“ ‘Troubadour' by George Strait is the greatest country song of all time,” Harris says. “Hands down!”

“The past year has seen the continued elevation and superstardom dominance of Cody Johnson,” Williams says of the Texas native, who sold out his first headlining stadium show at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, in November, and released the deluxe edition of his fifth album, Leather, the same month. The album and its subsequent edition launched his Country Airplay chart-­topper “The Painter” and top five hits “Dirt Cheap,” which won song of the year at the ACM Awards in May, and “I'm Gonna Love You,” a duet with Carrie Underwood.

“Country music has never been more popular,” Williams says. “With this brings a massive untapped potential to reach new and diverse audiences, and we need to embrace this range and diversity.”

Following chairman/CEO Randy Goodman's retirement at the end of 2024, Sony Music Nashville changed leadership and Lindsey and Robold assumed their current roles. They helm an artist roster that includes stadium headliners Luke Combs and Kane Brown and reigning CMA new artist of the year Megan Moroney. “Taylor and I have the honor of leading Sony Music Nashville into a new era, where we have the responsibility to both our artists and staff to help foster new careers,” Robold says. “Our goal is to not only honor the rich history of country music, but to break new artists and continue pushing the boundaries of the genre with our superstar acts.”

“ ‘I Will Always Love You' by Dolly Parton,” Lindsey says.

Post Malone's evolution from hip-hop megastar to Nashville-worshiping country singer led to 2024's third-most streamed single, “I Had Some Help” (featuring Morgan Wallen), by on-demand audio streams. Post's album F-1 Trillion hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and also debuted at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. “For any established artist to continue to be popular and relevant, and to even grow, is a challenge. To do all those things while redefining your music and overall brand required such thoughtfulness,” says Avery Lipman, whose label has scored the top market share among all labels, by a wide margin, two years in a row.

“Willie Nelson's ‘Always on My Mind' is my favorite song, period, across all genres,” Avery says. “A truly timeless story of simple, heartfelt sentiment that lands like a ton of bricks every time I hear it.”



“Over the past year, we've solidified our role in the market by growing format leaders, breaking tomorrow's legends and elevating country's biggest stars,” Hahr says, pointing to longtime radio fixtures like Dustin Lynch, Jason Aldean and Blake Shelton, the lattermost of whom signed with the company in September. But BMG Nashville and its affiliated imprints also feature two of the genre's biggest and still-growing hit-makers in Jelly Roll, who scored his first Billboard 200 No. 1 in 2024 with his Beautifully Broken album, and Lainey Wilson, whom the ACM Awards named entertainer of the year in 2024 and 2025. She was also inducted into the Grand Ole Opry, and her 2024 album, Whirlwind, won album of the year at the ACM Awards.

“Johnny Lee's ‘Lookin' for Love,' ” Hahr says.

Back Blocks' artists achieved a number of milestones this year. Management, publishing and label client Ashley Cooke scored a No. 2 hit on Country Airplay with “Your Place,” while publishing and label client Tucker Wetmore achieved the same feat with “Wind Up Missin' You.” Publishing client Blake Pendergrass has 15 tracks on Morgan Wallen's new album, I'm the Problem, and singles on the radio from four different artists: Wallen, Jelly Roll, Warren Zeiders and Vincent Mason. “That's four different sounds, four different labels. His range as a songwriter is unreal,” Marshall says of Pendergrass. “I'm proud we've done it our way — with integrity, hustle and heart. We're breaking through by betting on great songs and even better people.”

“Platforms like TikTok have changed the game, and we'd be foolish not to pay attention. But somewhere along the way, social media became the marketing plan instead of part of it. That's the problem.”



On the publishing side, River House creative director Kayla Adkins last year helped secure more than 150 tracks for its songwriters with artists including Kane Brown, Lainey Wilson and Shaboozey. The publishing company also recently re-signed Billy Strings, who in 2024 released his fourth studio album, Highway Prayers, and the Grammy-winning Live Vol. 1. On the label side, Hudson Westbrook's song catalog “is currently streaming over 13 million a week, with more than 300 million total to date in less than a year,” Oliver-Cline says, adding that the rising star and Billboard's December Country Rookie of the Month “is selling out his own shows across the country and will support Parker McCollum later this year.”

“ ‘I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool' by Barbara Mandrell,” Oliver-Cline says.

Four months after his home label, Bailee & Buddy/Stoney Creek/Broken Bow/BMG, partnered with Republic Records, Jelly Roll's Beautifully Broken hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in October, scoring 161,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Republic also made a partnership deal with Miranda Lambert in April 2024, releasing her album Postcards From Texas with radio promotion and marketing by Nashville's Big Loud. “These moments represent our commitment to honoring country music's deep roots,” Kinney says, “while boldly expanding the genre's reach and relevance on a global scale.”

“Country music is in a golden moment, but the real opportunity is in sustaining the boom and focusing on meaningful global reach,” Kinney says. “The growth came from outside the traditional center, driven by artists who took creative risks and rewrote the rules. And the future depends on continuing to champion that kind of bold innovation.”



“Max McNown's efficient and joyful journey from busking on a boardwalk to nearly 8 million monthly listeners in a matter of months has been a truly beautiful project to develop,” Studley says of the rising country newcomer. “When an extraordinary artist's vision is wholly supported by their label and the label gives our team fuel and trust to harness momentum, success is an inevitability.” Another recent Orchard highlight: Black River's Kelsea Ballerini notching her first No. 1 on Top Country Albums with Patterns, which also landed at No. 4 on the Billboard 200.

“Gender and racial disparities and cultural gatekeeping in commercial country music continue to handicap the genre and the community. Country music will become bigger and better when the hurdles facing women, [those who are Black, Indigenous and people of color] and gender/sexual minority artists are eliminated and we enthusiastically welcome artistic experimentation and expansion.”

RECORDS Nashville had a big year of growth for several artists, including breakthrough successes at country radio with George Birge (“Mind on You”) and Ty Myers (“Ends of the Earth”). Myers “is rapidly becoming one of the hottest stars in country music. He has already sold over 100,000 tickets on his current sold-out tour,” Easler says. “We firmly believe Ty will continue to take the music world by storm.” RECORDS Nashville also helped Columbia promote the Koe Wetzel-Jessie Murph team-up “High Road,” which became the first Country Airplay No. 1 for both artists.

“The song that made me fall in love with country music is ‘Diggin' Up Bones' by Randy Travis,” Easler says.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Over his more than four decades as a producer, Mark Johnson has done about 60 movies, including The Chronicles Of Narnia fantasy trilogy; Best Picture Oscar winner Rain Man; Bugsy; Good Morning, Vietnam; Galaxy Quest; The Holdovers; and romantic classic The Notebook. Surprisingly, none have been turned into a TV series yet, even as Johnson has established a footprint in television with the Emmy-winning Breaking Bad and most recently the Anne Rice universe on AMC. 


	That may finally change. During an interview with Deadline tied to Johnson's first-look deal extension at AMC, he provided an update on the long-in-the-works TV series based on the cult classic 1999 sci-fi comedy Galaxy Quest. There had been multiple incarnations at the now-defunct Paramount TV Studios over the past decade, the most recent set up at Paramount+ in 2023.

	Johnson addressed that project, now set up at CBS Studios, which absorbed sibling Paramount TV Studios, as well as a TV series adaptation of the 2023 boarding school Focus Features comedy-drama The Holdovers, which won Da ‘Vine Joy Randolph an Oscar and earned Johnson another Best Picture nomination.

	“Both are being written, so we'll see,” he said. 


The Holdovers series has been in talks at Universal Television but there is no deal in place, sources said.


	There are no current TV plans for The Notebook, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel, which was recently adapted into a short-lived Broadway musical. But things are brewing around another movie title, the 2022 supernatural horror thriller What Lies Beneath, which Johnson executive produced.

	











	“We're very excited about the idea of maybe doing a television show — I'm not sure I should say this but I'm going to — our movie What Lies Beneath, that could lend itself to a very good, perhaps limited, perhaps not, TV show.”


	Johnson also weighed in on C.S. Lewis' bestselling The Chronicles of Narnia novels getting a new movie adaptation, this time by Barbie filmmaker Greta Gerwig for Netflix.


	“I'm fascinated. First of all, I'm a gigantic fan of hers, so I can't wait to see it,” he said. “I can't quite tell what she's doing. Is she doing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which, of course, we did years ago, or is she doing something else. Or is it a combination of them.”


	No details about Gerwig's movie are being released but it is believed to be an adaptation of The Magician's Nephew, the sixth novel in the series, which serves as a prequel and examines the origins of Narnia.


	Cast so far are Carey Mulligan, who will play the mother of Digory, one of the film's young protagonists, Daniel Craig as Digory's uncle, Meryl Streep as lion Aslan the Great, and Emma Mackey as the White Witch.


	“I don't know how secret it all is, I don't know about it, but I'm not competitive about it,” Johnson said. “I can't wait to see it, because whatever [Gerwig] does is going to be really good, and I'm sure, radically different from what we did.”


The Chronicles of Narnia trilogy, which Johnson produced, included adaptations of the first three books in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The first two films were directed by Andrew Adamson and the third by Michael Apted. They grossed $1.5B collectively worldwide.


	The new movie is not following into its predecessors' theatrical footsteps as it is Netflix-bound, but Gerwig secured a two-week IMAX run before the film drops on streaming, something Johnson gave her props for.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Mark Johnson is closing in on two decades at AMC. The Oscar-winning film producer behind such movies as Rain Man, The Notebook and The Holdovers started his run at the cable network with Vince Gilligan's Emmy-winning Breaking Bad. It led to seven other series to date — and more in the works as Johnson has renewed his first-look deal with AMC Studios.


	“Why wouldn't I be at AMC?,” he told Deadline in an interview tied to the new pact. “They truly celebrate the story. You look at the success they've had, it is still very much the leader and the benchmark: good writing, good characters and good television.”

	Johnson has become a franchise player for AMC. Along with executive producing Breaking Bad and prequel Better Call Saul, he oversees the Anne Rice universe, which spans Interview With the Vampire and Mayfair Witches — both headed into Season 3 after filming Seasons 1 and 2 in New Orleans  — and the upcoming The Talamasca. Johnson also is spearheading the recently announced Great American Stories anthology series, which will launch with The Grapes Of Wrath, written by Interview developer/showrunner Rolin Jones.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to more installments of the current franchises, which he discusses in the Q&A, Johnson is developing other projects under his deal, including drama Black Vault, written by Vinnie Wilhelm (The Bondsman) based on the novella by Alma Katsu and executive produced by The Walking Dead franchise veteran Greg Nicotero.


	In it, after an ambitious CIA field agent makes the ill-advised choice to report his encounter with a UFO, he finds himself abandoned by both his family and his allies at the Agency. Fifteen years later, buried behind a desk at Langley, he's asked to join a task force investigating government knowledge of UFOs. Armed with the tools to unpack the circumstances of his own disgrace and redeem his past, he stumbles onto a mystery that could upend the geopolitical order— and possibly much more.


	In the interview with Deadline, Johnson shares plans for expanding the Anne Rice universe and building the Great American Stories franchise and explains why The Grapes Of Wrath was chosen to launch it. He recalls his chance first encounter with Gilligan and reacts to Better Call Saul‘s Emmy record of 53 nominations without a win. He also gives updates on several TV series adaptations of movies he had produced.

	











	As he is about to turn 80 this year, Johnson reveals whether retirement is in his plans and what his hobbies are. He also gives his take on the ongoing industry correction and explains why he thinks series budget getting trimmed may be a good thing.


DEADLINE: There had been multiple unsuccessful attempts to launch an Anne Rice TV series franchise by the time AMC acquired 18 of her books. Because of that, did you have any hesitation when approached by the network to oversee the properties?


JOHNSON: Well, I had a hesitation because, to be totally candid, I didn't really know Anne Rice that well. I had read Interview with the Vampire but didn't know the rest of her works, and I had no idea there was as much as there was.


	I went back, looked at the Interview with the Vampire movie, started reading some books and realized the potential and that nobody else was doing what she was doing. That her concept, specifically of vampires, was so original, because there is a temptation to say, yet another vampire show or movie, and yet her vampires — I keep saying they're vampires, but they're humans.


	Most people forget that vampires are indeed humans, and they have all of the same longings and tastes that we do. And what was so heartbreaking and openly romantic about our vampires is that they are at their core, lonely. The friendships, the love affairs they have with non-vampires have an end date on them so ultimately, these vampires are left alone. 


	The more I explored her, the more captivated I was. And as I got to know New Orleans, I realized that so much of the city was in her writing and formed by her writing. If you go to New Orleans, they're all these ghost tours and so on, they're all based on Anne Rice's books and characters. It just became a world that I thought there's so much to do here.


DEADLINE: How ambitious was the initial plan? Was it focused just on Interview with the Vampire or did you have, like Dick Wolf, three on-air series in mind already?


JOHNSON: Oh no, no, no. When we started, we thought maybe it would just be Interview. And the genius of Interview with the Vampire is Rolin Jones, the showrunner-creator, who truly took a very faithful Anne Rice [approach] but he's also made it entirely his. I think both Seasons 1 and 2 were remarkable, and it's no accident that both seasons got a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score.


	Had that been the only Anne Rice thing I did, I would have been a happy man. Then we started exploring some of the other titles, and we got to Mayfair Witches, which is created by Michelle Ashford and Esta Spaulding. It's a completely different world; it's contemporary, and it's witches, not vampires. And again, it concentrates on human beings, it's not celebrating the supernatural, but the natural as it's affected by these other characters.


	And then, we're in the process of finishing The Talamasca, which is a third one altogether. There's almost a temptation to say, well, they're not really connected. And yet they are; thematically they are, and certainly in terms of the style and as a concentration, they all belong under the Anne Rice umbrella.


	Our goal is — and we're doing it judiciously — connecting, not so much in terms of easter eggs, but connecting characters from one show to the other, because ultimately, there's a common point that they all have.

	











DEADLINE: Are you getting to a point where you can do crossovers between shows? Even if they're not set in the same era, time is kind of irrelevant when it comes to immortals.


JOHNSON: I know, there is a temptation. When you kill a character, you say, Oh, come on, you can bring him back next season, because it's the supernatural. No, we can't play by those rules. And one of the things you learn early on is that there are rules within Anne Rice's work, and you have to obey them because you deviate at the expense of alienating an audience. 


	But there's so many other things we can do. For instance, The Talamasca is an organization that keeps tabs on — and in theory doesn't interfere with — the supernatural beings in our world. Of course, that would do with witches and with vampires, so you can see how we can connect all three. And we do. There are big surprises already in couple of the seasons, but in the coming season of both Interview and you'll see in Talamasca that there are some connections to these other franchises.


DEADLINE:  What about spinoffs?  You did one with Vince Gilligan, Better Call Saul, and AMC has mastered that with The Walking Dead offshoots. Have you thought about characters that have broken out and feel like they can headline their own show?


JOHNSON: No, I haven't thought about characters that are broken out. This is not a criticism of Walking Dead, but in a strange way, if a character is available to put into another world or his or her own show, then that means you haven't successfully integrated them into their own franchise. The vampires Lestat and Louie are unique to Interview with a Vampire, and I don't know how you would break them out of that world and that history. I certainly haven't thought about, oh, this character is so successful, let's give her or let's give him their own show.


DEADLINE: Isn't there a separate Lestat book in Anne Rice's collection that  you could use for a spinoff? 


JOHNSON: Yes, there's a book called The Vampire Lestat but there is this connection. And, Talamasca, our third series, is not based on a single book. There isn't a book called The Talamasca, but it's an organization that appears in a number of Anne Rice's books.


	John Lee Hancock, who is a writer I've worked with a great deal, has created the world of The Talamasca, all of it inspired by her work but taken a certain amount of liberty, hopefully at the same time always being faithful to what she might have done with the Talamasca had she done a book on them.


DEADLINE:  Is this a direction for you now, not adapt the books title by title but do worlds-encompassing series where you pull from different novels? What else do you have in development? 


JOHNSON: We have a couple of other things in different stages of development, two based on specific books, and the third one, like Talamasca, based on series of events that happen in a couple of the books, on characters who can cross over into original stories.


	AMC is being smart along with us, taking it step by step. So there isn't this impulse, quickly, let's get all the Anne Rice stuff in development. And also it's hard work. You can't do a lot of things all at once, so you pinpoint one or two and work on those. Our goal now is to keep both Interview and Mayfair Witches going successfully, and then premiere Talamasca, which I think is a very satisfying show. It's kind of a spy show, almost a John le Carré with elements of the supernatural in it.

	











	 It's such a gold mine, this cornucopia of material because Anne Rice gifts us characters and situations and moments in history that you want to play with. She's so specific and so tactile in her world. She's an extraordinary writer, for one, being a woman writing when she was at that time. And she's very progressive and quite salty in terms of everything, from romance to sex to violence and, again, she's writing about the supernatural in a way that nobody else has.


DEADLINE: Did you get to meet her? Was she still alive when you started working on the franchise?


JOHNSON: She was still alive when we started shooting the first season of Interview with the Vampire. She unfortunately died shortly after we started, and we had all of New Orleans — and certainly our shooting company — in a form of mourning. I have met her son, Christopher, who is an executive producer on the shows, but I never met Anne Rice herself.


DEADLINE: How many Anne Rice series do you envision in the universe? Could you go to four or five at the same time? 


JOHNSON: I think we could do four or five. At some point, it becomes a little ridiculous, but I have a very small but incredibly gifted team, and we can keep tabs, certainly on the three we have now. I know that we could add a fourth and maybe go a little crazy with a fifth.


DEADLINE: What has been the impact from the shows streaming on Netflix? Have you seen any spike in ratings?


JOHNSON: Well, our show Breaking Bad didn't become an official hit until it was on Netflix, it made a huge difference. And we've already seen that with both Interview and Mayfair Witches, having the first seasons of both those shows be available on Netflix brought a number of new subscribers to the network, which is exactly what AMC had hoped it would do.


DEADLINE: You mentioned Breaking Bad. Did you really meet Vince when you were judging a script competition long time ago?


JOHNSON: My undergraduate school was the University of Virginia. After I had been producing movies, I was very involved in the film festival and was asked to be part of a script writing contest that was then headed by Governor Wilder of Virginia. I read a script by this NYU graduate who I think was probably 22 maybe 23 then, Vince Gilligan, who was living in Richmond, Virginia, and it was like a light bulb went off.


	Like any greedy producer, I said, I've got to know this man. And so I went to Richmond, he and I spent a fair amount of time, I went back and forth to Richmond, where he was living. We did a couple of movies together, and he was offered a job on The X Files. I thought that was a terrible idea, because I thought he'd lose his voice. He is the most inventive writer I've ever come across, and I was worried that television was going to somehow beat it out of him. And little did I know…


DEADLINE: He lured you to TV. With Better Call Saul, was that the first time you started thinking of building TV franchises? Obviously you've done it on the film side with The Chronicles of Narnia.


JOHNSON: Yes, it was with Better Call Saul, the idea of keeping that world alive. And first of all, Vincent and the writers are geniuses, making sure that, for instance, Saul, while it recognizes and deals with characters and moments from Breaking Bad, the puzzle fits and there are no discrepancies within it. And I thought, what a great idea. So the idea that I'm now involved in the Breaking Bad franchise, the Anne Rice franchise, and now Great American Stories, is certainly not by design.

	











DEADLINE: In terms of the Breaking Bad franchise, is this it? You did the El Camino movie too, and Vince is currently busy with his secret Apple show. But is there more in the Breaking Bad universe that you guys are noodling on? 


JOHNSON: You'll have to ask Vince, that I don't know. I know nothing about Vince's new show. I was with him last week, we continue to be quite close. But there's certain things that I don't know about. That's a question for Vince, I don't know of any continuation.


DEADLINE: Breaking Bad won 16 Emmys, including 2 for Drama Series. What do you make of Better Call Saul's Emmy record of zero wins out of 53 nominations?


JOHNSON: I think it was fantastic and humbling for this show that meant so much to all of us to be recognized with so many nominations over the years, and never winning was about as on-brand for Saul Goodman as one could imagine.


DEADLINE: When you were renewing your AMC deal, did you know that you would be taking on a second franchise for them, beyond Anne Rice?


JOHNSON: No, I knew that we're in the middle of the Anne Rice one, but this Great American Stories is pretty recent, and it's a brainchild of [President of Entertainment and AMC Studios] Dan McDermott. He really wants to celebrate what it means to be American and the history of the American generation as seen through its literature and events. I think the ambition is huge, which is what draws me to it.


DEADLINE: Whose idea was it to start with The Grapes of Wrath, yours or Dan's?


JOHNSON:  I think it was Dan and Rolin Jones, who is one of the most gifted storytellers I've come across. We talked about it. I had read it, I think, in graduate school, but I quickly came back and re-read it. I have forgotten how extraordinary it is, and I think it's a perfect story for our time. 


	When it was first published, it was considered un-American, and a lot of people really wanted to ban it. And the truth of the matter is, while it is a political piece, it is very much a celebration of who we as Americans are, who the characters are, and what this country is all about, even though it's very much about the Joad family being under the thumb of those in power. I think it's probably the biggest thing we can start off with.


	You look at the John Ford movie with Henry Fonda, which is very, very strong. Arrogantly I say, I think we can actually improve upon it, and I don't think there's a better writer than Rolin. So as soon as he brought that up, I think we all said, perfect. 


	So we're starting with a bang, and we'll see what we follow it with. We're entertaining all kinds of titles. There are nine American Nobel Prize winners in literature, the ninth one is, of course, Bob Dylan. I'm not sure we're going to be doing a Bob Dylan show, but the palette is gigantic. 


DEADLINE: What is the current status of The Grapes of Wrath? How far along is it? 


JOHNSON: It has not been written yet. Rolin is otherwise engaged with the third season of Interview.


DEADLINE: But you're already thinking about other titles, yes? 


JOHNSON: Oh yes, we have sort of a master list, and as soon as it was announced, a number of really significant writers reached out and said, How about this? What about that? Have you thought about this? It's difficult because I don't know that you can follow it with a heavy period piece. Do you try something a little bit lighter in tone? Do you try something geographically different? Anyhow, the options are huge, and I think we'll be developing two or three titles at the same time in competition for the second [installment].

	











DEADLINE:  Dare I say that the infamous AMC bake-off is back?


JOHNSON: I don't. By the way, I think I may have escaped that, and there are a number of people I know who will damn AMC because of that bake-off process. It was, to their credit, discontinued, but it was a pretty tough way to do it.


	Look, I've been at AMC since the start of my television career. I did a couple of things at CBS years ago, but not just with Breaking Bad, but Halt and Catch Fire and Rectify, two shows I'm extraordinarily proud of. I've been there long enough that practically the whole management has changed. The consistent player is Ben Davis, who started as a development executive when we were doing Breaking Bad and now runs production. I could not be more pleased and quite frankly, thankful, that I'm at AMC.


DEADLINE: Is it possible for you to go contemporary with Great American Stories or will you be sticking to classics? 


JOHNSON: Sure. I was talking about something at some point– and I have no idea what the rights situation is — could we do something like A Confederacy of Dunces? I'm a huge Walker Percy fan. There are some really good, not just 20th century, but end of 20th century writers, some extraordinary people, be it [John] Cheever. It's just this great opportunity, you have all these titles.


DEADLINE: Under your AMC deal, are you working on anything that is a brand new IP or just something different than Anne Rice and Great American Stories? 


JOHNSON: We're definitely developing other things, we have some writers. Look, for a producer, writers are his or her lifeblood, some of my best friends are writers. People come to me all the time, or I'll go to them with an idea, writers I value. So we have a couple of things in development at AMC that have nothing to do with franchises. 


DEADLINE: Anything you can mention?


JOHNSON: There's something called Black Vault that I'm doing with a wonderful writer named Vinnie Wilhelm. For me as a producer, it's a non-exclusive deal, it's a first-look deal. So I have a couple of things .We're developing our movie, Galaxy Quest, as a TV series. But the bulk of my work is clearly with AMC. And not because I have a deal there; it would be my first stop no matter what.


DEADLINE: What is the status of the long-gestating Galaxy Quest series at Paramount+? And I believe you also have been developing a TV series based on The Holdovers.


JOHNSON:  Both are being written, so we'll see. 


DEADLINE: Any other movie titles from your body of work that you are looking at or have been approached about doing for TV? One day The Notebook will probably lend itself to a limited series somewhere.


JOHNSON: Yeah, there was, of course, the Broadway play. We're talking. We're very excited about the idea of maybe doing a television show — I'm not sure I should say this but I'm going to — our movie What Lies Beneath, that could lend itself to a very good, perhaps limited, perhaps not, TV show.


DEADLINE:  Is there any of your movie titles that you could do for AMC or are they all tied up at different studios?


JOHNSON: Most of them are. There's something that I'm talking to AMC this week about, but I can't tell you.


DEADLINE: Have you done cameos on your shows? Do you have interest in doing that?












JOHNSON: No, I have no interest at all. I had a small part in Good Morning, Vietnam. I had a small part in The Notebook, a small part in a couple of others. I hate it, it drives me crazy. I grew up in Spain, of all places, and at the time, they were making American and British films there. I started working as an extra, and then I had a couple of small parts. But no, that's not an ambition of mine, and not something I enjoy doing.


DEADLINE: Your career has spanned more than four decades on two continents across film and TV. Are you thinking about slowing down at any point, enjoy golf and retirement? How long are you planning to go on full speed?


JOHNSON: You know what, Nellie, I enjoy it so much I don't know why I would step down. And I don't play golf. I'm probably the most boring person I know, because my hobby is movies and television. I go to cinemas two or three times a week. I went downtown to Alamo Drafthouse to see Serpico. And a couple of days before I was watching The Conversation at the Egyptian.


	I got a graduate degree in film scholarship, history, theory and criticism — not film production — and I was going to teach it before I got involved. You can't talk to me about much outside of the film and television worlds because I I'm too busy paying attention to all of that world. I really love doing what I'm doing, as long as I feel that I'm doing it well and am somewhat relevant, I'm going to keep doing it.


DEADLINE: What is next for you on the film side?


JOHNSON: I'm working with a director who you would know, putting together something that we're going to start shooting by the end of the year.


DEADLINE: AMC and the entire industry have changed a lot since Breaking Bad. What is your take on where television is going? Are you optimistic about the future of TV storytelling and TV producers? There is concern that they may become extinct due to the new compensation models.


JOHNSON: Yeah, the producers' plight is a tough one right now, and there are a number of us, a number or organizations, including Producers United, trying to defend, not just the producers themselves, but what a producer does. It seems to be undervalued these days and is taken up sometimes by people who aren't producers, and I think the process and often the product suffers from it.


	I'm not going to say anything original, it's an evolving world. I was lucky in that I was a feature film producer who really, thanks to Breaking Bad, adapted and accepted the television world. You're using different muscles, and it's so satisfying. I'm so lucky because I can do a feature now and then, and these television shows, which I truly enjoy doing. The challenges are different, and they keep me on my toes.


	I think what we're going through right now, everybody's complaining about budgets, but it's just a redirection. I think it's setting the scales back to zero because we were spending, quite frankly, way too much on so many shows. 


	At AMC, we don't have the same budgets some of the streamers have, but it actually forces you to be more imaginative, more resourceful. So I would point at both seasons of Interview With the Vampire and dare anybody to say those aren't really spectacularly made pieces of filmmaking.


	And we made them on a level that I think, once again, I don't think we're misspending any money, and I don't think anything needed to be as expensive as it has been in the past. Obviously, if you're doing Shōgun, there's a certain amount of money that you have to spend, but I do think everything's got way out of whack, and I don't bemoan the fact that it's correcting itself now.

	











DEADLINE: So being a producer is still a viable profession in the post-peak TV landscape?


JOHNSON: Yes, and in part, I don't even know how to talk about it financially. I can just say it's a viable profession because it's immensely satisfying. There's so many great creators, so many feature directors, so many great showrunners, and I want to help them make whatever it is they want to make within the parameters that were given. Some days are tougher than others, but I love what I'm doing,

Senior Film Reporter


SPOILER ALERT: The following story contains details from Hacks‘ Season 4 finale.


	Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) goes to hell and back in the Season 4 finale of Hacks, which aired on HBO Max tonight.


	After blowing up her late-night dreams, she finds herself under a network non-compete in Episode 10, “Heaven,” which states that she can't perform as a comedian for 18 months. Ava (Hannah Einbinder) encourages her to make the most of her mandated time away from the spotlight, in the writing of a new act, but Deborah instead sets out to find a legal loophole that will allow her to skirt the agreement.

	At loose ends for perhaps the first time in her life, Deborah pays a visit to former manager Marcus (Carl Clemons-Hopkins), trying to convince him to come back to work alongside her — though he's now content to oversee a warehouse producing solar panel materials.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Marty (Christopher McDonald) offers Deborah an extended stay at a Hawaiian hotel where he's a part owner, and while it looks for a moment that she's resigned herself to jet off for a vacation with Ava and set work aside for a beat, Ava is surprised to wake from the trip in Singapore instead.


	Deborah has found her loophole: She's negotiated a limited run in a casino, where she'll perform through a translator, circumventing the terms of her late show contract. Over time, the run extends into a residency, and Deborah lives the high life, partying too much as Ava becomes increasingly disillusioned.


	Ava accuses Deb of having given up — after all, she hasn't written new material in months — and is sent packing following yet another big argument with her boss. But when Ava wakes on the morning of her flight, it's to frantic texts and calls, letting her know that TMZ has reported Deborah dead.


	Fear not, though, as she's very much alive. This was just a case of an obit being prepped in advance and accidentally published. In any case, the moment serves its purpose for Deborah, lighting a fire under her to get back to the U.S. and have the final say in the writing of her story.

	











	Hours before Hacks‘ Season 5 renewal was formally announced, creator-showrunners Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs, and Jen Statsky hopped on Zoom with Deadline to break down the finale and preview their endgame for the series. Here, they discuss signs of “character growth” for Deborah, a big evolution in her dynamic with Ava, whether they'll stick to a five-season plan for the series, the potential for a Jimmy-Kayla spin-off, their Kaley Cuoco comedy Kansas City Star in development at HBO, and more.


DEADLINE: Hacks has been renewed for a fifth season, as expected. How are you feeling?


JEN STATSKY: Good! We feel privileged and honored to get to do another season of this show.


LUCIA ANIELLO: Yeah.  In a world where five seasons of a comedy is extremely rare, we count our blessings.


PAUL W. DOWNS: And it shouldn't be, but it is.


DEADLINE: Do you have a sense of when you'll be back on set?


DOWNS: I think the fall. We have been writing, so behind the Zoom tab is another tab. We're in process.DEADLINE: Why did this feel like the right place to leave Deborah and Ava this season?


DOWNS: It just felt right. I mean, in [Episode 9] “A Slippery Slope,” Deborah gives up her white whale, and it was something we always knew we would do, and it really took four seasons to get there. All of the ups and downs of their relationship, and all of the twists and turns of Deborah's career have led to this moment where she says, “I'm going to actually put someone before my career, and I'm going to do right by my career as a comedian and not make a show the wrong way.” So obviously it's a huge character growth for Deborah. And I think that it's just something that we've always planned to do. We always knew we wanted her to get the late-night show; we always knew we wanted her to give it up. And I think at the end of four seasons felt right.


DEADLINE: These beats were part of your concept of the show from the very beginning?


DOWNS: Yeah, although we didn't know it was Season 4. Initially we were like, “Oh, maybe she gets the late night show in Season 3. Maybe it's half of a season.” So all of the tentpoles are there. It's just, when we roll them out and how long we stay with certain stories kind of depends on how we break each season with our writers. 


DEADLINE: There are points toward the end of the season where it seemed like things might go in a different direction: Maybe Deborah exposes her dalliance with network exec Bob after she's ousted from late night. Maybe she goes to Hawaii instead of Singapore. And maybe she dies for real. Were any of those avenues discussed? What informed your choice of direction?


ANIELLO: Going to Singapore, I think what we were searching for there was basically Deborah, since she's kind of banished from performing in English, she always finds a loophole. For us, the way that she in her career ended up going to Vegas, when she was tossed out of the entertainment industry, she kind of likes to find these places where she can build her own reality, her own fortress. And for us in Singapore, that was her doing the same thing. She was creating a world where she could live in the lap of luxury and do what she wanted to do, which is perform, so she figured out her own kind of loophole.


	In terms of the Bob Lipka of it all, I think we actually thought it was more interesting for her not to be able to get out of the non-compete…Obviously, that's not necessarily set in stone. We haven't written the rest of the series. But that did feel like to give him a checkmate would be really putting her in an interesting position and a lack of power, which isn't really something we've seen before. So for us, we're really trying to put our characters in new situations you haven't seen them in. That is what led us to the spirit of the finale, which is to see Deborah in an extremely, extremely low place, and a place which is very different than we've ever seen, which we thought was particularly interesting after she has kind of an emotional climax of just making the right choice in our minds. So for us, in terms of where we left it, I think that's the thing that we've found to be the most interesting, is when Deborah Vance has something she wants, she's reinvigorated and she's excited for life.


	So we wanted to end the season with her excited about her new goal, instead of just ending in a, “Well, that was that. I finished my late-night show, and that's the end, and I chose Ava.” Just because that could feel like a series finale, and we just don't feel like that's where we wanted to end the season. So that is why we kind of had this epilogue episode that got to explore different things and put them in a new scenario. 

	











	For us, in terms of the form of the episode, it feels different than the rest of the series. And for us, we like to challenge ourselves and try to make episodes of the show that you don't see coming. So for us, it's a really special episode.


DOWNS: Although we did always talk about those things. Like, could she get out of [the contractual agreement]? Could she do this? Could she talk about the affair? But obviously, the affair could tarnish the way in which she earned the show. So we were like, can't really do that. And also, knowing that we wanted to get to this place where Ava in Season 3 says, “You'll never put someone before your career,” we needed to give Deborah the opportunity to put someone before her career. And there's not going to be a greater moment, or a more heightened moment than giving up her white whale, this dream that she's had.


DEADLINE: Was the death fake-out simply about making Deborah realize she needed to get back to her real life? Shaking her out of her funk?


STATSKY: Yeah. She does this amazing thing in 9, which is both an emotional and moral victory for her. But we always, after being a comedy first, want to treat our characters as real people and in a grounded way. And we wanted to honor the fact that this was Deborah's dream for her entire life. And even though she knows it was the right choice to walk away, that doesn't mean it's easy. If you've been muzzled and she's not going to be able to do the thing she loves more than anything — the thing she's addicted to, as we've shown — that's going to really put her in a low place, and really put her in a place of grieving and feeling adrift, and everything that you see happen in Episode 10. 


	So, then we've always talked about this story of an obituary being leaked of a famous person because we find it so fascinating. The idea of doing this story with Deborah has been around since Season 1 because all of us were taken very much with the story of Alfred Noble, who had invented dynamite, and then his obituary was accidentally printed and it said, “The merchant of death is dead.” The obituary was about all the people his invention had killed, and it made him realize what his legacy was, and his legacy was someone who had hurt others and taken lives from people. And so it made him reevaluate and want to establish the Nobel Peace Prize in his will, which he did.


	So we always have really thought it was so interesting to have a famous main character who this could happen to, who could see their life the way it would be remembered, and perhaps not like what they see, and still have the chance to change that. To get a second chance at writing your legacy is such a rare, incredible thing, and we really wanted that to be the fire that would be lit under Deborah going into Season 5.


DEADLINE: What does this ending reflect about where the dynamic now rests between Ava and Deborah? Is this always going to be a love-hate relationship, or have they turned a corner?DOWNS: I think after what happens in “A Slippery Slope,” they're so ride or die for each other. They really have, I think, sealed the deal. They're creatively bound, and I think Ava has said this in the past, that as much success as she's had on On the Contrary — which was that weekly news show that she worked on and was offered the head writer job of — or the success she's had in her past, she gets so much satisfaction from working with Deborah, I think because writing can be a very solitary thing. I think their creative collaboration is the most satisfying thing for her. So I do think they are in the best place they've ever been. Of course, they're still going to have philosophical differences because they're two women of very different generations, and the way they see the world is different. They are always going to have grist, and that's sort of the secret sauce of the show. But I don't think they're going to be at odds in the same way again.


DEADLINE: What does the future hold for Jimmy and Kayla? Because it seems like they're also coming to a new place, in their relationship and shared professional life.


DOWNS: We are digging into that right now because their relationship has certainly evolved, as well. They're like a bizarro version of Deborah and Ava, and things have changed for them, but also we have to remember that two of their highest-earning clients now are out of a job and are in Singapore. So what's happening with their fledgling management firm is yet to be seen. We have a lot to explore with them. I don't even actually know all the answers.

	











STATSKY: But they're ride or die, too. Just like Deborah and Ava, at the end of the season, are ride or die.


DOWNS: You know what it is? They're all family — and you can't choose your family.


DEADLINE: You've long talked about Hacks as a five-season show. Is that still definitely the plan?


ANIELLO: We very much know where we want to end the series; it's how we pitched the show originally. Right now, we're still writing towards it ending in the fifth season. But that being said, we have a lot of things we want to do this season. A lot of stories we want to pay homage to and a lot of characters we want to do right by. So that being said, there's always a world where it's more than the amount that we can turn out in a year. Because we really like having the show out every year. But we are really in the middle of figuring it out. If it's not done in five, it's close to it. But we shall see.


DEADLINE: It feels like the world of Hacks might lend itself to a spin-off — perhaps one focused more squarely on Jimmy and Kayla. Is that kind of thing something you'd entertain, or will your time in this world be done once this show is completed?


DOWNS: We're asked that a lot, and the truth is that we have so many funny scenes for Jimmy and Kayla that don't end up in the show, and we're like, “Well, that's going to be for a different show.” Because there's oftentimes stories that we want to tell with them that there just isn't room for in an ensemble show, especially one that's a character study of this woman, and they really are best served when they dovetail with Deborah and Ava's stories. So you're right. There's certainly a lot of material there, and it would be a lot of fun. I think we would absolutely be open to it, but we haven't been asked to do it. So, you know.


ANIELLO: Start the petition.


DOWNS: We need the Deadline blast. We need the groundswell. 


ANIELLO: And that's up to you.


DEADLINE: Last fall, we broke the news that you have a new HBO series in the works — a comedy called Kansas City Star, starring Kaley Cuoco. When can we expect that? What can you tell us about it? And how are you going to now balance two shows?


ANIELLO: We're very much just concentrating right now on finishing Hacks. It's not something we're juggling really at the same time.


STATSKY: HBO and HBO Max have been such incredible creative partners. Everyone there is just so wonderful and listens to creatives first. Hacks is this thing that exists and it's so important to us, and we're able to focus on that and dedicate ourselves to that. And so while we have things that we're super excited about, including this Kaley show, it's not taking up the majority of our time right now. The majority of our time is Hacks, Hacks, Hacks….and maybe, the Jimmy-Kayla spin-off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Wynonna Judd Looks to Tour for Healing","https://entertainmentnow.com/country-music/wynonna-judd-tour-brings-healing/","Fri, 30 May 2025 15:52:00 GMT","

Country icon Wynonna Judd says for her, touring is a great way to cope with grief.

Wynonna sat down with country singer Clint Black as a guest on his “Talking in Circles” program May 23.

The Country Music Hall of Famer told Black that that's why she went on the planned “The Judds: The Final Tour” solo right after her mother and partner in the Judds committed suicide. 

“Here's the deal, y'all. We have to celebrate the past because it's where we come from but not be defined by it,” she told Black.

“So I'm trying to go back and stop the car, read the map and see where I'm going because I'm making a record right now. But I'm also living in the past, I'm in the present, and singing in the future.”

Wynonna reiterated that the tour celebrated “just how far I've come.” “I got through it. I'm better, not bitter, for all the crap that's happened to me. That's the key.”

“I think you have to get to a place in your life where you realize you're not a victim. And all this crap has happened to me with mom committing suicide last year I had a choice to make.”

“I could either let that define me or give me permission to show everybody and myself that I could do it even in spite of the hellish time period that I went through, that I could still sing. And so I went on tour because those fans bought the tickets and they were there for me.”

A post shared by Academy of Country Music (ACM) (@acmawards)

Now the legendary singer is hoping the fans show up once again as she hits the road for her Wynonna Judd: The Greatest Hits Tour.

The tour ramps up Saturday, June 7 when Wynonna plays the world's largest country music festival, CMA Fest, in Nashville.

The singer says she chose touring rather than choosing to “stay home and complain.” “I'm going to go to work,” she says.

And she's just as eager as her longtime fans to dive back into some of the Judds' most iconic songs.

The red-headed legend rocked the ACM Awards May 8 with a performance of the Judds' hit “Why Not Me.”

While Wynonna Judd has said there's no place she'd rather be these days than on her Tennessee farm raising her 3-year-old granddaughter Kaliyah, she's excited about her upcoming tour.

In a recent Instagram post, Wynonna put up some old pictures of her posing with fans in the 1980's. In the caption, she writes, “Just came across a nostalgic bunch of photos from the 80's shared within our fan club community. Now I can't sleep! Too excited for ACM Awards this week, followed by CMA Fest next month, then the GREATEST HITS TOUR!!! Keep the momentum going, FANmily! 😘”

She'll have 40 more tour stops before wrapping up on October 4 at Ocean City, Maryland's Country Calling Festival. You can find tickets to any of her tour stops here.

Fans who can't get enough of the incredible talent that rose to the top of the heap on “American Idol” season 23 will have one more chance to see many of them together. Many of the top finalists of 2025 will be among the “American Idol” stars taking the stage together in Nashville on June 4. 

The night before CMA Fest begins, 19 Recordings — the record label partner of “American Idol” — will host its annual 19/BMG Takeover concert at 6th & Peabody, including performances by season 23 winner Jamal Roberts, runner-up John Foster, and third place finisher Breanna Nix. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Also appearing at the one-time concert are season 23 finalists Thunderstorm Artis, Gabby Samone, Mattie Pruitt, and Kolbi Jordan. All but Jordan released singles with 19 Recordings on the eve of the May 18 finale. 

The only top 2025 contestant missing from the bunch, many fans noted on social media, is 18-year-old Slater Nalley, who placed in the top five but just signed a management deal with an agency separate from 19 Recordings, potentially precluding him from appearing. 

Other “American Idol” stars scheduled to appear at the concert are season 22's runner-up Will Moseley and finalist Ajii, season 21's third-place finisher Colin Stough and finalist Wé Ani, as well as season 20 runner-up HunterGirl.

All five of those recent finalists have signed deals with 19 Recordings or its parent company, BMG, and are actively releasing new music with the label. Moseley, for instance, released his single “Mechanic” in mid-May and Stough released “White Trash.” 

Meanwhile, season 21's Haven Madison, who just scored her first Top 40 hit with “Castle,” is still signed to BMG but isn't scheduled to appear at the Takeover concert. The same goes for season 19 winner Chayce Beckham, who's currently on tour and will be playing in Delaware on June 4. 

The evening, slated to last from 4 to 8 p.m., will be emceed by Josh Randall, a senior casting producer for “American Idol” and the warmup host for the show's studio audiences. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

In addition to the Nashville Takeover night, many of the “American Idol” alums appearing there are also hitting the road for concerts across the U.S.

Season 23 winner Jamal Roberts will perform a hometown concert in Meridian, Mississippi, on May 31. He has said on social media that his team is plotting out tour dates, but concerts already scheduled include the City Winery in Nashville on August 15 and a fundraiser in Biloxi on September 19. 

His fellow finalists John Foster and Breanna Nix will both make their Grand Ole Opry debuts after the 19/BMG Takeover concert. Nix will appear in the circle on June 5 with artists including Jelly Roll and Steven Curtis Chapman, while Foster will appear on June 7 with multiple country legends including Craig Morgan and Bill Anderson. 

Moseley, meanwhile, has concert dates lined up throughout the summer. Stough has a couple of appearances scheduled for July,

For all its thrilling spycraft and tactile environments, “Andor” has catapulted to the front of the cultural conversation this spring through its depiction of a rousing — and relatable — rebellion. Fans and critics alike have noted the “contemporary politics” in Tony Gilroy‘s Disney+ series, admiring the parallels between galaxies far, far away and our own “world [that's] collapsing under corporate-fueled autocracy” — a forceful sentiment made all the more so by the franchise's relatively tame recent entries.  

One such high point is a scene in which Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) delivers a speech to the Galactic Senate and describes the Empire's recent actions as “genocide.” Featured in Episode 9, “Welcome to the Rebellion,” the moment drew a noticeable reaction when it debuted earlier this month. Many critics applauded Gilroy (and episode writer Dan Gilroy) for having the courage to use a term so often suppressed or denied in real life. That it comes from Mon Mothma, a beloved character who, in the very same speech, also decries the continued manipulation of truth, only emphasizes her choice of language.

At the ATX Television Festival on Thursday, during a panel with “Andor” writer Beau Willimon, Gilroy was asked about including the word and if he thought carefully about using it.

 










“Ultimately, yes,” Gilroy said.

“Can you talk about that decision?,” asked Vulture critic Kathryn VanArendonk, who moderated the panel.

“Pretty effortless,” he said.

Gilroy, who had been verbose and open throughout the rest of the panel, remained pointedly silent after each two-word response.

“You have been doing a lot of press about this show over the last several weeks,” VanArendonk continued. “What has it been like to hear people respond to this show? I assume this is a moment you've been asked about quite a bit.”

“It's really sad how many people can find a place to put this [word] in some place that's meaningful for them,” Gilroy said. “And, you know, I've been allowed to start using the word ‘fascism' the last couple weeks. That's liberating. But I don't think it should be any surprise or even be too slippery or complicated for people to understand the road I have to walk to do all this; to maximize the audience and protect the investment of a really brave [company.]”

“I mean, [for] Disney this is $650 million,” he said. “For 24 episodes, I never took a note. We said ‘Fuck the Empire' in the first season, and they said, ‘Can you please not do that?' … In Season 2, they said, ‘Streaming is dead, we don't have the money we had before,' so we fought hard about money, but they never cleaned anything up. That [freedom] comes with responsibilities.”

 










“But it is sad how many people can find a place to put ‘genocide' into their vocabulary,” he said. “I don't think you need me to say anything else, do you?”

From there, Willimon said it was “heartwarming to hear how many people are inspired” by the scene.

“Rebellions are built on hope, right?,” he said. “And hope is a hard-won thing. You don't wake up in the morning with a bucket full of hope. You have to earn it.”

Willimon added there are “real-life … people on the streets” and “it connects with them, and that's important.”

“Careful,” Gilroy said, before the conversation shifted to a new subject.

Earlier in the panel, Gilroy also discussed another rarity for modern “Star Wars” projects: sex. 

“I worked on ‘Rogue [One]' so I knew what the [permissable] levels of violence were, and actually the rules loosened up considerably,” Gilroy said. “Yeah, we can't have skin, but I very consciously started the first scene in a brothel just to see what would happen and how far we could go. There's sex. … It's something that probably seemed at some point like it was going to be a big anxiety, and it really turned out to be a nothing-burger all the way through.”

It's certainly not nothing for fans still fascinated by Syril (Kyle Soller) and Dedra (Denise Gough), whose “turn out the lights” scene started the conversation about sex in “Star Wars.” But that, in itself, speaks to the power of acknowledging reality onscreen — even in science-fiction.

How far would you go in your fandom of your favorite auteur? For heist comedy “Stealing Pulp Fiction,” cinephiles know no limits…and even plan to break in and take Quentin Tarantino's personal 35mm print of his iconic Oscar-winning film.

“Stealing Pulp Fiction” stars Jon Rudnitsky and Cazzie David as Tarantino superfans who set out to lift the original print of the feature. Karan Soni, Jason Alexander, Taylor Hill, and Oliver Cooper co-star. Danny Turkiewicz makes his directorial debut with the film, which had its world premiere at the Newport Beach Film Festival in October 2024. “Stealing Pulp Fiction” was adapted from Turkiewicz's 2020 short film of the same name.

The logline reads: “‘Stealing Pulp Fiction' follows a group of enterprising wannabes and their eccentric therapist as they concoct a plot to steal Quentin Tarantino's personal 35mm print of his famous 1994 film from his movie theater. What begins as a simple heist quickly spirals into a chaotic misadventure filled with unexpected twists and mishaps.” 

 










Giant Pictures acquired the distribution rights; Giant Pictures is the parent company of Tribeca Films, which is distributing. “'Stealing Pulp Fiction' is an electrifying homage not just to the work of Tarantino but to the history of film in general. Danny Turkiewicz's dazzling and whip-smart vision is a must-see for film buffs and casual moviegoers alike,” Giant Pictures' content acquisitions manager Shayna Weingast said in a statement. “On behalf of the Giant Pictures team, we are thrilled to bring ‘Stealing Pulp Fiction' to movie-loving audiences around the country.”

Director Turkiewicz added, “Giant Pictures has an undeniable love for the history of cinema and a passion for championing new and upcoming directors. They also have a willingness to be creative with distribution strategies that a film like ours could benefit from. I'm excited for audiences to experience the humor and heart that our cast and crew brought to the screen.”

“Stealing Pulp Fiction” is produced by Turkiewicz, Ben Shields Catlin, Becca Standt, Jordan Willcox, Josh Zakaria, Ian Novotny, Dr. Slava Shut, and Chris Barry. It will have a special screening at the Gardena Cinema in Los Angeles with a cast and crew Q&A. The film was shot in part at the theater.

Darren Aronofsky may be preparing to debut his buzzy crime novel adaptation “Caught Stealing” with Austin Butler, but the auteur also has produced another film based on a book coming soon: documentary “Underland.” The film, which will premiere at Tribeca 2025, brings author Robert Macfarlane's nature book of the same name to the big screen.

“Underland” is billed as a “cinematic documentary that voyages into worlds rarely glimpsed by human eyes,” mostly involving underground geological phenomenons. The logline reads: “Beginning in the shallow soils beneath an old ash tree, we travel alongside several ‘astronauts of the underworld' into ancient sacred caves, flooded storm drains, melting glaciers, underwater burial chambers and a deep underground laboratory built to solve the mysteries of the Universe. … We know so little of the world beneath our feet. To most it is a place only of fear and darkness, though to a brave few it is one of knowledge and wonder to be found nowhere else.”

Sandra Hüller narrates the documentary, which is directed by Robert Petit. The feature is from production companies Sandbox Films, Protozoa Pictures, Planet Octopus Studios, and Spring Films. 

 










“When I read Macfarlane's book, I was drawn to the way he told all these specific individual stories but brought in a deeper mythological level to the Underland,” producer Aronofsky told IndieWire. “Rob Petit tells different stories, and is working in cinema not text, but pulls off the same trick of mixing myth with character. It's a doc with a unique voice, unlike any I've ever seen.” 

Petit added, “As a text, Macfarlane's ‘Underland' has an inherent tension: it's a journey that leaves behind the world we know and ventures into the strange and unfamiliar. This very special book shines a light not just on forgotten worlds but on a whole new way of seeing and I wanted to make something that ran with that idea. In terms of cinema, that's a gift. We filmed in locations that were hard to even imagine before embarking on the project: flooded storm drains, impossibly tight cave passages, glacial rivers, abandoned mines and a deep underground science laboratory built to solve the mysteries of the universe. In each of these worlds we encountered the most incredible people – explorers and scientists determined to find wonder in the most unlikely places.”

Author Macfarlane, whose new book “Is A River Alive?” also just reached number 9 on the New York Times bestseller list, cited how long the documentary has been in the works. He cowrote the film with director Petit, too. “‘Underland' has been 4.5 years in the making,” he told IndieWire, “and the team has created something astonishing. It's a documentary film — and one that's experimental in form and tone. It sets both matter and metaphor shivering in strange, powerful ways. It's compassionate and beautiful.” 

 










“Underland” is produced by Aronofsky, Ari Handel, Lauren Greenwood, and Jessica Harrop, with Macfarlane, André Singer, Figs Jackman, Craig Miller, Elizabeth Radshaw, Richard Wolfe, and Keith Potter executive producing. Ruben Woodin Dechamps is the director of photography. 

“Underland” premieres June 5 in Tribeca's Documentary Competition as a sales title. Check out the first look, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

She's going to be Fock-ular? Ariana Grande in her first post-“Wicked” and post-Oscar nomination role has joined the cast of “Meet the Parents 4″ at Universal, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. 

Grande joins Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro, who are returning to the long-running comedy franchise, and Universal has also now set a release date for the film on November 25, 2026, or Thanksgiving week 2026.

John Hamburg, the co-writer of the first three “Meet the Parents” films, wrote the screenplay for “Meet the Parents 4” and will direct the film. Plot details are still being kept under wraps, and the film is officially still untitled.

Blythe Danner and Teri Polo, who also starred in the original trilogy of movies, are also expected to return for the fourth film. 

With a collective $1.13 billion at the box office, the “Meet the Parents” movies date back to 2000 with the film directed by Jay Roach (who is returning as a producer on the fourth film). The original followed Stiller as a man trying to win the affection — or join the “circle of trust” — of his fiancé's (Polo) hard-nosed parents, played by De Niro and Danner, only to find that De Niro is a former CIA agent. That movie was followed by 2004's “Meet the Fockers” and 2010's “Little Fockers.”

 










The fourth film is being produced by Jane Rosenthal and De Niro through Tribeca Productions, Roach through Delirious Media, Stiller and John Lesher through Red Hour Films, and Hamburg through Particular Pictures.

“Meet the Parents 4” is, of course, a reunion between Universal and Grande, as she starred as Glinda in last year's “Wicked” and will return this fall for “Wicked: For Good,” the conclusion to the Broadway musical adaptation. The first film made nearly $800 million at the global box office and got 10 Oscar nominations. “For Good” hits theaters November 21, 2025.

Executive Vice President of Production Development Matt Reilly and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell will oversee the project for the Studio.

Grande is repped by CAA, Good World Management, The Lede Company and Myman Greenspan Fox Rosenberg & Light LLP.

Deadline first reported the news.

Thom Yorke has released a statement about Israel and the war in Gaza. The Radiohead and Smile frontman began his statement by acknowledging the pro-Palestine concertgoer who shouted at him about the war during an Australian show last year. “Some guy shouting at me from the dark last year when I was picking up a guitar to sing the final song alone in front of 9000 people in Melbourne didn't really seem like the best moment to discuss the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza,” Yorke shared. “Afterwards I remained in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity, and I struggled to find an adequate way to respond to this and to carry on with the rest of the shows on the tour.”

Yorke continued by stating his opposition to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government. (Around the time Radiohead last performed in Israel, in 2017, Yorke also made clear his opposition to Netanyahu.) “I think Netanyahu and his crew of extremists are totally out of control and need to be stopped, and that the international community should put all the pressure it can on them to cease,” the musician wrote. “Their excuse of self-defence has long since worn thin and has been replaced by a transparent desire to take control of Gaza and the West Bank permanently.” Additionally, Yorke called the blockade of aid to Gaza “horrific.”

Yorke also condemned Hamas, admonishing the Palestinian Islamist group that governs the Gaza Strip for the October 7, 2023, attacks that precipitated the Israeli military's offensive in the region. “Why did Hamas choose the truly horrific acts of October 7th?” he asked. “The answer seems obvious, and I believe Hamas chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people, in an equally cynical fashion for their own purposes.”

For much of the rest of his note, Yorke discussed the largely online conversations about Israel and Palestine. “I sympathize completely with the desire to ‘do something' when we are witnessing such horrific suffering on our devices every day. It completely makes sense,” he said. “But I now think it is a dangerous illusion to believe reposting, or one or two line messages are meaningful, especially if it is to condemn your fellow human beings. There are unintended consequences.”

The musician also made reference to “those i work with,” likely alluding to his Radiohead and Smile bandmate Jonny Greenwood, who has been a subject of interest with regard to the war in Gaza. Greenwood is married to Sharona Katan, an Israeli artist of Egyptian and Iraqi descent, and he has collaborated closely with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa. The musicians also recently had two UK concerts canceled after pressure from the the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.

Find Thom Yorke's full statement below.

Some guy shouting at me from the dark last year when I was picking up a guitar to sing the final song alone in front of 9000 people in Melbourne didn't really seem like the best moment to discuss the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.

Afterwards I remained in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity, and I struggled to find an adequate way to respond to this and to carry on with the rest of the shows on the tour.

That silence, my attempt to show respect for all those who are suffering and those who have died, and to not trivialize it in a few words, has allowed other opportunistic groups to use intimidation and defamation to fill in the blanks, and I regret giving them this chance. This has had a heavy toll on my mental health.

I would hope that for anyone who has ever listened to a note of the music of my band or any of the music i have created over the years, or looked at the artwork or read any of the lyrics, it would be self-evident that I could not possibly support any form of extremism or dehumanization of others. All i see in a lifetime's worth of work with my fellow musicians and artists is pushing against such things, trying to create work that goes beyond what it means to be controlled, coerced, threatened, to suffer, to be intimidated .. and instead to encourage critical thinking beyond borders, the commonality of love and experience and free creative expression.

Sounds naff … but true.

For others let me fill in the blanks now, so we're nice and clear.

I think Netanyahu and his crew of extremists are totally out of control and need to be stopped, and that the international community should put all the pressure it can on them to cease. Their excuse of self-defence has long since worn thin and has been replaced by a transparent desire to take control of Gaza and the West Bank permanently.

I believe this ultra-nationalist administration has hidden itself behind a terrified & grieving people and used them to deflect any criticism, using that fear and grief to further their ultra-nationalist agenda with terrible consequences, as we see now with the horrific blockade of aid to Gaza.

While our lives tick along as normal these endless thousands of innocent human souls are still being expelled from the earth… for what?

At the same time the unquestioning Free Palestine refrain that surrounds us all does not answer the simple question of why the hostages have still not all been returned? For what possible reason?

Why did Hamas choose the truly horrific acts of October 7th? The answer seems obvious, and I believe Hamas chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people, in an equally cynical fashion for their own purposes.

I also think there is a further and extremely important point to make.

Social media witch-hunts (nothing new) on either side pressurizing artists and whoever they feel like that week to make statements etc do very little except heighten tension, fear and over-simplification of what are complex problems that merit proper face to face debate by people who genuinely wish the killing to stop and an understanding to be found.

This kind of deliberate polarization does not serve our fellow human beings and perpetuates a constant ‘us and them' mentality. It destroys hope and maintains a sense of isolation, the very things that extremists use to maintain their position. We facilitate their hiding in plain sight if we assume that the extremists and the people they claim to represent are one and the same, indivisible.

If our world is ever able to move on from these dark times and find peace it will only be when we rediscover what we share in common, and the extremists are sent back to sit in the darkness from whence they came.

I sympathize completely with the desire to ‘do something' when we are witnessing such horrific suffering on our devices every day. It completely makes sense. But I now think it is a dangerous illusion to believe reposting, or one or two line messages are meaningful, especially if it is to condemn your fellow human beings. There are unintended consequences.

It is shouting from the darkness. It is not looking people in the eye when you speak. It is making dangerous assumptions. It is not debate and it is not critical thinking.

Importantly, it is open to online manipulation of all kinds, both mechanistic and political.

What is the alternative? I can't answer that easily. I do know in communities around the globe this subject is now dangerously toxic and we are in uncharted waters. We need to turn back.

I am sure that, to this point, what I have written here will in no way satisfy those who choose to target myself or those i work with, they will spend time picking holes and looking for reasons to continue, we are an opportunity not to be missed, no doubt, and by either side.

I have written this in the simple hope that i can join with the many millions of others praying for this suffering, isolation and death to stop, praying that we can collectively regain our humanity and dignity and our ability to reach understanding .. that one day soon this darkness will have passed.

Thom Yorke

“Who said being sad is not a crime?” Shura asks on I Got Too Sad for My Friends. Regardless of the phrase's origins, the English singer-songwriter seems blithely unafraid of any carceral ramifications. In the album's opening song, she relays “crying in the backseat of a taxi in Tokyo”; later, she's “out here in America/And I'm so sad that I am.” She wonders if “maybe I got too sad for my friends,” then, on the very next song, comes to a conclusion: “I got too down around my friends.” Occasionally, she looks on the bright side: “If I die,” she sings, “at least I don't have to pick out a shirt to wear.” (And though she likely meant the question rhetorically: For the record, it was Arthur Russell.)

Perhaps it wouldn't surprise you, then, to learn that Shura wrote her third album in the midst of a mid-pandemic bout of depression and anxiety: stuck at home after a canceled tour, isolated from family and friends. Nearly all the songs on I Got Too Sad for My Friends wallow in these particular doldrums. She's no stranger to an album-length emotional throughline; her debut, Nothing's Real, focused squarely on romantic yearning, and its follow-up, forevher, traced the head rush of new love. And while I Got Too Sad's emotional tenor can occasionally feel one-note, its warm, lush sound offers a counterbalance to its gloomy lyrics.

Shura filled her previous two albums with bubbly synth pop, and some of that style carries over here: “World's Worst Girlfriend” and “Recognise” are awash in '80s-inspired shimmery synths and dramatic gated drums. But mostly, the album sounds earthier; dotted with woodwinds, keys, and organ, it leans more towards chamber pop than psychedelic dancefloor bops. “Leonard Street” is buoyed by a sauntering bassline and plucky keys; “America” is led by a gentle, wandering clarinet; on “I Wanna Be Loved by You,” a singalong choir of friends joins Shura on the chorus. She has retained, too, her ear for detailed production—consider the synth squiggles on “Online” or the layered harmonies of “Tokyo”—giving the record a rich, lively sound. The mature palette suits the reflective tone, though the overall atmosphere can start to feel a little too mood-stabilized, even when, in the album's second half, she dips into groovy soft rock.

On the album's cover, Shura sports armor, like a knight fending off the small army of illustrated goblins that surround her. The lyrics aren't brash or defensive, though; they're pensive and unguarded—often straightforwardly so, circling the same themes of isolation and depression. She mentions anger in the elegant, synth-led “Online” and the funk-lite ballad “I Wanna Be Loved by You,” but each time, the emotion is blown away on the song's gentle breeze; there's no outburst, no heat, as Shura's voice barely rises above a whisper. When Cassandra Jenkins and Helado Negro—heroes of this strand of cosmic, contemplative melancholia—show up on a couple tracks, they serve as unfortunate benchmarks of the introspective depths Shura doesn't quite reach. Being sad isn't a crime—but, on its own, it's not an entirely thrilling muse, either.

When Shura embraces a sense of humor, the album gets a much-needed lift. She's called “World's Worst Girlfriend” a performance of “peak dramatic gay,” and its buoyant production and punchy chorus ride delightfully close to corny; when she croons “fuck my life” in the middle eight, she laughs off the brooding sad-girl stereotype. On “Bad Kid,” when she and Nashville singer-songwriter Becca Mancari consider that dying would at least wipe away the burden of choosing a shirt, she similarly toes the line between committing to self-seriousness and playfully rolling her eyes at herself. At its best, I Got Too Sad doesn't just offer a clichéd reminder that it's OK to cry; it suggests that looking closely at any one emotion can be a means of letting more light in.

Grills, guitars, Auto-Tune, CS:GO gameplay footage, Wisp, flashing lights, shooting guns, skeletons, scuzzy CCTV shots. In the overstimulating music video for “I Heard You,” nu-gaze and SoundCloud rap congeal into an onslaught of digital debris, like an A24 take on corecore. The mastermind is Max Epstein, a Los Angeles workaholic whose rap sheet—live guitar for Jane Remover and quannnic, production for post-emo prodigies like daine and Blair—often outshines his own feverish output. But within the vast sprawl of his collaborations, his spunky solo catalog feels like a buried treasure. His latest and lengthiest LP, the 18-track I look at her and light goes all through me, is equal parts guitar album and producer tape: feature-flecked, genre-agnostic, scattered, and sincere. Across 30-odd searing minutes, Epstein synthesizes his impulses, allowing his frenzied vision free rein. The result is a delightfully dizzying collage, not unlike the “I Heard You” music video: shards of inchoate ideas, cascading until the clamor becomes cathartic.

Busy as Epstein is, I look at her scans as a document of his downtime: hours spent fiddling with old demos, jamming on tour buses, dreaming on studio floors. He pays the bills by nudging peers towards their voices, but his back-catalog betrays a years-long struggle to find his own. His earliest releases as Photographic Memory, which date back to 2014, brim with hazy slowcore, like a (very) low-budget take on Duster. As his footprint expanded, his sound followed suit: Everything Nice, his 2018 mixtape, compiled fleeting bedroom demos; 2021's eponymous LP sported a fuller feel, though without shedding his early sadness-soup songcraft. (Arpeggios! Auto-Tune! Abjection!) It's bad practice to judge an album by its cover, but his aesthetic identity has long suggested the subtlety of a peripheral figure. Take the album art for said eponymous LP, a dusky, out-of-focus take on Either/Or. Intentional or not, the allusion is telling of its contents: a young guitarist shrouded in the shadows of his peers and influences.

But I look at her is not the triumphant, swaggering comeback album in which the reclusive unsung hero finally roars. And this isn't at all bad. Epstein has managed to distill his defining qualities—production prowess, spotlight aversion, frenetic collaboration—into a vivid snapshot of digital music in 2025, when producer tags, power chords, live instruments and Ableton plugins coexist in chaotic harmony. Perhaps the most effective voice for Photographic Memory is that of the auteur, the half-visible center of an immersive experience. Fittingly, the most brilliant moment on this project is not a solo track, but “Heartsyle,” a glistening single in which Wisp flits over an Epstein-produced plugg beat. It is disarmingly odd; like much of I look at her, it basks in the strange collisions forged by an amorphous, oversaturated era. I laughed the first time I heard “Recently,” in which Gucci Mane raps “Woppenheimer” over what sounds like a scrapped Tired of Tomorrow demo. The next time I played it, I realized that it was really, really beautiful.

Beautiful, too, is Epstein's voice, which sounds stronger here than it ever has. While his vocal timbre—something like a lonely, androgynous android—has remained relatively consistent over the past few years, the textures on I look at her grant it more room to command. Digi-rock epic “Clearly” is a loud-quiet-loud stomper, all twinkling synth stabs, soft acoustic pluckage, and the occasional pulsating kick. At certain points, it risks scanning as a Snow Strippers remix of “Fireflies.” But what rescues the song from its potential pitfalls—overstimulation and ennui—is the push-and-pull between Epstein's voice and production, a complex soundscape braved by a careful, somewhat childlike protagonist. Regardless of your definition of “nu-gaze” (“new shoegaze” or “shoegaze à la nu-metal”), there's something on this record for members of all sects: compare the glitchy pathos of “Emo Tour Track” to the growling thrash of “Love in My Heart.” Epstein the singer is undergirded by Epstein the producer, who is undergirded by Epstein the curator. When these multiple selves converge here, their handiwork is the strongest proof yet of his singular vision.

Taylor Swift has bought back her master recordings. She made the announcement with a note on her website, sharing happily, “All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me.” It's the first time she has every owned the rights to all of her own music. Find the full statement below.

Infamously, in 2019, Scooter Braun's media holding company, Ithaca Holdings LLC, acquired Big Machine Label Group. With that acquisition came the rights to Swift's first six studio albums. Swift denounced the acquisition and criticized Braun and his “bullying.” She also said, “Scooter has stripped me of my life's work, that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.” (In a new statement, regarding Swift's acquisition of her masters, Braun said, “I am happy for her.”)

Following the acquisition, Swift—who left Big Machine Label Group in 2018 to sign a deal with Universal Music Group—pledged to re-record her albums so that she could own the new master recordings. She made it two-thirds of the way through, releasing new editions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989. According to her announcement, she finished the new version of her self-titled debut, but is not yet sure when it could be released. She also said she did not yet finish re-recording Reputation—a re-recorded album that was widely expected to come out soon due to her previewing of “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version).”

Before Swift released any of her Taylor's Version albums, however, Braun and his company sold the musician's masters to the Los Angeles investment firm Shamrock Capitol. At the time of the acquisition, Shamrock said, “Taylor Swift is a transcendent artist with a timeless catalog. We made this investment because we believe in the immense value and opportunity that comes with her work.”

In her statement today, Swift thanked “everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful.”

Hi.

I'm trying to gather my thoughts into something coherent, but right now my mind is just a slideshow. A flashback sequence of all the times I daydreamed about, wished for, and pined away fro a chance to get to tell you this news. All the times I was thiiiiiiiiiiiis close, reaching out for it, only for it to fall through. I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that's all in the past now. I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening. I really get to say these words.

All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me.

And all my music videos.All the concert films.The album art and photography.The unreleased songs.The memories.The magic.The madness.Every single era.My entire life's work.

To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it. To my fans, you know how important this has been to me - so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released 4 of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version. The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music. I can't thank you enough for helping me to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.

All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy. I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.

I know, I know. What about Rep TV? Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off. There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch. I've completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness or longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.

I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans. Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You've never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here.

Thanks to you and yoru goodwill, teamwork, and encouragement, the best things that have ever been mine… finally actually are.

Elated and amazed,

Taylor

Elon Musk's use of ketamine was so intense during the 2024 campaign that he complained it was negatively affecting his bladder function, according to a New York Times report detailing the billionaire's drug use as he joined President Donald Trump's circle last year. 


	The Times paints a picture of a man caught in an erratic cycle of substance abuse and family drama. While Musk has previously spoken of using ketamine as a scheduled prescription treatment for depression, sources who spoke to the Times say his use of the anesthetic was frequent — almost daily —and regularly in combination with other drugs while in the throes of campaign season. The billionaire also took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms as he campaigned for Trump, and traveled with a box of daily medication, including Adderall, according to a photo obtained by the Times.


	It's unknown whether Musk's drug use continued into his time leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)'s teardown of the federal government, although he exhibited erratic behavior throughout his time in the White House.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Musk's ketamine use reportedly became so chronic last year that he began to experience some of the negative side effects of frequent consumption: namely, complaining of issues with his bladder. 


	Studies have shown that frequent recreational ketamine use can lead to a condition known as “ketamine-induced cystitis,” or inflammation of the bladder and urinary tract. A report published by the National Institute of Health states that “common KIC-related problems are urinary pain and discomfort, bladder epithelial barrier damage, reduced bladder storage and increased pressure, ureter stenosis, and kidney failure.” 

	











	“Furthermore, it becomes a vicious cycle when KIC patients attempt to manage their urinary pain with increased ketamine use,” the study adds. 


	Speculation about the extent of Musk's drug use, and its effects on the management of his various companies as well as his foray into the federal government, has existed for some time now. Last year, The Wall Street Journal spoke to various sources within and around Musk's companies who expressed concerns that the mogul's regular drug use was not only a major liability to his businesses, but could spiral into a full-blown health crisis.

	In the year and change since the Journal's report, Musk's personal and corporate life have only become more erratic.

According to the Times, the musical artist Grimes, who is mother to three of Musk's children, privately indicated that she feared for the safety of her son X Æ A-12 (X), who is frequently seen in the public eye alongside Musk in what Grimes says is a violation of their custody agreement. Grimes reportedly expressed concerns that the five-year-old's health was being affected by the long travel and irregular sleep schedule. 


	Today, Musk will officially step back from his role as de facto head of DOGE. Publicly, the departure is being attributed to the expiration of Musk's authorization as a special government employee. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that executives at Tesla considered replacing Musk as his plummeting popularity and reckless government tenure continued to harm the company's stock valuation, and led to widespread national protests against the electric-vehicle manufacturer.

	Sen. Joni Ernst is encouraging her constituents to think big-picture about the Medicaid cuts in the “big, beautiful” bill President Donald Trump and House Republicans passed last week.


	The Iowa Republican tried to justify the cuts — which are expected to kick at least 10 million people off the health care program — during a town hall event today, an attendee appeared to yell out: “People are going to die!”


	Ernst began to respond but then stopped herself, exasperated.


	“Well, we all are going to die,” she said, smirking as the audience jeered.


	Republicans have been struggling to justify the tax bill's cuts to Medicaid and other social services, which are wildly unpopular. GOP lawmakers have been arguing that the millions of Americans who are expected to lose health care over the cuts are undeserving and are abusing the system. 


	“It's corrections of overpayments and of people who have not been eligible for these programs, by law as it is currently written,” Ernst said before her constituent pointed out that people will die. “When you are arguing about illegals who are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million, they are no eligible, so they will be coming off.”

	











	This is total bullshit.


	Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) pointed out while arguing against the bill last week that of the millions of Americans projected to lose coverage because of the “big, beautiful” bill, exactly zero are undocumented, as undocumented immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid. The tax bill does, however, cut federal Medicaid funding to states that use their own funds to provide care for undocumented immigrants. The cuts, which will affect millions of vulnerable American citizens, are in service of giving the wealthiest Americans a tax break.

	Ernst continued to claim that Republicans are looking out for the less fortunate, though. “Listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those that are most vulnerable,” she said in response to her constituents booing her. “Those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, we will protect. We will protect them, OK? Medicaid is extremely important here in the state of Iowa.”


	It's becoming increasingly clear that Americans are starting to see through the lies Republican lawmakers are pushing about their legislation to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor.

	Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's police commissioner on Sept. 11 and later pleaded guilty to federal corruption and tax crimes, died on Thursday at the age of 69.


	FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Kerik's death “after a private battle with illness,” and praised Kerik as “a warrior, a patriot, and one of the most courageous public servants this country has ever known.”


	“With over forty years of service in law enforcement and national security, he dedicated his life to protecting the American people. As the 40th Police Commissioner of New York City, Bernie led with strength and resolve in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, guiding the NYPD through one of the darkest chapters in our nation's history,” said Patel in his statement shared to social media. “Rest easy, Commissioner. Your watch has ended, but your impact will never fade.”


	The New York Police Department also mourned Kerik's death and looked back at his impact following the attacks on the World Trader Center: “For nearly two decades, Kerik served and protected New Yorkers in the NYPD, including helping rebuild the city in the aftermath of 9/11.”

	











	Kerik and former New York City Mayor Rudy W. Giuliani were both hailed for their response to the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001.

	In 2004, he was nominated by then-President George W. Bush to head the Department of Homeland Security. He withdrew one week later, stating that his employment of an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter and failure to pay payroll taxes as a reason for his withdrawal.

	











	In 2008, Kerik pled guilty to eight felonies, including two counts of tax fraud, one count of making a false statement on a loan application, and five counts of making false statements to the federal government while being reviewed for senior positions, according to The New York Times. He spent three years in federal prison and was later pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020.

	The Trump administration has plans to turn the idea of “remigration” — a term associated with the far-right in Europe and the forced removal of all immigrants back to their native countries — into an official federal office that will be dedicated to escalating deportations across the United States.


	In a move to follow through with President Donald Trump‘s vow to lead the “largest” mass deportation operation in American history, his administration proposed the creation of an Office of Remigration, which will be a “hub for immigration issues and repatriation tracking.”


	The plan was detailed in a more than 100-page notification sent by the State Department to six Congressional committees, outlining its intentions to make widespread changes, including reducing immigration, the closure and restructuring of offices, and staff firings at its Washington, D.C., headquarters, according to CNN, which obtained a copy of the document.


	Per the outlet, the notification states that the Office of Remigration “will provide a policy platform for interagency coordination with DHS and other agencies on removals/repatriations, and for intra-agency policy work to advance the President's immigration agenda.” State Department funds will be used to “intra-agency policy work to advance the President's immigration agenda” and will use State Department funds to “actively facilitate the voluntary return of migrants to their country of origin or legal status.”

	Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the State Department's proposal in April. “The plan submitted to Congress was the result of thoughtful and deliberative work by senior Department leadership,” Rubio said in a statement. “We have taken into account feedback from lawmakers, bureaus, and long-serving employees. The reorganization plan will result in a more agile Department, better equipped to promote America's interests and keep Americans safe across the world.”

	











	The department's plan also calls for the elimination of most of the Democracy, Human Rights and Labor bureau's regional offices, according to Reuters. Rubio proposed appointing a new deputy assistant secretary who would oversee a new Office of Natural Rights to “build the foundation for criticisms of free speech backsliding in Europe and other developed nations.”

	According to CNN, the document also confirmed earlier reporting that a majority of the disaster relief work by the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, would be absorbed into the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. The decision has been denounced, following devastating cuts to USAID by billionaire Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which threaten to leave the world's most vulnerable people without access to life-saving supplies of food, clean water, and medicine.


	It's a testament to Trump and his administration's obsession with deporting migrants, around which they are focusing an obscene amount of federal resources. Stephen Miller, the White House adviser and fervent immigration hawk, reportedly yelled at top immigration officials earlier this month because they weren't deporting enough people, and on Thursday the administration shook up the leadership of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) .


	Miller posted ahead of the election last year about “remigration,” writing on X: “THE TRUMP PLAN TO END THE INVASION OF SMALL TOWN AMERICA: REMIGRATION!”

Miley Cyrus has dropped a show biz-themed music video for her song “Easy Lover.” The clip, directed by Cyrus, Jacob Bixenman, and Brendan Walter, arrived alongside Cyrus' new album, Something Beautiful. 


	In the video, Cyrus arrives in a dressing room, where she dons a costume and has her hair and makeup done. She struts across a film studio backlot to one of the stages, where she dances alongside a group of back-up dancers in true showgirl style. 


	The song sees Cyrus reflecting on a difficult relationship: “You got the love I always needed/ Tie me to horses and I still wouldn't leave ya/ But you're not an easy lover.”


Something Beautiful, Cyrus' ninth album, arrives ahead of the premiere of its accompanying short film, which is set to debut on June 6 at the Tribeca Film Festival before it hits theaters nationwide on June 12. The was directed by Cyrus with Bixenman and Walter, the same team responsible for the “Easy Lover” video (hint hint). A synopsis describes it as “a unique visual experience… including 13 original songs from the upcoming album. A one-of-a-kind pop opera from the mind of Miley Cyrus.”

Taylor Swift has regained control of her recorded music catalog six years after her old label, Big Machine Label Group, sold it to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. The singer announced the purchase in a lengthy letter, writing, “All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me.“


	Swift announced the news this morning with a note to fans on her website, as well as a handful of photos on Instagram showing her with vinyl copies of her original records. “You belong with me,” she captioned the post.


	The deal, as Swift wrote, covers not just the rights to her music, including unreleased tunes, but all of her music videos, concert films, album art, photography, and unreleased songs. And there are, of course, equally meaningful, more ephemeral aspects of the deal: “The memories. The magic. The madness,” Swift wrote. “Every single era. My entire life's work.”


	It's unclear how much the deal is worth, but a source tells Rolling Stone that a previously reported price range of close to $600 million, which emerged when rumors of the sale first started circulating, was “highly inaccurate.”

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)


	In her letter, Swift said that calling regaining control over her catalog her “greatest dream come true” was “actually being pretty reserved about it.” She thanked her fans for all their support, suggesting that the massive success of the Eras Tour and efforts to rerecord her old albums made it possible for her to buy back her music. 

	











	“I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but never owned until now,” she wrote. “All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.”


	Swift went on to say that she was grateful to Shamrock Capital — which has owned the rights to her catalog since 2020 — for “being the first people to ever offer this to me,” saying their handling of the deal was “honest, fair, and respectful.”

	A source close to the contract negotiations also pushed back against what was described as a “previous false report” that there was an “outside party” — Braun — who was encouraging the sale back to Swift. “All rightful credit for this opportunity should go to the partners at Shamrock Holdings and Taylor's Nashville-based management team only,” the source said. “Taylor now owns all of her music, and this moment finally happened in spite of Scooter Braun, not because of him.”


	Braun, in a statement shared with Rolling Stone, said, “I am happy for her.”


	Ithaca's 2019 acquisition of Big Machine launched one of the most fascinating music industry sagas in recent years. While Big Machine owned the rights to music by an array of top country acts (Reba McEntire, Midland, and Sugarland, to name a few), Swift's first six albums were arguably the crown jewels, and a major reason the sale was valued at around $300 million. 


	By the time Ithaca acquired Big Machine in summer 2019, Swift had already left the label and signed with Universal Music Group (the deal included provisions that would allow her to retain control of her master recordings). As Swift wrote in a blog post at the time, she was aware that, after leaving Big Machine, CEO Scott Borchetta was likely to sell the label — but she never expected Braun to be the buyer.


	In that same post, Swift highlighted her contentious history with Braun, largely via his work with her longtime foe, Kanye West. She claimed, for instance, that Braun got West and Justin Bieber “to bully” her online amid the fracas over the leaked phone call regarding a lyric about Swift in West's song “Famous.”

	Swift said she was “sad and grossed out” over the deal, and claimed that any time Borchetta heard her speak Braun's name, “it was when I was either crying or trying not to.” 

	











	On top of all that, though, was Swift's desire to simply own the rights to her catalog. “For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work,” she wrote. “Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past.”


	Within a few months of the sale, Swift began teasing her ambitious response: She would rerecord her first six albums, thereby reclaiming some control over the music, while ostensibly diluting the value of the original recordings. In 2021, she launched her Taylor's Version campaign with rerecords of Fearless and Red, both of which were followed in 2023 by Speak Now and 1989. (Along with new versions of the original albums, the projects also included an array of previously unreleased tunes now known as “vault tracks,” which were also rerecorded.)


	As for the future of that project, Swift said in her letter today that her 2006 self-titled debut has been “completely re-recorded,” adding, “I really love how it sounds now.” But her rerecord of 2017's Reputation is far from complete — “I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it” — and Swift admitted she wasn't sure if she would ever finish it. 


	“The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it,” she said. “All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.” 


	Swift went on to say she may share the unreleased Reputation “vault tracks” at some point, but didn't give any release details. Nor did she share when the rerecord of Taylor Swift would see the light of day.


	“Those 2 albums can still have their moments to reemerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about,” she said. “But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”


	Before Swift had originally begun the rerecord project though, her catalog changed hands again. Just over a year after the Big Machine acquisition, Braun's Ithaca Holdings sold Swift's catalog to Shamrock Capital in a deal reportedly worth over $300 million. Prior to that sale, Swift revealed, she'd been trying to get back control of her masters, but claimed that Braun's team was, as part of the deal, demanding she sign “an ironclad NDA” that would prevent her from speaking negatively about him. Swift also said she considered partnering with Shamrock until she found out that the deal terms would still result in Braun profiting off her old recordings for “a very long time.”

	











	Braun, for his part, later expressed some regret over his handling of the Big Machine acquisition and Swift catalog sale. In a 2022 interview on NPR's The Limits podcast, he admitted to coming from “a place of arrogance,” assuming that he and Swift could work things out. “The regret I have there is that I made the assumption that everyone, once the deal was done, was going to have a conversation with me, see my intent, see my character and say, great, let's be in business together,” he said. “And I made that assumption with people that I didn't know.”


	Swift concluded her note today by mentioning a massive positive that has come from this saga: The attention it's brought to the hurdles that artists face in trying to control and own their creative output.

	“Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this flight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen,” Swift wrote. “Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for brand discussion. You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Fighter pilots feared going public after 'incredible' UFO sighting","https://www.the-express.com/news/weird-news/173295/ufo-sighting-raf-pilots","Fri, 30 May 2025 02:43:00 GMT","



Fighter pilots have reportedly experienced close encounters with UFOs, but they remain tight-lipped due to fear of repercussions.

Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee claims that after being approached by British RAF pilots with UFO sightings akin to those of their U.S. colleagues, he realized the stark absence of whistleblower protections in the U.K. that would enable them to speak out.

Consequently, these incidents go unreported, and the public remains uninformed, unlike in America where pilots can disclose their experiences mostly without consequence.

To battle this silence, Lee has established an advocacy group named UFO Disclosure U.K. to push for the declassification of Britain's X-Files.

He went as far as reaching out to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in pursuit of legislation similar to that in the U.S. which would shield military members from backlash when recounting their unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) episodes.



""We have military pilots who have had real life encounters with UAPs,"" Lee exclusively told the Daily Star, the Daily Express US's sister brand.

In his dialogue with them, he said, ""I have spoken to them. What they say is incredible.""

These individuals are willing to share their accounts anonymously. However, the fear of what might happen if they come forward publicly hangs over them. ""But they fear the consequences if they were to go on the record,"" they said.

It's not just pilots, other military staff and even police officers have stories to tell. Mark said, ""We also have accounts from other military personnel and police who want to come forward. But they all fear what will happen to them if they do.""

The consequences they dread are serious, from losing jobs to facing ridicule or demotion, and potentially even legal action. ""Will they be fired, ridiculed, demoted - even prosecuted - for speaking out? These are their fears.""

And there's more at stake than their careers – family wellbeing is also a concern. ""What will happen to their families?"" he asks.

""It's frustrating because unless someone goes on the record, puts their name - and potentially rank - to an event it is impossible to judge and difficult to properly investigate. The result is the British public is being kept in the dark.

""Information about extraordinary events is being withheld from them. These encounters could amount to threats to national security - certainly sightings of mystery craft near military bases and personnel must fall into that category.

""But until pilots feel free to speak out without fearing they will be grounded the country is burying its head in the sand.""

David Grusch, a former Afghanistan combat veteran and U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, made a shocking unfounded claim in his statement to Congress, stating the U.S. government had recovered extraterrestrial entities and debris from ten UFO crashes. He alleged that officials had been ordered to secretly reverse-engineer this alien technology to aid the U.S. in the global arms race.

Grusch, without evidence, asserted that he had interviewed at least 40 witnesses involved in these covert operations

Earlier this month, Jon Kosloski, the head of the US Government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which is conducting the investigations, confessed that about 2% - roughly 36 - of the cases were ""perplexing"" and remained entirely unexplained, stating: ""I don't think we're alone.""

In his letter to Starmer, Lee, whose documentary on the Royal Family's interest in UFOs has gained worldwide attention, he encouraged him to follow the US Government's disclosure process.

""Decorated military pilots are giving testimony under oath that they have encountered craft of unknown origin beyond our current technological capabilities,'' he stated.

""The U.S. Congress is seeking to provide protection to whistleblowers who go public when it's seen to be in the greater national/public interest. We formally call on you to provide the same protection to whistleblowers and witnesses.

""We have many people in the U.K. military and police service who want to come forward publicly but are afraid of the repercussions to themselves, their family and their careers.""

""We will happily meet with your advisors to furnish them with the evidence we have collected.""

If there's something strange in your neighborhood — a bump in the night, a voice in the wind or a spirit in your closet, you might want to call Boston Paranormal Investigators. 

New England is no stranger to the paranormal, with hundreds of preserved historical sites and accounts of hauntings stretching back centuries. For most, these stories are a source of frightening entertainment or morbid curiosity, but the Boston Paranormal Investigators, or BPI, see these cases as opportunities for discovery. 

BPI doesn't charge for private investigations and isn't promoting a radio or TV show; they are gathering research on the afterlife. 

Barry Corbett, a former BPI lead investigator, said that 80-90% of the spirits they encounter in their historic and private cases are “completely harmless, just stuck between two worlds,” unlike poltergeists and demons as depicted on TV and in movies. Corbett's lifelong fascination with the paranormal led him to write and publish “The Boston Paranormal Archives” in 2024, which highlights several haunted New England locations.

“The fact that we can get evidence, someone's voice on a recorder that was once alive, to me, that tells me that the soul exists and is real, and we go on when we die, so that's a big deal to me,” Corbett said. 

In April, the group visited the Jeremiah Lee Mansion in Marblehead, Mass., a revolution-era estate that has been the scene of several otherworldly sightings and phenomena, according to Corbett's 2024 novel. 

“This was the home of someone who we like to call the forgotten revolutionary Jeremiah Lee,” said Associate Director of the Marblehead Museum Jarrett Zeman. 

Lee was the wealthiest merchant in Massachusetts right before the American Revolution. He fought alongside Samuel Adams and John Hancock and used his vast shipping empire to smuggle cannons and weapons to support the war. 

“Unfortunately, he never got to see the revolution happen. He died right after the battle of Lexington and Concord of a cold he caught right as that battle was happening,” Zeman said.  

The museum preserves the estate as it was when it was first built in 1768. In some rooms, it pays homage to the later history of the building, like when it was a bank and family residence. 

During its time as a museum, visitors and staff have witnessed multiple otherworldly happenings, including when a little boy on a tour saw a female ghost walk through the wall, Corbett said. 

“The poor kid was so scared, he ran out of the building yelling down the street,” Corbett said. 

On another occasion, a tour guide on the second floor claims to have seen a spirit in colonial garb on the second floor. 

BPI has been to the Lee Mansion three times before the April investigation, conducting research and doing public demonstrations. During one of its sessions, the group caught a whisper on the digital recorders, and one member said they felt something poke the back of their head. 

In his eight years with the group, Corbett has been to around 150 haunted sites.

“We get a lot of voices, EVPs – electronic voice phenomena,” Corbett said. “We've heard knocking sounds; some of us in the group have seen physical manifestations before — I haven't, but a spirit did walk through me twice, and that's something to experience. It felt like electricity going through your body.” 

BPI uses a variety of gadgets to capture this ghostly evidence, including infrared camcorders, voice recorders, motion-activated trail cameras and regular iPhone cameras, trying to cover and monitor each room of a haunted site. 

They also employ REM pods, which detect changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields, as  well as laser grids — devices that highlight movements and disruptions — and movement-activated cat toys in an effort to give spirits as many avenues as possible for interworldly communication. 

The group had three hours to conduct its investigation at the Lee Mansion, meaning BPI investigators had to quickly assemble their equipment in each room and gather in the lobby to begin the session. 

In each ornately-decorated room, the group attempted to coax out a spirit. 

“We have cameras in quite a few of the rooms here, and we're hoping to catch an image of you. I can see why you might be camera shy, but we would sure love to see you,” Corbett said. “It's easy to communicate with us just by touching one of these, you don't have to touch it. None of these things can hurt you, they're just tools we use to alert us to your presence.” 

As the storm outside beat the trees and shook the windows, the investigators spitballed Ouija board-style questions, asking spirits if they're present, why they remained and to share their story. That night, the house mostly remained quiet, except for some unaccounted for knocks and creaks. 

The investigators made their way through the mansion and upstairs to a dark 19th-century nursery filled with antique baby rockers and eerie paintings of children. 

“This room is set up to represent bank families that lived in this house when it was a bank in the 19th century, and along the walls are what we call postmortem portraits,” Zeman said. 

If a child died at a young age, before their parents were able to get them photographed, they would have a painting done instead. These paintings were hung in a mourning family's parlor and often had ominous symbols indicating the child was dead or how they died. 

“We're hoping to use the white noise between stations to catch a ghostly voice,” Corbett said. 

The BPI employed the Estes Method, using a SB7 “spirit box,” which sweeps rapidly through radio frequencies. 

“It's like spinning a radio dial up and down. So it's sweeping so fast that it's going to be unusual for you to get a whole word or a sentence,” Corbett said. 

While BPI Investigator Brianne “Bree” Hantzis listens to the spirit box with over-ear headphones, other members of the group ask questions to try to break the ice with a lingering spirit. Hantzis sits on the floor, intently listening for any messages from beyond. 

“If we ask them something and she gives us an answer that makes sense, then we know it probably came from somewhere else,” Hantzis said.  

“Are there spirits in the room with us? Can you give me a name?” Corbett said. 

“Female voice, ‘Annie,'” Hantzis said. 

“Thank you. All right, we asked for a name, and she gave us a name. That's wonderful, Annie. It's nice to meet you,” Corbett said. 

Hantzis said she also heard a male voice say “Go away,” to which Corbett assured that they would leave soon but had gotten permission to be there. 

“Annie, are you still here? Bree is the one sitting on the floor listening to the device that helps us–”

“I just had a female voice say, ‘Hey Bree,'” Hantzis said.

“No kidding. Are you serious?” Corbett said. “Oh, that's really good – thanks so much, Annie, that's excellent.” 

Corbett smiled as he scanned the room with his thermal camera. 

“We do love what we do. It's what we're addicted to — it's fun,” Corbett said. 

Corbett was originally brought into the group by founder Tom Elliott, who started BPI in 2006. Since Corbett stepped down as lead investigator in 2023, Laura Giuliano has been leading the crew of about a dozen investigators. 

Hantzis brought her sister, Arlyssa LaPorte, along for the investigation, who is on the fence about the supernatural but loves reading about history and historical sites. Both sisters have a background in science – Hantzis has a degree in marine biology and works in biotechnology, and LaPorte is a biotechnology teacher at Essex North Shore Agricultural and Technical School. 

“From a science standpoint, how do we capture that? It's all about data,” Hantzis said. “If you can go back to the same locations over and over and over and over again and layer it with as many different cameras and capture as much evidence as you can — all those bits of evidence can be aggregated into a set of data that you can look at and try to look for trends.”

BPI returned to the Lee Mansion for a fourth time May 17 for a public event, where they showed a slideshow, took people around the mansion, trained them to use their ghost detection gadgets and raised funds for historical preservation. 

“Believe it or not, I started out not being a believer when I was young. I didn't think ghosts were real,” Corbett said. “Now, I would say trust your senses, because we've got enough real evidence to convince me that they're certainly out there, and they're everywhere too.” 

In the final Estes session, Corbett asked, “Do you want us to come back again?” and with no answer heard, the BPI team packed up its gear. Upon reviewing the footage, just after Corbett's question, a faint EVP captured on a recorder whispered, “No.”

Control with the inside of the left foot, thump.

Control with the inside of the right foot, thump.

Control with the left thigh, this time, the ball arriving a bit higher. Touch to the right, thump.

The ball smacking against the wall and springing back towards him through the puddles, the spray flying off it. The rain hammering down, his sodden tracksuit clinging to his skin. The noise of the ball hitting the wall echoing around the square. Over and over: right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot. Control, thump. Control, touch, thump.

Ousmane Dembele is still a child, but he is already obsessed with football. If his friends are around, he plays with them: furiously contested kickabouts on the bare concrete of his neighbourhood, a pair of trees or a couple of backpacks for goals.

If they are not, or if they are deterred by the weather, he comes here, to a playground a stone's throw from the high-rise apartment block he calls home, and wallops his football against the side of a squat red-brick building with a sloping terracotta-coloured roof.

It is an easy, carefree pastime, but even at this young age, he knows that it will make him a better footballer; every touch and every shot strengthening his bond with the ball, sharpening his muscle memory. Control, thump. Control, touch, thump.

The spindly youngster is at the beginning of a journey that will successively turn him into one of the most promising, one of the most unfortunate, one of the most maddening and ultimately one of the most celebrated football players in the world.

At Rennes and then Borussia Dortmund, he is the very epitome of footballing potential: a whirlwind of sidesteps and breezy dribbles, a broad smile forever stretched across his face, a trail of befuddled opponents forever floundering in his wake.

At Barcelona, after a record-breaking €135million transfer, things get complicated: injuries, recurrent complaints about his time-keeping and professionalism, the fear that his potential is destined never to be truly fulfilled.

But the planets have aligned at Paris Saint-Germain, where his abrupt transformation into a prolific goalscorer means that he approaches Saturday's Champions League final against Inter in Munich accompanied by a higher level of expectation than perhaps any other player. Should PSG prevail, the Ballon d'Or could well be his.

As he stands on the brink of career-defining glory, this is his story so far.

By Moustapha Diatta's reckoning, he was five years old when he first met Dembele, who was one year older. The two boys' mothers were close friends and their families lived in the same building in La Madeleine, a disadvantaged district of the Normandy town of Evreux, which lies 60 miles west of Paris.

“The days often revolved around football,” Diatta tells The Athletic. “We'd have kickabouts with friends at the foot of our building or we'd challenge a team from another neighbourhood to a game.

“Ousmane always had a ball with him. And he had a gift. He could already shoot with both feet and his dribbling was instinctive. The results were pretty incredible.”

A child of the 2000s, having been born in May 1997, Dembele grew up idolising players such as David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Lionel Messi. The dream of following in their gilded footsteps took root at an early age.

“When we were young, he told me several times that he was going to become a great player,” says Diatta. “That's one of his character traits: when he wants something, he does everything to get it.”

Dembele was seven years old when he and Diatta joined local club ALM Evreux (later to become Evreux FC), whose pitches lay a 10-minute walk away across the Boulevard du 14 Juillet. The first time Evreux youth coach Gregory Badoche laid eyes on him, he could scarcely believe them.

“He stood out a mile,” Badoche recalls. “It was almost paranormal: the quality of his sidesteps, his dribbles, the crazy changes of rhythm. He was a little shrimp, you know, a very slender guy with legs like toothpicks, but his dribbling ability was insane.”

Interest from major local clubs did not take long to arrive. Le Havre and Caen both made overtures, but Rennes won out after offering to help Dembele's family — his mother, Fatimata, his brother and his two sisters – to relocate to Brittany with him.

Expectations, on both sides, were high.

“There was a recruiter from Rennes called Armand Djire who used to come and watch him regularly,” says Badoche. “When Ousmane was still only 12, Armand said to me: ‘If he doesn't become a professional, I'll end my career'.”

As the former director of the Rennes academy, Yannick Menu has equally fond memories of ‘Dembouz' the burgeoning footballer and Dembele the burgeoning person.

“Ousmane is someone who's very cheerful and very smiley,” he says.

“Sometimes our relationship was a bit stormy, because when you're in contact with a young person every day, that can happen. But he loved football and he loved training and he always gave everything on the pitch.”

Dembele made rapid progress in the Rennes youth ranks and was capped by France at both under-17 and under-18 level. But he was frustrated by what he felt was a lack of consideration from the club. Amid interest from Red Bull Salzburg, he downed tools in the summer of 2015, sitting out a two-week training camp in Germany, before eventually putting pen to paper on a three-year professional contract.

After making his debut off the bench in a 2-0 win at Angers in October 2015, the 18-year-old became a fixture in the starting XI and finished his maiden campaign with an excellent return of 12 goals and five assists from 26 Ligue 1 games.

“He was very collective-minded,” says former Rennes head coach Philippe Montanier. “He was a dribbler, but he always dribbled with intention.

“And he had personality as well. I remember the derby against Lorient (a 2-2 draw in January 2016). We went 2-0 down in the first half, but he was the one who was urging his team-mates to react.”

Dembele's remarkable two-footedness left observers agog. A hat-trick of right-foot strikes in a 4-1 win over Nantes was followed by a notorious post-match interview in which even he seemed not to know which was his stronger foot.

The unintentionally comical effect of that interview created an impression of a young player whose head was tethered to his shoulders with less than customary tightness. But those who know him insist that behind the impression of absent-mindedness lies a keen intelligence.

“Sometimes he'll seem a bit in his own world, then the next second he'll seem very switched on,” says a source close to Dembele, speaking anonymously to protect relationships.

“He's passionate about historical documentaries, for example. So in a conversation, you might think he's a bit lost, but then he'll suddenly start talking to you about the Bolsheviks.

“It's like when he's on the pitch — he's constantly throwing people off-balance.”

Before his first season in senior football had reached its conclusion, Dembele had been announced as a Dortmund player, joining the club from the Ruhr valley on a five-year contract for a fee of €15million.

Diatta, who played at centre-back, signed for Dortmund's reserves and the pair embarked on a German adventure together, first living in a hotel and then moving into a house in the city centre.

“We had a pretty simple life there,” Diatta recalls. “It was our first experience overseas, so we were discovering life abroad. We were lucky to find French players there like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who really took Ousmane under his wing.”

The kind of football career that Dembele had pictured for himself in those kickabouts in La Madeleine was suddenly upon him: a gigantic stadium, packed to the rafters with 80,000 wildly cheering fans; glamorous Champions League ties against Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Benfica and Monaco; taut domestic tussles with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig.

Initially taken aback by the intensity of Dortmund's training sessions, Dembele soon got up to speed and credited head coach Thomas Tuchel with giving him the liberty to play his natural game.

“When I have the ball, it's total freedom,” he told L'Equipe. “It's something that I need. I'm allowed to move into the middle, put myself in the number 10 position, change wings. It's gratifying to feel this confidence in me, as if I was 25.”

Forming a devilish three-pronged attack alongside Aubameyang and Marco Reus, Dembele enjoyed a brilliant first season, playing a starring role in Dortmund's conquest of the DFB-Pokal and being named the Bundesliga's Rookie of the Season (one year on from having won the equivalent award in France).

But the youngster's impatience came to the fore once more the following summer when he went on strike again, leaving a bad taste at Dortmund that lingers to this day. This time it was to force through a move to the club of his dreams.

Before joining Barcelona, Dembele had never sustained a serious injury. Within two weeks of being unveiled at a sun-soaked Camp Nou in August 2017, he ruptured the tendon in the femoral bicep of his left thigh, which sidelined him for nearly four months. It created an unfortunate template for what was to follow.

In Dembele's early years at Barca, his body continually betrayed him. Further problems with his left hamstring came in January 2018 and March 2019. A muscle tear in his right thigh in May 2019. A muscle tear in his left thigh the following August. A complete right hamstring tear in February 2020. A knee tendon issue in June 2021 that forced him out of Euro 2020.

By the time he left Barcelona in the summer of 2023, after six seasons at the club, he had missed no fewer than 119 matches due to injury.

It did not help that, even when he was fit, he did not always seem entirely present, with repeated instances of lateness driving the club's decision-makers to distraction.

Dembele was living with Diatta and his uncle in a luxurious house in Barcelona's upmarket Pedralbes neighbourhood and the fear within the club was that he was spending too much time playing video games and not enough time focused on football.

“In his early days, he didn't have the professional mindset of a Barca player,” says a source who worked with Dembele during his time at the club.

“His eating habits were horrible. He also had a phase when he'd show up very late for training. He was fined for that multiple times. Sometimes he'd fall asleep at home and that was it. He even missed medical appointments.”

Diatta puts Dembele's teething problems at Barca down to inexperience. “When you buy a player at such a young age and there are lots of expectations around him, you should be able to forgive him a few little mistakes,” he says.

Eventually, the penny dropped. Encouraged by his agent, Moussa Sissoko, Dembele took on a full-time personal chef, Anthony Audebaud, in the summer of 2019. Out went the Coca-Cola and the ready meals, in came the sea bream, the sea bass, the spring chicken and the vegetables.

A year later he started working with a personal fitness coach, former elite sprinter Salah Ghaidi, and physiotherapist Jean-Baptiste Duault, who was taken on after impressing Dembele's entourage with his analysis of the player's injury problems in an interview with L'Equipe.

The feeling in Dembele's camp was that Barcelona's focus on patient, possession-dependent football meant that their training sessions were not sufficiently dynamic for him from a physical perspective. Backed by his new personal support staff, Dembele took physical preparation and injury prevention into his own hands, constructing a daily fitness schedule designed to strengthen and protect the muscles that had previously been his undoing.

With his injury problems finally behind him, Dembele's last three seasons at Barcelona were much happier as he became a key figure under first Ronald Koeman and then Xavi. Although his attacking statistics remained largely underwhelming, he bowed out as a Barca player with three La Liga titles and two Copa del Rey wins to his name.

“He eventually became a sort of veteran in the dressing room and his team-mates understood him better in his last years,” says the Barcelona source. “Dembele ended up being loved for how he was.”

The turnaround in Dembele's Barca fortunes also permitted him to resurrect his international career. He played only a peripheral role in France's triumph at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, having lost his place after their opening game, and then went 860 days without playing for Les Bleus between November 2018 and March 2021.

But although injury curtailed his involvement at Euro 2020, he was a first-choice pick on the right flank at both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024. Close to Kylian Mbappe, Dembele is popular in the France squad due to his irrepressible bonhomie and has long retained national coach Didier Deschamps' backing, in spite of his many injury problems, thanks to his unique ability to unlock matches.

“Some players understand things very quickly and are already mature at the age of 19 or 20, like Kylian,” says Ludovic Batelli, who coached both Dembele and Mbappe at under-19 level with France.

“I think Ousmane needed a bit more time to understand that work, rigour and discipline would make him even more effective and successful. But as they say — better late than never.”

Having agreed to meet a €50million (£42.9m, $54.9m) release clause in Dembele's Barcelona contract, the PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi sold his club's project to the forward by vowing that he would be the homegrown figurehead of a young, hungry team with a strong French identity.

Paris had been a 70-minute train ride from Evreux during Dembele's childhood and he had happy memories of going to watch games with his friends at the Parc des Princes.

It helped, too, that Dembele already knew PSG's newly appointed coach. While coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique had enquired about the winger's availability following his breakthrough at Rennes, only for Dembele to inform him that he had already given his word to Dortmund. Seven years on, their paths finally converged.

“Luis Enrique was fiercely protective of him, right from day one,” says a source close to the PSG coach. “He was confident that he had something magical in his hands and that under him, Dembele was going to flourish.”

After claiming a league and Coupe de France double alongside Mbappe in his maiden PSG season, Dembele was one of the players expected to step up to the plate when his long-time friend left the French capital for Real Madrid last summer.

Things did not get off to the best start when he was dropped on disciplinary grounds for PSG's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League in October.

Dembele had questioned Luis Enrique's possession-heavy tactics during a team briefing and subsequently reported late for a training session, although a source close to him suggests that he was primarily axed for the trip to the Emirates Stadium in order to send a message to the rest of the squad.

Yet only two months later, Luis Enrique happened upon a tactical innovation that would reinvigorate PSG's season — and transform Dembele's career.

The decision to deploy Dembele as a false nine for a 3-1 home win over Lyon in mid-December proved the spark for a stupendous run of goal-scoring form in which the France international racked up 27 goals in only 22 appearances.

Amassed in the space of only three and a half months, it represented twice as many goals as he had ever previously mustered over the course of an entire season.

Dembele, who has scored 33 goals in all competitions, attributes his improved fortunes to the fact that his central role means he has to expend less effort in order to get into shooting positions, enabling him to take aim at goal with fresher legs. Sources close to him additionally point to the hours of work he has spent on his finishing in training over the last 12 months, as well as input from a personal video analyst.

As the deliberately elusive focal point of a deliberately loose-limbed starting XI, the super-fit Dembele also plays a pivotal role in PSG's build-up play and their formidable pressing game.

Having turned 28 earlier this month, Dembele is one of the senior figures in the PSG squad. Although grand speeches have never been his style (“a connector rather than a leader” is how one source describes him), he fulfils an important function in the club's youthful, multilingual changing room.

“He speaks several languages, which facilitates links with his team-mates,” says a source close to the PSG squad. “He's also someone who's very jovial, who likes taking the mick, and that helps to create a good atmosphere and bind the squad together.”

Dembele's performances have also benefited from the fact that, away from the pitch, he has moved into a more settled phase in his life. He married Moroccan influencer Rima Edbouche in December 2021 and they had a baby daughter in September 2022.

A practicing Muslim, PSG's No 10 is scrupulously discrete about his private life and describes himself as “casanier”, meaning ‘a homebody'. Though fatherhood and the demands of elite-level football have inevitably reduced the amount of free time on his hands, he remains a committed Football Manager player and watches as much live football as he can. “I watch practically every championship,” he confided to Le Parisien last year.

Few would have bet on him emerging from the current campaign with a stronger claim to the Ballon d'Or than Mbappe. But according to those who know him, until he has the Champions League trophy in his hands, thoughts of individual glory can wait.

“For him, the most important thing is to win the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain, because it would be something historic,” says best friend Diatta.

“And it'd be deserved, when you look at his journey. He's been through tough times, people have spoken ill of him, about the injuries and things like that, but he's never complained. He's just kept working.”

One more assured first touch, one more thumping finish, and a little boy's dreams will all come true.

A thick ice crust and temperatures as low as minus 200 degrees - doesn't exactly sound pleasant. Why Saturn's moon Enceladus is nevertheless promising in the search for extraterrestrial life.

At first glance, Saturn's moon Enceladus appears rather unspectacular: it is much smaller than our moon, far away and completely covered in ice. But beneath the frozen shell is an ocean of liquid water - and thus perhaps one of the most promising places in the solar system in the search for extraterrestrial life.

""Where there is water, life is also possible,"" says astrobiologist Nozair Khawaja, who leads a research team at Freie Universität Berlin (FU). Experiments are soon to show which substances can form under conditions such as those prevailing on Enceladus.

Seen from the sun, Saturn is the sixth planet behind Mars and Jupiter. ""Scientists used to believe that the region beyond Mars was hopeless for the search for life or conditions for life,"" explains Khawaja. It was too cold and had too little sunlight.

The detection of liquid water on Enceladus was therefore a minor sensation. The first indication of an underground ocean was in 2005, when several special instruments detected water jets and fountains at the south pole of the moon. Along large cracks, water vapor and ice grains are hurled hundreds of kilometers into space.

In the laboratory, he and his team want to simulate the conditions in the subsurface of the Enceladus Ocean and understand what happens deep below the ice layer. What would it mean if there really is life on Enceladus? Khawaja says: ""The discovery of extraterrestrial microbial life would raise hopes that traces of life may be widespread elsewhere in the universe and that conditions may exist there under which human-like life is possible or could be established in the future.""

The scientist has some disappointing news for science fiction fans: the search is on for simple life forms such as bacteria. The idea of a small green male inhabiting Enceladus has to be abandoned. ""We're not looking for something that looks like us and has two eyes, a nose and arms.""","{'href': 'https://www.bluewin.ch', 'title': 'blue News'}","other"

To celebrate the release of A24's truly terrifying new film Bring Her Back, we invited real-life exorcist and author Rachel Stavis to sit down with the film's writer-directors, Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me). What unfolds is part interview, part psychic reading, and a fascinating unveiling of the supernatural connections between Bring Her Back and allegedly very real demonic entities. As Stavis dives into the brothers' paranormal pasts and energy fields, the trio unpacks the film's core themes of grief, possession, and demonic spiritual attachment. 

Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a mother shattered by loss who will stop at nothing, including grotesque supernatural means, to bring her child back from the dead. Together, this conversation blurs the line between fiction and something far stranger. Read it for yourself below or check out the video here:

Danny Philippou: (Hushed but silly) I'm scared as well.Rachel Stavis: (Logs on) Hi, how are you? Michael Philippou: (Professional) We're good. How are you? RS: I'm good, thank you. So. I guess you know that I'm an exorcist. That's what I do. I remove entities from people places and things, and say to, you know, I'm a, so I'm a big fan of yours or talking about that obviously in your movie. Now possession and attachment is really based in trauma. It really is about that energy, and it's a double-edged sword, you know, when you experience trauma and grief, and then else takes hold. And that's what's so great about your movie now, cause it's exactly how it works crazy, so you really tapped in thereDP: Awesome, thank you! We, we had, um, a shaman that was helping bless the set and cleanse it of negative energies and all that. So that was a process that happened before we started shooting, as we were shooting as well. RS: That's so smart that you do that… I don't wanna get too personal because we know this is going out to the wild world without getting into too much of your pastor background. And obviously, we don't know each other. You are high empaths. This basically means that you are very sensitive to energy and I am going out on the limb here to say to you that, cause I don't know if you wanna admit it or not. I had some interesting, like, paranormal, kind of, weird things that have happened to you past. 

DP: One situation I never could explain… Our grandfather used to live with us and, and would babysit us and would raise us. And, um, when we were 13. he passed away in our house. There was always a really comforting sound of him coming home at night, uh you know, when we were the most terrified. I was always so terrified of nighttime, and he would come home at night and he would, I could hear him, yeah, doing the dishes, and then he would make us food. I'd come out and sit with him and I'd eat. And I remember a couple of days after he passed away, it was 1 o'clock in the morning, all the lights off in the house, everybody was asleep and then I could hear the dishes being done. And it was that comforting sound that I always would rely on and love hearing from my grandfather. And so I remember that it was comforting, but also a little bit terrifying. And then I spoke to my sister about it the next day and she's like, oh my god, did you hear that as well? And we had all heard the dishes being done at midnight with all the lights off of everyone asleep.MP: (Cheekily) It was me. DP: It wasn't Michael! MP: Our poor grandfather's stuck in the afterlife doing dishes…RS: What I think it's a sound that he was comforting. DP: And Michael hasn't washed the dishes in his life.MP: Actually I do. Danny doesn't wash the dishesRS: Your grandfather is with you all the time, you know that, right? DP: That's, that's a comforting thing to hear, though.RS: It's true. He was a really good man, let's also put that out there. A really nice, good man that really was for you. And you had a lot of fear at night because you had a lot of night terrors. It's the sensitivity to energy and being a high empath like you, you visitations even if you really don't know what that is. And kids are in particular so empathic because we come in so open that the, you know, the world kind of takes it away as we get older. There's a familiar smell that you have of him, um, that he does, kind of, send around sometimes, which you might have noticed and been like, oh, weird that smells like that. DP: Yeah, it's that candle! It smells like there is … like a certain aroma. MP: I always, uh, worry about if we've attracted negative energies. Not because of the films that we made, but we also always seek out the most haunted places in the world and wanna stay at them. Like, I love camping out at a haunted environment or, like, a place that has, like, a dining country we visit. I look at the most haunted location and go stay there. I don't necessarily have a strong belief in it, but I'm always fascinated by it. I always love hearing stories and, and, uh, people talking about experiences, that's always fascinating to me. So I love doing it in different countries. I love diving into the occult world and interviewing people, and, and, like, hearing about different rituals.RS: Well, if it was anything real bad, believe that I would be like, we're gonna talk separate. That's not gonna happen.MP: Like, that's good, that's comforting here at least.RS: No, you know, you're fine, you're fine. When we are people who are attracted to the occult or people who love horror, it's because we too are trying to deal with our own. It's a way to provide comfort through that. I can see them. I can see them in actors when they're in movies. I can see them in pictures. I can see them walking around, and I did not know what that was. You know, that was really scary as a kid cause, you know, when your kid you talk about everything and then some adult is like, don't you dare talk about that? And you're like, oh, sorry. MP: When you see entities, what does that look like physically? Does it look like a full person or is it what, what is it?  RS: They don't look like people at all. So deceased people and entities totally different. So deceased people, people who are dead entities are what people consider demons and have never been people. I have seen a certain type of species of people of entities more often than others. And I had a memoir come out and that kind of goes through like what the different entities are. MP: I'm fascinated by this. Do these things acknowledge you? So when someone walks in with this, are they attached to this person? That's, are they completely attached to that person or are they aware of your presence?RS: The answer is yes, but in weird ways. So when I go into public spaces, I try to block it out as much as possible. Because you have an entity and nobody wants to hear that can't just go up to people and be like, this horrible thing that happened to you. Let's discuss it, because there's a worst thing attached to you that I'd love to take out for you. DP: That'd be a hard conversation to have. 

RS: It's not, it's not as pleasant as, like, hearing from your grandfather. The weirdest part is when you're watching a movie and you know, clearly, the actor has an attachment.

MP: Wait, did you see attachments in Bring Her Back?

RS: I did see one…

BOTH: Oh, really attached to which character??

RS: I can't say that. That's gonna out somebody. 

BOTH: Oh, we can just beep it, oh, yeah, well, beep it!

RS: I'll tell you later. I'll tell you privately, I don't wanna put that out there.  

MP: I was gonna say if you watch a film, and you see an actor, and they're on screen, and there's a and you see there's an MC attached, and it distracts you because it was captured in a moment of time.If that MC was removed later down the line, do you still see it in the film? 

RS: It's not there anymore, same with photographs actually, so I can see entities in pictures, and you wouldn't believe how many people are like, here are five pictures, can you tell me what's going on? It's weird, but, it's like, it was never there. It's like the full  he has gone

DP: That's insane. So, it is true when they say that photos capture the soul! I mean, film would be the same thing?

MP: The film is pictures, Danny!

DP: That's what I'm saying!

Dread Central's Mary Beth McAndrews recently awarded the film four stars in her review, writing Bring Her Back is a calculated risk to prove the filmmaking duo isn't afraid to go weirder and freakier while shattering a few more taboos along the way. It's that kind of risk-taking and original storytelling that keeps the genre feeling fresh and consistently relevant in popular culture.”Bring Her Back is now playing in theatres everywhere. With a powerhouse performance from Sally Hawkins and the Philippou brothers' signature mix of emotional horror and raw intensity, it's a chilling descent into the spiritual fallout of grief. If this interview taught me anything, it's that some stories … and some entities … don't stay buried for long.

A lone, battered shipping container that has washed up on the beach in Paravur, a small fishing hamlet between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, is the talk of the town. The reddish-brown container, like many more than have beached all along Kerala's coast following the recent sinking of a Liberia-registered ship, has piqued curiosity and, for now, taken a daily staple off the plates of most households in these parts – fish.

On Sunday, May 25, MSC Elsa 3, an 184-metre-long container ship, sank while it was sailing from Vizhinjam port to Cochin port, triggering alarm in coastal hamlets all the way from Alappuzha in mid-north Kerala to Kollam further south. The ship was carrying an estimated 640 containers, including 13 with “hazardous cargo”, of which 12 are said to have contained calcium carbide. A solid compound, calcium carbide is not flammable by itself, but it reacts vigorously with water and moisture to produce highly flammable acetylene gas, posing a significant fire hazard. The ship also had 84 metric tonnes of diesel and 367 metric tonnes of furnace oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday.

Around Paravur beach, men in khaki have been deployed to guard the container, lest some intrepid local falls prey to curiosity and tries to prise it open. A constable has been deputed to clear traffic as people slow down vehicles on the narrow beach road to check out the container. Taking advantage of the sudden rush of onlookers, an ice cream vendor has strategically shifted closer to this spot on the beach, adding to the problems of the constable who struggles to clear the occasional “block” – the term used for a traffic jam.

There are a bunch of people on the beach shooting reels and shorts with the container in the backdrop, as are children in uniform, who have taken a detour on their way home from school to witness the local spectacle. In this sleepy Kerala town, where the high point of the year are the fireworks at a local temple, the coming of the container is an assured selfie moment.

Valsala Srikumar, though, has a harried look. “I have barely sold anything. The same as Monday,” she says, standing metres away from the ice cream vendor, peddling a full stock of fish on a yard stool by the beach road.

Metres away, the container bobs gently as the waves crash into it. All around the container and further south along the coast, the water is white and foamy – one reason why people are keeping off fish.

Today, Valsala's husband has ventured out “to the cleaner parts” seeking a catch, but it's pointless now. “What is the use if no one is buying,” she says.

Fishing boats are moored along the beach, with little activity at the far end where the fisherfolk stay.

A kilometer away, at Oottupurayil restaurant in Paravur Kombolam, a market with a cluster of shops, waiter Anees says clients are shunning seafood. “This is just a phase,” he hopes.

Back on the beach, there are speculative guesses on the contents of the container. The locals, helped by WhatsApp forwards and their vestigial knowledge of the periodic table, rattle off names of the multiple chemical compounds the containers ostensibly contained – all the way from arsenic to zinc, lead and mercury.

For a populace fed on a steady diet of politics and media, conspiracy theories come easy. “Is Liberia linked to Pakistan… like Turkey?” a person in the crowd asks, a query that's quickly dismissed by someone else who is more well-versed in these matters.

A ship's flag state testifies to the country where it is registered, but much of this is determined by the tonnage tax advantages offered by jurisdictions such as Liberia or Cyprus.

Three days since MSC Elsa 3 sank, the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard are trying to contain any oil spill from the ship. Teams of scientists from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, are collecting water and sediment samples across locations on the Kerala coast. The onset of the monsoon hasn't helped, with the surging tides making the operations difficult. While the containers are being removed from the coastline, one by one, a clean-up of the beach waters could be a long way off.

Until that happens, Valsala's fishing business could be in some trouble. And despite the optimism of the Oottupurayil waiter, this phase could last a while.

When No Other Land won the 2025 Academy Award for Best Documentary for its depiction of life in the occupied West Bank, some in the Hollywood audience sat silently in protest. Far from the ceremony, an insidious narrative about the movie was already taking hold.

“Hollywood gave a Pallywood mockumentary an Oscar,” declared YnetNews, calling the film a “dangerous fable” and accusing its co-directors of staging confrontations and manipulating footage. Israel National News published an article titled “Pallywood Propaganda Wins an Oscar,” written by a spokeswoman for an Israeli pro-settler NGO, who wrote that the film is “an extreme anti-Israel concoction” designed to manipulate Western audiences. In a separate op-ed in the Wrap, critics demanded that the academy rescind the Oscar, accusing the filmmakers of “outright falsehoods” and “emotional manipulation.” The message was clear: The movie was “Pallywood propaganda on steroids.”

The term Pallywood—a portmanteau of Palestine and Hollywood—stems from a long-standing claim that Palestinians fabricate their suffering for cameras, using actors, dolls, or staged scenes to smear Israel. It offers an all-purpose, ready-made excuse to dismiss even the most well-documented atrocities, sowing just enough doubt to ignore Palestinian suffering entirely.

This conspiracy has been around for years, but mentions of Pallywood spiked dramatically after Oct. 7, 2023, far surpassing previous peaks for the term during past Israeli military offensives in Gaza and the West Bank. Beyond Israel, Pallywood has gained traction in right-wing circles worldwide, particularly in the U.S. and India. One of the most grotesque examples came in December 2023, when a wave of pro-Israel accounts—including the official @Israel handle, the Jerusalem Post, and influencers like Ben Shapiro—amplified the claim that a grieving Palestinian man, seen in a widely shared video cradling his killed baby grandson, was faking it. “Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll (yes a doll),” the @Israel account wrote in a post that was viewed more than 1.3 million times. Others—including StopAntisemitism, Hen Mazzig, and Yoseph Haddad, echoed the claim to millions more. “Pallywood 🤣,” delighted Eli David.

In truth, the baby, 5-month-old Muhammad Hani al-Zahar, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The supposed “doll” these accounts amused over was his body. The Jerusalem Post eventually retracted its article. But by then, the damage was done. The lie didn't need to hold up under scrutiny—it confirmed what many were already primed to believe.

These claims have proliferated in recent months, even as the horrors of the war in Gaza have been increasingly difficult to dispute following the often-deadly work of journalists and health care workers who have continued to report what's happening on the ground. I spoke to some of those people—and also to the people who aren't so sure that there aren't Palestinian ruses afoot—to understand the seductive and enduring power of the conspiracy that, more than ever, seeks to mask the reality of the carnage in Gaza.

When I met Richard Landes in New York, he had just arrived from Israel, where he also keeps a home. Dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and walking with a cane, he looked like an aging adventurer, eager to deliver to me his theory about media deception and how Palestinian propaganda had “evolved” into what he calls “Pallywood 3.0”—a supposedly industrialized version of the staging of tragedies he believes he uncovered decades ago.

Few have done more to promote the Pallywood myth than Landes, a medievalist and historian of apocalyptic movements who coined the term. In his most recent book, 2022's Can “the Whole World” Be Wrong?, he argues that Western journalists are unwittingly reporting Palestinian propaganda as legitimate news (a phenomenon he calls “lethal journalism”), rendering them complicit in spreading antisemitic narratives under the guise of human-rights reporting. The book expands on the idea of Pallywood as an intricate, evolving system of staged deception designed to manipulate global opinion against Israel.

Over coffee, Landes traced his convictions back to the case of Muhammad al-Durrah, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy shot and killed in 2000 at Netzarim Junction, in Gaza, an event caught on film and broadcast worldwide. Landes said he was immediately suspicious of the footage. He described to me his benevolent curiosity, watching hours of raw video from the scene and discovering what he believes were signs of staging—injured men getting up, ambulances whisking away seemingly unharmed people. He fixated on the final frames, when al-Durrah, moments from death, appears to move his arm.

“The last time you see him in a clip taken by the cameramen, he is alive,” he said. “He's lying stretched out; he's got his right hand over his eye, not clutching his stomach, where he was allegedly hit with a fatal wound. And then he slowly lifts up his elbow and peeks out at the camera and then slowly lowers the elbow. And it's so obvious that the journalist who ran the story literally cut that scene so that people wouldn't see it. I don't think he was killed.” He remains convinced that Palestinian camera operators, medics, and bystanders were all in on a kind of elaborate theater. “The boy who's being carried to the funeral is not the same as the picture of the boy from the family of Muhammad al-Durrah,” he said. (What actually happened that day has been the subject of extensive revelations and questionable reversals for decades; al-Durrah's family, and the people who witnessed the events, maintain that he was killed by Israeli soldiers.)

For Landes, this moment was foundational. He argues that Palestinians are waging war with empathy. “They got to fight back somehow. They don't have the weapons, but a picture is worth a thousand bullets,” he said. “They're manipulating the compassion of Westerners so that they can get a massive response of anger at Israel, force her to a ceasefire, and thereby spare Hamas so Hamas can once again start a round in which they draw Israeli fire onto their own civilians.”

It became a self-reinforcing logic: In his view, the more compelling the image, the more likely it was a deception.

Landes told me that nearly every clip from Gaza and the West Bank contains clues. “You're an Arab, right?” he asked me. “Women weep openly, but is it common for men to do the same in grief? Ask around. In many cultures, especially warrior cultures, men don't display emotions like sorrow. They might cry in rage but not in despair. And yet, in these videos, you see men weeping dramatically.” He pointed to Gazawood, a crowdsourced website and X account that compiles what it claims are Pallywood slipups—supposed bad edits, recurring actors, makeup mistakes. The account frequently shares videos of dead Palestinian babies, speculating that they might be fake. “If you pause the footage and look closely, you'll see other people in the background who were smiling at the performance,” Landes added, referencing videos like this one.

Landes continues to monitor footage from Gaza closely. In a recent Substack post, he scrutinized a video showing the immediate aftermath of an Israeli airstrike that hit a 13-year-old boy, Mohammed Salem, and a secondary strike on those who came to his aid that killed Salem and a 14-year-old boy and wounded 20 others. Though the Washington Post verified the video's authenticity and the Israeli military acknowledged the strikes, Landes argues that a lack of visible injuries and people reacting before the explosion proves that it was staged.

I pointed out that many so-called examples of Pallywood have been debunked—like videos supposedly showing Arab children having makeup applied to fake injuries, recordings that are actually behind-the-scenes footage from films or commercials. But Landes insisted that his broader point still stood: “I'm not saying that every claim of Pallywood is fairly accurate. I do think that there are significant numbers that are accurate.”

Though he stops short of denying the destruction in Gaza outright, Landes believes that the world is slowly catching on. He cites past cases—like the 2004 Gaza beach bombing, in which four Palestinian children were targeted by Israeli naval strikes while playing soccer, and for which he claims that Hamas land mines were actually responsible—as examples of how initial narratives shape public perception long before facts are verified. Even when he concedes that Israeli forces may commit atrocities, he argues that Palestinian exaggerations, and the willingness of Western journalists to relay them, are what truly fuel the cycle of violence.

As Israel bans foreign journalists from entering and reporting freely in Gaza, I asked Landes, what hope do we have to verify information in the way he seeks? “It may be that you can't. It may be that you have to recognize that,” he told me. “The journalist is there to report as accurately as possible. And if you can't report accurately, you don't just incredulously run with any information you get from people who are clearly warriors with their pens and their cameras.”

Laila Al-Arian, an Emmy- and Peabody-winning investigative journalist and executive producer of Al Jazeera's Fault Lines, has spent the months since October 2023 reporting on Gaza. Her feed is flooded with footage of bombed homes, bloodied children, frantic rescue efforts—as well as accusations that it's all fake.

“It's everywhere on my Twitter,” she told me. To her, the concept of Pallywood is no more credible than the “crisis actor” conspiracy theories used to deny mass shootings in America, like the one at Sandy Hook. “Facts don't matter. They're inventing stories to discredit what's right in front of them: suffering, atrocities, death,” she said.

Al-Arian, who is Palestinian American, said the “Pallywood” label has followed her work for years but has intensified with the war in Gaza. The assertion that Palestinians are unreliable narrators of their own stories deeply frustrates her. “Journalists aren't really journalists. Doctors aren't really doctors. Rescue workers aren't really rescue workers. It's all about delegitimizing Palestinian voices,” she said. “If you paint Palestinians as irrational, obsessed with martyrdom, you shift the conversation away from settler colonialism, land theft, ethnic cleansing.”

In her work, she often has to contend with the effects of this doubt; while Israeli lives are consistently portrayed with sensitive compassion in Western media, Palestinians are often denied that. “Israeli snipers who shoot children are still given the benefit of the doubt,” she said. The world sees only a fraction of what's really happening, she told me: “Forget Pallywood. The real tragedy is how much we don't see. Journalists are being killed, their equipment destroyed. What makes it out is just a sliver of reality.”

Even so, it wasn't hard to find journalists in the region who see things differently. For reporters like Al-Arian, there is a flood of raw footage: families pulling bodies from rubble, lifeless and bloodied children in the arms of dispirited parents. But in pro-Israel circles, those same platforms are filled with selective clips framed as evidence of Palestinian trickery—a “corpse” shifting under a shroud, civilians eating desserts amid a food shortage. Each is fodder for the Pallywood narrative.

“Do you know Mr. FAFO?” Ruthie Blum, an Israeli journalist, former Jerusalem Post editor, and former adviser at the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, asked me. She was referring to Saleh Aljafarawi, a Palestinian musician turned citizen journalist who now documents Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in real time. “Apparently he's a well-known actor in Palestinian circles,” she said, “who's appeared in several clips playing the part of a wounded Palestinian, all bloodied up, and, in other footage, having makeup applied to him in what looks like a makeshift studio.”

Aljafarawi was given the FAFO nickname—short for “Fuck Around and Find Out”—after pro-Israel accounts circulated footage of him early on in the war cheering on Hamas rockets, juxtaposed with videos of him weeping amid Gaza's devastation. He quickly became a central figure in the Pallywood conspiracy. His image is often used to suggest that Palestinians are staging their suffering—even when the videos shown aren't of him. Multiple news organizations have debunked these claims. Yet the conspiracy persists.

Blum is certain Pallywood is real, at least in part. “There have been many, many videos,” she said. “You'll see a row of dead bodies covered in sheets, and then one of them lifts his arm to check his phone. Or there's this other one, with a father weeping over his supposedly dead kid, and then the kid starts scratching his foot. He's a little kid, so he couldn't keep still.”

She told me her son, a soldier in the Israeli military, barely survived his deployment in Gaza. And she insists that the images perpetuate a culture of violence within Palestinian society.

“It's used to persuade children to become martyrs for Allah,” she said. “They say: ‘Look at this dead boy—you should aspire to that.' That's what makes it different from other kinds of propaganda. This is why Palestinian children are such victims of their society—because they are taught to idolize not only killers but killers who died in the process of killing.”

Blum doesn't deny that real suffering is happening in Gaza. But she praised the Israeli army's rules of engagement and argued that even if any of the images are authentic, “every death in Gaza is on Hamas' hands.”

Because it's an English term, most Palestinians in Gaza have never even heard of Pallywood. Most Israelis don't use it either. But Tom Divon, a researcher at Hebrew University specializing in digital culture, told me that the idea is much more powerful—and deeply ingrained—than the term itself. “No content from Gaza has the chance to stand as evidence of truth in the current climate, where we are conditioned to search for the fake. We wait for the injured girl to stand up, laugh, and reveal the lie, because we've been trained to see Gaza through a lens of suspicion,” he said. “It's a way to cope. Truth, in its full force, is overwhelming. Denial offers some relief.”

Since Oct. 7, Divon said, skepticism around Palestinian suffering has evolved. Where the term Pallywood was once invoked to suggest manipulation, many now simply look away: doubting death tolls, dismissing the scale of destruction, or otherwise accepting outright that mass civilian casualties are an acceptable cost of a just war.

“Gaza's inhabitants are objectified, reduced to numbers or blurry concepts. The media rarely shows unfiltered images or personal stories, because doing so would be too confronting for most viewers,” he said. That distancing, he noted, predates the current war. Israeli mainstream media has long excluded humanizing perspectives of Palestinians, including Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, he said.

These days, when Palestinians post TikToks documenting life in a locked-off war zone, many Israelis begin from a baseline of disbelief. “ ‘Why are they baking cakes if they're starving?' ‘How are they making polished videos if they're under siege?' ” Divon said, explaining the reasoning. The rise of A.I. has only deepened public skepticism, making it feel increasingly plausible that any image or video, no matter how realistic, could be fake.

For Divon, Pallywood is less a conspiracy theory than a psychological defense mechanism. Within Israeli society, he said, it's easier to imagine Palestinian suffering as unserious or exaggerated than to grapple with what the Israeli military is inflicting. “To them, it's all lies. Why? Because acknowledging it as truth would shatter us,” he said. “How long until we look back and recognize that our mechanisms of denial were too strong, that we ignored the truth?”

Maytha Alhassen, a historian who studies media and national identity, sees Pallywood not as a uniquely Israeli phenomenon but as part of the mythmaking process in many nations. The U.S. legend of the “great American liberator” was invoked for decades to rationalize the country's wars abroad, she said. She points to the 2022 documentary Tantura, which reveals how, decades ago, Israel erased evidence of massacres while promoting the idea that Palestine was “empty land,” a narrative essential to its national origin story.

The emotional investment in these beliefs, she argues, makes confronting the reality of Israel's founding—displacement and devastation for Palestinians—almost impossible for many. “To question it is to shatter a core piece of identity,” she said. This, she believes, is why accusations of Pallywood gain traction. They're meant not just to discredit Palestinian suffering but to preserve the psychological comfort of those invested in the status quo: “When your identity is formed around a nation-state, it requires so many acrobatic maneuvers to maintain it.” For many, Alhassen said, facing the reality of what's happening in Gaza means facing something personal. “Either you confront that truth or you protect the dream. To accept the horror would be to shatter something at your core.”

While reporting this article, I spoke to many journalists and doctors on the ground in Gaza who told me that the horrors they'd witnessed were beyond question. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care physician, described treating a child whose body had been mangled by an Israeli bulldozer that ran over her tent while she slept. Despite her best efforts, the girl died in agony. Journalist Mohammed Mhawish recounted surviving an airstrike: His home was bombed, entombing him, his wife, and their 2-year-old son. Though several relatives and neighbors sheltering with them were killed, Mhawish and his family were pulled out alive by neighbors, bloodied but breathing. He resumed reporting shortly after recovering from his injuries. Stories like these are so wrenching, so unbearable, that it becomes easier to understand why some would rather call them fake—“Pallywood”—than confront what they reveal.

Combing through these examples, I thought back to my conversations with Landes. I wondered if he had any thoughts on No Other Land, filmed from 2019 to 2023 in the West Bank by, as it happens, a team of both Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers. He dismissed it outright. “The ‘documentary' is a classic expression of Palestinian propaganda,” he told me. That the film could win an Academy Award, he said, was “testimony to the collapse of professional standards before the demands of political correctness.” Then he added: “If Palestinians expended a fraction of the energy and creativity they dedicate to maligning Israelis and playing victim on building a future for themselves, this would not be a forever war.”

Giant groundsels are rare plants that grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) tall. They are endemic to the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano in Tanzania and Africa's tallest mountain.

Name: Mount Kilimanjaro

Location: Kilimanjaro National Park, northeast Tanzania

Coordinates: -3.067192481296387, 37.355526051878165

Why it's incredible: Kilimanjaro hosts huge, endemic plants called giant groundsels.

On the middle-altitude slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro grows a strange plant not found anywhere else on Earth. The giant groundsel, a plant that looks like a pineapple crossed with a saguaro cactus, colonized the flanks of Africa's tallest mountain up to 1 million years ago and has not budged since.

Kilimanjaro's giant groundsels (Dendrosenecio kilimanjari) grow at altitudes of between 9,200 and 13,100 feet (2,800 to 4,000 meters), where they get just enough rainfall to survive, according to the tour operator Tranquil Kilimanjaro. The plants have evolved adaptations to the harsh conditions on the mountain, including water storage systems and a protective jacket of dead leaves.

Located in northeast Tanzania, the base of Mount Kilimanjaro is hot and humid, but temperatures at the summit, which is 19,340 feet (5,895 m) above sea level, can drop to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 29 degrees Celsius). The mountain ""creates its own weather,"" according to the tour operator Climbing Kilimanjaro, with baking sunshine, snow, rain and bitter winds all possible at different altitudes at any time of the year.

Giant groundsels have evolved to cope with this variable climate. Their thick stems are topped with a crown of sturdy leaves covered in hairs that limit how much water escapes the plant by evaporation. Both the stem and the leaves store water for when the climate is dry, usually from December to March and June to October.

The plants are also well equipped to survive a wide range of temperatures. When their leaves die, they fold over the stem and create a thick layer of insulation against the cold. Additionally, giant groundsels ooze “antifreeze” substances that enable the plants to grow above the tree line.

Most giant groundsels aren't much taller than a human, but some can reach 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall. Their vertical growth is another adaptation to the conditions on Mount Kilimanjaro, as the plants receive more sunlight the higher they grow, according to the tour operator Altezza Travel.

However, growth takes time. Giant groundsels grow by 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per year, according to tour operators, meaning that the tallest specimens may be at least 100 years old.



According to a genetic study by botanists, published in the journal PNAS, groundsels colonized Kilimanjaro within the past 1 million years and giant groundsels evolved as certain species adapted to the hostile conditions and migrated up the mountain.

Giant groundsels are pollinated by insects, which visit the plants' yellow flowers. After pollination, the flowers turn into fluffy seed heads, and these are carried by the wind to new locations.

Giant groundsels are found on Mount Kilimanjaro's Shira plateau and in the area around Barranco Camp, according to the Kilimanjaro National Park website. The best walking trails to see the plants are the Northern Circuit, the Lemosho route and the Machame route, according to tour operators.

Hikers should be careful not to touch or damage giant groundsels, which provide food and shelter for birds and small mammals. The plants' deep roots also help stabilize the soil, slowing the rate of erosion on Kilimanjaro, according to Tranquil Kilimanjaro.

War in Ukraine:

Volodymyr Zelenskiy

Ukraine said it's skipping a $665 million payment on government debt linked to economic growth after the country failed to agree on restructuring terms with a group of creditors led by hedge funds.

The east European nation, whose economy and finances have been battered by Russia's full-scale invasion for more than three years, agreed with investors last year to remove a cross default clause between the so-called GDP warrants and its regular international bonds. That protects it from a scenario in which a default on one instrument carries over to other debt. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump on Friday will host a press event to celebrate Elon Musk as the Tesla CEO concludes his official government service after four turbulent months leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

Musk's scheduled departure comes at a precarious moment, both for DOGE and for his relationship with the president.

Multiple top staffers at DOGE have either recently left or are on their way out of the federal workforce-slashing group. They include Steve Davis, the president of Musk's Boring Company, and DOGE spokeswoman Katie Miller, White House officials told NBC News. Attorney James Burnham is also reportedly leaving the group.

Musk worked for Trump temporarily as a powerful and highly visible ""special government employee"" after spending over $250 million helping to get the president elected.

Trump has regularly praised Musk throughout his tenure, up to and including his announcement of Friday's Oval Office ""press conference.""

""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,"" Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social, adding, ""Elon is terrific!""

But Musk, the world's richest man, has publicly broken with Trump and clashed with Cabinet members on multiple occasions.

He expressed support for lower tariffs, undermining Trump's ""tariff man"" persona. He also slammed White House trade advisor Peter Navarro as ""truly a moron"" and ""dumber than a sack of bricks.""

This week, Musk broke with Trump over the ""one big, beautiful bill"" that the president is pushing congressional Republicans to approve.

Musk told CBS' ""Sunday Morning"" that he was ""disappointed"" that the bill would increase the federal budget deficit, saying it ""undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.""

The ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" which Musk once predicted would cut trillions of dollars in government spending, has come nowhere close to that level, according to its own numbers, which also have come under question.

But Musk said DOGE isn't done yet.

""The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,"" Musk wrote Wednesday in an X post thanking Trump.

Musk's tenure in politics also bruised his public image and soured consumers' views of Tesla, whose cars and showrooms became a target for arsonists and vandals.

In his final weeks in government, Musk, once omnipresent in Trump's orbit, became far less visible, Politico reported.

Musk recently signaled he plans to back away from politics, including by pulling back on future campaign contributions, and focus more on his many businesses.

In the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, it is hard to escape the war with Russia. On some days, when the wind blows in the right direction, residents of the historic city can hear the boom of artillery fire from the front line. Most nights, Russian kamikaze drones packed with explosives buzz over apartment buildings as parents put their children to bed. Frequently — but unpredictably — a Russian ballistic missile would slam into the city.

For many people in Kharkiv, the war with its unrelenting, inescapable proximity, takes a mental toll. However, there is a space in the city where — for a few fleeting hours — the war stops existing.

In the basement of the Kharkiv National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre, a dance company has created a space protected from drones and bombs, where people can lose themselves in ballet performances.

Last month, the space hosted performances of Chopiniana, performed with full classical pomp, complete with corps de ballet and orchestra.

That marked a milestone for Kharkiv's cultural life, because it was the first full performance of a classical ballet in the city since Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

“In spite of everything — the fact that bombs are flying, drones, and everything else — we can give a gift of something wonderful to people,” said Antonina Radiievska, artistic director of Opera East, the ballet company which staged the performance. “They can come and, even if it's just for an hour or two, completely immerse themselves in a different world.”

Despite Ukraine's history of excellence in classical ballet, the art form seems far removed from the everyday lives of Ukrainians in wartime. Daily routines are given over to checking apps for drone attack warnings, sleeping on the metro station floor to escape an air raid or seeking news of relatives on the front line. Pirouettes, pas de deux and chiffon tutus feel a world away.

Nevertheless, the journey of Kharkiv's ballet through the war mirrors the ways Ukrainian society has adapted and evolved.

In 2022, as Moscow's troops reached the outskirts of Kharkiv and threatened to capture the city, the theater closed its doors and many of the ballet troupe moved away.

By 2023, the war was grinding on, but the situation in Kharkiv had stabilized after Russian ground forces pulled back. The realization dawned on the city that this was a long game, a new, wartime reality. 

Locals started referring to the city and themselves using the Ukrainian word nezlamniy, meaning invincible. It was that year that work began on converting the theater basement into a performance space. 

In October 2023, it began to be used as a rehearsal space. In spring the following year, the theater was granted permission to bring in an audience, and it held small-scale ballet performances.

The revival of Chopiniana represents the next milestone in Kharkiv's wartime cultural journey.

Staging a classical opera again sends a message that Ukraine is still standing, Opera East Director-General Igor Tuluzov said. “We are demonstrating to the world that we really are a self-sufficient state, independent, in all its aspects, including cultural independence.” 

The auditorium seats 400 people on stackable chairs, compared with 1,750 in the main theater upstairs, where the plush mustard seats lie empty. The stage downstairs is one quarter the size of the main stage. The aesthetic is gray-painted brick, concrete floors, pipes and electricity ducting running along the walls — a contrast to the varnished hardwood and marble of the space upstairs. 

The acoustic qualities of the basement do not match the lofty expanses of the main theater, performers said.

However, Radiievska said that what matters is that she and her troupe can once again perform at their best, in front of an audience.

“An artist cannot exist without the stage, without creativity, without dance or song. It's like a rebirth,” she said.



                                                                                Polish presidential candidates offered different visions of Poland and its relations with Ukraine in a televised debate ahead of next week's run-off, which remains on a knife-edge.
During a head-to-head debate lasting two hours, centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's governing pro-European coalition, faced the Eurosceptic historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS).
The two candidates, who qualified for the second round after coming in the top two places in the first vote on Sunday last week, clashed over Poland's relations with Ukraine, EU policy and the track records of their                                    


UNSCHEDULED VISIT:
                                        ‘It's a very bulky new neighbor, but it will soon go away,' said Johan Helberg of the 135m container ship that run aground near his house                                        A man in Norway awoke early on Thursday to discover a huge container ship had run aground a stone's throw from his fjord-side house — and he had slept through the commotion.
For an as-yet unknown reason, the 135m NCL Salten sailed up onto shore just meters from Johan Helberg's house in a fjord near Trondheim in central Norway.
Helberg only discovered the unexpected visitor when a panicked neighbor who had rung his doorbell repeatedly to no avail gave up and called him on the phone.
“The doorbell rang at a time of day when I don't like to open,” Helberg told television

A team of veteran Hudson's Bay executives led by former president and CEO Bonnie Brooks had a plan to keep some stores open, but it didn't materialize.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

A proposal led by former Hudson's Bay Co. executives that would have kept at least two dozen stores open, and saved more than 1,000 jobs, never came to fruition – meaning that, as of this weekend, the country's oldest retailer will cease to exist as Canadians know it.

Shortly after Hudson's Bay filed for court protection from its creditors on March 7 – saying it was running out of cash and struggling under $1.1-billion in debt – a team of eight veteran senior Hudson's Bay executives began discussing a plan to preserve part of the historic retail chain, led by well-known former Bay president and chief executive officer Bonnie Brooks and with backing from a Canadian investor.

The group developed a plan to continue operating 24 to 31 stores across the country, and to rehire at least 1,200 existing employees, with plans to hire more people as time went on. Thousands of people who worked for The Bay are facing unemployment as the retailer permanently winds down its business.

“These stores had all been profitable in recent years and, we believed, could continue to be successful under the right stewardship with the right targeted assortments,” Ms. Brooks wrote in a statement provided to The Globe and Mail. She declined to identify the investor who backed the proposal.

But the group's plan fell short of submitting a formal bid in the court-supervised sales process for the company's assets, according to Reflect Advisors LLC, the financial adviser handling that process. In late April, Reflect received a letter from Canadian apparel executive Brian Cytrynbaum that described an offer of $1 for assets including the company's intellectual property, trademarks, e-commerce operations and customer data. The letter outlined a plan for operating 24 stores.

But a letter does not qualify as a formal bid in the process, which required other elements such as written evidence of an irrevocable commitment for financing, and additional forms to be submitted.

The bid the group discussed with their financial backer was $13.5-million for the assets, Ms. Brooks said. “We have every confidence that our partner submitted our bid, as per our agreed-on bid,” she said. 

Reflect co-founder and managing director Adam Zalev told The Globe that the firm typically would not disclose matters related to the sales process. But he confirmed Reflect never received a $13.5-million offer at any stage of the process.

“Had Reflect had contact with these executives, we would have done whatever we could to try to facilitate a successful going-concern bid, like we did with multiple other parties who contacted Reflect,” Mr. Zalev said in an interview.

Mr. Cytrynbaum did not respond to The Globe's requests for comment.

Ms. Brooks told The Globe that multiple other investors reached out to her group shortly after the news of Hudson's Bay's insolvency in early March, “and we felt it was important to work with a Canadian and we believe our partner to be the right one for many reasons.”

The court-supervised sales process was intended to generate cash that will go toward paying off the company's senior lenders. There were 17 final qualified bids submitted, according to court documents. 

The successful bid came from Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd., which recently announced a $30-million deal for the company's intellectual property, including the Hudson's Bay brand name, various company logos and the iconic stripes design featured on Hudson's Bay point blankets since the 18th century, when they were used in the fur trade. 

While Canadian Tire has not yet confirmed its plans for the trademarks, CEO Greg Hicks recently suggested his company is not interested in operating stand-alone Bay stores, saying during a conference call earlier this month that it was not pursuing “a wholesale acquisition of HBC's operations,” and that this would not be a “good fit” for Canadian Tire. 

But the strategy developed over weeks by the former executives envisioned Hudson's Bay surviving as a department store chain, if a much smaller one.

The plan committed to investing $16.5-million in badly-needed renovations and improvements to the stores. The group had planned to seek matching investments in from landlords for the locations, many of which had fallen behind on repairs and upgrades. According to Ms. Brooks, the team also planned to spend roughly $100-million to purchase inventory to restock the stores. 

Ms. Brooks, a seasoned retail executive who led a financial turnaround at The Bay after joining the company in 2008, says she and her team believed the stores could have been successful in the future. “We had done it before. We knew it could be done again,” she wrote. 

The team included other former executives such as Kerry Mader, who spent more than 40 years with The Bay, including as executive vice-president and chief customer officer. Ms. Brooks would have returned as CEO, while Mr. Mader would have been chief operating officer.

While he was still at Hudson's Bay, Mr. Mader says he advocated for closing underperforming locations and investing to revive the stores that were still viable. 

“We had an opportunity to save this great Canadian institution, and to rebuild it,” Mr. Mader said in an interview.

More than 8,300 Hudson's Bay employees will be out of a job by next week, others to lose disability benefits

Had they been successful, keeping the store locations open would have guaranteed at least $30-million per year in continuing rent payments to Canadian landlords and at least $70-million in annual pay to employees, according to Ms. Brooks.

The group's plan envisioned a potential collaboration with Shopify Inc. to offer digital-only brands for sale in a store environment for the first time; an expanded partnership with designer Brian Gluckstein to offer a broader range of products under the Gluckstein Home brand; and more food and beverage options in stores through a partnership with Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality. 

Separately, inside Hudson's Bay, there were efforts to find investors to back a going-concern plan for some stores. According to a confidential memorandum prepared in March and obtained by The Globe, the company pitched a restructuring plan to potential buyers or investors that would have involved an $82-million investment in the first year to turn around six locations.

In late April, saying there was a “low probability” any financial backer would emerge for that plan, the company announced it was adding the final six stores to its liquidation sales. 

What happens to those empty stores is still under discussion. Last week, Hudson's Bay announced an agreement with a billionaire mall owner in British Columbia to acquire up to 28 store leases, pending consent from landlords and court approval. 

The company is still in talks with bidders about other lease locations, according to the release. Canadian Tire has also bid on some of the store leases. 

When the company filed for creditor protection, it operated 80 Hudson's Bay stores across the country, as well as two Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off 5th stores. Some of those locations have already gone dark, and as of this Sunday, June 1, the last Bay stores will close their doors permanently.

Ms. Brooks wrote that she was disappointed in the results of the process. The team of former Bay executives had hoped for a different outcome.

“To us – and to thousands of former employees and millions of Canadians – this isn't just a brand,” she wrote. “It's a major part of our history. Part of our identity.”

LUGANSK, May 30. /TASS/. By advancing in areas between the Belgorod and Kharkov regions, Russian troops have started to establish a new sector of the buffer zone in this direction, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

Since Russian forces liberated Stroyevka, which is situated near the Russian border, on May 29, they have built on their successes as they advance both north and south of this locality, he said.

""Meanwhile, our fighters have been clearing the border areas. Besides, pressure has intensified on the Ukrainian positions near Otradnoye and Bologovka. From this, we can conclude that a new sector of the buffer zone between the Belgorod and Kharkov regions is currently being established,"" Marochko concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Radiohead frontman makes lengthy statement after he had been criticised over perceived silence on the war, and for previously performing in Israel

After he was criticised for his silence on the subject, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has made a statement regarding the war in Gaza, saying Benjamin Netanyahu and his Israeli administration are “extremists” who “need to be stopped”.

He also criticised Hamas, saying the organisation “chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people”.

In October 2024, he was heckled during a solo concert in Melbourne by a man who asked Yorke: “How could you be silent?” regarding the death toll in the war. A flustered Yorke rebutted him and briefly left the stage.

More broadly, Radiohead have been criticised for performing in Tel Aviv in 2017, with Yorke saying at the time: “Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government.” Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood has recently been criticised for performing with Israeli musician Dudu Tassa, with UK venues cancelling his concerts after protests.

Yorke has now made a statement about the Australian incident and the situation in Gaza, saying the October concert “didn't really seem like the best moment to discuss the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Afterwards, I remained in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity, and I struggled to find an adequate way to respond to this and to carry on with the rest of the shows on the tour.

“That silence, my attempt to show respect for all those who are suffering and those who have died, and to not trivialise it in a few words, has allowed other opportunistic groups to use intimidation and defamation to fill in the blanks, and I regret giving them this chance. This has had a heavy toll on my mental health.”

Yorke said he thought it would be “self-evident” from his music “that I could not possibly support any form of extremism or dehumanisation of others.” He added:

I think Netanyahu and his crew of extremists are totally out of control and need to be stopped, and that the international community should put all the pressure it can on them to cease. Their excuse of self-defence has long since worn thin and has been replaced by a transparent desire to take control of Gaza and the West Bank permanently.

I believe this ultra-nationalist administration has hidden itself behind a terrified & grieving people and used them to deflect any criticism, using that fear and grief to further their ultra-nationalist agenda with terrible consequences, as we see now with the horrific blockade of aid to Gaza …

At the same time the unquestioning Free Palestine refrain that surrounds us all does not answer the simple question of why the hostages have still not all been returned? For what possible reason?

Why did Hamas choose the truly horrific acts of October 7th? The answer seems obvious, and I believe Hamas chooses too to hide behind the suffering of its people, in an equally cynical fashion for their own purposes.

He then turned his focus to “social media witch-hunts” saying that pressure on “artists and whoever they feel like that week to make statements etc do very little except heighten tension, fear and oversimplification of what are complex problems”.

He concluded his lengthy statement by saying: “I have written this in the simple hope that i can join with the many millions of others praying for this suffering, isolation and death to stop, praying that we can collectively regain our humanity and dignity and our ability to reach understanding ... that one day soon this darkness will have passed.”

As well as fronting Radiohead, Yorke has released a number of solo and group projects, including his recent trio featuring Greenwood and drummer Tom Skinner, the Smile.

Radiohead haven't released an album since 2016's A Moon Shaped Pool, but the band members came together last summer to rehearse, ahead of an expected reunion.

Bassist Colin Greenwood, brother of Johnny, told NME: “We got together in the summer just for a couple of days and just ran through all the songs and picked up where we left off in 2018. It was really fun and nice to see everyone. We were going to do three or four days but knocked it on the head after two because it was fine and we could still do it. My brother said that we'd just need a couple of weeks' rehearsal and we could go on the road, no problem.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

France could harden its position on Israel if it continues to block humanitarian aid to Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron said yesterday, reiterating that Paris was committed to a two-state solution to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

“The humanitarian blockade is creating a situation that is untenable on the ground,” Macron said at a joint press conference in Singapore with Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong (黃循財).

“And so, if there is no response that meets the humanitarian situation in the coming hours and days, obviously, we will have to toughen our collective position,” Macron said, adding that France might consider applying sanctions against Israeli settlers.

“But I still hope that the government of Israel will change its stance and that we will finally have a humanitarian response,” he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has hit back at growing international pressure over the war in Gaza, the deadliest fighting in decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

Macron was in Singapore on a state visit and is also to deliver the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security forum, which runs began yesterday and is to run until tomorrow. 

Deep differences between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March. Under growing international pressure, Israel partially ended an 11-week-long aid blockade on Gaza, allowing a limited amount of relief to be delivered via two avenues — the UN or the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

Macron said Paris is committed to working toward a political solution and reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

Macron is leaning towards recognizing a Palestinian state, diplomats and experts said, a move that could infuriate Israel and deepen Western splits.

French President Emmanuel Macron warned the U.S. and a large audience of Indo-Pacific countries Friday night that they risk a dangerous double standard as they concentrate on a potential conflict with China if that shift comes at the cost of abandoning Ukraine.

Macron's made the remarks as the U.S. is considering withdrawing troops from Europe to shift them to the Indo-Pacific. He warned that abandoning Ukraine would eventually erode U.S. credibility in deterring any potential conflict with China over Taiwan.

In a speech that emphasized France's tight ties to the Indo-Pacific, Macron said that any shifts to developing a more hard-line deterrent stance in the region is still tied to how the world – and particularly the West – treats other critical issues, including climate change and Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza.

Ukraine keeps Russia guessing over its participation in June 2 peace talks

“If you consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what would happen in Taiwan, what would you do the day something happened in” the Philippines? he asked in a speech delivered in English.

The speech was notable in that Macron delivered it with U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in the audience and as not only France, but countries around the globe are dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff threats. Both Europe and those same Indo-Pacific nations also find themselves increasingly pulled between the competing interests of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“We want to co-operate. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,” Macron said, in an apparent jab at Trump.

Macron and Hegseth are among the world leaders, diplomats and top defence officials in Singapore this weekend for the region's biggest security forum that comes amid concerns of China's growing assertiveness, the global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the flare-up of conflicts in Asia.

Opinion: Strengthening Canada's relationship with Taiwan is a crucial piece of our geopolitical puzzle

It's Hegseth's first time at the Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, which is taking place against the backdrop of heightened rhetoric between Beijing and Washington. The Trump administration has threatened China with triple-digit tariffs, and there's some uncertainty in the region over how committed the U.S. is to the defence of Taiwan, which also faces possible 32% American tariffs.

China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking it by force. China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, and currently has an aircraft carrier in the waters southeast of the island.

China, which usually sends its defence minister to the Shangri-La forum, sent a much lower-level delegation instead, led by Maj. Gen. Hu Gangfeng, the vice president of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University. The delegation was expected to speak Saturday on a panel on “co-operative maritime security” alongside representatives from Japan, Vietnam, Chile and the U.K. – notable in that China's aggressive global fisheries tactics have been a regular topic of concern not only in the Indo-Pacific but as far away as Latin America and the Arctic.

Defence officials travelling with Hegseth, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, called the absence of a higher-level Chinese delegation an opportunity for the U.S. to make inroads.

“We can't account for whether China engages or not. All we know is that we're here. And we will be here,” Hegseth said as he met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro.

Hegseth's trip to Singapore is his second to the region since becoming defence secretary, following a March visit to the Philippines, which has seen escalating confrontations with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.

That trip, which also included a stop in Japan, brought a degree of relief over growing concerns from the Philippines and others in the region about U.S. support from a president who has taken more of a transactional approach to diplomacy and seems wary of foreign engagements.

The U.S. has been pursuing a “free and open Indo-Pacific” policy, which includes regularly sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which is claimed almost in its entirety by China.

The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France, which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April.

Friday marks Elon Musk's last day in Washington. Donald Trump tanked him for his ""fantastic"" work and said Musk would continue to support his administration informally. DW has more.

Below, you can read a roundup of news from the United States on May 30, 2025:

US President Donald Trump held a press conference together with billionaire Elon Musk, in which he thanked him for his time as a senior advisor to the administration, leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, also known by the internet meme DOGE.

Despite its name, DOGE is not a cabinet-level department.

Trump praised Musk's work as ""fantastic,"" while calling the world's richest man a ""great patriot.""

The US president said Musk will continue to support his administration even after his time as special advisor is done, which was also echoed by the billionaire himself.

""Elon is really not leaving,"" Trump said. ""He's going to be back and forth.""

Elon Musk said he will continue to support the work done by DOGE ""as a friend and an advisor to the president.""

""It's not the end of DOGE, but the beginning,"" Musk said, adding that the office's influence will only grow stronger.

""I'm confident we'll see trillions of dollars of savings overtime.""

The Supreme Court allowed the Trumpadministration to strip temporary legal protections from more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. 

This brings the number of people who could be exposed to deportation to almost one million.

The Court put on hold a federal judge's order halting the administration's move to end the so-called ""parole"" granted to 532,000 of the migrants from the four countries by previous US President Joe Biden.

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said the bloc is ""fully invested"" in reaching a deal with the United States to avoid sweeping tariffs.

""Our time and effort fully invested, as delivering forward-looking solutions remains a top EU priority. Staying in permanent contact,"" Sefcovic said in a post on social media platfrom X after speaking with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. 

The EU is seeking an end to 25% tariffs on steel and cars and for Trump to drop his so-called ""reciprocal"" tariff. It was provisionally set at 20% for the EU but is being held at 10% during a 90-day pause until July.

Trump threatened last Friday, but then postponed, to slap EU goods with a huge tariff, in a sign of increasing frustration that talks with the EU were ""going nowhere.""

US President Donald Trump is set to bid farewell to his billionaire adviser Elon Musk with a press event in the Oval Office on Friday.

""This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social media platform on Thursday. 

""Elon is terrific! See you tomorrow at the White House,"" Trump said.

Musk has been heading up the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE that has been behind the drastic federal workforce cuts.

Over a month ago, Musk indicated that from May onwards, he would be spending ""significantly"" less time working as Trump's cost-cutter and focus on his e-car company Tesla, which has posted plunging sales figures.

Musk claimed that DOGE had saved taxpayers $160 billion although the numbers have been questioned, with some suggesting that some savings had been double-counted.

It hasn't been a smooth 130 days in Washington, with Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution telling AFP news agency the beginning of the end ""started (in) mid-March when there were several meetings in the Oval Office and in the cabinet room where basically Elon Musk got into fights.""

Musk publicly called Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro ""dumber than a sack of bricks."" 

As indicated by Trump in his social media post, this doesn't appear to be the end of things.

""I think they genuinely like each other and I think Musk has a lot of money that he can contribute to campaigns if he is so moved. I think there will be a continued relation,"" Kamarck told AFP. 

Elon Musk has finished his time as a ""special government employee,"" with US President Donald Trump saying an Oval Office press event is planned for Friday to bid the Tesla billionaire farewell.

Musk has claimed his cost cutting measures at the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE have saved taxpayers $160 billion (€141 billion), although the sum has been questioned. Democrats in particular have argued that Elon Musk and DOGE have no authority to make the spending cuts.  

We're also following the EU saying its ""fully invested"" in reaching a deal with the Trump administration to avoid sweeping US tariffs.

			Billionaire said to have mixed drug with other narcotics, and also used ecstasy and magic mushrooms

Elon Musk's consumption of ketamine led him to develop bladder problems around the same time he endorsed Donald Trump, according to people close to him.

Mr Musk, 53, the world's richest man, went on to become a central figure in the Trump White House, leading an initiative to slash spending and shrink the federal workforce.

He was using ketamine on an almost daily basis and mixing it with other narcotics, people familiar with his consumption told The New York Times.

He also took ecstasy and magic mushrooms, they said, blurring the line between medical and recreational use in a way that worried his friends.

Mr Musk has spoken openly about his drug use, saying that he took “a small amount” of ketamine, about once a fortnight, as a prescribed treatment for black moods.

Hours before he was due to appear in the Oval Office beside Mr Trump for a farewell news conference on Friday, The Times quoted multiple sources saying his drug use went much further.

They described how Mr Musk travelled with a daily pill box, holding about 20 tablets, including ones that resembled the stimulant Adderall.

“Elon has pushed the boundaries of his bad behaviour more and more,” said Philip Low, a neuroscientist and former friend of Mr Musk's who spoke out against him after a “Nazi-like” salute at a rally.

The report said it was unclear whether his drug use had followed him into the White House.

But the bizarre salute was just one element of his unusual behaviour as he moved to the centre of power. He publicly insulted cabinet members, garbled answers in an interview, and lost his train of thought during Oval Office appearances in front of the camera.

At the same time, he has been the subject of frenzied headlines about his complicated family life, with a growing number of children with multiple women.

He announced on Wednesday that he was leaving his role in government to return to his businesses.

Mr Musk and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

But he has in the past discussed his drug use, explaining how he had been prescribed ketamine for depression.

“I really don't like doing illegal drugs,” he told his biographer.

SpaceX, his aerospace company, is a major government contractor and is required to keep drugs out of the workplace. However, people close to the business claimed that Mr Musk had been given advance warning of supposedly random tests.

Board members at his electric car company Tesla also raised concerns about his use of drugs, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Mr Musk played down any impact on his work. He told the reporter Don Lemon last year that he used “a small amount” of ketamine.

“If you've used too much ketamine, you can't really get work done, and I have a lot of work,” he said.

Mr Musk threw himself into politics last summer, endorsing Mr Trump after the Republican candidate survived an assassination attempt.

They appeared together on stage in October, when Mr Musk bounded on to the stage, leaping in the air.

The two quickly formed a close working relationship. After the election, Mr Musk even lived in a cottage on the Mar-a-Lago estate, helping build the administration and fleshing out his plans for a tech-led effort to slash the federal bureaucracy.

Former friends began to raise concerns about his behaviour.

Sam Harris, a public intellectual, published a newsletter accusing him of using his social media platform to promote lies.

“There is something seriously wrong with his moral compass, if not his perception of reality,” he wrote.

Stephen Miller, a key Trump aide, shrugged off concerns about Mr Musk's alleged drug use. “The drugs that we're concerned about are the drugs running across the southern border,” he said when asked about the reports.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of ketamine only for medical procedures although doctors with a special licence are allowed to prescribe it for some medical procedures.

But its dangers were highlighted by the death of actor Matthew Perry in 2023.

			Members scrutinising Peter Navarro after ‘smack in face' court ruling halting levies

The architect of Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs is facing scrutiny from cabinet members after the levies were halted by judges.

A New York court ruled on Wednesday that Mr Trump's “liberation day” tariffs were illegal and overstepped the authority of the Oval Office.

The ruling is a “huge smack in the face” for Peter Navarro, one of the president's closest advisers, a source close to the White House told The Telegraph.

Members of Mr Trump's cabinet are now closely scrutinising Mr Navarro, who is widely viewed as the architect of the president's tariff scheme.

“Navarro has been given enough rope to hang himself,” the source said.

The Manhattan-based Court of International Trade on Wednesday ruled that the US president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the United States than they buy.

The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate trade with other countries and cannot be overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the US economy.

The administration won a temporary reprieve on Thursday with an appeals court temporarily blocking the previous ruling halting tariffs.

Mr Trump has claimed broad authority to issue tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is meant to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during a national emergency.

Mr Navarro is understood to have counselled the president to use the IEEPA to implement the measures.

The law, which Mr Trump is the first president to use to implement tariffs, has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets.

A source close to the White House said Mr Navarro will face backlash over the decision from within Mr Trump's cabinet, potentially paving the way for him to be replaced by Robert Lighthizer, the president's former trade secretary.

Mr Lighthizer sparked a trade war with Beijing during Mr Trump's first term by imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.

The international trade lawyer was a key adviser to the president's 2024 campaign but was passed over for a cabinet position in the administration.

Shortly after the court ruling, which quashes the tariffs Mr Trump imposed on Canada, Mexico and China, the White House filed a notice of appeal.

“We think we have a strong case. Yes, we will immediately appeal and try to stay the ruling,” Mr Navarro confirmed to Bloomberg.

He added that the court ruling showed the White House could also use alternative legal methods to impose a baseline 10 per cent tariff and higher reciprocal duties on other countries.

“So nothing has really changed here in that sense... We are still, as we speak, having countries call us and tell us they want a deal,” Mr Navarro said. “These deals are going to happen.”

Mr Navarro served as a trade adviser during Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign and has long advocated for a radically protectionist trade policy.

He spent four months in jail last year for contempt of Congress after he refused to cooperate with an investigation into the Jan 6 riots.

Addressing the trade court's slap down, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, blamed the decision on “activist judges” and called for the Supreme Court to intervene.

The ruling was handed down by a three-judge panel, who were nominated to the court under the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and Mr Trump.

“There is a troubling and dangerous trend of unelected judges inserting themselves into the presidential decision making process,” Ms Leavitt said.

“America cannot function if president Trump, or any other president for that matter, has their sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations railroaded by activist judges.”

She added: “But ultimately, the Supreme Court must put an end to this for the sake of our Constitution.”

The president's call for a policy of “remigration” has been embraced by far right groups in Europe.

Eight months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly called for a policy of “remigration” — a term that's become a rallying cry among far-right groups in Europe and sparked comparisons to ethnic cleansing — the U.S. State Department said Thursday that it plans to create an office devoted to the project, with refugee aid resources diverted to Trump's rapidly accelerating mass deportation campaign.

A State Department official told Axios that the proposed creation of the Office of Remigration would be part of a broad reorganization of the agency, with a division that resettled Afghan people who supported the U.S. during the 20-year occupation of Afghanistan eliminated.

A proposal sent to Congress detailed how the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's immigration work would be consolidated into three offices, including the Office of Remigration, to shift the bureau's focus “towards supporting the administration's efforts to return illegal aliens to their country of origin or legal status.”

The office would be a “hub for immigration issues and repatriation tracking,” according to the proposal.

Trump first called for a “remigration” program in September 2024 ahead of the presidential election, saying he would “return Kamala [Harris]'s illegal migrants to their home countries” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

The comment came amid his attacks on Haitian legal residents in Springfield, Ohio and Venezuelan migrants, claiming the U.S. was under an “invasion” and saying he would “ship them back to their country.”

His use of the term remigration went largely unremarked on by the corporate media, said the news analysis group Media Matters at the time, but Zeteo founder Mehdi Hasan noted that Trump was “calling for the ethnic cleansing of legal immigrants in the United States.”

The term has been embraced by far-right groups in Europe including Alternative for Germany and Austria's Freedom Party, which called for the European Union to appoint a remigration commissioner last year.

Remigration policy has long been promoted by Austrian far-right activist Martin Sellner, who had communications with the white supremacist who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. Sellner has denied involvement in the attacks.

On his website, Wired reported on Thursday, Sellner “lays out a three-phase plan to implement remigration” that includes “striking similarities to Trump's current immigration policies”:

The primary aim of this phase is “stopping the invasion.” The Trump administration, invoking the Alien Enemies Act in March, cited an alleged “invasion” by a Venezuelan gang as a source of authority to take unprecedented steps to remove migrants from the U.S.

Sellner's website also lists a number of “tools” that can be used to achieve remigration, which includes “stop family reunification” — something Trump was doing even in his first term in office. In the first phase, Sellner also encourages governments to “create an ultimatum and economic incentives to self-deport.” The Trump administration is already purportedly offering undocumented immigrants a stipend of $1,000 if they use the CBP Home App to self deport.

Sellner adds that governments should “cut humanitarian aid” to force immigrants to stop entering the country. Last month, the Trump administration attempted to cut legal aid to unaccompanied migrant children, only for a court to temporarily block its efforts.

Julia Ebner, a researcher with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the University of Oxford, told The Guardian last year that the term “sounds a lot more benign than what it actually stands for. Because, particularly in the context of Germany and Austria, there is still a very strong association of the term mass deportation with the Holocaust.”

Far-right lawmakers and activists from the U.S., Germany, Ireland, and France were among more than 400 attendees at the first-ever Remigration Summit near Milan earlier this month. Jacky Eubanks, who was endorsed by Trump during her 2022 run for the Michigan House of Representatives, claimed in a speech at the summit that Europeans were the “founding stock” of the U.S., disregarding the existence of indigenous people across the continent.

The State Department is planning to open the Office of Remigration as the administration ramps up its mass deportation operations, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller informing immigration officials last week that federal agents should begin arresting 3,000 immigrants per day — tripling numbers from earlier this year.

The push has coincided with mandates for federal law enforcement agents to assist in raids and arrests and the targeting of people at formerly protected locations like courthouses.

“We're seeing the Trump administration take the unprecedented step of arresting non-citizens who are following the government's rules and procedures, and showing up for their court hearings,” Nayna Gupta, the policy director for the American Immigration Council, told The Guardian on Thursday. “They are desperate to reach a certain number of arrests per day. And the only way they can find non-citizens easily and quickly is to go to the courthouses, where [immigrants] are doing exactly what they're supposed to do.”

The Washington Post reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement in more than 20 states have been directed to arrest people at courthouses during court proceedings.

“The Trump administration is pressuring judges in immigration courtrooms to function more like cogs in the mass deportation machinery rather than as fair and balanced arbiters of the law,” Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the Post. “That is not the way Americans want and understand our judicial system to work. Immigration judges should be worried about this.”

Gupta said the administration is “doubling down” on its “illusion that they had been given a broad mandate to effectuate an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.”

Less than a third of Americans in a March Gallup poll agreed with Trump's stated goal of removing all undocumented immigrants from the United States; those who said “some” undocumented immigrants should be deported said that committing violent crimes should be a prerequisite for removal.

“Public polling is showing decreasing support for Trump's immigration agenda,” said Gupta, “as Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means arrests of our neighbors and friends, masked agents in our communities, and people afraid to go to work and show up to school, in ways that undermine our local economies.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Live Updates


            • Musk's departure: President Donald Trump and Elon Musk spoke in the Oval Office today as the tech billionaire's formal government role ends, with Trump heaping praise on Musk's work to overhaul government spending and both men indicating Musk will still serve as an informal adviser. The Tesla CEO has acknowledged this week that he sometimes finds himself at odds with administration decisions.
    


            • Steel deal: Trump will be in Pennsylvania tonight for an event touting the new partnership between US Steel and the Japan-based Nippon Steel, which he says will keep the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.
    


            • Tariffs reinstated: ﻿A federal appeals court temporarily restored Trump's ability to levy tariffs using the emergency powers he declared this year while the case goes through the courts. The pause adds to the confusion and uncertainty swirling around Trump's trade policy.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he was “surprised” and “disappointed” by recent Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, but stopped short of labeling President Vladimir Putin a “bad guy” when pressed by a reporter in the Oval Office.
    


            “We were going to solve a problem, and then all of a sudden, rockets got shot into a couple of cities and people died,” Trump said.
    


            “I saw things that I was surprised at, and I don't like being surprised, so I'm very disappointed,” he added, sidestepping a direct answer when asked whether he now views Putin “as the good guy or the bad guy.”
    


            Trump went on to express concern over the human toll of the conflict.
    


            When asked how his administration is managing “a very stubborn Vladimir Putin,” Trump was quick to interject and include Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in the characterization.
    


            “And Zelensky, too,” he said.
    


            Trump spoke with Putin on the phone last week, and the Russian leader reportedly committed to drafting and sending a “memorandum of peace” detailing Russia's conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official and a White House source familiar with the matter. However, more than a week after the call, the U.S. has yet to receive the promised document, the sources said.
    


            In response to the continued violence, Trump is now weighing additional sanctions on Moscow, according to individuals familiar with the situation, as he vents his frustration over the stalled peace process.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he wants to get rid of the debt limit and emphasized the dangers of default — a turnaround from his stance on the topic when President Joe Biden was still in office.
    


            “If we don't extend debt, we're in default. Now, the Democrats might like our country to be in default, but in 250 years, we've never been in default,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
    


            In a May 2023 town hall with CNN, then-candidate Trump said he believed the US should default if the Biden White House didn't agree to spending cuts.
    


            “It's psychological,” Trump said of a default at the time. “It's really psychological more than anything else. And it could be really bad, it could be maybe nothing. Maybe it's a … you have a bad week or a bad day.”
    


            In a 2016 interview on CNBC, the then-presumptive Republican nominee seemed to suggest that rather than pay its outstanding national debt in full, the country could renegotiate.
    


            Trump's changing demands on the debt ceiling also caused chaos last December, when he demanded Republicans try to use a government spending bill to increase the debt limit at the last minute. Trump made it clear he wanted the debt ceiling raised under Biden, rather than having to deal with it once he was president.
    


            Ultimately, the spending legislation passed Congress without a debt ceiling provision. Now, the GOP is trying to raise the limit under Trump's “one big, beautiful bill,” which is currently moving through Congress.
    


            Today, Trump brought up Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's calls to get rid of the debt ceiling and said, “I always agreed with her.” Most Republicans adamantly oppose that idea, believing it would lead to more spending.
    


            “She happened to be right on that. It should be gotten rid of or it should simply be extended,” Trump said. “But that's one of the things it gets taken care of in this bill — that automatically gets extended for a four-year period.”
    


            Elon Musk dodged a question in the Oval Office today about a New York Times report that said the tech billionaire used drugs more extensively than previously known.
    


            Musk interrupted the reporter and questioned the credibility of The Times before saying “let's move on.”
    


            “The New York Times? Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate? Is it the same organization? I think it is,” Musk said. “So I think they, I think the judge just ruled against New York Times for the their lies about the Russiagate hoax, and that they might have to give back their Pulitzer Prize. That New York Times? Let's move on.”
    


What you need to know about the report: The New York Times on Friday reported Musk — who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding under the Department of Government Efficiency — was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities.
    


            The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year.
    


            In a 2024 interview with Don Lemon, Musk acknowledged he took “a small amount” of ketamine to treat negative moods, under a prescription, but that a heavy workload prevented him from using too much. But the Times reports Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar.
    


            CNN has reached out to Musk's representative. Neither Musk nor his lawyer responded to the Times' request for comment about his drug use.
    


            President Donald Trump said Elon Musk is “really not leaving” and that he believes the tech billionaire will still be “back and forth” during remarks from the Oval Office on Musk's final day as a special government employee.
    


            “Elon is really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth. I think, I have a feeling — it's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things,” Trump said as he praised the Tesla CEO's work in the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            The president emphasized that the department's work will continue and praised Musk for delivering what he called a “colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington.”
    


            “But Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history. He's already running one of the most innovative car companies in the world,” the president added. “Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind, too, so they're not leaving,” Trump continued.
    


            During their joint appearance in the Oval Office, Trump presented Musk with a gift as part of his official send-off from federal service. “As a presentation from our country. Thank you, Elon. Take care of yourself,” Trump said as he handed Musk a ceremonial key.
    


Some background: Trump's praise for Musk comes amid recent tension following an interview in which the tech billionaire said he has some “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration but feels “a little stuck in a bind” when disagreements arise, not wanting to publicly speak out against them.
    


            Musk oversaw a massive transformation in the size and scope of the federal government through DOGE, with at least 121,000 federal workers laid off or targeted for layoffs in Trump's first 100 days and thousands more taking buyout offers.
    


            Still, the efforts fell short of his stated goal of saving $1 trillion in government spending.
    


            Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the Oval Office today that he still expects “over time” to achieve his promise that the Department of Government Efficiency will deliver a trillion dollars in cuts to the federal government.
    


            During his time as a “special government employee,” Musk oversaw DOGE's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to vastly reduce federal spending. While he initially boasted that he could cut $2 trillion from the nation's roughly $6.8 trillion federal budget, he eventually walked that back to $1 trillion — and reportedly seemed to lower the total to $150 billion for the coming fiscal year at a Cabinet meeting last month.
    


            Reflecting on his time heading DOGE, the billionaire said identifying cuts takes “a lot of hard work.”
    


            “It's just a lot of work going through the vast expenses of the federal government and just really asking questions,” he said.
    


Continuing role: During his appearance alongside President Donald Trump today, Musk said he still intends to give the president advice even as he closes out his time in the administration.
    


            “I expect to continue to provide advice, whenever the president would like advice,” Musk said in response to a question from a reporter.
    


            “I hope so,” Trump chimed in.
    


            “I expect to remain a friend and an adviser and certainly, if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's service,” Musk added.
    


            President Donald Trump weighed in Friday on a video that appeared to capture French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, pushing his face as he was about to disembark a plane in Hanoi, Vietnam.
    


            Asked for marital advice for his French counterpart, Trump paused before saying, “Make sure the door remains closed.”
    


            Trump appeared to indicate that he spoke to Macron after the incident, which he described as “not good.”
    


            “That was not good. No. I spoke to him and he's fine, they're fine, they're two really good people,” Trump said of the Macrons, with whom he and first lady Melania Trump have spent significant time.
    


            He added, “I don't know what that was all about, but I know them well, they're fine.”
    


            Macron dismissed the situation, telling reporters, “There's a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he would “look at the facts” of the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial before considering a pardon if the music mogul is convicted.
    


            Asked about a potential pardon, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he hasn't been watching the trial closely.
    


            “I haven't seen him, I haven't spoken to him in years,” Trump said about Combs, whom he had called a good friend on his show “The Apprentice.”
    


            “He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics, he sort of, that relationship busted up,” Trump said.
    


            But he later added: “If I think somebody was mistreated, whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact on me.”
    


            President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are appearing together at an event in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that today is Musk's “last day.”



            The tech billionaire announced Wednesday his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” Musk oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, which made major cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to vastly reduce federal spending.
    


            Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday that he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions.
    


            He also has criticized the GOP's “big, beautiful bill” advancing Trump's domestic policy agenda for increasing the deficit.
    


            President Donald Trump announced today that he is removing Kim Sajet as director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing his concerns over her political leanings and support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
    


            “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am herby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery. She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
    


            Sajet, who has led the Smithsonian-affiliated institution since 2013, is the first woman to serve in that role. Trump's statement did not cite specific incidents or provide evidence of partisanship.
    


            Trump did not offer any names or a timeline for a replacement.
    


            CNN has reached out to Portrait Gallery for comment.
    


            The new US ceasefire proposal for an end to hostiles between Israel and Hamas calls for negotiations on a permanent end to the war beginning on day one — and promises President Donald Trump's support in the process.
    


            The proposal, viewed by CNN, includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began.
    


            Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the ceasefire under US envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the proposal. If Israel and Hamas fail to reach an agreement for a permanent ceasefire by the end of the 60-day period, the pause in fighting “may be extended under conditions and for a duration to be agreed upon by the parties so long as the parties are negotiating in good faith,” the proposal says.
    


            But the agreement contains no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, a key Hamas demand, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Instead, the proposal says that Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.”
    


            The US, Egypt and Qatar would guarantee the ceasefire agreement, according to the proposal.
    


                    The proposal also appears to stipulate that Trump would take credit for a deal. “President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement,” it says.
                





            President Donald Trump pushed back against a preliminary report from the Congressional Budget Office that his administration's massive spending bill would add trillions to the deficit, taking to Truth Social to blast the agency today.
    


            He took particular issue with the CBO's estimate that GDP would grow an average of 1.8% annually over the next 10 years.
    


            “The Democrat inspired and ‘controlled' Congressional Budget Office (CBO) purposefully gave us an EXTREMELY LOW level of Growth, 1.8% over 10 years. How ridiculous and unpatriotic is that!” Trump said. “They did the same thing to us in 2017, and we DOUBLED their numbers. The information they recently released is even more absurd and indefensible. I predict we will do 3, 4, or even 5 times the amount they purposefully ‘allotted' to us (1.8%) and, with just our minimum expected 3% Growth, we will more than offset our Tax Cuts (which will, in actuality, cost us no money!).”
    


            Trump's “big, beautiful bill” includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security spending – largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs.
    


            The nonpartisan CBO has estimated that the tax portion of the bill would pile another $3.8 trillion to the deficit. The legislation narrowly passed the House last week, and is now being considered by the Senate, where it will likely face many changes.



            The Trump administration and Chinese officials are discussing setting up a call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, two senior White House officials told CNN, adding that the White House believes a call is the necessary next step to revive trade negotiations.
    


            The two officials said the president is not currently considering re-imposing tariffs of 145% on China if Xi continues to not live up to the commitments struck in Geneva earlier this month.
    


            However, Trump's economic officials have told the president that there are “other tools at our disposal, other ways to hurt China” if the country continues to avoid fully complying with the terms of the deal.
    


            The official said one of main options being considered includes leveraging export controls over Chinese goods, controlled by the Commerce Department.
    


            Trump blasted China in a Truth Social post this morning, saying the country “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today that the White House will not use the conservative Federalist Society to make judicial picks moving forward, blasting what he called “rogue judges” who've blocked the administration's domestic policies.
    


                    “You heard President Trump himself say that the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo have created a broken system for judicial vetting,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown. “What it means is simply this, and nothing more: We're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.”
                





            Trump himself took to Truth Social yesterday to blast former Federalist Society head Leonard Leo as “a real ‘sleazebag'” and a “a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America.”
    


            He added: “I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.”
    


            Miller wouldn't say what checks and balances he believes should be in place to curtail the power of the executive branch, telling CNN, “It is not the job of a district court judge to perform an individual green light or red light on every single policy that the president takes as the head of the executive branch.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN Friday he has no concerns over a New York Times report that Elon Musk used drugs more extensively than previously known.
    


            “I don't have any concerns, but also I believe there's a press conference today with Elon Musk, so everyone will be having an opportunity to ask these questions themselves,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown in an interview.
    


            He quickly pivoted to complimenting Musk's efforts to cut government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            “All I can say is that DOGE has done an extraordinary job rooting out systemic waste, graft, grift, and corruption from the federal government, and you're going to hear from the President today, his thanks to Elon Musk for leading that effort to save taxpayers billions of dollars,” Miller added.
    


            The New York Times on Friday reported that Musk – who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding – was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities.
    


            The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year.
    


            In a 2024 interview with Don Lemon, Musk acknowledged he took “a small amount” of ketamine to treat negative moods, under a prescription, but that a heavy workload prevented him from using too much. But the Times reported that Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar.
    


            CNN has reached out to Musk's representative. Neither Musk nor his lawyer responded to the Times' request for comment about his drug use.
    


            On Friday, Miller – whose wife Katie Miller, a top adviser and spokesperson for DOGE, also left her position and is now working with Musk – wouldn't say if drug testing was required for Musk during his tenure as special government employee.
    


            “The drugs I'm concerned about are the drugs that are coming across the border from the criminal cartels that are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans,” Miller told CNN.
    


            President Donald Trump will travel to Pennsylvania today to tout a partnership between US Steel and the Japan-based Nippon Steel that he says will keep the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.
    


            Trump announced the deal last week on Truth Social, saying it will draw $14 billion in investment toward the US economy and create at least 70,000 jobs.
    


            But Trump's post included few details about what's included in the deal, such as whether this is truly a partnership instead of an acquisition and how much control would remain with US Steel.
    


Some background: Former President Joe Biden blocked the $14.3 billion acquisition during his last week in office. The deal has been controversial since it was first announced in December 2023, with both sides of the political aisle opposing foreign control of a once-key component of US industrial might that has fallen on hard times.
    


            Trump found rare convergence with Biden when he also began his term opposed to an outright deal. But in March, the Trump administration signaled it may allow the deal to go through after it filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit US Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks.
    


            The committee launched a review into the acquisition in April, and submitted a recommendation to Trump on whether any of the measures proposed by the companies would mitigate national security risks, Reuters reported.
    


            Nippon raised its investment pledge in US Steel's operations to $14 billion, which would include a new $4 billion steel mill in the US, if its bid was greenlit, according to Reuters.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era parole program that allowed a half million immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to temporarily live and work in the United States.
    


            It was the second time this month that the high court sided with Trump's efforts to revoke temporary legal status for immigrants. The Supreme Court previously cleared the way for the administration to revoke another temporary program that provided work permits to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
    


            The court's brief order was not signed. Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the decision.
    


            Though the emergency decision from the Supreme Court is not final – the underlying legal case will continue in lower courts – the order will allow the administration to expedite deportations for those who had previously benefited from the program.

            Elon Musk said he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions – his latest comments as he exits the administration.
    


                    “It's not like I agree with everything the administration does,” Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday. “So, it's like I agree with much of what the administration does, but we have differences of opinion.”
                





            He continued, “There are things I don't entirely agree with. But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't want to, you know, speak up against the administration, but I don't want to … take responsibility for everything the administration's doing.”
    


            The tech billionaire announced Wednesday his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” Musk oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, which made major cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to reduce federal spending.
    


            Musk also raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by DOGE.
    


            President Donald Trump lashed out against conservative legal activist Leonard Leo yesterday, lambasting the former head of the Federalist Society as “a real ‘sleazebag'” and “a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America,” in a post to his Truth Social platform.
    


            The post followed a three-judge panel – including a judge he appointed to the bench – blocking enforcement of his administration's tariffs Wednesday night. An appeals court the next day temporarily reinstated the administration's powers to levy broad tariffs while the case is pending.
    


            “[Leo] openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court – I hope that is not so, and don't believe it is!” Trump wrote. “In any event, Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own ‘thing.' I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a CNN interview this morning that “we're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.”
    


            Leo and the Federalist Society were instrumental during Trump's first term in assembling a list of conservative judges for judicial appointments. In a 2016 interview, Trump touted his work with the organization, telling a conservative radio host he “actually got the names from the Federalist [Society], and that's considered pretty much the gold standard.”
    


            And in 2019 remarks marking his administration's judicial confirmations, Trump offered effusive praise for Leo's work with the administration on confirming conservative judges.
    


            In a statement responding to Trump's post, Leo wrote: “I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved. There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.”
    


            Still, Trump's ire for the group did not seem to extend to his more recent judicial picks. Of the six judicial nominees he announced Wednesday, two – Ed Artau and Jordan Pratt – are Federalist Society members.
    


            United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Friday he's going to speak with his European Union counterpart next week to discuss an EU trade deal.
    


            “I would say that when it comes to the trade deficit, China is the biggest problem but the EU is right behind them, and when it comes to non-tariff barriers, certainly we have that in China, but we also have that in the EU with respect to their standards on industrial goods and ag (agriculture), where they effectively block a lot of our products,” Greer told CNBC.
    


            “Obviously, with China, you have a geopolitical layer on top of that, where their geopolitical goals are different and at odds with ours, and so that's its own challenge when it comes to the pure economics. I mean, we have problems with all kinds of countries, friend or foe, and we're trying to resolve those.”
    


            Greer said President Donald Trump's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week “went very well,” adding that the EU was “responsive” to trade talks, but criticized the EU for an ongoing trade deficit.
    


            “There is a very long list of problems in US-EU trade, where the EU has enjoyed very broad market access to the United States, and the EU, on its end, has somewhat higher tariffs than the US,” he said. “And they have these non-tariff barriers. … These are things that have gone on for a really long time, and that's why the EU, you know, it's one reason why the EU has a $240 billion surplus with us.”
    


            “It's not because they're competitive — we had come out several months ago saying how the EU is not competitive. So, the fact that they, despite that, managed have a huge surplus with the US certainly shows there's a structural problem there that needs to be resolved,” he added.
    


            President Donald Trump announced yesterday on social media that he will have an event from the Oval Office with tech billionaire Elon Musk on today.
    


                    “I am having a Press Conference (Friday) at 1:30 P.M. EST, with Elon Musk, at the Oval Office. This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way. Elon is terrific! See you tomorrow at the White House.” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            Musk was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. He said Wednesday that his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.”

Follow:


China will not send its defense minister to this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, shunning a chance for a high-level meeting with US and Asian counterparts as tensions simmer with Washington.
    


            China announced Thursday it will instead be represented by a delegation from the People's Liberation Army National Defense University, marking the first time in five years a high-level delegation from Beijing will miss Asia's largest defense and security forum.
    


            The United States will be represented by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the event, which often provides opportunities on the sidelines for rare face-to-face meetings between top generals and defense officials from the US and China.
    


            Last year then-US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun on the sidelines of the event and the two pledged to continue a US-China dialogue amid simmering military tensions over Taiwan and Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.
    


            Beijing's decision not to send Dong this year throws into question whether there will be any meeting between the US and China at a time of heightened tensions between the two.
    


            China has railed against America's efforts in recent years to tighten its alliances and defense posture in Asia, while economic frictions rose to historic levels earlier this year after US President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on China sparked a tit-for-tat between the two countries that saw duties rise to more than 100% on each other's goods.
    


            While the two sides announced a temporary tariff truce earlier this month, tensions flared against this week. On Wednesday, two days before the forum's opening, the US aimed a shock double punch targeting software exports to Chinese tech companies and study visas granted to Chinese students, risking a fragile trade war truce between Washington and Beijing.
    


            At a Chinese Defense Ministry press conference on Thursday, a spokesperson ducked a question on why Beijing was not sending its defense minister to the Singapore forum, expected to be attended by defense chiefs from around Asia, including many more closely tied to Washington than Beijing.
    


            China was “open to communication at all levels between the two sides,” a ministry spokesperson said when asked about a potential sidelines meeting with the US delegation.
    


            China's downgrading of its Shangri-La delegation showed Beijing was not happy with Washington, a US defense official told CNN on Thursday.
    


            “They're torqued at us,” the official said.
    


            “It's a signal that they are concerned about the level of engagement, specifically with the United States, to send a message that everything is not completely normal within that and there's probably some other underlying reasons about just uncertainty about what Shangri-La is intended to accomplish,” the official said.
    


            China has traditionally had few friends at Shangri-La, where its speakers face real-time, unscripted questioning from journalists and academics attending the conference.
    


            “Beijing always wants to control the narrative and discourse. Shangri-La does not enable that,” said Drew Thompson, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
    


            Last year, Defense Minister Dong faced tough questions after, in a Friday note keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea in an apparent allusion to China.
    


            China's military has also been in the spotlight in recent years as its top ranks have been roiled by a sweeping corruption purge, with more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China's defense establishment ousted since 2023.
    


            Analysts said the absence of a high-level Chinese delegation at the defense meeting may signal Beijing is emphasizing economics and trade over military relations in its foreign affairs at this time.
    


            “While surely security engagements such as the SLD (Shangri-La Dialogue) … do matter in the broader scheme of geopolitics, at this juncture it seems regional governments are perhaps even more concerned about the tariff impact on their economies,” said Collin Koh, also an RSIS research fellow.
    


            Ahead of the weekend conference, much attention has focused on how US-led alliances across the region that grew during the Biden administration would hold up under Trump's second term.
    


            There was broad consensus among analysts that unlike the turmoil Trump has caused in Europe – with threats to pull back from NATO and abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion – the US role in Asia has largely been consistent, centered on a policy to counter Chinese influence and back Taiwan.

            Hegseth's first trip to Asia as Defense Secretary began in the Philippines – on the front lines of China's increasingly aggressive posture in Asia – where he said the US would work with allies to “reestablish deterrence” to counter “China's aggression” in the Indo-Pacific.
    


            On Friday, during an early morning workout with sailors aboard a US Navy ship in Singapore, he had a similar message:
    


            “We send the signal to our allies and partners, hey, here in the Indo Pacific, America's here, and we're not going anywhere. We're here to deter adversaries who would seek us harm.” Analysts noted that US-led military exercises, especially those involving key allies Japan, Australia, the Philippines and South Korea, have continued or even been bolstered in 2025.
    


            A US Pacific Command spokesperson told CNN there would be 120 bilateral or multilateral exercises involving US forces in the Indo-Pacific this year.
    


            But while increased US involvement is welcome by those participating in such exercises, Washington must be careful they don't aggravate China so much that new tensions threaten the security of regional nations that are not US treaty allies, said Evan Laksmana, editor of the 2025 Asia Pacific Regional Security Assessment compiled by the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
    


            “The deepening of US security engagement is welcome but not so far on the strategic side that it raises tensions,” he said.
    


            On Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang said China “attaches great importance to the military relations” with the US, but warned Washington against “conjuring up a powerful enemy for itself whether intentionally or unintentionally.”
    


            “Such imagination is not rational and extremely dangerous,” Zhang said.
    


            Thompson, the RSIS researcher, said an extra irritant for China at this year's Dialogue is the large European contingent in attendance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who gave the keynote speech on Friday night.
    


            “China's support for Russia (in its war in Ukraine) has hugely impacted its relationship with Europe, which finds it harder and harder to ignore evidence of China's support for Russia's war machine, making a public tongue-lashing very likely,” Thompson said.
    


            “This makes for an awkward environment for a high-level PLA officer trying to manage and improve relations in Asia. If you can't win, don't join them.”
    


            In his speech, Macron called out Beijing as holding a double standard on what is expected in Europe and what is expected in Asia.
    


            He noted China has expressed opposition for any expansion of NATO to Asia, but not criticized North Korea's military support for Russia in its war in Ukraine.
    


            “If China doesn't want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia or Asia, then they should prevent clearly the DPRK (North Korea) from being involved on European soil,” Macron said.

MARSEILLE, France (AP) — The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: “I want to be what you saw in me.”

Banksy had struck again.

On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account — without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue Félix Frégier, in the Catalans district of Marseille's 7th arrondissement, near the sea.

Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.

There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable — a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.

The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light — the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.

Marseille's mayor, Benoît Payan, was quick to react online. “Marseille x Banksy,” he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.




Though often political, Banksy's art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.

The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, “Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.”

His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.

In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.

Despite the fame — or infamy — at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn't even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.

On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior. 

And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.

But the Marseille mural wasn't meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that's already circling the world.

SINGAPORE (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron warned the United States and a large audience of Indo-Pacific nations on Friday night that they risk a dangerous double standard as they concentrate on a potential conflict with China, if that shift comes at the cost of abandoning Ukraine. 

Macron's made the remarks as the U.S. is considering withdrawing troops from Europe to shift them to the Indo-Pacific. He warned that abandoning Ukraine would eventually erode U.S. credibility in deterring any potential conflict with China over Taiwan. 

In a speech that emphasized France's tight ties to the Indo-Pacific, Macron said that any shifts to developing a more hard-line deterrent stance in the region is still tied to how the world — and particularly the West — treats other critical issues, including climate change and Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza. 

“If you consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what would happen in Taiwan, what would you do the day something happened in” the Philippines? he asked in a speech delivered in English.




The speech was notable in that Macron delivered it with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the audience and as not only France, but countries around the globe are dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff threats. Both Europe and those same Indo-Pacific nations also find themselves increasingly pulled between the competing interests of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

“We want to cooperate. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,” Macron said, in an apparent jab at Trump. 

Macron and Hegseth are among the world leaders, diplomats and top defense officials in Singapore this weekend for the region's biggest security forum that comes amid concerns of China's growing assertiveness, the global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the flare-up of conflicts in Asia. 

It's Hegseth's first time at the Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, which is taking place against the backdrop of heightened rhetoric between Beijing and Washington. The Trump administration has threatened China with triple-digit tariffs, and there's some uncertainty in the region over how committed the U.S. is to the defense of Taiwan, which also faces possible 32% American tariffs. 

China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Xi hasn't ruled out taking it by force. China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, and currently has an aircraft carrier in the waters southeast of the island.

China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, sent a much lower-level delegation instead, led by Maj. Gen. Hu Gangfeng, the vice president of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University. The delegation was expected to speak Saturday on a panel on “cooperative maritime security” alongside representatives from Japan, Vietnam, Chile and the U.K. — notable in that China's aggressive global fisheries tactics have been a regular topic of concern not only in the Indo-Pacific but as far away as Latin America and the Arctic.

Defense officials traveling with Hegseth, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, called the absence of a higher-level Chinese delegation an opportunity for the U.S. to make inroads. 

“We can't account for whether China engages or not. All we know is that we're here. And we will be here,” Hegseth said as he met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro.

Hegseth's trip to Singapore is his second to the region since becoming defense secretary, following a March visit to the Philippines, which has seen escalating confrontations with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. 

That trip, which also included a stop in Japan, brought a degree of relief over growing concerns from the Philippines and others in the region about U.S. support from a president who has taken more of a transactional approach to diplomacy and seems wary of foreign engagements. 

The U.S. has been pursuing a “free and open Indo-Pacific” policy, which includes regularly sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which is claimed almost in its entirety by China. 

The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France, which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April. 

In its published Indo-Pacific strategy, France has underscored the need to “preserve a rules-based international order” in the face of “China's increasing power and territorial claims” and its global competition with the United States.

France's own ties to the Indo-Pacific are strong, with more than 1.6 million of its citizens living in the region in French overseas territories.

Following a meeting Friday with Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Macron told reporters there was room in the region for more than just the two superpowers. 

“We are neither China nor the U.S., we don't want to depend on any of them,” he said. “We want to cooperate with both as far as we can, and we can cooperate for growth and prosperity and stability for our people and the world order, and I think this is exactly the same view of a lot of countries and a lot of people of this region.”

Wong underscored Macron's point, saying that Singapore and the greater region weren't looking for exclusive arrangements with any single power. 

“We want to embrace comprehensive engagement with all parties and embrace win-win arrangements rather than zero-sum competition,” he said. 

In his speech later, he said it was wrong to think of the war in Ukraine as simply a European war, and chided China for its support of Russia and for not doing anything to prevent North Korea from sending weapons and troops to aid Russia's fight. 

Macron said that he had always been against NATO taking a role in Asia — something China routinely accuses the U.S. of trying to engineer - but suggested that the presence of North Korean soldiers on the front lines in Ukraine might cause him to reconsider. 

“If China doesn't want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia or Asia, they should prevent, clearly, DPRK to be engaged on the European soil,” he said, referring to North Korea by its formal name. 

The conference comes as civil war continues to rage in Myanmar, creating a massive humanitarian crisis that has only been compounded by the effects of a devastating earthquake that hit in March. 

It also follows the outbreak of violence this week on the Thai-Cambodian border, in which a Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides. Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of land disputes, though Thailand said after the short skirmish that the situation had been resolved. 

Of greater concern, nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan came to the brink of war earlier this month in their most serious military confrontation in decades. The two armies exchanged gunfire, artillery strikes, missiles and drones that killed dozens of people, and Pakistan shot down several Indian planes before a truce was declared.

The White House will ‘fight this in a court of law' after a judge blocked the Trump administration from ending a migrant parole program for those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision is a near-term victory for President Donald Trump as he moves to crack down on border security and immigration priorities in his second term. 

The order stays, for now, a lower court ruling that halted Trump's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for some migrants living in the U.S., which allows individuals to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other ""extraordinary and temporary conditions."" 

The stay, like many emergency orders handed down by the high court, was unsigned, and did not provide an explanation for the justices' thinking. 

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson did lay out their criticisms in a blistering dissent.

Jackson said that, in their view, the court ""plainly botched"" its assessment, and failed to properly weigh the ""devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.""

""While it is apparent that the government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize — not maximize — harm to litigating parties,"" she added.

The TPS program is typically extended to migrants in the U.S. on 18-month increments, most recently under the Biden administration towards the end of his presidency. 

But they were abruptly upended by the Trump administration in February, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attempted to end protections for a specific group of Venezuelan nationals, arguing they were not in the national interest. 

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer asked justices earlier this month to allow the administration to proceed with its decision to revoke the status for the migrants, accusing U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of improperly intruding on the executive branch's authority over immigration policy.

""The district court's reasoning is untenable,"" Sauer told the high court, adding that the program ""implicates particularly discretionary, sensitive, and foreign-policy-laden judgments of the Executive Branch regarding immigration policy.""

The update comes after the Supreme Court also allowed the Trump administration earlier this month to revoke the protected status of 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with their plans to remove them.

Fox News host Sean Hannity remembers former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik's life and legacy on 'Hannity.'

Rudy Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001, mourned the death of former New York City Police Department Commissioner Bernard ""Bernie"" Kerik on Thursday, describing the grief of losing his ""best friend"" and a ""true patriot"" as ""inexpressible.""

Kerik died at 69 years old ""after a private battle with illness,"" according to FBI Director Kash Patel. 

Kerik and Giuliani were prominent figures during and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City due to their leadership roles in the city, and they quickly became close friends.

""On September 11th, Bernie Kerik and I saved each other's lives. If we weren't already friends, that bound us together forever. He was my best friend, a true Patriot, and one of the bravest men I've ever known,"" Giuliani wrote in a statement.

Giuliani said Kerik was at his side ""within 20 minutes of the attack"" on 9/11 and ""never left."" 

The first collapse trapped both of them in a building for what Giuliani thinks was 20 to 30 minutes, but they were able to escape safely with ""substantial additional assistance"" and ""extraordinary bravery"" – an attitude that Giuliani said ""permeated the way"" for recovery over the next four months.

""Bernie's leadership helped guide the people of a very frightened city to draw from their inherent individual strength as Americans and children of God,"" Giuliani said on Thursday.

He also praised Kerik's career in law enforcement, specifically pointing out his role as Commissioner of Rikers Island, where he was able to reduce violence in the prison by 90%, and his role as NYPD commissioner, where he reduced crime in the city.

""He was driven by an unwavering love of this country and a commitment to serving others. He was one of the most decorated New York City police officers of his time,"" he said.

FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER CALLS ON POLITICAL LEADERS TO 'GET OUT THERE' AND 'DEESCALATE' VIOLENCE 

Kerik's 35-year career has been recognized with more than 100 awards for meritorious and heroic service, including a presidential commendation for heroism by President Ronald Reagan and two Distinguished Service Awards from the Department of Homeland Security.

He was considered for the role of Homeland Security chief in 2004, but lied to the White House during vetting, which ultimately led to him pleading guilty to eight felonies, including tax fraud, in 2009. He spent about three years in prison, then moved to home confinement and, later, supervised release.

President Donald Trump pardoned him of the convictions in 2020.

Americans continue to give President Donald Trump an extended honeymoon, including Democrats and those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

While saying that they don't agree with everything Trump and his MAGA movement do, two-thirds believe that the president is putting America first as he resets the national agenda.

In a new McLaughlin & Associates survey shared with Secrets, 61% agreed. In comparison, just 28% didn't when asked: “While I may not agree with everything that Donald Trump and the MAGA movement says and stands for, I think they are right about putting America and the American people first.”

The numbers bolster other recent surveys showing that more Americans than ever believe the country is on the “right track.”

Pollster Jim McLaughlin noted the wide political spectrum that is giving Trump the benefit of the doubt despite a wall of skepticism from the liberal media and the Democratic Party.

“This,” he told us, “explains all these recent polls where DJT has majority approval. After four years of [former President Joe] Biden putting our enemies and the elites first, Donald Trump is putting the forgotten men and women of America first. They liked it the first time and they like it even more after the disaster that was the Biden presidency. Two thirds say DJT and MAGA are right for putting America first. Including large cohorts of Democrat groups, 42% of all Democrats, 38% of Harris voters and 53% of black voters. Hispanics agree overwhelmingly, 68%-29%.”

McLaughlin added, “In spite of what the Democrats and their allies in the media are saying, the vast majority of Americans, a full two-thirds, trust Donald Trump when it comes to the direction he is taking the country and his focus of putting the American people first.”

The pollster said that the support for Trump's agenda should affect the Senate's consideration of the House-approved “big, beautiful bill” backed by the president and expected to extend tax cuts he instituted in his first term.

WHO ARE REALITY TV STARS TODD AND JULIE CHRISLEY, AND WHY DID TRUMP PARDON THEM?

He also said that it shows the potential for Republicans in the congressional 2026 elections to keep control of the House and Senate, breaking the typical pattern of midterms.

“This is why, in spite of the dishonest, negative attacks against the Big, Beautiful Bill, it passed the House and is going to pass the Senate. The Democrats are going to have real problems in the midterms when Donald Trump and the Republicans are on offense and the Democrats running will have to defend supporting the largest tax increase in American history, welfare benefits for illegals, more reckless inflationary spending and putting the rights of criminal illegals over the rights of law-abiding Americans,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will end the American Bar Association's role in vetting federal judges, escalating Republican efforts to sideline the legal group over claims of political bias.

In a letter sent Thursday to ABA President William R. Bay, Bondi said the DOJ under President Donald Trump would no longer grant the group first access to judicial nominees or require candidates to cooperate with the ABA's longstanding vetting process. The move eliminates a decades-old arrangement that gave the ABA early access to potential nominees for evaluation.

The American Bar Association has lost its way, and we do not believe it serves as a fair arbiter of judicial nominees.@TheJusticeDept will no longer give the ABA the access they've taken for granted. pic.twitter.com/ViqX9IRa7w

“For several decades, the American Bar Association has received special treatment and enjoyed special access to judicial nominees,” Bondi wrote. “That ends now.”

Specifically, the DOJ's Office of Legal Policy will no longer serve as a conduit for ABA access, ending internal policies that gave the association a unique foothold in the selection process. Nominees will also no longer be directed to provide waivers for the ABA to access confidential information, such as bar records, and will not respond to questionnaires or sit for interviews with the group's judicial review committee, Bondi said.

The decision marks a further rollback of the ABA's influence in federal judicial nominations, which had already diminished under previous Republican presidents. President George W. Bush first ended the ABA's early role in the nomination process, a practice that President Joe Biden also continued during his single term in office.

But Bondi's action goes further, ending cooperation with the group altogether. “The ABA no longer functions as a fair arbiter of nominees' qualifications, and its ratings invariably and demonstrably favor nominees put forth by Democratic administrations,” she said.

Robert Luther III, a former Trump White House lawyer who handled judicial nominations during the president's first term, said the group has had many chances to correct course.

“They've got a 50-year track record that needs a lot of improvement,” Luther told the Washington Examiner. “So I don't know where the future will go, but they've had a lot of opportunities to make up for mistakes, and haven't done a very good job.”

The ABA has struck an aggressive posture against the Trump administration since Trump's return to the Oval Office this year. It has been outspoken over former Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk‘s calls to impeach lower court judges blocking the president's agenda. Earlier, this month, the ABA scored a temporary victory in its legal fight to block the DOJ from canceling grants to the private legal group.

Asked whether the ABA could sue over the DOJ's latest decision, Luther was dismissive: “There's no constitutional right for a private organization to have access to government nominees. That'd be a ridiculous lawsuit.”

The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, a 15-member body made up of legal professionals, has reviewed judicial nominees since the Eisenhower administration. It rates potential judges as “not qualified,” “qualified,” or “well qualified.” But conservatives have long accused the committee of ideological bias, especially after several Trump nominees received “not qualified” ratings.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously blasted the ABA as a “radical left-wing advocacy group,” citing its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and its involvement in litigation opposing Trump-era policies.

Bondi's announcement comes one day after Trump nominated a top DOJ official who previously worked as one of Trump's criminal defense attorneys, Emil Bove, to a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.

“Emil has excellent credentials including a degree from a top law school, clerkships with two federal judges appointed by Republican presidents, experience as a federal prosecutor in a district with some of the most complex cases in the country, and private practice representing the President in some of the most contentious, high-stakes, public-facing litigation in recent memory,” Luther said of Bove's legal pedigree.

Trump on Wednesday included that he was nominating five Floridians to serve as federal district court judges in their state: Ed Artau, Kyle Dudek, John Guard, Anne-Leigh Gaylord Moe, and Jordan Pratt.

REPUBLICANS WAGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

The Trump administration has also imposed restrictions on DOJ employees' participation in ABA events and signaled concerns over the group's law school accreditation powers, especially regarding diversity mandates in legal education.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has teed up a confirmation hearing on June 4 for five of Trump's judicial nominees tapped earlier this month for lifetime appointments, including Whitney Hermandorfer of Tennessee to the 6th Circuit and Missouri district nominees Joshua Divine, Zachary Bluestone, Maria Lanahan, and Cristian Stevens. The panel will also consider Edward A. O'Connell of the District of Columbia for a seat on the D.C.

Senate Republicans will hold the first full congressional hearing next month to investigate what they say was a coordinated effort to conceal the cognitive decline of former President Joe Biden and whether anyone else was pulling the strings behind his presidency.

Sens. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) and John Cornyn (R-TX) announced Thursday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would convene a hearing on June 18 to examine who was “running the country” during Biden's final years and the alleged “cover-up” orchestrated by his aides, family members, and the legacy media.

“For four years, when the American people saw Joe Biden, they saw someone who was clearly not capable of making major decisions for the nation,” Schmitt said in a statement. “Yet those closest to the president and the mainstream media did everything they could to hide this truth.”

Schmitt said a group of insiders “were the de facto commander in chief” while Biden, 82, was “sidelined.” Cornyn echoed that, saying the country “depends on having a president who has the mental capacity to do the job, and it's clear that President Biden did not.”

Cornyn called the alleged effort a “conspiracy between the mainstream media, Joe Biden's family, and his inner circle,” accusing them of having “lied consistently to the American people about his capacity to make decisions, which are solely vested by the Constitution.”

The lawmakers said they are still finalizing a witness list for Congress's first formal committee inquiry into Biden's health and mental fitness.

Their inquiry comes as House Republicans ramp up a parallel investigation into the Biden administration's alleged concealment of the former president's condition. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) introduced legislation Thursday to create a select committee that would explore “the potential concealment of information from the American public” about Biden's health.

The Senate hearing also adds to the political fallout from a related House investigation into the use of autopen technology by the Biden administration to sign executive orders and pardons in his final days. That investigation has also prompted broader concerns about who was making key decisions during Biden's presidency and whether he remained fully engaged.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is pursuing interviews with several high-ranking Biden staffers over their alleged roles in masking the president's decline. Those targeted include Neera Tanden, former Domestic Policy Council director; Annie Tomasini, deputy chief of staff; Anthony Bernal, longtime aide to Jill Biden; Ashley Williams, deputy director of Oval Office operations; and Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor.

All five people have made initial contact with the committee through their attorneys since receiving letters from Comer on May 22, a source familiar with the panel's work told the Washington Examiner on Thursday.

“We expect all witnesses to fully comply with the Committee's investigation. The Committee will issue subpoenas if necessary,” the source said.

Momentum behind the congressional push to uncover more about Biden's condition has grown in the wake of the new book Original Sin, authored by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson. The book alleges that the White House worked aggressively to shape the narrative on Biden's health and shield the public from the extent of his decline. It also raised new suspicions surrounding Bernal, Jill Biden's aide, and the extent to which he was influencing the president's decisions after the book made claims that he wielded “enormous” power in the former administration.

Comer teased on Wednesday that there could be additional subpoenas for the former president and his spouse in the separate House investigation. The senators made no mention of Biden's autopen in their press release on Thursday.

DEADLINE LOOMS FOR EX-BIDEN AIDES TO COMPLY WITH GOP AUTOPEN INVESTIGATION

Cornyn and Schmitt's announcement came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called for the former first lady to “speak up” about her husband's health condition ahead of his Oval Office departure.

“I think anybody looking at the videos and photo evidence of [former President] Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common sense can see this was a clear cover-up,” Leavitt said during a press briefing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Conservative intellectuals have long lamented leftist dominance of culture. They recognize the danger of ceding culture to people who disagree with them on everything and watching their creations erode the founding values of the country.

The focus is mostly on television, film, and other dominant forms of middle- and low-brow entertainment. But conservatives should engage with higher culture, too. Great literature, old and new, must be protected, championed, and nourished.

My friend, the late Michael Novak, recognized this when he was a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He held readings of great works ranging from John Milton's epic on eternity, Paradise Lost, to P.G. Wodehouse's breezy tales of a brainy butler and his boneheaded master, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster.

Now, another AEI scholar, senior fellow Christopher Scalia, has taken up the cause, trying to couple conservative intellectual energy to good literature in his latest book, 13 Novels Conservatives Will Love (But Probably Haven't Read).

Scalia told me, “Over the past 15 years, especially, conservatives have been more aware that they've been ceding culture to progressives. Andrew Breitbart's admonition that politics is downstream of culture, I think, really resonated with … I think conservatives have been more conscious about engaging with culture, whether it's in universities, setting up alternative learning institutions, but also in television and cinema. But with literature, I think maybe we're lagging a little bit. What I hope my book does is introduce conservatives to great literature they didn't know about that helps them think about conservative topics more thoroughly, but also might inspire a couple of novelists to show them how you can grapple with these issues in sophisticated ways and create great literature.”The novels Scalia chooses are not the best-known works by their authors — for example, George Eliot's Daniel Deronda rather than her masterpiece, Middlemarch, and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance rather than The Scarlet Letter.

All the books — I admit to having read only five of the 13 — deal with conservative themes with great acuity and sophistication. 

V.S. Naipaul's A Bend in the River is, for example, a brilliant evocation of the ever-present threat of barbarism breaking through the precarious rampart of civilization. It is peculiarly relevant today when the domestic and international Left is calling openly for the destruction of Western civilization, celebrating Islamist efforts to carry out anti-Jewish genocide, and lionizing the assassination of corporate executives on America's streets.

Evelyn Waugh's uproarious comic novel, Scoop, is still perhaps the most perceptive depiction of news media bent on writing a preconceived narrative rather than reporting the facts. Russia collusion hoax or the Biden cover-up, anyone? It also mocks the vanity and exposes the cruelty of grandiose government. 

In the late 1980s, I had Scoop set as a text for journalism students at Columbia University. It was a portent of the closing graduate mind and of creeping presentism that they utterly hated it, failing to get past the fact that a work published in 1938 used racial terms unacceptable 50 years later.

PUTIN PLAYS TRUMP LIKE A BALALAIKA

All the books in Scalia's splendid list make the conservative case, imaginatively rather than pedantically, that this life cannot be perfect, that we each have duties to ourselves, to others, to the wisdom of the past, and to the desires of the future.

All 13 novels would be good additions to anyone's bookshelves. Scalia's book would be a good 14th.

The company is great at getting what it wants—whether or not it's beholden to a nonprofit mission.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

OpenAI is a strange company for strange times. Valued at $300 billion—roughly the same as seven Fords or one and a half PepsiCos—the AI start-up has an era-defining product in ChatGPT and is racing to be the first to build superintelligent machines. The company is also, to the apparent frustration of its CEO Sam Altman, beholden to its nonprofit status.



When OpenAI was founded in 2015, it was meant to be a research lab that would work toward the goal of AI that is “safe” and “benefits all of humanity.” There wasn't supposed to be any pressure—or desire, really—to make money. Later, in 2019, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary to better attract investors—the types of people who might otherwise turn to the less scrupulous corporations that dot Silicon Valley. But even then, that part of the organization was under the nonprofit side's control. At the time, it had released no consumer products and capped how much money its investors could make.



Then came ChatGPT. OpenAI's leadership had intended for the bot to provide insight into how people would use AI without any particular hope for widespread adoption. But ChatGPT became a hit, kicking “off a growth curve like nothing we have ever seen,” as Altman wrote in an essay this past January. The product was so alluring that the entire tech industry seemed to pivot overnight into an AI arms race. Now, two and a half years since the chatbot's release, Altman says some half a billion people use the program each week, and he is chasing that success with new features and products—for shopping, coding, health care, finance, and seemingly any other industry imaginable. OpenAI is behaving like a typical business, because its rivals are typical businesses, and massive ones at that: Google and Meta, among others.

Read: OpenAI's ambitions just became crystal clear

Now 2015 feels like a very long time ago, and the charitable origins have turned into a ball and chain for OpenAI. Last December, after facing concerns from potential investors that pouring money into the company wouldn't pay off because of the nonprofit mission and complicated governance structure, the organization announced plans to change that: OpenAI was seeking to transition to a for-profit. The company argued that this was necessary to meet the tremendous costs of building advanced AI models. A nonprofit arm would still exist, though it would separately pursue “charitable initiatives”—and it would not have any say over the actions of the for-profit, which would convert into a public-benefit corporation, or PBC. Corporate backers appeared satisfied: In March, the Japanese firm Softbank conditioned billions of dollars in investments on OpenAI changing its structure.



Resistance came as swiftly as the new funding. Elon Musk—a co-founder of OpenAI who has since created his own rival firm, xAI, and seems to take every opportunity to undermine Altman—wrote on X that OpenAI “was funded as an open source, nonprofit, but has become a closed source, profit-maximizer.” He had already sued the company for abandoning its founding mission in favor of financial gain, and claimed that the December proposal was further proof. Many unlikely allies emerged soon after. Attorneys general in multiple states, nonprofit groups, former OpenAI employees, outside AI experts, economists, lawyers, and three Nobel laureates all have raised concerns about the pivot, even petitioning to submit briefs to Musk's lawsuit.



OpenAI backtracked, announcing a new plan earlier this month that would have the nonprofit remain in charge. Steve Sharpe, a spokesperson for OpenAI, told me over email that the new proposed structure “puts us on the best path to” build a technology “that could become one of the most powerful and beneficial tools in human history.” (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.)



Yet OpenAI's pursuit of industry-wide dominance shows no real signs of having hit a roadblock. The company has a close relationship with the Trump administration and is leading perhaps the biggest AI infrastructure buildout in history. Just this month, OpenAI announced a partnership with the United Arab Emirates and an expansion into personal gadgets—a forthcoming “family of devices” developed with Jony Ive, former chief design officer at Apple. For-profit or not, the future of AI still appears to be very much in Altman's hands.

Why all the worry about corporate structure anyway? Governance, boardroom processes, legal arcana—these things are not what sci-fi dreams are made of. Yet those concerned with the societal dangers that generative AI, and thus OpenAI, pose feel these matters are of profound importance. The still more powerful artificial “general” intelligence, or AGI, that OpenAI and its competitors are chasing could theoretically cause mass unemployment, worsen the spread of misinformation, and violate all sorts of privacy laws. In the highest-flung doomsday scenarios, the technology brings about civilizational collapse. Altman has expressed these concerns himself—and so OpenAI's 2019 structure, which gave the nonprofit final say over the for-profit's actions, was meant to guide the company toward building the technology responsibly instead of rushing to release new AI products, sell subscriptions, and stay ahead of competitors.



“OpenAI's nonprofit mission, together with the legal structures committing it to that mission, were a big part of my decision to join and remain at the company,” Jacob Hilton, a former OpenAI employee who contributed to ChatGPT, among other projects, told me. In April, Hilton and a number of his former colleagues, represented by the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, wrote a letter to the court hearing Musk's lawsuit, arguing that a large part of OpenAI's success depended on its commitment to safety and the benefit of humanity. To renege on, or at least minimize, that mission was a betrayal.



The concerns extend well beyond former employees. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist at the University of Toronto who last year received a Nobel Prize for his AI research, told me that OpenAI's original structure would better help “prevent a super intelligent AI from ever wanting to take over.” Hinton is one of the Nobel laureates who has publicly opposed the tech company's for-profit shift, alongside the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Oliver Hart. The three academics, joining a number of influential lawyers, economists, and AI experts, in addition to several former OpenAI employees, including Hilton, signed an open letter in April urging the attorneys general in Delaware and California—where the company's nonprofit was incorporated and where the company is headquartered, respectively—to closely investigate the December proposal. According to its most recent tax filing, OpenAI is intended to build AGI “that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” so disempowering the nonprofit seemed, to the signatories, self-evidently contradictory.

Read: ‘We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI'

In its initial proposal to transition to a for-profit, OpenAI still would have had some accountability as a public-benefit corporation: A PBC legally has to try to make profits for shareholders alongside pursuing a designated “public benefit” (in this case, building “safe” and “beneficial” AI as outlined in OpenAI's founding mission). In its December announcement, OpenAI described the restructure as “the next step in our mission.” But Michael Dorff, another signatory to the open letter and a law professor at UCLA who studies public-benefit corporations, explained to me that PBCs aren't necessarily an effective way to bring about public good. “They are not great enforcement tools,” he said—they can “nudge” a company toward a given cause but do not give regulators much authority over that commitment. (Anthropic and xAI, two of OpenAI's main competitors, are also public-benefit corporations.)



OpenAI's proposed conversion also raised a whole other issue—a precedent for taking resources accrued under charitable intentions and repurposing them for profitable pursuits. And so yet another coalition, composed of nonprofits and advocacy groups, wrote its own petition for OpenAI's plans to be investigated, with the aim of preventing charitable organizations from being leveraged for financial gain in the future.



Regulators, it turned out, were already watching. Three days after OpenAI's December announcement of the plans to revoke nonprofit oversight, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general of Delaware, notified the court presiding over Musk's lawsuit that her office was reviewing the proposed restructure to ensure that the corporation was fulfilling its charitable interest to build AI that benefits all of humanity. California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, was reviewing the restructure, as well.



This ultimately led OpenAI to change plans. “We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,” Altman wrote in a letter to OpenAI employees earlier this month. The for-profit, meanwhile, will still transition to a PBC.



The new plan is not yet a done deal: The offices of the attorneys general told me that they are reviewing the new proposal. Microsoft, OpenAI's closest corporate partner, has not yet agreed to the new structure.

One could be forgiven for wondering what all the drama is for. Amid tension over OpenAI's corporate structure, the organization's corporate development hasn't so much as flinched. In just the past few weeks, the company has announced a new CEO of applications, someone to directly oversee and expand business operations; OpenAI for Countries, an initiative focused on building AI infrastructure around the world; and Codex, a powerful AI “agent” that does coding tasks. To OpenAI, these endeavors legitimately contribute to benefiting humanity: building more and more useful AI tools; bringing those tools and the necessary infrastructure to run them to people around the world; drastically increasing the productivity of software engineers. No matter OpenAI's ultimate aims, in a race against Google and Meta, some commercial moves are necessary to stay ahead. And enriching OpenAI's investors and improving people's lives are not necessarily mutually exclusive.



The greater issue is this: There is no universal definition for “safe” or “beneficial” AI. A chatbot might help doctors process paperwork faster and help a student float through high school without learning a thing; an AI research assistant could help climate scientists arrive at novel insights while also consuming huge amounts of water and fossil fuels. Whatever definition OpenAI applies will be largely determined by its board. Altman, in his May letter to employees, contended that OpenAI is on the best path “to continue to make rapid, safe progress and to put great AI in the hands of everyone.” But everyone, in this case, has to trust OpenAI's definition of safe progress.



The nonprofit has not always been the most effective check on the company. In 2023, the nonprofit board—which then and now had “control” over the for-profit subsidiary—removed Altman from his position as CEO. But the company's employees revolted, and he was reinstated shortly thereafter with the support of Microsoft. In other words, “control” on paper does not always amount to much in reality. Sharpe, the OpenAI spokesperson, said the nonprofit will be able to appoint and remove directors to OpenAI's separate for-profit board, but declined to clarify whether its board will be able to remove executives (such as the CEO). The company is “continuing to work through the specific governance mandate in consultation with relevant stakeholders,” he said.



Sharpe also told me that OpenAI will remove the cap on shareholder returns, which he said will satisfy the conditions for SoftBank's billions of dollars in investment. A top SoftBank executive has said “nothing has really changed” with OpenAI's restructure, despite the nonprofit retaining control. If investors are now satisfied, the underlying legal structure is irrelevant. Marc Toberoff, a lawyer representing Musk in his lawsuit against OpenAI, wrote in a statement that “SoftBank pulled back the curtain on OpenAI's corporate theater and said the quiet part out loud. OpenAI's recent ‘restructuring' proposal is nothing but window dressing.”



Lessig, the lawyer who represented the former OpenAI employees, told me that “it's outrageous that we are allowing the development of this potentially catastrophic technology with nobody at any level doing any effective oversight of it.” Two years ago, Altman, in Senate testimony, seemed to agree with that notion: He told lawmakers that “regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks” of powerful AI. But earlier this month, only a few days after writing to his employees and investors that “as AI accelerates, our commitment to safety grows stronger,” he told the Senate something else: Too much regulation would be “disastrous” for America's AI industry. Perhaps—but it might also be in the best interests of humanity.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Alternatives to the medical or economic state of affairs offer hope—and danger.

This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors' weekly guide to the best in books. Sign up for it here.

Why are so many Americans so eager to find alternatives—political, medical, vocational—to the status quo? By many measures, the 9-to-5 workplace, the medical industry, and other mainstays of American life seem to have served the country's population very well: The United States has the world's largest economy, and its population is far healthier and wealthier than it was before World War II. Yet in 2023, North Americans spent an average of $5,800 each on “wellness” treatments whose efficacy has not always been backed by research. One in 13 Americans have participated in multilevel marketing, even though research has shown that 99 percent of them lose money in the process, and 30 percent supported a Cabinet position for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the leader of the movement to “make America healthy again,” who has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism. This state of affairs has animated several stories in The Atlantic's books section over the past two weeks, and all of them identify the same basic answer: The status quo is no longer working.

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic's books desk:

As Adam M. Lowenstein wrote in his essay on Gardiner Harris's No More Tears, an exposé about the pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson's persistent efforts to downplay the risks of some of its products, evidence that the health-care system puts profits first may have “left some people so disillusioned and distrustful that they were willing to try anything else.” Cases of pharmaceutical wrongdoing give a message like Kennedy's—that the medical industry is corrupt—an understandable appeal. This same message underlies the $6.3 trillion wellness industry, with its array of purported miracle cures. Sheila McClear, in an essay on Amy Larocca's new book, How to Be Well, wrote this week that “Americans are exhausted from navigating a health-care system so costly and inconvenient that it has sent many of them scrambling for alternatives.” Those who can't find a therapist who takes insurance can instead buy a “$38 jar of adaptogenic ‘dust' that claims to improve your mood,” for example, while the wealthy can enroll in boutique health services that make house calls.

This deep distrust in American institutions—and the parade of disruptive entrepreneurs eager to take advantage of it—extends far beyond the medical arena. Last week, Lora Kelley wrote about Bridget Read's book Little Bosses Everywhere, a history of MLMs—companies that hire salespeople who earn commissions by signing up more salespeople. These businesses first proliferated during the Great Depression, and it felt like no coincidence to Kelley that they resurged online a few years ago during the “Great Resignation,” when growing numbers of workers were laid off or quit out of frustration. Many modern MLMs, Kelley writes, “promise what American jobs used to: security, freedom, dignity. Those promises have consistently failed to materialize. But the fact that so many are desperate to get in on the schemes each year is not a credit to the broader job market.” She summarizes Read's argument like so: “MLMs are a toxin masquerading as a cure.”

McClear, in her article, writes that the second Trump administration has opened the gates to medical skeptics. Casey Means, a wellness influencer, is the current nominee for surgeon general, and Kennedy now leads the Department of Health and Human Services. McClear notes that some of Kennedy's policy positions, such as curbs on microplastics, unhealthy foods, and unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies, could be productive reforms, and others, such as reducing access to vaccines and fluoride, feel like dubious solutions in search of a problem. It's not so hard to argue that the current state of the nation has left many people disappointed—in some cases, desperate for something that works. But this doesn't mean that any alternative is necessarily better. Some are proving to be demonstrably worse.

Train Dreams, by Denis Johnson

Johnson's drama of the American frontier is barely a novel; the thin paperback can be started on a hot afternoon and finished by happy hour. Yet it has accrued a devoted following in the nearly 15 years since it was published, because it conjures a great expanse—the mythic West. Its main character, Robert Grainier, works as a contract laborer for the railroads running through Idaho and Washington State. Sweating and straining, he hauls down giant conifers in the region's old-growth forests. He feels a sweet freedom while riding over freshly laid rail, watching the wilderness blur by through a boxcar's slats. Train Dreams is not overly romantic about its time and place: In the first chapter, Grainier's boss orders him to throw a Chinese laborer off an unfinished bridge. A curse later seems to fall upon Grainier. He experiences God's cosmic vengeance, a cleansing fire racing across the dry landscape. Johnson has a cinematic style, lingering on images. But the novella barrels forward with the locomotion evoked in its title, until the end of Grainier's days, and the end of the Old West. Give it a few hours in June, and it may hold on to your imagination until August.  — Ross Andersen

The Talented Mr. Vance

By George Packer

J. D. Vance poses a problem, and at its core is a question about character. In the years after the 2016 election, he transformed himself from a center-right memoirist and public speaker, offering a complex analysis of America's social ills and a sharp critique of Donald Trump, into a right-wing populist politician whose illiberal ideas and vitriolic rhetoric frequently out-Trump the original. According to Vance and his supporters, this change followed a realization during Trump's first term that the president was lifting up the fallen working class of the heartland that had produced young J. D. To help his people, Vance had to make his peace with their champion. According to his critics, Vance cynically chose to betray his true values in order to take the only path open to an ambitious Republican in the Trump era, and as a convert under suspicion, he pursued it with a vengeance. In one account, a poor boy from the provinces makes good in the metropole, turns against his glittering benefactors, and goes home to fight for his people. In the other, the poor boy seizes every opportunity on his way up, loses his moral compass, and is ruined by his own ambition.

Maybe it's unwise to pick a fight with the folks who control the Supreme Court?

by  Ian Millhiser

On Thursday evening, President Donald Trump publicly split with the Federalist Society, the powerful conservative lawyers' group that he relied on to select judges in his first term. Thanks in no small part to Trump, a majority of the Supreme Court justices are associated with the Federalist Society, as are dozens or even hundreds of other federal judges.

But now, Trump apparently regrets his earlier partnership with the Society. 

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

“I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations,” Trump posted on Truth Social. He blames his decision to ally with the Society on the fact that he was “new to Washington” when he first became president, “and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges.” He also names Leonard Leo, the co-chair of the Society's board, a “sleazebag” who “probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.”

It's a bold move by Trump, because the Federalist Society derives much of its power from the fact that so many of its members have lifetime appointments to the federal bench. Promising conservative lawyers want to join — and pay dues — to the Society because it was seen as a pipeline to power. And the fact that its members have been able to shape policy on everything from abortion to race to student loans made it the premier right-wing legal group.

That's not to say Trump will destroy the Society's grip on the judiciary. In fact, he may have inadvertently strengthened it. Older Federalist Society judges and justices may be less likely to retire under Trump now that they know that he's unlikely to rely on the Society to choose their replacement. And sitting Federalist Society judges and justices may view the Trump administration's legal arguments with greater skepticism.

Trump's breakup with the Federalist Society isn't particularly surprising. At a recent Federalist Society conference on executive power, many of the speakers denounced Trump's incompetence and warned that it would prevent conservatives from achieving lasting policy victories during this administration. Some argued that Trump's signature economic policy, his tariffs, are illegal. 

And Trump is right that Leo, and by extension, the Federalist Society and its judges, have “separate ambitions” that do not always align with Trump or the MAGA movement. While the Federalist Society certainly has plenty of members who are staunch MAGA loyalists, many of its judges still adhere to the more libertarian and less explicitly authoritarian approach that dominated the Republican Party before Trump took it over.

Speakers at the recent Federalist Society conference spoke openly about plans to diminish Trump's power and shift authority toward the judiciary. Nor did the Federalist Society's judges rally behind Trump's failed attempt to overturn former President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Some of them even actively pushed back – Trump-appointed Judge Stephanos Bibas's opinion rejecting one of Trump's attempts to overturn that election begins with the line “free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,” and rejects Trump's claims due to a lack of “specific allegations and then proof.” 

In his Thursday night post announcing that he and Leo are never getting back together, Trump pointed to a recent decision by the US Court of International Trade, which struck down an array of Trump's second-term tariffs, as a triggering event. Notably, one of these three judges, Timothy Rief, is a Trump appointee.

So it appears that one of the most fruitful partnerships in the conservative legal movement's history is now over. This divorce is likely to diminish both Trump's power and that of the Society in the long run.

The Federalist Society is America's most powerful legal organization in large part because it has such a comprehensive network of right-leaning and right-wing lawyers. Top law students often join the Federalist Society because the Society can help place them in clerkships with some of the most prestigious judges. The Society's events give young lawyers a chance to network with senior members of their profession who can connect them with other hard-to-obtain job opportunities. And, because senior lawyers often have a decades-long relationship with the Society, the Society can easily vet them for ideological loyalty if they seek a political appointment such as a federal judgeship.

This network also means that the Federalist Society has historically provided a valuable service to Republican presidents. If a federal judicial vacancy arises in, say, Idaho, the president and his top advisers are unlikely to know which members of the Idaho bar are both highly skilled and ideologically committed to the GOP's goals. But the Federalist Society has both a student and a lawyers' chapter in Idaho. So it can identify highly qualified right-wing candidates for the bench and pass that information on to the White House.

Without access to this network, Trump is likely to struggle to identify nominees as quickly as he did in his first term, and there are already signs that he's relying on alternative networks to find his second term judges — a shift that may diminish the Society's influence in the long run, because lawyers hoping for a political appointment will no longer gain an advantage by joining it.

When Trump announced his first slate of second-term nominees in early May, for example, half of them were lawyers in GOP-controlled state attorney general's offices. These offices might provide Trump with a stream of loyal nominees in red states, but it is unclear how he will identify judicial candidates in blue states where elected officials are unlikely to fill their offices with lawyers sympathetic to the MAGA movement.

Trump's split with the Federalist Society may prove to be one of the most consequential legal developments of his second term.

The Federalist Society also provides right-of-center lawyers with a forum where they can debate their disagreements and often achieve consensus. Once such a consensus is reached, moreover, Federalist Society events help popularize that consensus among legal conservatives, while also communicating to ambitious young lawyers which policy positions they need to hold in order to secure the Society's aid when those lawyers seek political appointments.

This means that judges chosen by the Society tend to have uniform views on a wide range of legal questions, even if those views are unusual within the legal profession as a whole. The Federalist Society, for example, has long popularized a theory known as the “unitary executive,” which would give the president full control over all federal agencies, even if Congress tried to give those agencies' leaders a degree of independence. This theory played a central role in the Republican justices' shocking decision in Trump v. United States (2024), which established that the president has broad authority to use his official powers to commit crimes.

If Trump stops drawing from the Federalist Society when he selects judges, in other words, his second-term nominees are likely to hold views that diverge from those of many sitting Republican judges, even if those nominees might broadly be described as “conservative.” And that could set back the conservative cause. 

Before the Federalist Society's founding, for example, President Richard Nixon picked four justices that he believed to be conservative. But three of them joined the Court's abortion rights decision in Roe v. Wade (1973), and Nixon-appointed Justice Lewis Powell wrote a seminal opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), which kept affirmative action alive for several decades.

It's also possible that many sitting Federalist Society judges and justices will view Trump with greater skepticism now that he's no longer aligned with an organization that they closely identify with. Because the Federalist Society has been a central part of many lawyers' and judges' professional life for decades, these senior professionals often identify strongly with the Society and react negatively to perceived slights against it. 

In 2020, for example, the US Judicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct withdrew a proposal to discourage federal judges from belonging to ideological bar associations like the Federalist Society after that proposal triggered widespread backlash among judges aligned with the Society. When it comes to Trump, many of the lawsuits challenging his tariffs are backed by conservative legal organizations that historically have aligned with the Federalist Society; his attacks on the Federalist Society could make such organizations more likely to challenge him.

Trump's split with the Federalist Society, in other words, may prove to be one of the most consequential legal developments of his second term. It is likely to make Republican judges less ideologically homogeneous, which increases the likelihood that any given panel of judges will vote against a conservative litigant. And it also means that many sitting judges will be less likely to retire under Trump, and more likely to view the Trump administration's legal arguments with skepticism.

Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US.

If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.

The Court's latest decision is a love letter to the abundance agenda.

The Republican justices draw a line in the sand – in an order that makes absolutely no sense.

One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was.

Libby v. Fecteau is an awful case about an anti-trans lawmaker who nonetheless needed to win.

A farewell gift.

In some ways, it's still Joe Biden's economy, and Donald Trump is just reaping the benefits. Well, Trump and hundreds of thousands of police, firefighters, teachers and other public sector retirees.

Over the past few months, personal income data have been flattered by what is, at least in some sense, the biggest short-run boost to Social Security coverage ever. The Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law on Jan. 5, repealed provisions that had limited or blocked benefits to around 3 million people, mostly retired public sector workers and their families, who were already receiving separate government pensions.

Pardons are just another deal to President Trump.

Let's make a deal.

A pattern is emerging in Donald Trump's use of the pardon power: The president appears to view clemency as a means to simultaneously reward supporters and rewrite history.

Since taking office for his second term in January, he has granted clemency to almost 1,600 defendants. According to Trump — who accused the Biden administration of “weaponizing” federal law enforcement to persecute political rivals — he is simply correcting injustices. The two dozen recipients of pardons and commutations this week include a former Chicago gang kingpin, three founders of a cryptocurrency exchange, and an embezzling nursing home executive whose mother attended a $1-million-a-plate dinner for Trump at Mar-a-Lago.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The AI Race:

Builder.ai, the artificial intelligence startup that recently announced plans to declare bankruptcy, faked business with the Indian social-media startup VerSe Innovation for years to falsely inflate its sales, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people with direct knowledge of the practice.The two companies routinely billed one another for roughly the same amounts between 2021 and 2024, documents reviewed by Bloomberg show, as part of an alleged practice known as ""round-tripping"" that the people said Builder.ai used to inflate revenue figures it presented to investors. In many cases, products and services weren't actually provided to either company for these payments, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Umang Bedi, a VerSe co-founder, said it was “absolutely baseless and false” that his company would have recorded expenses or billed services that it didn't receive or provide. “We're not the kind of company that is in the business of inflating revenues,” he said in an interview.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Chip Wars:

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is evaluating building an advanced production facility in the United Arab Emirates and has discussed the possibility with officials in President Donald Trump's administration, according to people familiar with the matter, a potentially major bet on the Middle East that would only come to fruition with Washington's approval.

The company has had multiple meetings in recent months with Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, and officials from MGX, an influential investment vehicle overseen by the UAE president's brother, the people said. Those conversations are a continuation of talks that began under President Joe Biden's administration but had died down by the end of his term.

In this article

The more Jamie Dimon worries, the better his bank seems to do.

As JPMorgan Chase has grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has grown more vocal about what could go wrong — all while things keep going right for his bank.

In the best of times and in the worst of times, Dimon's public outlook is grim.

Whether it's his 2022 forecast for a ""hurricane"" hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns over the fraying post-World War II world order or his caution about America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV appearance and investor event with another dire warning.

""His track record of leading the bank is incredible,"" said Ben Mackovak, a board member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partner. ""His track record of making economic-calamity predictions, not as good.""

Over his two decades running JPMorgan, Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any the world has seen.

A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking and Wall Street high finance, Dimon's bank is, in his own words, an end-game winner when it comes to money. It has more branches, deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion moves over its global payment rails daily.

A review of 20 years of Dimon's annual investor letters and his public statements show a distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the acquisition of two failed rivals, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.

By the time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon.

""There will be another crisis,"" he wrote in his April 2015 CEO letter, musing on potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. debt were a ""warning shot"" for markets.

That passage marked the start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including worries of a recession — which didn't happen until the 2020 pandemic triggered a two-month contraction — as well as concerns around market meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit.

But it also marked a decade in which JPMorgan's performance began lapping rivals.

After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon's first decade as CEO.

In that time, investors began aggressively bidding up JPMorgan's shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the world's most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is spending $18 billion annually on technology, including artificial intelligence, to stay that way.

While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record profits.

In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors to prepare for an economic storm: ""Right now, it's kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,"" Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the post-pandemic economy.

""That hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way,"" he said.

""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" Dimon said the following year in an earnings release.

But investors who listened to Dimon and made their portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best two-year run for the S&P 500 in decades.

""It's an interesting contradiction, no doubt,"" Mackovak said about Dimon's downbeat remarks and his bank's performance.

""Part of it could just be the brand-building of Jamie Dimon,"" the investor said. ""Or having a win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, 'Oh, I called it,' and if doesn't, well your bank's still chugging along.""

According to the former president of a top five U.S. financial institution, bankers know that it's wiser to broadcast caution than optimism. Former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince, for example, is best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage business that ""as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.""

""One learns that there's a lot more downside to your reputation if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,"" said the former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. ""It's damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the other way around, you just look like you're being a very cautious, thoughtful banker.""

Banking is ultimately a business of calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the downside, to the possibility that they don't get repaid on their loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.

""It's the old cliche that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; they're always looking around the corner, always aware of what could go wrong,"" Mayo said.

But other longtime Dimon watchers see something else.

Dimon has an ""ulterior motive"" for his public comments, according to Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody.

""I think this rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, whether they happen or not,"" Peabody said. ""With a high-performing, high-growth franchise, he's trying to prevent them from becoming complacent, so I think he's ingrained in their culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.""

Dimon has no shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national debt grows, and President Donald Trump's trade policies continue to jolt adversaries and allies alike.

""It's fair to observe that he's not omniscient and not everything he says comes true,"" said Truist bank analyst Brian Foran. ""He comes at it more from a perspective that you need to be prepared for X, as opposed to we're convinced X is going to happen.""

JPMorgan was better positioned for higher interest rates than most of its peers were in 2023, when rates surged and punished those who held low-yielding long-term bonds, Foran noted.

""For many years, he said, 'Be prepared for the 10-year at 5%, and we all thought he was crazy, because it was like 1% at the time,"" Foran said. ""Turns out that being prepared was not a bad thing.""

Perhaps the best explanation for Dimon's dour outlook is that, no matter how big and powerful JPMorgan is, financial companies can be fragile. The history of finance is one of the rise and fall of institutions, sometimes when managers become complacent or greedy.

In fact, the graveyard of bank logos that are no longer used includes three — Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and First Republic — that have been subsumed by JPMorgan.

During his bank's investor day meeting this month, Dimon pointed out that, in the past decade, JPMorgan has been one of the only firms to earn annual returns of more than 17%.

""If you go back to the 10 years before that, OK, a lot of people earned over 17%,"" Dimon said. ""Almost every single one went bankrupt. Hear what I just said?""

""Almost every single major financial company in the world almost didn't make it,"" he said. ""It's a rough world out there.""

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander poured cold water on Mayor Eric Adams's proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin. 

Lander, who shares responsibility for debt issuance with the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget, said the largest US city won't be issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds while he's in office. Lander, a Democrat, is also a candidate to succeed Adams in November's mayoral election. Adams is running as an independent.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (IBIT) is experiencing record-low volatility, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, which is attracting more interest from larger investors looking for a ""digital gold"" rather than speculative tech-like behavior.

The 90-day rolling volatility of 47.64 is the lowest since the ETF was introduced in January 2024, Balchunas posted on X, a degree of stability that can be self-reinforcing. As volatility drops, larger and more risk-averse investors tend to enter, which in turn further suppresses volatility. 

""The thing with volatility is it can become self-fulfilling,"" Balchunas said in his post. ""The lower the volatility gets, the more bigger investors will bite who will help lower volatility even more. The same 'should' happen with correlation too. This is a direct result of the ‘suitcoiners.'”

The trend is already underway, Balchunas said, citing IBIT's outsized inflows in recent weeks. Since its debut, IBIT has pulled in $49 billion in net inflows, more than four times the amount invested into the second-ranked Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which has attracted less than $12 billion, data from Farside Investors show.

In contrast, Strategy (MSTR), the software company that has made buying bitcoin BTC$104,580.98 a strategic priority, operates on a different appeal. MSTR attracts speculators and options traders who thrive on higher implied volatility (IV). However, even MSTR's IV has dipped recently to 60%, with historical volatility at 49%, contributing to its muted price action.

Previously, James worked as a Research Analyst at Saidler & Co., a Swiss hedge fund, where he developed expertise in on-chain analytics.

How do you save an ailing publicly traded company in 2025? One answer, and an increasingly popular one at that, is: pivot to crypto—or more specifically, become a crypto treasury company.

The previously unknown online gambling marketer SharpLink Gaming did just that earlier this week, when it announced it had raised $425 million in investment to establish an Ethereum treasury. It was a notable departure from the more common route of building a Bitcoin treasury, with Ethereum being the second largest and most liquid crypto asset on the market next to Bitcoin. As part of the raise, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined SharpLink's board of directors. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Before going all in on Ethereum, SharpLink had a market capitalization of around $2 million, trading for just over $2 per share and was just weeks ago dangerously close to being delisted from the Nasdaq for falling below the $1 per share minimum. On Tuesday, everything changed: The company's stock jumped 420% to $35 per share, with a market cap above $23 million.

It's a strategy reminiscent of, well, Strategy. Michael Saylor's company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, laid down the blueprint for how this works: you buy up a bunch of Bitcoin (or, in Sharplink's case, Ethereum), and your stock functions as a proxy bet on the crypto asset. Shares in a crypto treasury company will often trade at a premium to the digital assets because, for the average investor, it's much easier to buy stock than fiddle around with crypto directly.

Before being worth $101.76 billion and amassing a Bitcoin treasure chest worth over $60 billion, MicroStrategy was floundering at a double-digit share price as a fairly average business intelligence software solutions company. MicroStrategy then bought $425 million in Bitcoin in the fall of 2020. The same amount in Ethereum that SharpLink plans to buy. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy came out of nowhere. Just like SharpLink did Tuesday.

So what is SharpLink, and where did it come from?

SharpLink was co-founded in 2019 by now-CEO Rob Phythian and former COO Chris Nicholas, who left the company in 2024. Tori Roberts joined the team in 2021 as vice president, in charge of affiliate marketing with Robert DeLucia following in 2022 as chief financial officer.

According to the official SharpLink site, there are also three independent directors in Leslie Bernhard, Robert Gutkowski, and Obie McKenzie that make up the board of directors, chaired by Phythian himself. 

Bernhard has previously served as a director and chairman in multiple Nasdaq-listed companies, Gutkowski helped seal a $486 million cable distribution deal, and McKenzie was a managing director at BlackRock. So, it appears at least, the directors are a capable bunch.

Put simply, SharpLink Gaming uses technology to help match sports betting companies with fans. According to its LinkedIn page, the company now uses an AI tool that collects and analyzes behavioral insights on users, pushes relevant betting content onto those users, and converts them into paying customers.

Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, it currently sits at a market cap of $55 million trading at nearly $80 per share, already doubling its price since Tuesday, according to data on Trading View. If you bought SBET stock five years ago, though, you're still down around 67%.

The company's revenues declined 26.1% from 2023 to 2024, last year's financial report showed, with cash on hand decreasing by 42.2% to $1.43 million. That said, it saw a positive net income of $10 million, a notable rise from a net loss of $14.2 million.

In 2024, SharpLink Gaming sold two of its businesses for $22.5 million, used most of these proceeds to write off outstanding debts, and completed a domestic merger that changed the company from an Israeli LLC to a Delaware corporation, according to a company release.

In July 2024, the board of directors started a formal review process to “evaluate strategic alternatives” that would “drive growth and create and maximize value” for stockholders. It appears that in this process, the board of directors started to consider cryptocurrency more seriously. 

In February 2025, the company announced that it acquired a 10% equity stake in Armchair Enterprises Limited, a company that owns CryptoCasino.com, as part of a strategy to become the “first Nasdaq-listed company focused on crypto gaming.”

“We carefully evaluated more than two dozen compelling opportunities,” SharpLink CEO Phythian said in a release, referencing the board's review process. “And [we] determined that the combination of market expansion, cost efficiency, security and player demand makes crypto gaming one of the most promising growth opportunities in the online gaming industry today.”

But this initial crypto pivot wasn't enough to prevent the price of SBET stock from dropping 60.8%, from $5.75 to $2.26, over the next two and a half months. 

During this period, SharpLink announced a reverse stock split to stay above Nasdaq's stock price minimum requirement of $1. And then a $4.5 million public stock offering in order to regain  “compliance with Nasdaq's minimum requirement for total stockholders' equity.” 

Things were existential for SharpLink. But that was before the Ethereum treasury strategy led its stock price to surge 420% on Tuesday to $35 a share—and now more than doubling that.

Rob Phythian co-founded SharpLink and today serves as its CEO and chairman of the board of directors. And now he's the Ethereum Michael Saylor.

Pythian founded SharpLink after he spent almost nine and a half years as CEO of SportsHub Technologies, a company that created games and apps for sports gaming sites. Prior to that, he'd also co-founded SportsData LLC, a sports experience creator, and served as its CEO and president.

During his time at SportsHub, he was named by a local business publication as one of the top 100 people to know in Minnesota. Phythian was hailed a pioneer and a “sports tech godfather.”

One former business partner told Decrypt that he has great respect for Pythian.

""I worked with Rob maybe 10 or 15 years ago on [an unnamed] skill gaming venture,” Matthew Warneford, CEO of Roblox game creator Dubit, told Decrypt. “Rob's a great guy, very smart, and good to work with. Have nothing but positive things to say.""

By 2023, now CEO of SharpLink, Phythian and his company started to embrace artificial intelligence. In a guest blog post for Sportico, he outlined a future where AI could help personalize the sport fan experience, while also batting away concerns that AI outputs are too generic as he believed that the tide was turning.

A year later, it was clear that the company needed a new direction, and Pythian led the company through its shift to crypto gaming. 

And now he's leading SharpLink into its next phase as the Microstrategy of Ethereum. The question now is: Will it work?

If Phythian follows Saylor's playbook, then the next step will be to sell shares, or debt against those shares, to buy more Ethereum. Then rise and repeat. That likely bodes well for ETH—and perhaps even SBET shareholders. But what it means for SharpLink as a business is an open question. It's a gamble, but one that so far appears to be paying off.

The Ethereum blockchain has yet to see a significant increase in activity despite successive upgrades, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report.

""Neither the number of daily transactions nor the number of active addresses saw a material increase post recent upgrades,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the Wednesday report.

Still, total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum increased between the Dencun upgrade in March 2024 and Pectra earlier this month, the bank noted, possibly due to increased lending and borrowing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), but the increase looks lower in dollar terms than in the blockchain's ether ETH$2,574.12 token.

Ethereum activated the Pectra upgrade on May 7. The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality and improve overall efficiency.

Pectra makes the ETH token and Ethereum itself more appealing to institutions, the bank said. It distinguishes the network from competitors, but the upgrades haven't boosted activity in a meaningful way.

The bank noted that following the Dencun upgrade, both average and total fees fell, in part because of a shift toward layer 2 chains.

Ether's circulating supply also increased after Dencun, which raised concerns about the crypto ""becoming an inflationary asset amid subdued transaction activity,"" JPMorgan said.

Futures positioning suggests that institutions played a large role in the recent rally in ether, the report added. Ether has risen more than 45% in the past month, CoinDesk data show.

Optimistic traders betting on future crypto gains have been largely burned over the last day, with liquidations on crypto positions surging above the $800 million mark over the past 24 hours as prices decline.

More than $827 million worth of bets have been liquidated during that span, per data from CoinGlass, with long positions making the vast majority of the bunch at $747 million worth.

Bitcoin is the biggest single source of pain for traders, making up $222 million worth of soured bets, with Ethereum next at nearly $122 million. Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin round out the top five for daily asset liquidations.

All of those coins are in the red on Friday, with the broader crypto market declining in value by 4.3% over the last day.

Dogecoin is leading the pack for losses among the top 10 coins by market cap, falling 9% over the past day as of this writing and sitting just below the $0.20 price mark. DOGE hasn't been this low since May 8.

Meanwhile, Solana is down by nearly 5% at $160, XRP has fallen 3.3% to $2.20, and Ethereum is off by 3% at a current price of $2.573.

Bitcoin's daily dip of 1.3% is less notable at a current price of $104,730, though it came close to the $104,000 mark earlier this afternoon. The leading cryptocurrency has struggled in recent days to hold onto last week's gains, surging just over a week ago to hit a new all-time high mark of $111,814.

Friday's crypto slide comes as stock market indices were also down earlier in the day following Thursday's down GDP report, and recent back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and the courts over whether his global tariffs are legal.

In a Friday market note, BRN Lead Research Analyst Valentin Fournier said to expect ""further short-term weakness for Bitcoin"" before a potential pop to new heights.

“We expect a temporary drop toward the $100K level before a broader move toward $130K-$150K, after which altcoins could take over,"" he wrote.

The crypto market crash continued on Friday as profit-taking accelerated and concerns about trade and the Federal Reserve deepened.

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to $105,500, down from the all-time high of $111,900 last week. The other top laggards were altcoins like PancakeSwap (CAKE), Raydium (RAY), Ethena (ENA), and Arbitrum (ARB), which dropped by over 10%.

The crypto market crash triggered a wave of liquidations. CoinGlass data shows that 24-hour liquidations jumped by 125% to $709 million. Almost 224,000 traders were liquidated, with the largest loss amounting to nearly $13 million.

Cryptocurrencies retreated as Bitcoin lost momentum following its strong rally that pushed it to its all-time high last week. It is common for Bitcoin's price to pull back slightly after hitting a record high or a crucial milestone.

When Bitcoin sneezes, altcoins catch a cold. This explains why many altcoins have crashed even harder.

Second, Bitcoin and altcoins have declined in anticipation of June, which is typically the second-worst month for the crypto market after September. On average, Bitcoin returns -0.35% in June, as many investors take time off at the start of the summer season.

Third, there are lingering concerns about trade after a court ruled that Trump's tariffs were illegal. Another court allowed these tariffs to continue as the administration appeals, a process that will take it to the Supreme Court.

Finally, there are signs that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at 4.50% for a while. Minutes released this week showed that officials are comfortable with a wait-and-see approach as they assess the impact of tariffs on inflation.

Technicals and fundamentals suggest that the crypto bull run has a long way to go. As crypto.news wrote here, the ongoing Bitcoin price action is part of the formation of the handle section of the cup and handle pattern. It is also forming a bullish flag pattern, which could result in a strong breakout and an altcoin market rally.

The other sign that the bull market is not over is Bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics. Demand continues to rise, with ETFs bringing in over $45 billion in inflows and more companies adding it to their treasuries.

The supply on exchanges has dropped from 3.5 million in 2020 to 1.35 million. Therefore, this supply and demand dynamic suggests the coin will bounce back.

 As sports organizations expand into blockchain, fan engagement is evolving from collectibles to full digital participation. 

0xFútbol aims to unite football's global community by integrating blockchain technology, empowering fans to actively engage, influence and gain ownership within the sport.

Football is more than just a sport; it's a global phenomenon with an estimated four billion passionate fans worldwide. As these fans begin exploring blockchain and Web3 technologies, significant industry leaders are recognizing the need to meet them halfway.

FIFA, the international governing body for football, recently took a step in this direction by partnering with blockchain platform Avalanche to launch its own blockchain network, ushering football into the decentralized era.

This custom blockchain aims to deliver digital collectibles and next-generation fan experiences, setting the stage for massive fan engagement leading up to events such as the 2026 World Cup.

But FIFA isn't alone. Projects around the globe are racing to realize this vision, transforming passive spectators into active owners and participants. One of these projects is 0xFútbol, a blockchain-powered ecosystem designed to unite football's global fan base within Web3.

0xFútbol's mission is clear: onboard the next four billion football fans into Web3 by creating engaging, culturally relevant and valuable products that football enthusiasts genuinely want to use.

Unlike single-purpose applications, 0xFútbol offers a diverse ecosystem of experiences, including games, prediction markets and fan engagement platforms — unified by the project's native token, FUTBOL, which is set for launch on June 3.

The products in the 0xFútbol ecosystem cater to diverse interests among fans: MetaSoccer, with over 50,000 users in its beta phase, is a Web3 football management game where players build, manage and compete with their virtual teams.

For casual gamers, Wonderkid offers a quick and competitive football-based mini-game on Telegram, attracting more than 168,000 registered users. Ultras, currently in its minimal viable product (MVP) stage, is a “phygital” platform aimed at helping clubs directly engage and reward their supporters. The team said that they are in talks with top-tier clubs for potential Ultras partnerships.

Additionally, 0xFútbol is launching FútbolPM later this year, a prediction market that allows fans to leverage their football knowledge for monetary rewards. Behind the scenes, FUTBOL acts as the connecting thread, enabling seamless interactions across this rich tapestry of football experiences.

0xFútbol believes fans deserve more than the traditional passive role assigned to them. Despite the immense passion of fans, football lacks a unified global community. In the current landscape, fans rarely have meaningful ownership or decision-making power.

The vision behind 0xFútbol is to change this status quo, establishing a world where fans are active participants, organizers and stakeholders in the sport.

From watchers to owners.From noise to voice.We're building the fútbol movement fans have always deserved ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/d4k2oS4qPb

Each product developed by 0xFútbol brings new users into this decentralized ecosystem, steadily transforming individual voices into a powerful collective force capable of influencing football culture, governance and economics.

0xFútbol's ambitious goal is backed by prominent partnerships and investors who share the project's vision, including investors such as Protocol Labs, Consensys Mesh and Techstars. Collaborations span major tech entities such as AWS for Startups, Microsoft for Startups, Brinc, XDC Network, Atleta Network, Boba Network, Matchain and global projects like Fitchin, led by football star Kun Agüero.

The beautiful game is entering a new era where fans are owners shaping football's future. As Web3 continues to gain momentum within the space, initiatives like 0xFútbol promise to redefine fan engagement, making football fairer, more transparent and fundamentally fan-owned.

The cryptocurrency developer and its partners believe the product structure could also be used to fund other impact-linked areas.

The Cardano Foundation and Switzerland for UNHCR have collaborated to launch a new exchange traded product (ETP) that will funnel rewards for investment in a blockchain pool into a stream of funding for UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency, potentially worth up to $2m (€1.76) a year. 

The Cardano Impact for UNHCR ETP allows investors to donate all of the so-called staking rewards from an investment in blockchain platform Cardano's digital currency to fund UNHCR's emergency response and refugee programmes in more than 135 countries. The ETP was launched on 28 May on the SIX Swiss Exchange, Switzerland's main stock exchange. 

Staking rewards are extra cryptocurrency generated as returns for investors to encourage them to place their digital tokens in a given blockchain network. Directing these rewards to an organisation such as UNHCR does not reduce the underlying digital assets.

The Cardano Foundation is a Swiss-based non-profit set up to advance the Cardano platform as a public infrastructure. Cardano's cryptocurrency is currently one of the world's top ten in terms of its market capitalisation, which stands at around $22bn, according to the foundation. Its currency is known as the ADA, named after computer pioneer Ada Lovelace. On 27 May, 1 ADA was worth €0.68.

The Cardano Foundation said that, based on current ADA staking yields of around 3.5% and projections of fund inflows, the ETP could generate $1.5m-$2m in annual donations for UNHCR with $50m in assets under management.

Contributions to the underlying stake pool so far include 3.5m ADA from the Cardano Foundation, alongside more than 200 holdings delegated to the pool by the HOSKY group of ADA investors and their supporters, making a total of 6.3m ADA. 

Investors in the ETP can withdraw their contributions to the staking pool at short notice, making it a flexible investment. Cardano said institutions could invest using US dollars, Euros or Swiss francs and that no blockchain knowledge was required.

Oliver Anselmo, deputy executive director at Switzerland for UNHCR, described the ETP launch as a world first in sustainable finance and humanitarian aid.

“It transforms passive investment returns into a recurring, scalable stream of support for people who have lost everything,” he said.

Switzerland for UNHCR is the national partner of the UNHCR in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, mobilising resources and raising awareness related to the refugee organisation's activities .  

Frederik Gregaard, the Cardano Foundation's CEO, said blockchain had the potential to provide innovative ways of helping those seeking refuge.

“With the technology and use cases now at a stage where they have the capacity to substantially facilitate daily operations, the widespread adoption of humanitarian blockchain solutions must become one of the industry's key priorities,” he said.

The ETP has been structured by issuance.swiss,  a Swiss-based issuer of regulated digital asset products. The issuer described the ETP as an industry-first that merged full regulatory compliance, institutional-grade staking infrastructure, and humanitarian aid in one product.

Pavel Izmaylov, CEO of issuance.swiss, said the model could and should be replicated.

“Discussions are already underway to launch additional impact-linked ETPs supporting education, climate resilience, and public health within the next six to 12 months,” he said.

Custody and staking for the ETP are operated by Taurus, a securities and digital asset infrastructure firm, based in Geneva.

Technology and policy in India

Three years after the launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital rupee in circulation has surged to Rs 1,016.5 crore in 2025, up from Rs 16.4 crore in 2023. Consequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is exploring the digital rupee's deployment for cross-border payments on a bilateral basis. The apex bank is also mulling participation in multilateral CBDC initiatives under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub as disclosed in the RBI's Annual Report for 2024–2025.

The digital rupee now incorporates offline use cases and programmability features, in addition to cross-border pilots. Programmability allows government agencies to permit CBDC use for defined benefits or within a specified time and/or particular location. The different use cases include:

The Odisha government disbursed funds to 88,000 beneficiaries using digital rupees under the Subhadra Yojana Scheme. For context, this state government scheme provides women with financial assistance of Rs 10,000 yearly for five years.

Non-bank entities, including fintechs like MobiKwik and CRED, have been allowed to launch CBDC wallets. The RBI aims to “enhance adoption and improve distribution” through this approval. 

As of March 2025, 17 banks and 60 lakh users have engaged with the e₹-Retail pilot. The RBI aims to further expand the scope of ongoing digital rupee pilots in both e₹-Retail and e₹-Wholesale through the launch of new use cases and features. While the wholesale version of e-Rupee is meant for financial institutions like banks, the retail version is accessible to individuals for regular transactions.

As of March 2025, the platform houses 44 lenders—including banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). These entities avail themselves of over 60 data services across 12 loan journeys, including KCC loans, digital cattle loans, and MSME loans, among others. The central bank aims to expand the scope and coverage of the platform to tap more products, data providers, and lenders.

These statistics follow the RBI's push for ULI adoption among ecosystem players earlier this year. For context, ULI allows lenders to access authenticated data, including land records and other details from various sources via standardised APIs.

Besides its fintech department, the RBI shared the progress on the 2024-2025 goals of its Department of Supervision (DoS) for financial intermediaries. 

The RBI noted that it has deployed MuleHunter.ai, its AI tool for real-time identification of mule accounts, across select large public sector banks. Additionally, the RBI recounted the establishment of a FREE-AI committee for the financial sector and the development of a framework for self-regulatory organisations in the fintech and account aggregator ecosystems.

Home » News » Forthcoming bill will ‘proactively address' regulatory uncertainty in crypto

With more than 1.5 million Pennsylvanians owning cryptocurrencies, the state should develop clear regulatory guidelines for blockchain technology and digital assets, said State Rep. Torren Ecker (R-193), who plans to introduce legislation that would provide such certainty.

“Without defined rules, Pennsylvania risks falling behind other states and countries actively supporting blockchain development,” Ecker wrote in a May 28 editorial for the House Republican Caucus. “Ambiguity in current regulations hampers entrepreneurs, developers, and investors from fully embracing blockchain's potential.”

Consumers also remain vulnerable as they're uncertain about their rights and protections, he added.

To address the challenge, Ecker said he plans to introduce the Blockchain Basics Act, which would establish clear guidelines for blockchain technology — which are databases that maintain a growing list of records, called blocks — and cryptocurrency activities, helping to foster innovation, protect consumers, and maintain the state's competitive edge. 

The bill will mirror the federal Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT21) Act, which gained bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives last year before stalling in the U.S. Senate, said Ecker.

“The Blockchain Basics Act ensures practical benefits for both citizens and businesses,” he wrote.

Specifically, Ecker said his bill would enable individuals and businesses to accept digital assets as payment for goods and services, securely store digital assets, and participate freely in blockchain activities without needing special licenses. 

“This clarity and accessibility will empower Pennsylvanians to safely and confidently engage in the digital economy,” wrote the lawmaker.

Ecker thinks that establishing clear regulatory standards in the state will attract investment, encourage innovation, and position the commonwealth as a global leader in blockchain technology. 

“Businesses and innovators thrive in environments with predictable and fair regulations,” according to his post. “Pennsylvania has a unique opportunity to set a nationwide example by proactively addressing regulatory uncertainty. Now is the time to act decisively.”

At press time, Ecker had not officially introduced the Blockchain Basics Act, according to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives' legislative site.

Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions.

Bitcoin BTC$104,576.52 is down 2.1% in the last 24 hours, trading just above $104,000 after briefly hitting a session low of $103,900. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — slumped even further, by 4.2%.

Smart contract platforms were particularly affected, with solana SOL$160.50, sui SUI$3.34 and avalanche AVAX$21.25 losing 6.3%, 7.8% and 7.3% respectively.

Crypto stocks also took a hit, especially bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR), down 8.3% on the day after a run-up that saw the stock rise 132% from April 16 to May 21. Strategy (MSTR) slid 2.7%, and Coinbase (COIN) 1.3%.

The bleeding wasn't contained to crypto. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.5% respectively, while gold lost 0.7%.

Behind the price action was the flare-up of U.S. trade tensions once again after an agreement was struck earlier this month. The concerns came after President Donald Trump accused China in a post on Truth Social of ""violating"" the tariff truce between the countries.

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that talks had ""stalled"" with the Chinese representatives.

China, in response, urged the U.S. to ""immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions,"" BBC reported.

The cool-off between U.S. and China helped risk assets rally in May, providing a tailwind for BTC to clinch a new record high. The re-escalation now threatens to unwind some of those gains.

The native token of Livepeer LPT$10.99, a decentralized artificial intelligence video processing protocol, soared on Friday to its strongest price in four months on exchange listing and other catalyst.

The token advanced 150% over the past 24 hours, hitting a session high at $14.20, CoinDesk data shows. The surge defied a slump in the broader crypto market, with bitcoin BTC$104,576.52 sliding 2% below $106,000 and the CoinDesk 20 Index declining 3.5% during the same period. Most artificial intelligence-linked tokens were down 5%-10%.

The price action happened as popular Korean exchange Upbit introduced trading with the token against KRW and Tether's USDT on its platform earlier on Friday.

Joel Kruger, a crypto market strategist, highlighted that asset manager Grayscale introduced earlier this week its Artificial Intelligence Crypto Sector, with Livepeer being included among the 20 cryptocurrencies.

Ecosystem developer Livepeer Foundation's advisory boards also kicked into gear,  starting a community survey about the platform's strategic direction, he pointed out.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the operator of Truth Social, said on Friday it has closed a $2.44 billion fundraising deal to establish a bitcoin BTC$104,576.52 treasury.

DJT shares erased early morning losses and were up 5.6% on the day following the news.

The company sold nearly 56 million shares at $25.72 apiece and issued $1 billion in 0% convertible notes maturing in 2028, according to a press release. Some 50 institutional investors subscribed to the offering. The placement was led by Yorkville Securities and Clear Street, with Cantor Fitzgerald serving as financial advisor.

The firm said it will direct the net proceeds of $2.32 billion to purchase BTC for its treasury, with Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital providing custody services.

The move adds the company to a growing list of publicly-traded firms that have raised capital for adding crypto assets like bitcoin to their balance sheet, a playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). The software firm has become the world's largest corporate holder of the leading crypto asset, accumulating over $60 billion in BTC by financing the purchases via a combination of equity and debt issuances.

Trump Media shared plans earlier this year to launch a financial services platform focusing on crypto and customized exchange-traded funds. It also said it wants to partner with crypto exchange Crypto.com to launch the ETF products.

 Stripe's president confirms growing interest in stablecoins from banks, but adoption would still require more green lights from regulators. 

Payment giant Stripe has reportedly held early discussions with banks about potentially integrating stablecoins, signaling growing acceptance in global banking.

After debuting stablecoin-based accounts in 100 countries in early May, Stripe has noticed significant interest in stablecoins — cryptocurrencies tied to fiat currencies like the US dollar — from global banks.

“In the conversations we have with them, they're very interested,” Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said in an interview with Bloomberg News on May 30.

“This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well,” he stated.

The growing interest by banks to integrate stablecoins comes from understanding that such cryptocurrencies offer significantly lower transaction costs for payments, including foreign exchange fees by banks.

“It's extremely expensive to do. It's very slow. It takes a matter of days,” Collison said. “No one is happy with that equilibrium today. And so I think you will see those kind of profit pools come under attack.”

On the other hand, stablecoins offer instant transactions with fees being significantly less than those of FX, Collison said, making a perfect case for payment use globally.

“A lot of our future payment volume is going to be in stablecoins,” Collison said. “This is, for sure, a big part of our business on a go-forward basis,” he added.

Stablecoins have already made an impact on traditional finance, beating volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined in 2024.

While showing interest in stablecoins, some jurisdictions like the United Kingdom might be falling behind in the race to attract stablecoin operators if they don't move faster with regulations, Collison said.

“You have companies that are being set up to serve this industry — if maybe there was a really good regulatory framework, they would choose to base here,” the Stripe exec said, adding:

Collison referred to the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation taking force in late 2024, while the UK Financial Conduct Authority is still seeking public feedback on new stablecoin rules as recently as May 28.

The latest insights by Collison align with reports suggesting that banks in the United States have been seeking even clearer guidelines from the government clarifying what they can do in crypto.

On the other hand, despite falling behind in terms of stablecoin regulation, the UK has seen the largest increase in new crypto owners in the past year, outpacing Europe, according to Gemini.

SpaceX's Starbase Is Officially a City. Some Neighbors Aren't Thrilled

Starbase, SpaceX's launch site turned company town in South Texas, faces local opposition from residents outside the city limits

By Paola Rosa-Aquino edited by Lee Billings

SpaceX rockets stand near the end of a neighborhood street in the company's Starbase launch complex in this photograph from October 2021. Starbase was officially incorporated as a city of Cameron County, Texas in May 2025.

Before SpaceX's Starship lost control and exploded over the Indian Ocean during its ninth test flight, the 400-foot-tall megarocket blasted off from Texas's newest city.

Starbase, situated on 1.5 square miles of the Lone Star State's southernmost tip in the Rio Grande Valley, is mostly made up of SpaceX employees living on company-owned property and abuts a habitat for endangered wildlife, as well as a public beach.

Starbase serves as the main testing and launch location for Starship, SpaceX's planned fully reusable spacecraft, which is meant to revolutionize human and uncrewed space travel with its gargantuan payload capacity and rapid-fire flight cadence. If Starship's development proceeds as planned, the megarocket could soon be ferrying crew and cargo alike to multiple otherworldly destinations—such as the lunar surface, for NASA's Artemis program, and Mars, in fulfillment of SpaceX founder Elon Musk's long-stated dream. But nearby residents worry about less glamorous local effects, fearing that a town built around the space company could continue SpaceX's alleged pattern of polluting the area and blocking access to the nearby beach and other open public spaces.

“SpaceX has already proven itself to be an extremely bad neighbor,” says Christopher Basaldú, an anthropologist and environmentalist and co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, who lives in nearby Brownsville, Tex. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Long before it was Starbase, the area's beaches, tidal flats and wetlands were of great significance to the Indigenous Carrizo/Comecrudo people (or Esto'k Gna in their own language). Many of them still live nearby as members of the modern-day Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. Today the area is largely Latino and among the poorest in the country. Musk's space company began buying up property there in 2012; ever since company housing and rocket-related infrastructure have steadily sprouted.

“We've grown quite a bit just in the last couple of years. It's a couple hundred employees [and] their families, living amongst actual rockets,” said Daniel Huot, a SpaceX communications manager, during a company livestream before Tuesday's Starship test flight.

Huot added that the move to incorporate what was formerly Boca Chica Village as Starbase will help the company “scale more quickly [to] try to build out the best community possible for all the people that are building the future of humanity's place in space.”

Even before SpaceX began launching rockets at the site, neighbors complained about potential environmental woes stemming from the company's operations. In a 2018 press conference, Musk dismissed such concerns, saying “We've got a lot of land with no one around, and so if [a rocket] blows up, it's cool.”

The first launch of the 40-story-tall Starship vehicle in April 2023 didn't entirely proceed as planned—it blew up the concrete launch pad and left a literal crater behind. Particulate debris, as well as concrete and steel shrapnel from the botched launch, scattered far and wide across the surrounding landscape, igniting fires and slamming into protected habitats and public beaches. Ash, dust and sand grains hurled aloft by this first Starship flight test rained down as far out as Port Isabel, Tex., about five miles from the launch site.

Local environmentalists have also sounded the alarm on how the company's activities at Starbase could increase chemical and sonic pollution that puts migratory birds and other vulnerable endangered species in the area at greater risk.

Despite these brewing tensions, Starbase was incorporated in early May, making it the first new city in Cameron County, Texas, in 30 years.

Only people who live in the immediate area—almost all of them SpaceX employees—were eligible to vote for the new city. Residents voted 212 for and six against. The city's mayor and commissioners—all current or former SpaceX employees—ran unopposed. “Now [SpaceX has] stolen away not only a neighborhood but the land around it, which had been basically environmentally untouched areas,” says Basaldú, who is a member of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe.

Starbase's boundaries snake along State Highway 4, which provides the only access to both Starbase and the open-to-the-public Boca Chica Beach. A bill pending in the Texas Legislature would shift control over weekday closures of the beach and nearby roadways from the county commissioners to Starbase city leaders now that Starbase is a municipality under law.

“As a community, we were there first,” says Suquiery Santillana, a resident of nearby Brownsville, Tex., who has visited Boca Chica Beach since childhood. “I'm almost 50, and now my grandkids are going.” Her family's trips to the isolated shoreline now include wide-eyed roadside spectators from all across the country who want to catch a glimpse of the SpaceX launch site. While Santillana is happy that SpaceX has brought jobs to the area, she would like the company to communicate more about upcoming closures and launch plans with locals.

Members of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe also trace their creation story to this once-pristine beach. The intermittent access restrictions imposed by SpaceX's launches, some tribe members say, limit them from freely participating in traditions such as fishing and tribal ceremonies that have been taking place on their ancestral land for thousands of years.

Activity at the site could soon ramp up even more. On May 22 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it had granted approval for SpaceX to increase the annual number of Starbase launches from five to 25. Eventually, Starship flights from the site could far exceed that because the vehicle is designed for very fast turnaround times and an unprecedentedly high launch cadence. Starship's sheer size, coupled with more frequent launches, could balloon Starbase's overall environmental footprint while also essentially shutting down Highway 4 for much of the year. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For now, Starbase is poised to continue its rapid development and expansion, with plans in the works for more housing, offices and rocket launch facilities. Jim Chapman of the local environmental justice nonprofit Save RGV (Rio Grande Valley) worries that Starbase's incorporation could allow SpaceX to skirt important regulatory hurdles. “[SpaceX has] fewer layers of bureaucracy that [it has] to go through and get approval from,” he says. “But on the other hand, I haven't really seen the county denying [it] anything.”

As SpaceX vies to fly ever more powerful rockets in pursuit of Musk's interplanetary aspirations, local residents also fear that the company's launch activity and its proximity to new natural gas projects could pose grave threats to Rio Grande Valley communities. One such project currently under construction is less than six miles from the launch site—too close for comfort, some critics say, given the possibility of volatile explosions sparked by showers of fiery rocket debris.

If Musk's latest projections are to be trusted (he often overpromises and underdelivers on meeting ambitious rocketry deadlines), additional Starship test flights will blast off from Starbase every few weeks for the rest of the summer. Time will tell if the company will be mindful of those who live next door.

That's because German manufacturer Rheinmetall put an electric-vehicle charger in there.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

Let's face it: EV chargers aren't exactly what we'd call nice to look at. Many EV charging companies have replicated the gas pump aesthetic, but little consideration has been given to integrating these chargers into city centers. That's where Rheinmetall—a German arms manufacturer with a mobility division—comes in with its Curb Charger. 

As the name implies, the Curb Charger replaces a small portion of the curb along city streets, allowing the charger to take up effectively zero sidewalk real estate. It's a neat and tidy Level 2 charger that's much tidier than existing solutions, and that's a massive deal when it comes to city planning. The unit itself is a 176-pound lump of aluminum and stainless steel, with internals capable of pumping out 22 kilowatts of power to your electric vehicle. 

It didn't take us long to notice that the Curb Charger doesn't include a charging cable. That's by design—you'll need to bring your own—but it likely isn't a massive deal, as many vehicles arrive from the factory with a Level 2 charging cable included. Once you've arrived at the charger (which will show up on the existing apps you use to find chargers), you'll follow the same process of validating your vehicle before plugging it in. And that's it.

To streamline connectivity, each Curb Charger features an integrated 4G Modem and Ethernet port, along with an RFID reader and display. This gives motorists the option to connect with a smartphone using an app or QR code, as well as an RFID “charge card.” Once the vehicle is charging, you get to enjoy the city and come back with extra juice. 

Rheinmetall says the charger can withstand just about any condition Mother Nature can throw at it. Being so low to the ground, its IP68 water resistance rating—meaning that it can be submerged in over three feet of water for 30 minutes—was an absolute must. The company states that the Curb Charger also features built-in drains to ensure that it can maintain a steady supply of electricity to your electric vehicle during a downpour. Despite its imperviousness to rain, it does have a failsafe that cuts the power in the event of a flood.

For areas that experience extreme winters, it also features a heater that's able to melt any snow and ice that accumulates. (As for the ice on your vehicle, however—you'll still need to handle that yourself.)

One of the significant concerns we had with the Curb Charger was the potential for the device (and, specifically, the cord connecting the EV to the device) to be a tripping hazard. Rheinmetall, however, argues that the charger's proximity to the vehicle reduces the need for cables to be spread across the sidewalk. That might be a perfectly ideal solution for European countries, but Americans will likely take less care to keep their cable out of harm's way. Here in the states, there's an equally high chance that drivers are just going to take the first available spot, regardless of whether or not they're driving an EV. 

Last but not least, we were wondering about how Rheinmetall's chargers connect to the power grid. And it's much simpler than we thought, as they're able to tap into any existing connection cabinet on the street. As a bonus, the Curb Chargers are hot-swappable, should anything go wrong with them. 

Rheinmetall's plans to roll out the Curb Charger are unknown at the moment, but the company did complete a pilot program in Cologne, Germany, with great success. Over the course of 12 months, the charger achieved 99% uptime, with more than 2,800 sessions.

Resistance to disease should mean a longer life, but researchers have found that a mutant protein that helps a plant fight mildew might make it age sooner.

The Osaka Metropolitan University research team of Graduate School of Agriculture student Tomoko Matsumoto and Professor Noriko Inada and Graduate School of Science Professor Koichi Kobayashi discovered that thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants with the mutant Actin Depolymerizing Factor protein turn yellow sooner over time and in dark conditions compared to wild-type thale cress.

""ADFs are involved not only in leaf aging but also in disease response and plant growth control,"" Professor Inada explained. ""Further elucidation of the function of ADFs can help contribute to crop yield improvement and enhanced sustainability of agricultural production.""

An area buried deep in the brain is a hotspot for immune cells called T cells.

Specialized immune cells can act as ‘spies' that
carry information about the gut and fat tissue into the brain
. This surveillance system, uncovered in mice, is crucial to the brain's control of behaviour such as pursuit of food. The newly identified cells have molecular traits that give them entry into the core of the brain. Their function is shaped by diet and the microbiome; without them, even hungry mice are slow to eat.

When a scientist moves away from their original area of expertise,
their publications receive fewer citations than their previous work
. An analysis of millions of papers revealed that the larger the shift away from a scientist's field, the greater the effect — a phenomenon coined the ‘pivot penalty'. A pivot can also make getting a paper published, and securing initial funding, more difficult. “When you move out of the area in which you're trusted, you lose that recognition,” says science-policy specialist Kieron Flanagan.

Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”. The order mandates the overhaul of research-integrity policies to ensure that the federal government promotes “transparent, rigorous, and impactful” science. Researchers who spoke to

Voice recordings examined by artificial intelligence (AI) could reveal new biomarkers of conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's. Neurologists can often spot the tell-tale signs of an illness in someone's voice, but
AI systems could grant non-specialists the same ability, and detect more subtle vocal changes
than people. The measure isn't perfect, not least because people's voices fluctuate from day to day, and there is a lack of long-term data. But AI-guided vocal analysis might one day allow physicians to monitor their patients remotely and get early warnings of a range of conditions.

Around the world, arts therapies have seen success for a range of conditions, such as improving mobility in people with Parkinson's. These ‘art for health' initiatives use activities, such as choir rehearsals or museum visits, as
add-on therapies to help treat, and raise awareness of, both physical and mental conditions
. But critics of the practice believe it needs more robust evaluation — and a clear definition of what counts as ‘art' — before it's adopted as a standard treatment. “We have more to gain by leaning into the arts as a health resource than we have to lose,” argues drama therapist Nisha Sajnani.

Today I'm considering my badminton skills. I'm a little rusty, having not played the sport for some time, so I might struggle to beat a person. But I stand a chance at beating a
badminton-playing robot
. The robot has four legs, one arm to hold its racket, and a camera to locate and aim for the shuttlecock. Though not a championship-level player yet, the bot maintained a rally of 10 shots after a little practice, so maybe it would still best me after all….

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","DOGE Is Busier Than Ever—and Trump Says Elon Musk Is 'Really Not Leaving'","https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-really-not-leaving/","Fri, 30 May 2025 19:01:11 GMT","

Elon Musk will not be fully exiting the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—and its activities are only intensifying. On Friday, President Donald Trump threw cold water on the idea that Musk would fully disappear from DOGE and the White House forever. ""Elon's really not leaving,” Trump said in a joint press conference with Musk in the Oval Office. “He's gonna be back and forth. It's his baby, he's going to be doing a lot of things.""

“I expect to continue to provide advice,"" Musk, wearing a black hat with DOGE written on it and a black shirt reading “DOGEFATHER,” said during Friday's press conference, while noting that his legal limit for service as a special government employee was coming to an end. ""I expect to remain a friend and an advisor.”

Federal workers from at least six agencies tell WIRED that DOGE-style work is escalating in their departments.

Both new and familiar DOGE faces have also been recently detailed to new agencies, according to sources. Members of Musk's early DOGE team, including Luke Farritor, Gavin Kliger, Edward Coristine, and Sam Corcos, have met with a number of departments and agencies—including the Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, and the FBI—in recent days, seemingly continuing business as usual, WIRED has learned.

The team also appears to be actively recruiting, according to documents viewed by WIRED.

Over the last week, federal workers have also been asked to urgently review and potentially cancel contracts across the government. Trump appeared to confirm that contracts were under review at Friday's press conference: ""Many contracts, Elon, right now are being looked at,” he said.

Some agencies have also received visits from DOGE at their headquarters, WIRED has learned.

“This doesn't sound like a group that is going away, it sounds like one that's digging in like a parasite,” an IT specialist at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) tells WIRED.

Since DOGE first began its work in Washington in late January, its representatives have been eager to cut what they see as superfluous spending in government. In recent weeks, the pressure to slash and cancel contracts, specifically focused on workforce management and IT, has drastically increased, multiple sources at a variety of agencies tell WIRED.

“Biggest thing is we are being asked to cut as many contracts for software and labor as possible,” one tech worker at the Department of the Interior (DOI) tells WIRED, saying that the stated goal, as they understand it, has been “to save money and efficiency in consolidated IT.”

“We are cutting developers, telecom, server admins, call center staff etc.,” the DOI source says. “Some things were bloated and could use the cut. Others are going to suffer, and our service to the public is going to be degraded.”

Employees at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and all the agencies under its umbrella, were told that contracts would have to go through a new approval process called the Departmental Efficiency Review (DER). Any requisitioning or contract approval is paused until after workers submit a form to start the DER and the deputy secretary's office reviews the funding, according to an email about the process obtained by WIRED. The email also states that the review will flag any contracts that appear to be expensive and excessive.

Urgent contract oversight is also occurring at the Department of Labor (DOL). “There is a LOT of pressure to end these contracts as soon as possible, within the next few days,” a source at the DOL told WIRED on Thursday.

At other agencies, like the USDA and the Treasury, some tech workers were recently notified that they may be asked to interview with someone at DOGE for an unspecified reason. “Just last week we were warned of possible contact from DOGE for interviews,” the USDA IT source says, adding that no one told workers what the interviews would be about. At Treasury, employees were told those who perform “some of the more technical functions” would be pulled into these interviews.

Tech contractors at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), one of the first agencies DOGE burrowed into, were suddenly let go after returning from the long Memorial Day weekend. Their termination letters credited DOGE with their dismissal.

“The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has modified the IT services contract with RMCI [an IT contractor] that you support,” the termination letters say. “As a result, it is with regret that your work on the OPM contract will end.”

During Friday's press conference, Trump gifted Musk what appeared to be a golden key in a box that had a picture of the White House, thanking him for his last few months of government work.

“DOGE is integral to the federal government's operations, and its mission, as established by the President's executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and department heads in the Trump administration,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields tells WIRED. “DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented pace, and its work is far from complete.”

United States DOGE Service administrator Amy Gleason did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

“Elon may be stepping away, but DOGE's mission remains stronger than ever. Exposing reckless, wasteful government spending isn't about one individual—it's about a lasting overhaul of Crazy Town,” congressman Aaron Bean, chair of the House DOGE caucus, tells WIRED about the group's continued work. “From reducing fraudulent payments by reforming the Treasury payment system to modernizing federal processes, like the OPM retirement system, the House DOGE Caucus is working to codify targeted spending cuts to rein in government overreach and deliver real accountability to the American people. We are also working closely with the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE's critical findings—turning transparency into action. Rest assured, the House DOGE Caucus is here for the long haul, and our work is just getting started.”

WordPress.com parent company Automattic is changing direction… again.

In a blog post titled “Returning to Core” published Thursday evening, Automattic announced it will unpause its contributions to the WordPress project. This is despite having said only last month that the 6.8 WordPress release would be the final major release for all of 2025.

“After pausing our contributions to regroup, rethink, and plan strategically, we're ready to press play again and return fully to the WordPress project,” the new blog post states. “Expect to find our contributions across all of the greatest hits — WordPress Core, Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, and WordPress.org. This return is a moment of excitement for us as it's about continuing the mission we've always believed in: democratizing publishing for everyone, everywhere,” it reads.

Automattic says it's learned a lot from the pause in terms of the many ways WordPress is used, and that it's now committed to helping it “grow and thrive.” 

The post also notes that WordPress today powers 43% of the web. 

It's unclear what has changed.

However, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg explained in an internal post published last night that he wants to get a 6.9 release out this year with an admin refresh and something from the “new AI team.” (The latter references this week's announcement that WordPress formed a new team to steward the development of AI projects.)

“I don't think that will happen without our contributions,” the post stated, according to a source familiar with the internal discussions. 

Insiders are speculating there's more to it than that, and various theories are being floated. Some wonder if Mullenweg was pressured into this move or if he realized that pulling back wasn't good for his business or its reputation? Others are debating if this change of heart has to do with Automattic's ongoing litigation with WordPress' hosting company, WP Engine, which Automattic has called a “threat” to the WordPress community and a “cancer to WordPress.”

No one knows what to believe, and none of these backchannel theories line up with the officially stated reason. 

Automattic was asked for additional comment. 

Since 2024, Automattic has been engaged in a legal dispute that has to do with how little, in Mullenweg's opinion, WP Engine contributes to the WordPress project, despite its size and revenue. 

He sees the hosting company as profiting off the open source work WordPress is doing without giving back. Mullenweg also alleges that WP Engine benefits from the confusion between WordPress and commercial services like WP Engine. This led him to ban the company from accessing WordPress.org and sue in court for unauthorized trademark usage.

Simply put, Mullenweg thinks WP Engine should either pay a direct licensing fee or up its contributions to the open source WordPress project, or shouldn't be allowed to use its trademark.

WP Engine responded that it doesn't think it needs a license and that Automattic misunderstands trademark law, suing Automattic in return. 

Last month, Automattic laid off 16% of staff, saying the restructuring was necessary to be more agile and improve its productivity and profitability.

Summer is the best time to start hosting parties, and if you're planning on doing just that this year, you're going to want to make sure you have everything you need to throw some ragers. What's the most important thing you need for a great party in addition to the “vibe”? Oh, nothing. Just some amazing music and a way to share it. Case in point? A party speaker that's up to the task that won't force you to spend all of your savings. Sound like a plan Head to Amazon to get the JBL PartyBox for $250, down from its usual price of $350. That's $100 off and a discount of 29%.

See at Amazon

The JBL PartyBox is everything you need to get people moving and the party jumping. And it's powerful enough to fill your space with 100 watts of signature JBL sound. It's also compact enough to carry over your shoulder. It even comes with a padded strap so you can sling it across your back like a messenger bag. That makes it convenient for beach trips, park hangs, or just moving from room to room too. It also includes a built-in bottle opener, which sounds like a gimmick until you actually need one mid-party and realize how smart that feature is. Because someone's going to have to bring a drink with a lid that doesn't twist off, and that's gonna harsh your vibe.

This is more than just a speaker. It's also a light show in a box, which you'll soon find out when you start using it in earnest. Whether it's a quiet night with friends or a full-on celebration, it's a small touch that makes a big visual impact. And if you're the karaoke type or know someone who is, you'll love the wireless microphone that comes included. Tweak the bass, treble, and even echo effects, which makes this speaker double as your own personal DJ booth or karaoke machine.

It's also made to handle real life. With IPX4 splash resistance, it can stand up to light rain, poolside splashes, or accidental drink spills. The 6-hour battery life keeps things going long enough for most parties, and if you've got another compatible JBL speaker, you can pair them together for an even bigger sound experience.

All this for under $300? You'll want to get yours as soon as possible before the heat wave and the summer parties begin.

They even work on the Raspberry Pi


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Linux runs on hardware as diverse as the Raspberry Pi and powerful supercomputers, making it a flexible choice of operating system. Linux can be used via a graphical user interface similar to Windows or macOS. Or it can be used via a powerful terminal / command line.

The command line interface provides you with a lot more control over the computer than you can get using the GUI. Many important tasks are easier, quicker or only possible via commands. That's why, below we've listed the most important commands for navigating the file system, installing software, editing files and monitoring performance.



To open a terminal from the desktop, you can either click on the Terminal icon found in the applications menu or hit CTRL+ ALT + T. Once open, you will see a black screen appear with a flashing prompt.

This prompt is telling us that we are logged in as a user called ""les"" and that our machine is called ThinkpadX390 (this is the hostname). The $ refers to our permissions, in this case that we are logged on as a user with no special privileges, and that we have permission to edit any file or folder in our home directory, which in this case is /home/les/.

In our home directory we can store our work, projects, pictures etc. But we cannot harm the underlying filesystem as we do not have permission to do so. To make system wide changes we either need to be a user called “root” which has similar powers to the administrator on Windows, or we need to use sudo (see below) to temporarily give us extra permissions.

So let's start our adventure by testing out a few Linux commands and learn how to use the terminal

Many forms of Linux do not, by default or design, give you the admin privileges you need to perform some core tasks like installing software. This is done to make sure that the operating system is protected. However, by prefacing any command with the word ""sudo,"" you can have admin rights for that execution. To use ""sudo,"" you will have to be in the ""sudoers"" permission group, but the good news is that many Linux distros already put the main user in this group.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

We can check if our user is in the sudoers group by running this command. Just swap for your username



This shows that my user, les, is in the sudoers group.

To use sudo to upgrade your operating system, you'd type:



Moving around the filesystem is something we take for granted in a desktop environment. But with the terminal we can do everything, and often with greater speed and precision. We just need to know the correct commands. If you don't have permission to perform any of these actions on a particular file or directory, prefacing the command with sudo will probably let you, but think before doing so. There is no undo button.

We've got a full guide on the Linux file system, showing you what each directory is for.

This command will show the full path to the directory we are in, for example /home/les. It is a useful command to clearly show where we are in the filesystem. Typically our location forms part of the prompt, but with pwd we get a clearer indication of our location.



This command is used to list the contents of a directory. You may already be familiar with dir used in Windows and MS DOS.

You can use the command to list files in your current working directory.



We can also list the files in another directory, such as /var/log:



See hidden files and directories, in a long list with extra details.



List all files of a certain type, for example .py Python files.



Using cd, change directory we can move around the filesystem. For example to move from our home directory to Downloads



Move to a directory in another part of the filesystem, for example /var/log.



Go back to the previous directory that we were in.



Go back to our home directory.



Sometimes we need to take a peek inside a file, look for a specific command, error or bug and with these commands we can do just that all from the terminal.

With cat we can print the contents of a file to the terminal, for example a Python file.



Print contents of the file to the terminal with line numbers. Useful when debugging a file, and you need to tell a colleague exactly where to find the issue.



The less command will print the contents of a file in sections and we can scroll through the file using the arrow keys, Page Up / Down and Home / End.



To search inside a file for a specific word / section of text. Typically used with log files when looking for issues. In this example we use lscpu to print the details of the CPU which is passed via a pipe | to grep which we instruct to look for “MHz”.



For when you quickly need to edit a config file, Python code or just write a to do list. Yes, there are many different text editors for the terminal, nano, Vi, Vim etc. But for this how to, we will stick with nano.

Nano is the easiest command-line editor for beginners.

Create a new file, for example newfile.txt.

If the file doesn't exist, the command will create it. If it exists, it will open the file.



Edit an existing file, for example test.py.



Inside nano we navigate using the arrow keys and it works just like a regular text editor.

To save your work press CTRL + O, then confirm the filename. Finally, press Enter

To exit nano, press CTRL + X.

Managing our operating system and checking system resources is standard practice for system administrators. Here we show a few commands that will show you key details at a glance.

Shows the current CPU load, RAM usage and running system processes. Useful for closing non responsive applications and seeing which processes are bottlenecking your system.



Free will tell us how much RAM is in use, and what is free for applications. Using the -m option we can set the values in Megabytes. By default, free will show the values in KB.



The kernel is the core of the operating system and with dmesg we can see what events are happening behind the scenes. Useful for debugging issues with devices. You will need to run the command using sudo, otherwise you will not have access to all of the data.



Moving, deleting, copying and creating new files and directories are some of the most basic actions that we need to do. All of this, and much more is possible via the terminal.

This command offers two functions. We can move a file from one location to another. For example here we move test.py to the Documents directory.



The command can also be used to rename a file or directory. Here we rename test.py to test2.py.



With this command we can delete files and directories. In this example we delete the file test.py.



To copy a file, for example test.py to our Documents directory.



To copy a directory, for example /home/pi/test2 to /home/pi/Documents/  we need to use the -r option to copy everything across.



Create a new directory to store work. For example let's create a directory called Work in our home directory.



Just like any computer we need to make sure that our software is up to date and on our Linux machine the tool to do just that is called apt.

Apt, the Advanced Packaging Tool. The app store of Debian and Ubuntu flavors of Linux. To use apt we will need to use sudo as it will make changes to the operating system.

First we update the list of installable software.



Then we can install a specific application, for example to install vlc.



Or we can upgrade all of the software on our system. Note that for this command we pass the -y option to automatically agree to install every package. But this is optional and if you prefer, you can omit the -y and be prompted for confirmation.



Checking that your Linux machine is connected to the Internet is a basic yet crucial task. It enables us to debug our servers, watch YouTube videos, and get work done.

The ping command is used to test that our Linux machine is connected to the Internet / home network.

We can send a ping to a website.



Or to an IP address such as Google's DNS server.



Or for internal connectivity checks we can send a ping to devices on our home network. This example assumes that our IP range is 192.168.1.114 but your range may be different.

The easiest way to find the IP address of our Linux machine is using hostname with the -I (uppercase i) which will show all IP addresses (Wi-Fi and Ethernet)



With this command we can transfer a file to and from our Linux machine. For example if we wanted to download an image from a website we would use curl along with the -o option to create a file named image.jpg.

Note, curl may not be installed on your system, so you may need to install using sudo apt install curl



The curl command is particularly useful for downloading installation scripts to automatically install add on boards. But it should be used with caution and any code reviewed before it is used.

The Linux terminal has many secrets and tricks, all designed to save you time and become a keyboard ninja.

The history command will display the history of the commands entered in the terminal. When used it will output all of the commands at once as a long list.



At the start of each line in the list is a number and we can use this number to run that command once again. But we must precede the number with an exclamation mark.

By using a pipe “|” with the history command we can send the output of history to grep where we can then search for specific commands. Here we look for all the occurences of “apt” in history.



Using this we can interactively search through our command history for a specific command. To start we press CTRL + R together and then start typing part of the command. For example we have just used the history | grep “apt” command so we can now press CTRL + R and start typing history and the search will find that command.

Think of this as “auto complete” for the terminal. The TAB key is located just above the Caps Lock key and we can use TAB completion to help complete long commands, directory listings. If we type in the first few letters of a command, for example his and press TAB it will complete the command to show history.

But if we wanted to complete a long directory path, for example /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages then we could start typing /usr/lib/ and then press TAB to show us all the directories available along that path. We could then start typing python3 and by pressing TAB a few more times, the command will narrow down the options that we can use. 

Another way to search through your history is to use the up and down arrow keys. With these keys we can go backwards and forwards through our command history and when the correct command is displayed, press Enter to run.

Using this command we can create shortcuts / short commands from much longer ones. For example here we create an alias called updater and use that to call two commands. The first will update our list of installable software, and if that works successfully, denoted by using “&&” to chain the commands together, then it will run the upgrade on our Linux machine.



Now we can run our update command just by typing updater in the terminal. Note that once the Linux machine is switched off, this alias is deleted.

 May 30, 2025  

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to a fourfold increased risk for early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), results from the largest, population-based cohort study of its kind to date showed.

The findings indicated “that there can be shared biological drivers behind ASD and Parkinson's disease,” study investigator, Weiyao Yin, MD, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, said in a release.

“One hypothesis is that the brain's dopamine system is affected in both cases, since the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important part in social behavior and motion control,” Yin added.

The study was published online on May 27 in JAMA Neurology.

Recent research pointed to a plausible biological link between ASD and PD. However, large, longitudinal studies investigating the risk for PD following an ASD diagnosis are scarce, the researchers noted.

“Our study is the first population-based study, to our knowledge, using prospectively collected data, longitudinal design, and life-course approach to strengthen the inference,” they wrote.

To investigate they used national registry data from more than 2 million individuals born in Sweden between 1974 and 1999 and followed them from age 20 years up to the end of 2022. The median age at study exit was 34 years.

Within this cohort, they identified 51,954 individuals with ASD and 2,226,611 individuals without the disorder.

PD, defined as a first-ever diagnosis of PD or other idiopathic or degenerative parkinsonian disorders, was identified in 438 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years) and in 24 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 cases per 100,000 person-years), corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 4.43.

Depression and antidepressant use were present in 46.7% of individuals with ASD, and antipsychotic use, which can cause Parkinson-like symptoms, was present in 31.5%.

Adjusting for depression and antipsychotic use reduced but did not eliminate the association between ASD and PD risk (RR, 3.10 and RR, 2.00, respectively).

Independent of ASD diagnosis, a history of depression and exposure to antipsychotics were linked to a significantly higher risk for PD (RR, 2.01 and RR, 6.34, respectively).

Preterm or early-term birth is a known risk factor for ASD, prompting an examination of its potential association with PD. However, no increased risk for PD was found compared with individuals born at full term.

After adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, and parental mental illness or PD, the investigators found ASD remained consistently associated with an increased risk for PD.

There are potential biological explanations for the link, Yin told Medscape Medical News.

“One hypothesis suggests that the brain's dopamine system is impacted in both conditions, as the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a crucial role in social behavior and motor control,” Yin said.

There may be a genetic correlation between the two conditions, she added noting that the PARK2 gene may be associated between ASD and early-onset PD.

“ASD is a lifelong condition, and more children with autism now progress into middle and older adulthood. Healthcare services need to provide long-term monitoring for individuals with ASD — a vulnerable group with high comorbidity and a high use of psychotropic medications,” Yin said.

The study is clinically relevant “mainly because it shows that neurodevelopmental conditions, like ASD, may be associated with clinical signs and diagnoses that may manifest at different ages, and we as clinicians should be aware of that,” Christos Ganos, MD, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who was not involved with the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“Although neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed early in life, there is a need to assess for neurological symptoms and signs also later in life, including to monitor the effects of prescribed medications on neuromotor control,” added Ganos, who is the wolf chair in neurodevelopmental psychiatry, and associate professor of neurology at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

However, he urged caution in linking the specific diagnoses of ASD and PD, as there is a more general link between neurodevelopmental disorders and motor dysfunction.

“Neurodevelopmental disorders are very heterogeneous, and the ‘ASD' diagnosis encompasses a lot of different disorders and etiologies. Some of these diagnoses/conditions are linked to motor syndromes that are specifically associated with motor slowing but are not PD, although they could resemble some of its features,” he explained.

Strengths of the study include its large sample size and statistical power to provide estimates “with more meaningful precision than prior studies,” said Connie Marras, MD, PhD, a movement disorders specialist, and professor of neurology at the University of Toronto.

However, she noted that investigators did not include smoking in the models, which “may result in an overestimation of the association between ASD and PD,” she added. “Smoking is less common among individuals with ASD and may constitute a confounder. Smoking is also less common in individuals with Parkinson's disease and is considered a protective factor against PD.”

She also questioned whether the results really have clinical implications for monitoring the emergence of parkinsonism in this population.

“Early detection does not have treatment implications currently, particularly since at present we don't have therapies for PD prevention or slowing of progression. Once we do have such treatments, then monitoring would be justified,” she said.

However, the finding “could have significant clinical and policy-related implications as these individuals age,” Gregory Wallace, PhD, an autism expert and associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences at The George Washington University, Washington, DC, who was not part of the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“Given increased rates of autism diagnoses in younger cohorts, if autistic people are at increased risk for developing parkinsonism as they age, the healthcare system and clinicians who provide care for autistic adults need to be prepared,” said Wallace.

Wallace recently published research showing that co-occurring parkinsonism in adults with autism is linked with lower subjective quality of life, more memory problems, lower sleep quality, and greater depression symptoms.

This study was supported by grants from the Simons Foundation, Swedish Research Council, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation, and the Beatrice and Samuel A. Seaver Foundation. Yin reported no disclosures. Coauthors' disclosures included receiving grants from Janssen, MSD, and Takeda outside the submitted work (Ludvigsson), and personal fees for consulting from Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic outside the submitted work (Figee). Ganos, Marras, and Wallace reported no disclosures.

 May 30, 2025  

About 36% of older veterans who recently used cannabis screened positive for cannabis use disorder (CUD), with a higher risk observed among younger respondents, individuals with anxiety, and frequent users, a new analysis showed. Investigators said the findings suggest asking about cannabis use during all routine health exams could help identify patients for treatment.

“Older veterans may be at risk for THC intoxication. Prevention of problematic cannabis use and CUD is also crucial in older veterans due to the elevated risk of suicide ideation and exacerbation of mental health concerns experienced by aging populations. Routine health screening for cannabis use in Veterans Health Administration clinical settings is necessary to identify older adults with cannabis use,” the investigators wrote.

The study was led by Vira Pravosud, PhD, MPH, MS, Center for Data to Discovery and Delivery Innovation, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco. It was published online on May 14 in JAMA Network Open.

The study was limited by its cross-sectional design, low generalizability, reliance on self-reported data, and potential recall and social desirability bias.

The study received support from National Institutes of Health and Tobacco Related Disease Research Program.

 May 30, 2025  

The government has allocated £750 million to the NHS in England for tackling long-term maintenance problems. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the money could be used by hospitals, mental health units, and ambulance services to mend leaky pipes, improve ventilation, and solve electrical issues. 

The investment aims to prevent operations and appointments being cancelled because of crumbling infrastructure. However, healthcare leaders said the cash injection is a “drop in the ocean” and just a fraction of the estimated £14 billion maintenance backlog across the health service estate.

More than £100 million will be put aside for maternity units to replace outdated ventilation systems in neonatal intensive care units and create better environmental conditions for vulnerable babies and their families.

Hospital services were disrupted more than 4000 times in 2023-2024 due to poor quality buildings, according to England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting. 

Streeting highlighted the severity of the problem, noting that burst pipes had flooded emergency departments, faulty electrical systems had shut down operating theatres, and mothers had been forced to give birth in substandard facilities.

A recent UNISON survey revealed NHS hospitals were plagued by rats, cockroaches, and sewage leaks. The survey also flagged problems with leaky roofs and out-of-order toilets.

Simon Corben, director for NHS estates and facilities at NHS England, said repairs were overdue. “Fixing the backlog of maintenance at NHS hospitals will help prevent cancellations,” he stated.

Earlier this month, the DHSC pledged £102 million this financial year for GP surgeries to upgrade outdated premises. It followed an independent report by Lord Ara Darzi last year which concluded that outdated, inefficient buildings were unfit for purpose, created barriers to delivering high-quality patient care, and reduced productivity.

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, welcomed the latest announcement, particularly noting support for the “often overlooked” mental health and ambulance sectors.

However, he pointed out that “an eye-watering near £14 billion is needed just to patch up buildings and equipment,” with mental health services alone facing a maintenance backlog exceeding £1 billion.

Tim Mitchell, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said NHS facilities had fallen into a “dire state of disrepair” that was hampering efforts to reduce waiting lists. 

""With the NHS maintenance backlog currently standing at £13.8 billion, this really is just a drop in the ocean,"" he said.

Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, described the spending boost as a “small down payment” on the maintenance backlog. “At £750 million a year, it would take almost 20 years to clear the backlog, assuming it does not continue to grow,” he warned.

Healthcare leaders called for new investment models, including private sector involvement, to address the funding shortfall more rapidly.

Projects are due to be delivered during the 2025-2026 financial year, with the first upgrades expected to begin this summer, the DHSC said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Emma Hayes reaction to key women's soccer appointments speaks volumes","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/emma-hayes-uswnt-soccer-appointments-1180787","Fri, 30 May 2025 17:59:00 GMT","

Since taking over as head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team, Emma Hayes has placed a high priority on reshaping women's soccer through a female lens. And two new appointments have her particularly excited.

What's more, the Chelsea legend has repeatedly emphasized the importance of creating a clearer and more effective pathway for talented young players to progress through the youth teams and work their way towards the senior team in such a way that allows them to develop and grow at their own pace.

If effective, this would help bridge the gap between the experienced veterans available for selection and the next generation, something that Hayes has been dealing with since her arrival.

All of these fundamental changes have required the arrivals of new faces behind the scenes to help reshape the program and the direction of the USWNT and the Youth National Team, such as the return of the Under-23s program, now led by head coach Heather Dyche.

Reflecting on her first year in charge, ahead of the USWNT's upcoming friendlies against China and Jamaica, Hayes elaborated on her excitement about the direction the program as a whole is heading in.

“I'm so blessed that the, not just that the leadership, but the people we are putting into positions across WNT and YNT have made me more excited for a long time, because we're bringing so many different innovations into the women's game and the girls' game,” she explained. “Anything from mental skill development to female health, menstrual cycle support, whatever it might be, I'm so, so excited about it.”

But while Hayes is excited about the steps that have already been taken, there is still plenty of work to be done - work which she believes could have a positive impact on generations of players down the line.

“I think the WNT strategy in and around how we're positioning things through the female lens,” she said. “And there's a huge amount of work that's going on in the background, developing insights that for years to come, I hope will influence everything from coach education to ensuring we've got female health insights in each and every one of our camps and longer term across the whole ecosystem.

“I can't believe I've only been here a year, to be honest with you. When I reflect on the work that's being done by so many people, it's so exciting to think, if I'm to fast forward to 2031 (when the FIFA Women's World Cup will be held in the U.S.), the work and the impact that everybody's having now for the future of the game, I think will leave the ecosystem, not in a healthy way.

“America's always produced players, but I think what we are putting together is a system so that it goes beyond just a pipeline of players, that it's a support system around girls and women that I think will take our game up a notch.”

Taking the women's game “up a notch” is no mean feat, given the USWNT's remarkable success over the past few decades, including four World Cup wins, five Olympic gold medals (one under Hayes), and nine CONCACAF W Championships, among numerous other accolades.

That being said, Hayes' arrival followed a relatively rough patch for the USWNT, which failed to get past the Round of 16 at the 2023 World Cup and, prior to her arrival, hadn't won an Olympic gold since 2012.

The Briton's monumental aspirations to reshape and remold how women's soccer is run in the U.S., from the ground level all the way to the top, will inevitably take years to kick into effect before the rewards can be reaped. However, given her incredible level of success during her 12-year tenure at Chelsea, where she turned the London side into a dominant force in the WSL, it would be unwise to doubt her vision.

Gotham FC's Jaelin Howell talks about the impact of playing alongside USWNT veteran Emily Sonnett. (1:08)

United States women's national team head coach Emma Hayes sung the praises of 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes again on Friday, saying Yohannes has a bright future with the program.

Hayes also reiterated the need for patience from the public, however, citing Yohannes' youth and relative inexperience.

""She's got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,"" Hayes told reporters. ""But I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that considering her tender age and her lack of international and high-level experience.""

Yohannes rejoined the USWNT this week for upcoming games against China and Jamaica. Saturday's game against China will be played at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minnesota -- the site of Yohannes' first cap and first goal nearly a year ago to the day.

""It's crazy to be back here,"" Yohannes said in a video released by U.S. Soccer. ""That was such a special moment for me, so to be back here is kind of full circle.""

Yohannes has six caps after formally deciding to represent the USWNT last fall.

The Netherlands, where the Virginia-born midfielder and her family have been based since she was 10 years old, recruited Yohannes to play for the program but Yohannes ultimately chose her native country.

Yohannes currently plays for the storied Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam. She signed a professional contract with the club at 15 years old. In 2023, as a 16-year-old, she became the youngest player to ever start a UEFA Women's Champions League match in Ajax's historic group-stage win over Paris Saint-Germain.

Sources told ESPN's Emily Keogh earlier this month that English champions Chelsea -- Hayes' former club -- are interested in signing Yohannes via transfer this summer.

""As I keep saying to everyone, she's 17,"" Hayes said. ""She's got a couple of years of experience as a professional. I think the next two years of development will be important for her.

""I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax. That, for me, I think, has advanced her positional play in a way that I think makes her stand out beyond her years.

""She's physically developed in the last 12 months. Tactically in possession, when she plays for her club team, they generally have the ball against sort of mid-to-low blocks. So, I think she's developed that side of her play.""

Yohannes narrowly missed out on making the USWNT's Olympic roster last year. At the time, she had not yet decided whether to represent the U.S. or the Netherlands.

The U.S. went on to earn a fifth Olympic gold medal, a world record. The Netherlands did not qualify for the tournament.

Yohannes recently starred for the USWNT in a 2-0 win over Brazil in April in a 2024 Olympic gold-medal game rematch, coming off the bench in the second half and earning a penalty kick a few minutes later. She started the following match against Brazil, a 2-1 loss a few days later.

Yohannes also started as a box-to-box midfielder for the USWNT in a 2-1 February loss to fellow world power Japan. She helped set up the lone U.S. goal that day.

And she provided a secondary assist earlier in the SheBelieves Cup in a 2-0 win over Colombia by providing a line-cutting through ball to teammate Yazmeen Ryan.

Hayes tried to temper immediate expectations after those results. She did so again on Friday.

""I think for us, playing against opponents like Brazil and Japan, were extremely high-level games that will serve her well in the future,"" Hayes said.

""But as I always keep saying, she's got a lot of development to do, and I think it will be up and down. And I think that we'll see really good moments from I think we'll see indifferent moments. I think it's what you can expect from a 17-year-old.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

COMMERCE CITY, Colo – Colorado Rapids forward Bryce Jamison has been called up to the U.S. U-19 Men's National Team for an upcoming training camp and a pair of international friendlies in Albir, Spain, from June 2–11, 2025, U.S. Soccer announced today.

The U.S. will take on host nation Spain on June 7, followed by a second match on June 10 against an opponent to be announced. The squad will be led by U-19 MYNT Head Coach Rob Valentino.

Jamison, 19, signed with the Rapids on April 4, 2025, to a three-year contract through 2027 with club options for 2028 and 2029. Currently, Jamison is on loan to USL Championship club Orange County SC, where he has made 77 professional appearances since 2022, tallying eight goals and six assists.

A native of Atlanta, Georgia, Jamison rose through the youth ranks at the Barcelona Residency Academy in Arizona. He helped lead the academy's U-19 team to an MLS NEXT Southwest Division title and was named to the inaugural MLS NEXT All-Star Team in 2022.

On the international stage, Jamison made his U.S. Youth National Team debut in 2023 and represented the United States at the FIFA U-17 World Cup later that year, appearing in all four of the team's matches, including a Round of 16 clash against Germany.","{'href': 'https://www.coloradorapids.com', 'title': 'Colorado Rapids'}","soccer"

With an important summer of soccer approaching, the USMNT needs to uplift the vibes.

The United States Men's National Team will be back on the field next week when they take on Türkiye and Switzerland in friendlies to prepare for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. The continental tournament is usually a chance for the USMNT to once again compete for a title and try to solidify their position as the best team in the region. However, with the Gold Cup serving as the final competitive matches the USMNT will see before they co-host next summer's World Cup, the Gold Cup has taken on even more importance.

The team gets even more scrutiny when you consider the fact that the most recent competitions that the USMNT have participated in have had some disastrous results. Since the 2022 World Cup ended, the team has participated in five tournaments. They won the 2023 and 2024 Concacaf Nations League Finals, but betweeen those titles, they lost in the 2023 Gold Cup semifinals via penalties to Panama. Then came the 2024 Copa América, where the USMNT failed to make it out of the group. Losses to Panama and Uruguay offset their opening match win against Bolivia. The inability to get to the knockout stage led to U.S. Soccer dismissing then-head coach Gregg Berhalter.

The federation installed Mauricio Pochettino as coach, and the hope was that he would be able to turn the program around and get them back to the place they need to be ahead of the World Cup. However in March, the team lost to Panama and Canada at the Concacaf Nations League Finals to finish 4th out of 4 teams. It was the first time they had ever lost at the Nations League Finals in the history of the tournament, and the team didn't look great in the process.

This summer, the USMNT must focus on getting their mojo back. They need it as they continue to get ready to host the world in 13 months. Here's how they can start the process of re-discovering that mojo over the next month:

The players that are in camp for the friendlies and the Gold Cup have to play with a sense of urgency and rediscover the tenacity that has been the calling card of the men's national team program for 30 years. Who wants to be here for the World Cup? It's earned through their performance on the field now, and they need to approach this next month of matches with the drive to make a statement. That statement should be to the world and it should be to everyone else: we're back, and we're not backing down. There's been a lot of talk that the players need to fight for the crest. The more important thing is that they recognize the sacrifice for the privilege of being a USMNT player is great. And they should use this opportunity to merge their hearts and the crest together so they can fight for both.

Sure, many fans ultimately measure growth and progress by looking at the win column. Winning does help present the case that the program has improved. However, the goal i to show that the team is getting better and they're using the time afforded them with these friendlies and the Gold Cup to accelerate the development they need to be a contender next summer. As they prepare to co-host arguably the biggest sporting event ever, give fans hope that the USMNT has learned from those past failures. Don't take the opportunity for granted, because once it's gone, the players will wish they had one more.

Part of the urgency that the USMNT needs to show is how they approach each opponent that they play. They need to show that they can get it done against the best in the world during a World Cup. That means treating every match like it's a World Cup knockout match, no matter the opponent. That first match against Türkiye next weekend in Hartford is important. So is the match against Switzerland on June 10th in Nashville, a team that has made it to the knockout stage in 4 of the last 5 World Cups. But, that urgency has to continue in the Gold Cup group stage against Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti. And should they proceed to the knockout stage, the level should only continue to increase. 

There shouldn't be a concern that because the USMNT is playing a team that's considered a lesser opponent that the squad will play down to that level. The level should consistently be high and the maximum effort should be sought. Effort can fit into a suitcase, it can fit in any home or visitor locker room, and it is essential if you want to defend home turf this summer or take on the world in 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","A closer look at the players seeking June USMNT debuts","https://sbisoccer.com/2025/05/a-closer-look-at-the-players-seeking-june-usmnt-debuts","Fri, 30 May 2025 17:23:38 GMT","



The CONCACAF Gold Cup has previously provided the opportunity for players to make their international debuts and this time around is no exception.

Quinn Sullivan and Damion Downs headline a total of six players will be seeking to earn their senior U.S. men's national team debuts this June. Alex Freeman, Chris Brady, Matt Freese, and Sebastian Berhalter will also be fighting to feature in home friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland before Gold Cup play begins.

With head coach Mauricio Pochettino previously voicing his support for new faces in the squad, all six of these players could feature by June's end.

Here is a closer look at all six players seeking their USMNT debuts this June:

One of several rising talents to come out of the Philadelphia Union academy, Quinn Sullivan finally has his USMNT opportunity this June.

Sullivan, 21, entered 2025 coming off his best club season yet and has build off of that production this year. He has contributed two goals and seven assists in 15 starts for the Union, helping Bradley Carnell's squad to a strong first half of the season.

Sullivan's versatility could see him used as a  midfielder, winger, or lead forward in Pochettino's set up.

Damion Downs could become the latest dual-national to choose the USMNT over a European powerhouse.

The 20-year-old forward recently helped Cologne FC earn promotion back to the Bundesliga, scoring 11 goals during the 2. Bundesliga campaign. Also eligible for the German national team, Pochettino's plans to get Downs involved early might pay off big time.

Downs will fight with Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, Brian White, and Patrick Agyemang for minutes in June, bringing a youthful energy to the mix.

Right back remains a position in question for the USMNT and Alex Freeman has quickly tossed his name into the mix.

The son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio, Alex has relished in his first season as a starter for Orlando City. Freeman has scored three goals and added one assist in 16 appearances.

After playing heavily for Orlando City B over the last two MLS NEXT Pro campaigns, Freeman has made the most of Oscar Pareja's early trust in him with the first team.

24-year-old Sebastian Berhalter has played a key role in the Vancouver Whitecaps' early-season success in 2025, leading to his recent call up to the USMNT.

Berhalter has tallied one goal and four assists in 15 MLS appearances this season, logging just over 1,000 minutes of playing time. A versatile midfielder, Berhalter is the son of former USMNT head coach and player, Gregg.

He has been knocking on the door for his debut and June could finally be the time for it.

Chris Brady is one of the more experienced 21-year-old's in MLS.

Brady has remained the Chicago Fire's starting goalkeeper for the third-straight season, registering two clean sheets in 13 appearances. A former USYNT standout, Brady replaced the injured Patrick Schulte on the roster, joining Matt Turner, Matt Freese, and Zack Steffen in the goalkeeping corps.

Brady has stood on his head for Chicago in 2025 and now has a strong chance to feature for the USMNT.

Moving to New York City FC might have been the best move for Matt Freese.

Freese has remained NYCFC's No. 1 goalkeeper for the second-straight season, logging six clean sheets in 2025. The former Philadelphia Union homegrown mainly sat behind Andre Blake as a youngster, but now has become one of the more consistent shot-stoppers in MLS.

Freese will challenge for minutes this June, especially with the USMNT's No. 1 job still undetermined. 

Turkey squad is strong man this will be a fun test.

Jake Payne from 50 Plus Döner joins the USA Soccercast to discuss the German-American who's getting a terrific shot with the USMNT.

The United States Men's National Team is headed to camp next week and among the newcomers is 1.FC Köln striker Damion Downs. We're joined by Jake Payne of 50 Plus Döner as we do a deep dive on the young German-American and what he brings to the table.

Jake does content that focuses on Köln and German soccer as a whole, and he gives us some incredible insight on Downs and what he's done well at the club level. He also discusses what Downs will have to improve as he prepares for his time with the USMNT and helping Köln as they return to the Bundesliga next season. It's a great interview that also expands to why German soccer is normally so beneficial for American players to develop and how the wave can shift back to players thriving in the Bundesliga.

The interview is part of Episode 155 of the USA Soccercast. Here's an excerpt from the interview with Jake Payne as we discuss Damion Downs and his elevation to the USMNT.

USA Soccercast: I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who have not seen Damion Downs play at all so just in a nutshell, can you describe his overall game?

50 Plus Döner: Oh, he is the quintessential striker. He's everything you want in the striker...he's super tall for soccer, he's 6'4”. He's not fast, but his positioning is insane. Like, if you go and watch some of the goals that he scored, he's not particularly outpacing anyone but he's just in [the right spot]. There's a song called “He's always where he needs to be,” and that is his game. He's there when the ball gets to him, he's gonna do the right thing, he's so fun to watch, and I'm so glad. I feel like that's what the U.S. needs...I feel like you guys have been looking for that for a while, just a striker that's there to set people up but mostly score goals. 

USAS: At 6'4, Downs is going to tower over everybody. Because of that, there's the obvious question: is he an aerial threat that can kind of serve as that target forward, or is he going to be more of a guy that's a poacher who uses his feet? 

50: Yeah, so I don't think he has a lot of header goals, but that's not due to lack of trying. I just think Köln isn't really a crossing team per se, but [Downs] is an aerial threat. He does have very good header goals and a few goals where he muscles someone off. He's really good with his feet when he does get the ball. I do think sometimes, just with him being younger and him starting to get his opportunity now, that he sometimes makes a bad shot when he's open, but that's not due to lack of ability. I just think he's now getting his shot. So he's got some learning to do, but now he has a chance to do it on national team level. And I think he's definitely ready for it for sure. 

USAS: [Downs] grew up in the American system of sports and mainly [played] American football before he started playing soccer when he moved back to Germany, which is unlike some of the other dual nationals that we see. A lot of them learned soccer first and then maybe applied to other sports. How does that affect his game or does it affect his game? Do we see a little bit of American football in his game as he has been developing? 

50: Yeah, what is it? What if our best athletes played soccer and now we're finally seeing it? I think just in playing football myself is like I think what I see in him is just like that positional understanding. Like with football, I feel like you have to know where everybody is at all times, even if it's across the field. And when you look at the way that he understands space and how people move to react to space, like he knows, “Okay, I'm tall...so someone's going to play me a little bit closer. I'm going to kind of like back off a little bit and give me some more space to work with.” He's obviously very physical too, even though I think he hasn't gotten that chance to be physical a lot. But with the American football mindset, I wouldn't be able to point out like, “Oh, that's a football player.”But I think when you're a multi-sport athlete like that, positioning and understanding physicality...that's definitely present in his game. 

USAS: [Damion Downs] had his breakout year this year in the 2. Bundesliga, so what made him so successful this year? Was there something about his game that elevates to where he was able to find success?

So I will have to point out his first ever goal for the team was against Köln's biggest rival. So that sticks out a bunch. And like in the Bundesliga season, he kind of got his opportunity at the end of the season and he scored some very key goals. So I think like already the thought going into this last season was like, “Okay, we got to get we got to let him cook a little bit.” They weren't really sure [about Downs]. They were getting production from this striker and then they kind of fell down Damian Downs got a hand injury, which kind of stopped his momentum of starting and whatnot. [At] the end of the season, he was on the bench because he was coming back from that [injury]. But now that there is that open hole, I do think he's going to get more of a chance and like he had 10 goals and I think four assists on the season. So the times that he did get in, he did make that opportunity. And even though he's on the slower side, as I said, his positioning is just phenomenal. So we really got to see that. You would be like, “where is he on the field?” And then all of a sudden, he's in the box with the ball.

England have confirmed that Manchester City's James McAtee will join up with Lee Carsley's Under-21 squad this weekend ahead of the EUROs this summer.

The announcement from the national side comes after a period of uncertainty and talks between all parties as to which direction would be most suitable for McAtee this summer, given a clash of competitions for the player.

While Manchester City will be jetting off for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, McAtee and his teammates within England's Under-21 set-up will have a European Championship tournament ongoing at the same time.

     

As such, all relevant parties have held discussions which have seemingly led to the highly-rated attacking midfielder being released to represent his country for a crucial summer both personally and collectively.

A statement from England confirmed on Friday afternoon, “James McAtee has been added to England MU21s' pre-EURO training squad.

“The Manchester City player, with 18 caps and seven goals to his name for the age group, will link up with Lee Carsley's extended group at St. George's Park this weekend.”

The pre-EURO training squad will precede a finalised list to be decided and announced by manager Carsley ahead of next month's UEFA U21 EURO in Slovakia on Friday 6 June, England have also reaffirmed.

The decision taken and approved by Manchester City will also raise further doubts over James McAtee‘s future at the Etihad Stadium, with transfer interest in the Salford-born playmaker growing throughout the game.

Among the clubs to have taken a keen interest in his performances and continuing to monitor his situation leading up to the summer transfer window are German giants Bayer Leverkusen, as well as numerous sides in the Premier League.

Recent reports have pointed towards Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur as potential candidates for his signature, while the former may prove to be an interesting proposition given City's interest in Morgan Gibbs-White.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

GOAL goes over everything fans need to know about the unique transfer window opening from June 1-10 ahead of the Club World Cup

FIFA has opened a special transfer window from June 1-10, allowing teams to make roster additions ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. It's an unprecedented move to allow players to swap clubs this early in the offseason. Still, with the marquee event beginning in just over two weeks on June 14, they opted to open the window so teams could bolster their core ahead of the competition.

Likewise, U.S. Soccer has reportedly sanctioned a window to run during the same timeline, but has limited it to the MLS teams competing in the tournament - Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders, and potentially, LAFC. The Black and Gold face Liga MX side Club America Saturday evening in a Club World Cup playoff game, with the winner clinching a berth in the competition.

FIFA and U.S. Soccer have introduced new rules and amended existing ones ahead of this summer's competition, aimed at facilitating player movement. As a result, clubs participating in the tournament have additional flexibility in the transfer window - though some of the changes may not be widely known or understood by fans.

Some players have an opportunity to sign a short-term contract to compete, strictly in the competition, before entering free agency this summer. Others are completing pre-agreed transfers, while some are swapping new clubs entirely on multi-year deals. Then, there's a unique case like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Real Madrid, as Los Blancos have now paid the Reds $11.3 million(€10 million) to secure his services ahead of the competition despite his contract ending on June 30.

Manager Pep Guardiola said he would ""quit"" City if he wasn't given a smaller squad after he had to leave out several key players in the final games of the season.

Despite this, the Cityzens have been linked with the likes of Morgan Gibbs-White of Nottingham Forest, Tijjani Reijnders of AC Milan and Lyon's Rayan Cherki, which suggests that the club are preparing to offload a number of players in the coming months in what will be a significant squad overhaul.

City have qualified for next season's UEFA Champions League but failed to lift any silverware last season, unless you count the Community Shield, which Guardiola defended in one of his final press conferences.

Al Mubarak has spoken to the club website about the team's ambition heading into the transfer market and how they want to conduct their business early before the start of the Club World Cup so they may build a squad that can improve next season.

""I can tell you today, we have clearly identified who exactly are the targets, in what positions, and we have our clear number one option, our clear number two option,"" he explained.   

""And we'll go about our business, and it will be very clear, very swift. Our objective is to try to be ready with the new squad for the Club World Cup."" 

Al Mubarak says he can sense a hunger in the squad to once again fight for the Premier League title as well as another Champions League trophy after what has been a poor season by City's standards.

He sent a message to fans, stating that lessons will be learnt and that next season is a new beginning. 

""We will be back. This season is a season that's now behind us. Today is a new day. We start working and preparing for next season. 

""And by the way, we've been doing that since January. And we will take all the good things and the not so good things from this season and learn from it and improve from it and get better. 

""I can assure you, this club will do everything possible to come back to the standards that we know we all can achieve and that we know, we will achieve.""

International Football

FIFA is still “far away” from resolving the row with Europe's domestic leagues and global players' union FIFPro over the international match calendar, according to the Premier League's director of international football relations Mathieu Moreuil.

Last October, European Leagues, the body that represents leagues in 30 countries across the continent, teamed up with FIFPro to file a formal complaint against world football's governing body at the European Commission.

The dispute over who controls football's congested calendar has been simmering for years but FIFA's critics believe its decisions to expand the World Cup to 48 teams and create a new 32-team Club World Cup are an abuse of a dominant market position, which is contrary to European Union competition law.

At the heart of the dispute is the claim that FIFA has failed to consult the rest of the game on the impact of these changes, with the unions concerned about a spike in injuries and player-burnout, while the leagues are worried about the detrimental effect of too much football on their competitions.

Speaking to journalists in Munich on Thursday, Moreuil said European Leagues and FIFPro made their complaint because FIFA was not listening to them, something that has started to change.

“We've had meetings, at least, and FIFA is now engaging with us,” said Moreuil, who is also European Leagues' vice-president.

“Both organisations have had meetings with the FIFA president (Gianni Infantino), which is good, but we're still far away from an agreement, therefore we'll keep our legal action in the system.

“FIFA needs to have a discussion with all the stakeholders about a calendar that works. It's not going to be easy but that's what we do.

“When we look at (European football's governing body) UEFA, we can have a discussion on these issues. It's not perfect but at least the points we are making are taken into account. That's the relationship we want with FIFA and we're far from that at the moment. But hopefully things can improve.”

FIFA's international match calendar is an agreement with the game's six continental confederations, the European Club Association and FIFPro that sets out when international games can be played, including all the major tournaments.

The current calendar runs from this summer until the end of 2030 and, as FIFA insists that international football takes priority over domestic games, national competitions must fit into FIFA's schedule.

The revamped Club World Cup, which starts in Miami on June 14, does not have a ring-fenced space on the calendar but FIFA is still demanding that the 32 participating clubs field their strongest squads and has created a bespoke transfer window to allow them to bring in new players between 1-10 June.

And with the tournament not finishing until 13 July, teams that go deep in the tournament will only have five weeks off before their domestic seasons start again in mid-August.

Maheta Molango, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, was also in Munich ahead of Saturday's Champions League final and the English players' union boss told reporters that his members have been very clear about the consequences of fixture congestion.

“The players have spoken up,” he said. “(Manchester City's) Rodri, the Ballon d'Or, said it was too much, and many others. So now it's very tangible. It's not a theory.

“We are in situation where players are being put at risk of injury, physically and mentally.

“That's why we need to come together and work on solutions, otherwise people will get injured or they'll make choices to protect themselves. That's where it becomes a problem for the whole industry, because we want to see the best players on the pitch.”

Molango added that the players' unions are pushing for a mandatory two-week break for players in the off-season and a day off every week during the season.

FIFA has not responded to a request for comment.

The Club World Cup has already bent plenty of rules, and should disrupt once again to bring a brash legend to the U.S. this summer

One of the stranger moments in American soccer happened last week. You'll be forgiven if you weren't watching. But there was iShowSpeed, YouTuber, internet personality, Cristiano Ronaldo enthusiast, and, somehow, a representative of soccer in the United States, sitting at his desk, streaming to millions.

He was up to his usual act of screaming, talking, and just sort of saying words in various orders that supposedly mean something to the kids these days.

And then he was interrupted by a bald-headed man, slick polo, nice fitting pants, shoes brandless and suspiciously clean. It was a supposedly impromptu appearance, Gianni Infantino walking in on Speed, who willingly stopped his stream mid game, stood up in a choreographed manner, and watched as the FIFA president reached the exact right spot, so he could be seen by the masses.

The usual stuff followed: a cool bro hug, an exchange of gifts, an excited introduction from Speed, and, finally, the hundredth unveiling of the Club World Cup trophy (because, of course a random man can show up to someone's house unannounced with a massive block of gold hidden underneath black cloth.)

After that the two talked about the Club World Cup. They covered all of the bases: number of teams, big names, how much of a spectacle the United States will be in store for this summer. But somewhere in the jumble of it all, Infantino came up with the most unexpected words he could have uttered: ""Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well.""

Cue, Internet explosion. Surely this couldn't happen. Cristiano Ronaldo, under contract al Al-Nassr at the time, still under control of a club that wasn't playing in the tournament, could not simply show up to this thing, on loan at a random club, who haven't trained with him, haven't set up their squad for him, and cannot guarantee the same kind of generational wealth that his current club could?

Not a chance, even in a world of make believe, could this transpire.

Well, it turns out that it just might. Ronaldo's contract is up at the end of the month. There have been a smattering of reports of talks on an extension, but nothing official. Meanwhile, chatter about Ronaldo potentially joining a Club World Cup participating team has only grown louder. Another Saudi Pro League side is supposedly interested. He could also, apparently, represent a Moroccan team for a month.

But the logistics don't matter here. Reality doesn't really matter here. Reason is out of the window. The president of FIFA is showing up on YouTube to support this? There will be matches at the Club World Cup, yes, but it's somehow transformed into a marketing event.

And yes, Ronaldo, someway, somehow, in whatever manner possible, simply has to play this summer - whatever it takes from the relevant parties to make it happen.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arthur Fils has withdrawn from Roland Garros due to injury, the tournament announced on Friday evening.

The 14th seed battled past Jaume Munar in a thrilling five-setter on Thursday in Paris, needing four hours and 25 minutes to secure his place in the third round. But instead of facing Andrey Rublev on Saturday, the 17th seed will move into the fourth round by walkover.



Fils admitted after clawing past Munar that he was ""a bit tired, to be honest"". He struggled physically towards the end of the match before finding a way to advance.

""The back a bit,"" Fils said of what was bothering him. ""Got some issue with the back, but that's since I'm young, so I'm used to [it]. And also the cramps. A bit of everything. The mix was not very good.""

Rublev will next play the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, or big-hitting Czech Jiri Lehecka.

Ben Shelton was a man on a mission — and a man covered in clay — Friday at Roland Garros, where he surged past Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time.

The 22-year-old delivered a high-quality display, during which he produced a miraculous recovery to win a point from the floor in the second set, to triumph 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. With his two-hour, 18-minute victory, Shelton became the fourth-youngest American man to reach the fourth round at all four majors.

Serving at 6-3, 3-0, 15/0, Shelton was pulled out wide to hit a deep forehand before falling to the floor as he tried to regroup in the middle of the court. Yet he managed to swat his racquet to the next ball while plummeting to the ground face first, then jumped back up to play a whipping backhand at Gigante's feet to win the point.

“It was very different having five days off between my first and third rounds,” said Shelton, who received a walkover past Hugo Gaston in the second round. “I was thinking about going home to the US for a few days to relax, but I stayed here and I'm really looking forward to being in the second week.

“It's my first time being in the second week here at the French, the only Slam where I hadn't been in the second week yet. I couldn't be more happy with doing that today.”

With Tommy Paul also advancing on Friday, it marks the first time that multiple American men reached the fourth round at the clay-court major since 2001, when Andre Agassi and Michael Russell progressed. Shelton will next face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Damir Dzumhur.

Gigante scored the biggest win of his career by defeating former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, but he was unable to produce another memorable upset. In the first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash between the two explosive lefties, Shelton targeted the Italian's backhand and often lured him in with the use of the drop shots and crafty net play.
Shelton charged to the forecourt on 33 occasions, according to Infosys Stats, throughout the clash. Despite only winning 20 of those points, he unsettled Gigante with his unpredictability, which accounted for the 36 unforced errors produced by the qualifier.

Frances Tiafoe ensured three American men advanced to the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time since 1995 with a clinical 7-6(6), 6-3, 6-4 victory over countryman Sebastian Korda, his first win over a Top 30 opponent on clay since 2022.
“I think we are all pushing each other and working hard,” Tiafoe said of his fellow American players. “There's a window in the game, a lot of guys see a lot of opportunity and it helps when you see peers do well. It's becoming a normality that we are going deep in Slams and having a look in, it's not a surprise anymore.”
By improving to 4-3 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Korda, Tiafoe joined Agassi, Taylor Fritz, Robby Ginepri, John Isner, Andy Roddick and Shelton as the only American men to advance to the fourth round at all Grand Slams this century.
“I thought I played really solid,” added Tiafoe, who saved each of the break points faced against Korda. “I did a really good job in the first set. It was hard to lock in on his service games, it wasn't easy to get in there, but I did a good job of hanging around. From the breaker on, I really stepped it up and played great today.”
Tiafoe will next face Germany's Daniel Altmaier, who rallied past Hamad Medjedovic 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.

American tennis star Tommy Paul has been making waves both on and off the court. Known for his powerful forehand and relentless hustle, his journey from junior sensation to ATP mainstay has been nothing short of compelling.

While his talent speaks volumes, his personal life adds another layer to his public image. His romantic relationships and friendships often generate as much buzz as his killer backhand, adding an intriguing element to his story.

But beyond the headlines, there's much more to Tommy Paul. From his dynamic partnership with his coach to the tournaments that have defined his career, his path offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of professional tennis.

Born on May 17, 1997, in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, Tommy Paul is currently 28 years old. He moved to Greenville, North Carolina, when he was just three months old, where he began playing tennis at the age of 7.

His early training on clay courts laid the foundation for his dynamic playing style. In 2015, he turned professional, and by January 2025, he achieved a career-high ATP ranking of World No. 9, following a quarterfinal run at the Australian Open.

Tommy Paul stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm), a height that complements his agile and aggressive baseline play. His physical attributes contribute to his powerful forehand and swift court coverage, making him a formidable opponent on various surfaces.

No! Tommy Paul is in a relationship with the influencer-entrepreneur Paige Lorenze and since 2022 they have cultivated a partnership that thrives despite the challenges of long-distance and demanding careers.

Lorenze, who divides her time between Connecticut and traveling for his tournaments, has become a familiar face at major events, including the Australian Open and US Open, where her stylish courtside appearances have garnered attention.

Beyond the public eye, their relationship is marked by mutual support and shared interests. Paul, currently based in Florida, often speaks about the grounding influence Lorenze has on his life, from home-cooked meals to encouraging his use of sunscreen and moisturizer.

Tommy Paul's passion for tennis was nurtured by his family. His mother, Jill MacMillan, a former collegiate tennis player at East Carolina University, was his first coach.

His father, Kevin, along with his siblings, Dylan and Jessie Lynn, have been integral to his support system. The family resides on a farm in South Jersey, where they maintain a close-knit and grounded lifestyle.

Brad Stine, a seasoned tennis coach with a history of mentoring top players like Jim Courier and Kevin Anderson, has been instrumental in Tommy Paul's ascent in the ATP rankings. Since taking him under his wing in 2019, Stine has focused on instilling discipline and tactical awareness.

Stine's coaching philosophy emphasizes building a strong personal rapport with his players. He believes that success stems not only from technical training but also from a supportive and understanding relationship.

This approach has fostered a close-knit team environment for him, including physical trainer Franco Herrero and physiotherapist Sebastian Cozzarin, contributing to his sustained performance improvements.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros this week. The 2025 French Open is swiftly approaching the Third Round. The defending champions, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek have both made it through so far — though notably neither player occupies the top-seeded spot in their respective singles tournaments. Jannik Sinner is the No. 1 seed in the men's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka is the No. 1 seed in the women's. American tennis star Coco Gauff is the No. 2 seed on the women's side. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Holger Rune claimed he 'didn't feel safe' during his third round victory at the French Open.

It came as the tenth seed threatened to forfeit his clash with Quentin Halys if an 'aggressive' spectator was not removed.

Rune booked his place in the last-16 at Roland Garros with a 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 victory over his French opponent.

However, the five-set triumph was not without incident after a confrontation with a member of the crowd.

The Danish ace accused a spectator of grabbing his towel as he returned to his box between points.

Rune then launched into a verbal tirade with umpire Adel Nour, who decided against ejecting the fan.

The two-time quarter-finalist could be heard saying, 'He tried to touch the towel,' on a courtside microphone during his protests.

As he headed to the back of the court, Rune angrily threw his towel down and argued with the fan, who held their arms up in their defence.

Rune was also seen venting his frustrations towards a tournament supervisor during the incident.

TNT Sports' Nick Mullins explained on commentary: ""Well the conversation between Holger Rune and the umpire Adel Nour continues about the spectator who tried to grab, did grab, Rune's towel as he took it back to his box courtside.

""Rune said that he wouldn't play again until the spectator had been ejected.

""He said that he didn't feel safe, that the guy was getting aggressive. Spectator is still in his seat, and here is Rune serving to stay in this third set.

""I assume that is at the umpire's discretion and it would appear that Adel Nour has decided that as much as Rune is upset about it, annoyed about it, it is not enough to kick the spectator out.""

The fan later left Court Philippe Chatrier by their own volition despite Nour not calling over security.

As a result, Rune was happy to continue playing as he came from behind to beat Halys.

Commenting on the incident after his match, he said: ""It happened at, I don't know, 5-4 when I was serving for the third set, and we played three more games and nothing really happened. I asked to get him removed three times.

""Yeah, you know, again, I think maybe he got annoyed that I threw the towel in my towel box.

""But I can do whatever I want with my towel box as long as I'm keeping respect for everyone, which I believe I did, and the umpire believed so because I didn't get any warning.

“I think a guy like that, it should not be about him. We're here to perform, we're here to play, and they should try to respect it as much as possible.”

Before adding: ""I was actually very happy about the rest of the crowd. I think they were very respectful. I think obviously when it's like 5-4, tense moment, they were supporting him [Halys] a lot, but it's normal.

“He actually said, ‘Sorry for the crowd', after the match when we shook the hands. I said, ‘Don't worry. I don't think it was anything crazy'. Yeah, just happy to win.""

The 22-year-old will now face Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the fourth round on Sunday.

A win would see him into the last eight in Paris for the third time in his career.

Rune previously reached the quarter-finals in both 2022 and 2023 before a fourth round exit 12 months ago.

Arthur Fils has withdrawn from Roland Garros due to injury, the tournament announced on Friday evening.

The 14th seed battled past Jaume Munar in a thrilling five-setter on Thursday in Paris, needing four hours and 25 minutes to secure his place in the third round. But instead of facing Andrey Rublev on Saturday, the 17th seed will move into the fourth round by walkover.



Fils admitted after clawing past Munar that he was ""a bit tired, to be honest"". He struggled physically towards the end of the match before finding a way to advance.

""The back a bit,"" Fils said of what was bothering him. ""Got some issue with the back, but that's since I'm young, so I'm used to [it]. And also the cramps. A bit of everything. The mix was not very good.""

Rublev will next play the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, or big-hitting Czech Jiri Lehecka.

PARIS (AP) — Defending champion Iga Swiatek joined No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round of the French Open on Friday and neither player has dropped a set.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam winner who has only once reached the semifinals at Roland-Garros, beat Olga Danilovic 6-2, 6-3 on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where the hot weather contrasted with previous days.

“The ball flies much faster,” Sabalenka said. “The bounces are much higher.”

Swiatek, who has won four of her five major titles at Roland-Garros, defeated Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5 on Court Suzanne-Lenglen to extend her French Open winning streak to 23 matches. A second set lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, tested the Pole, who yelled in relief after winning on her second match point. Swiatek had 20 winners and 21 unforced errors.

“She used her chances and just went for it,” said Swiatek, who enjoyed temperatures which reached 29 degrees (84 F). “For sure I don't mind. On clay it gives the balls the extra bounce.”

Sabalenka and Swiatek have been in contrasting form.

Sabalenka has reached six singles finals this year, the most for a woman entering Roland-Garros since Serena Williams in 2013.

But Swiatek is looking to reach her first final anywhere since winning her third straight French Open title, and fourth overall, a year ago. No woman has won four straight French Opens in the Open era.

Asked who was under the most pressure to win this year — her or Swiatek — Sabalenka said, jokingly: “Let's just leave it on Iga since she won it, what, three times in a row?”

Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain was in action later Friday. The No. 2-ranked Alcaraz faced Damir Dzumhur, who hurt his left knee during a fall in his second-round win.

No. 4-seeded Jasmine Paolini, last year's runner-up, beat Ukrainian Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-4, 6-1, and No. 12 Elena Rybakina won against 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko.

Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen beat 18-year-old qualifier Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4, while No. 16 Amanda Anisimova and Liudmila Samsonova also advanced.

In men's third-round play, No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti of Italy beat Mariano Navone, No. 10 Holger Rune of Denmark beat Frenchman Quentin Halys in five sets, and 12th-seeded American Tommy Paul did the same against No. 24 Karen Khachanov.

No. 15 Frances Tiafoe beat No. 23 Sebastian Korda 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-4 in an all-American matchup, joining Paul and No. 13 Ben Shelton to give the U.S. three men in the French Open fourth round for the first time since 1995.

If qualifier Ethan Quinn wins on Saturday, there would be four American men in Week 2 in Paris for the first time since 1991. Shelton won against Matteo Gigante 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

No. 25 Alexei Popyrin of Australia also advanced.

Novak Djokovic plays in the night session on Saturday much to his frustration as he hoped to play earlier so he could watch the Champions League final in Germany between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan on TV.

The 24-time major winner, who recently won his 100th career title, faces qualifier Filip Misolic. If Djokovic wins quickly, though, he may be able to catch the end of the soccer final, which starts at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT). Or possibly extra time.

In remaining third-round men's play, Alexander Zverev — last year's runner-up — takes on Flavio Cobolli on Court Philippe-Chatrier, while No. 1 Jannik Sinner — who beat Zverev in this year's Australian Open final — faces Jiri Lehecka on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. Over on Court Simonne-Mathieu, British hope Jack Draper plays 18-year-old rising Brazilian star Joao Fonseca. They are followed by Cameron Norrie vs. Jacob Fearnley, guaranteeing a British player in the fourth round.

In remaining third-round women's play, former U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff faces Marie Bouzkova on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and No. 3 Jessica Pegula, the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, plays former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier on the same court. There is an all-American contest on Court Suzanne-Lenglen between current Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, who won that major in 2020, the year she went on to lose in the French Open final to Swiatek.

French wild cards Lois Boisson and Elsa Jacquemot have overcome ups and downs in their careers to light up Roland Garros for home fans this week -- and now they'll face off for a place in the Round of 16.

As this year's edition of Roland Garros approached, French women's tennis was in need of a boost.

At the end of March, Caroline Garcia fell out of the Top 100, leaving Varvara Gracheva as the country's sole representative in that echelon -- the lowest number of Top 100 Frenchwomen since 1981. Former WTA Finals champion Garcia announced her imminent retirement last week.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores | 411

A pair of wild cards, Elsa Jacquemot and Lois Boisson, have provided a ray of light. On Thursday, the pair of 22-year-olds both scored impressive second-round wins.

Day 7 preview: French wild cards aim for rare second-week run at Roland Garros

No. 361-ranked Boisson backed up her first-round upset of No. 24 seed Elise Mertens by routing Anhelina Kalinina 6-1, 6-2, pummeling 30 winners (to only nine unforced errors) to win in just 62 minutes.

Later, No. 138 Elsa Jacquemot bounced back after dropping a tense second set to Alycia Parks. She had served for the match at 5-4 and held three match points, only to see the American erase them with clean winners. Undeterred, Jacquemot dominated the third to seal a 6-2, 6-7(4), 6-1 win.

Boisson and Jacquemot, who first played each other in a Grade 2 junior event in Istres eight years ago, will now meet with a place in the second week of their home Grand Slam at stake. Jacquemot  won both of their junior encounters and their only pro matchup, three years ago in an ITF W25 in Cherbourg-en-Cotentin.

""It means a lot, yet not a lot at the same time because I have big ambitions,"" Jacquemot said. ""It's in France. It's in Roland, so it makes me happy. The crowd is really backing us. It's cool. I love it.""

Both players have delivered crowd-pleasing tennis. Jacquemot's signature is her phenomenal speed around the court. Boisson's is her lethal topspin forehand -- but the path to their showdown has been filled with ups and downs. Jacquemot was the Roland Garros girls' champion and junior No. 1 in 2020, and five years later has not gone higher than No. 137. Her year-end ranking has improved incrementally every season, but her tour-level record to date is just 5-15, with two of those wins coming this week.

ELSA JACQUEMOT QUEL POINT DE DINGUE 🤯#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/emZDCIaQDR

Jacquemot admitted that she had been complacent after her stellar junior career.

""There have been some difficult times,"" she said. ""At the beginning, I thought it would be easy. There was no competition. Then I had some defeats. It wasn't easy for me. I think that what's important is to get up after this and say you're allowed to lose, although it's not easy psychologically.

""Is the pathway long? I think we each have our own pathway. I'm not old. I'm only 22. I'm not saying there's a long pathway between my juniors and now. I think that's the pathway I've come on. I want to play in the Top 100, Top 50 and Top 10. But I try to be positive and say, 'OK, this is my current ranking, I'm worth it, I'm going to work even harder to get over the next hurdle.'""

Last year, Boisson also wrote about the importance of hard work and discipline -- but in a very different context. She had not been a star junior like Jacquemot, peaking at No. 171, but in early 2024 seemed to be storming towards a pro breakthrough after winning 31 of her first 37 matches of the year, including the Saint-Malo WTA 125 trophy.

A Roland Garros debut wild card was beckoning -- only for Boisson to tear her ACL two weeks beforehand. Instead of playing her first Grand Slam, Boisson was confined to a hospital bed, and would be sidelined for the next nine months.

A post shared by Lois Boisson (@loisboisson)

""In the space of a week I went from 'collapsed' to the ground, the joy of winning my first WTA title, to 'collapsed' to the ground because my knee gave out and the pain was immense,"" she wrote on social media. ""But this is the path that life has decided to give me, now it's time for discipline to get back to the top!""

In the aftermath of the injury, Boisson's spirits were lifted by messages from fellow WTA players -- particularly Daria Saville, who had her own history of ACL issues. The Australian was one of the first to offer advice, and Boisson was inspired by her own journey as well.

""She really helped me a lot because she had the same experience,"" Boisson said earlier this week. ""I asked her quite a few questions. She really supported me during my rehabilitation. I know that happened to her and she came back and she's playing very well. That really made me confident that I could come back also.""

Almost exactly a year after composing her emotional post, Boisson was rewarded for her persistence with ""a feeling that is impossible to describe"" after edging Mertens in the first round, her first career Top 30 win.

""Just the fact of being here today makes me happy,"" she said. ""It took a long time. I wasn't sure that I would get here. The win has a different taste today. All of the work that we've done has led to this win.""

Though Jacquemot and Boisson both grew up in the same area of France, they rarely trained together as children. Only recently have their paths been crossing on a regular basis. Now, they'll cross on the biggest stage yet. Jacquemot pointed out that the fervent crowd support, a key factor in both of their routes to the third round, will now be split.

""It's not easy to play against a French player at Roland because the crowd won't be behind me as much,"" she said. ""I think it will be quite equal between both players.""

Bobby is all grown up in 14th season of the animated series.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Hulu has set a date for its return to Arlen, Texas. 


	The Disney-owned streamer has set an Aug. 4 premiere date for its King of the Hill revival, which will come a little more than 2 1/2 years after Hulu announced the show's return. The 10-episode season is considered a continuation of the original show, which ran for 13 seasons on Fox from 1997-2010.




	The show will also acknowledge the passage of that time: The first still image from the show (at the top of this post) shows that Bobby Hill, a perpetual middle schooler during the original run, has grown up. The show's opening credits feature the familiar alley setting and theme song by The Refreshments, but the time-lapse shows the passage of a number of years, including the Hill family moving out of and then back into their house. Watch the sequence below.

	Here is Hulu's description of the new season: “After years working a propane job in Saudi Arabia to earn their retirement nest egg, Hank and Peggy Hill return to a changed Arlen, Texas, to reconnect with old friends Dale, Boomhauer and Bill. Meanwhile, Bobby is living his dream as a chef in Dallas and enjoying his 20s with his former classmates Connie, Joseph and Chane.”


	Much of the show's original voice cast, including co-creator Mike Judge, Kathy Najimy, Pamela Adlon, Johnny Hardwick, Stephen Root, Lauren Tom and Toby Huss, return for season 14. Hardwick, who voiced Hank's (Judge) conspiracy-loving neighbor Dale Gribble, died in August 2023. At the time, he had done some voice recording on the revival. Huss took over the role of Dale for the remainder of the season.


	Judge and Greg Daniels created King of the Hill and are executive producing the revival with showrunner Saladin Patterson, Michael Rotenberg and Howard Klein of 3 Arts, and Dustin Davis of Judge and Daniels' Bandera Entertainment. The series is produced by 20th Television Animation.

The creator of the acclaimed Netflix adult animated series talks season 4 episodes and the show's (hopeful) season 5 future. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Netflix's acclaimed adult animated series Love Death + Robots has dropped its long-awaited fourth season, which includes 10 striking fever dream episodes that run the gambit of storytelling — from a cat battling Satan, to naked gladiators riding dinosaurs, to a dolphin messiah. 


	Once again, the show has served up visions inspired by an array of short stories that are unlike anything else on TV (trailer below). And once again, there are controversies, with the show's passionate fandom debating certain aspects (such as a character voiced by Mr. Beast, and executive producer and director David Fincher's short which takes a Red Hot Chili Peppers' performance and recreates it using thousands of puppets).

	Below, creator and director Tim Miller (Deadpool) discusses the new season, several of the episodes and the show's future (if you haven't yet watched season four, better to do that first). The show's success has also allowed him to expand his talents to another adult animated anthology series, Prime Video's Secret Level, which has been renewed for a second season. 


Before we get into the new episodes, if you could adapt any story for this show — like, anything out there that you don't currently have the rights to do — what would you want?


	“Johnny Mnemonic” by William Gibson. And I know they made a movie, but it's so different than the short story that nobody would recognize those two things other than some character names and a dolphin. The original short story is just amazing — as were many of those books from that age. My second one would be a Gibson and Bruce Sterling collaboration from Mirrorshades called “Dog Fight.”

	











You have a huge number of published short stories that you pull from to inspire these. As this is “summer reading list” season, what are some of your all-time favorite short story collections?


Mirrorshades, which is also where [the season 4 episode] “400 Boys” comes from, is fucking fabulous. Gibson has another collection called Burning Chrome. And I really love these books called SNAFU from Cohesion Press in Australia, where we find a lot of Love Death + Robots stories.


It feels like there's some creative linkage between your show and Black Mirror. Have you and Charlie Brooker ever discussed collaborating or trading an episode?  


	No, but I'd happily do that. I think he's much more thematically consistent. His show with its fear of technology and what it might do to our lives, whereas I'm all over the map. My theme is no theme.


So this season, people seem to love “Spider Rose.” The original ending of the short story, she eats her pet out of desperation because she realizes she wants to live, which causes her body to metamorphosis into a new version of the creature. What made the new ending right?


	The transition to a visual medium. You can talk about the creature being cute, but it's a different thing entirely when you see it. And [director] Jennifer Yuh Nelson made it super fucking cute. So the idea of then eating that thing — which, if I directed it, maybe I still would have done — but she certainly made the right choice for the audience. It was just too cute to eat at the end of the day. 

	











For “Golgotha,” I know it doesn't matter, the story works either way, but I still wondered: Was the dolphin just a dolphin or was the dolphin the Messiah? 


	No, the dolphin is a messianic figure. The idea that a dolphin would be able to rise from the dead, be able to speak to aliens and also tell them humans suck and you should scour the earth clean, it was too much of a chance. I'm pretty agnostic, or atheist, and this and “How Zeke Got Religion” ends with an affirmation of religion. So I try not to let my beliefs get in the way of a good story. 


I was curious about that, because religion is a theme in multiple episodes this season and wondered if that was a coincidence. 


	I'm sure, if I was in therapy, there would be some kind of assessment. Like why are there so many cats? I hate cats, so why are they there? But I'm not aware of it. It's really sometimes only after the fact that somebody points out a pattern that I go, “Oh, yeah, I guess so.”


Speaking of the cats, I quite liked “For He Can Creep.” What drew you to that one as a non-cat person?


	I don't like cats, but I do like John Scalzi and John Scalzi likes cats and a lot of those stories are from him. But that one is by Siobhan Carroll. The attitude of [the black cat] Joffrey, the protagonist, I found it very humorous that he feels like like the poet is his pet and when Satan shows up he's like, “Fuck you, don't tell me what to do.” 


	“The Screaming of the Tyrannosaur.” You can't really go wrong with naked Ben-Hur meets Jurassic Park in space. I know it was originally written for Zack Snyder, who couldn't do it. But I don't think it could have been more Zack Snyder even if he had? Other than maybe more slow-mo? 












	Well, at some point there was lot more sex in it. The Duke and Duchess were not just sitting there. They were, let's say, otherwise occupied during the race — which I think would make it a little more Zack Snyder. We dialed that back. Not because of any puritanical instinct, it's not really Mr. Beast's brand and — to be quite honest — it felt a little gratuitous, even to me. Sometimes you do something and you think it's cool, and then sometimes you go, “Am I doing that for the right reasons, or am I doing that just to shock people and get a reaction?”


I thought Mr. Beast's character worked and didn't realize it was him while watching. The way some fans reacted, you would think that guy had invented cancer rather than found a way give tens of millions to strangers. Plus he's clearly parodying himself. Has that pushback been surprising at all?


	I wasn't surprised at the reaction to Mr. Beast. In fact, it was a little milder than I expected, just because he's a polarizing figure. Why? I'm not entirely sure. If I was 13, I'd have a better handle on that question. People go, “This feels like a blatant attempt to get his fan base to watch the show,” and I want to go, “Well, duh, yeah.” It's good to get people to watch the show. It allows us to make art and tell stories. Like with Secret Level, “Well, this just feels like a bunch of stories meant to sell games.” And again, I wanted to go, “Well, yeah, because nobody's going to give us money to make this shit if we're not selling games.” Like nobody gives money to make movies unless somebody's paying to watch those movies.   

	











The one episode that people seem to pile on a bit is “Can't Stop.” It sounds like fans were thinking that it was going to progress into a story instead of being only a performance. Was that aspect ever discussed?


	It was never discussed and I think that's more my hubris than anything. The reason David and I created the show to begin with was an excuse to do anything that we thought was visually interesting, and/or a good story. Sometimes music videos tell a story. Sometimes they're just beautiful. I feel that that's the same way with with animation. Sometimes it's just a beautiful piece of art. So I was kind of surprised by that because it didn't enter my my head, nor had anybody else's. I remember the first time I saw Mad Max: Fury Road, I was disappointed because I was expecting more of a story. The second time I fucking loved it, because I could just sit back and enjoy the spectacle and not have that expectation. I don't know if we'll ever get there on “Can't Stop,” but I enjoyed the hell out of it.


It sounds like you don't mind looking online to see how people react to the show when many creatives are like, “That way lies madness.”


	A showrunner I respect just watched season four and wrote to say he fucking loved it. I said, “Me too, but we're getting a little hate.” Then he said, “Dude, there's not many things that I can tell you about this industry that I've learned over the years. But the one thing is do not read the comments.” Maybe I'm insecure, but I can't help it. And as accomplished as David is, when we screen the show, or I'm on the press tour, he'll text me afterwards and ask, “How did it play? Do they like it?” If you're a creator who doesn't care what people think, I'm not quite sure what you're doing it for. Certainly there's a level of self satisfaction, but you want people to enjoy what you do. 

	











Every writer does, I think. This is the longest wait for new episodes. Will there be a season five? And, if so, will it take another three years?


	Boy, I hope there will be. I have a plan already. I picked two seasons worth of stories and said [to Netflix], “We can get it out faster because we'll just do these seasons back to back.” The wait was too long and fans were not happy about that, and rightly so.


Speaking of waiting for new seasons, how long for a second season of Secret Level?


	I'm not sure I can announce that yet. We're trying to learn from our mistakes. It wasn't the plan to take three years. It was a really a rough time coming out of the pandemic. When the trolls go, “They're taking the money and spending it on popcorn and pizza,” I'm like, “Man, we don't make any money on this show!” All of the money goes up on the screen. And if we had more money, that would go up on the screen, too. If we got a chance to do more seasons, we would not let that happen again. I am genuinely excited about the next batch of stories that are waiting in the wings. I'm interested in examining some of the weightier topics of our time, particularly what happens with the intersection of AI and humanity's future, and there are a lot of great stories about that.

Jen Statsky, Lucia Aniello and Paul W. Downs on the season four ending and their not-so-joking plea to Gavin Newsom. 


							By 

	Seija Rankin


Senior Editor


[This story contains spoilers from the season four finale of Hacks.]


	At the end of Hacks‘ fourth season, Deborah (Jean Smart) and Ava (Hannah Einbinder) find themselves in a new place on their long, often tumultuous, on-again off-again relationship journey. After an erroneously published obituary blames Deborah for Late Night‘s demise, they're not just on-again, they're united in a joint mission for the first time: to get back at the network establishment. “What Deborah does for Ava in episode nine [quitting the show] is the culmination of four seasons' worth of their relationship evolving, so now they're more aligned than ever,” says co-showrunner Jen Statsky. “That was always the plan: to have these women go through everything together and find themselves together, stronger than ever.”

	Below, Statsky and her fellow creators and showrunners Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello speak to The Hollywood Reporter about how they mapped out their protagonists' journey to their new crusade, the real-life writers room scenarios that inspired this season's mishaps and how they cast Celebrity Strip Poker.


	***


You've been renewed for season five — did you write season four with the assumption that you'd get to continue the story?


PAUL W. DOWNS We've always known where we want the series to ultimately conclude, and obviously we haven't gotten there yet, but we also try and deliver a season that feels satisfying in case we can't do anymore episodes. We want people to feel like they've gotten some good emotion at the end of the season.

	











In terms of Deborah standing up for Ava to the network, what other options did you consider? Did you think about having her stay on the show and slowly sabotage it, like her version of quiet quitting while she's still under her contract?


JEN STATSKY We think about this show from every possible angle, so we discussed things like the blackmail she has on Bob Lipka. But the truth is, her going this route was an emotional win for the character. It shows her growth and her morals. She doesn't try to use her old maneuvers to do this, she doesn't react the way season one Deborah would. She realizes she loves Ava more than she wants the show — it's why she says, “I held onto the dream for so long that I didn't realize the dream had changed.”


DOWNS Deborah also does it because, as a comedian, she has too much integrity to allow herself to be censored. She doesn't want to make a show under those terms. In seasons two or three she might have been blind to those things, but now it's not worth it to her to outmaneuver the network just to keep making a show under terms that are set by a corporate overlord.


LUCIA ANIELLO Ava shows her in maturity at the end of the season. She has to have that conversation with Deborah on the boat [in Singapore], and it's hard but it doesn't become irreparable. Ava is just taking in what she has to say. That's why they could quickly get to that ending, being on the same page, with the same crusade in mind. We do feel like it ends with them on the same team, excited about their new goal.

	











When I interviewed the three of you on the day of your Emmy nomination last summer, I asked whether you thought we'd see a female president or a female late-night host first…


ANIELLO Now we're further away from both of them.


DOWNS Well, Deborah will run for President. As a third-party candidate, but she does really well. But, no, isn't that depressing?


Steering us back: The cocaine scene. Did you guys know that both you and Seth Rogen, with The Studio, would have storylines where the show's main characters have to force cocaine on someone to perk them up for a gig?


DOWNS I haven't watched the finale yet, I've only watched through my episode. (laughs) But they don't boof it, right?


No, they just put it into Bryan Cranston's nose.


ANIELLO Okay, so we can claim boofing. We plant our flag in the boof.


In episode six, when we saw Ava's meltdown while she quit her job as head writer, was that based on anything you've seen in real life? Was it wish fulfillment for anyone?


STATSKY Well, we don't want to scream at our writers. We love our writers, so that's fictional.


ANIELLO We would never throw fish near our writers.


DOWNS I would be happy if someone ordered branzino for the table.


STATSKY I worked in late night, and the pace of it is truly exhausting. There were many times that I wanted to scream, and maybe I did into my pillow at night.


DOWNS Mrs. Table is ripped from the headlines, that's something they did at Parks and Rec.

	











STATSKY Sorry, Universal Television. On Parks and Rec we used to have a “writer” named Mrs. Table who loves sweet potato fries. But I don't think the showrunner was supplementing those orders. We were taking from the corporation.


DOWNS And we have heard stories of other shows losing a showrunner mid-show. We've never experienced it, knock on wood.


Jen, was it fun to revisit your late night past or did it give you PTSD to have to write a late night show within a show?


STATSKY It was definitely a bit traumatic. We wanted to pay homage to it but also realistically depict what a grind it is. I think we came up with some good moments. We really do think Celebrity Strip Poker is a good segment, and somebody should do it.


Did you write those segments with the specific celeb cameos in mind, or did you fill them in later?


DOWNS We wrote Jimmy Kimmel into the script, and Carol Burnett and Kristen Bell. Thank God they said yes. Seth Rogen and Kaia Gerber were the first people we asked for Celebrity Strip Poker; it wasn't crafted for them, but we just thought they would both be great. We thought Melissa Etheridge would be a fun cameo because we reference her in the very first joke of the whole series.


Between Seth having you three play yourselves on The Studio, and you guys having Seth on, who asked who first?


ANIELLO We shot our scene in The Studio awhile ago.


DOWNS In writing that segment, we figured it would certainly be an easy ask because we did spend a day shooting with Seth. We also know him socially, and you never want to make someone feel obliged to do something. But luckily he's always been so supportive of us.

	











ANIELLO He's the nicest. He was on Broad City season two as a cameo, when the show had barely been out. He's really been there for us.


DOWNS We love him. I was in a movie with him, Like Father, that his wife directed. So we asked him, and thought about who would be funny to do it with him. We'd recently seen Bottoms, and we'd heard that Kaia was a fan of the show, so we asked her. Asking someone to play themselves — it's not something people always want to do, especially if they're actors. But they were both so game.


Do you think Gavin Newsom has seen the show and taken the plea for tax credits to aid production in L.A. to heart?


STATSKY I think Gavin Newsom is a Hacksinista.


DOWNS I kind of do, too. I weirdly think he sees himself in the show. He sees himself as a Deborah. That's how we try to get to him, is through the show.


ANIELLO I think he also likes Jimmy. I think he's like, you know what, I've got to sign that bill, we've got to stay in L.A. It's something we really are very passionate about. We've shot every season of the show here, primarily. We're so happy to hire local crew and actors and so it's played as a joke but it's very real to us.

What took her so long?


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	In her seventh season of The Kelly Clarkson Show, the pop-star host finally covered Bonnie Tyler‘s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” — a song that many consider to be the ultimate karaoke ballad — for her popular Kellyoke segment.


	Clarkson stayed true to the 1983 original for her two-minute cover on Thursday's (May 29) episode, getting a boost from backup singer (and the daytime talk show's vocal director) Jessi Collins on the essential “turn around” interjections.

	











	“Total Eclipse of the Heart” — written by late composer, lyricist and record producer Jim Steinman — was a four-week No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for Tyler and was nominated at the 1984 Grammys for best female pop vocal performance.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In the Billboard staff's list of the 100 Best Karaoke Songs of All Time, “Eclipse” stands alone as the only solo ballad in the top 10, sitting at No. 9. (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born duet “Shallow” is the only other ballad in the top 10.) As Billboard‘s Jason Lipshutz wrote for the list, “If your karaoke night ends with ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart,' it's been a good night.”


	Tyler's enduring hit returned to national prominence back in August 2017 following a total solar eclipse that passed across the United States, breaking onto Billboard‘s Digital Song Sales chart for the first time with 31,000 digital downloads sold — up 546 percent from the previous week. To capitalize on the song's surge in popularity, Tyler performed “Eclipse” on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship on Aug. 21, 2017, in the Caribbean Sea, with the Joe Jonas-fronted DNCE as her backing band.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Sony's Karate Kid: Legends grossed $2.3M from previews that began at 2 p.m. Thursday.


	The PG-13 movie is a vortex of old school and new school: Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han and, shhhhh, the Cobra Kai gang (I mean, is it really a secret?). Forecast for the movie is $25M-$30M in a marketplace where Disney's Lilo & Stitch is overpowering with a potential $60M second frame. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning also is hoping to hold with those Imax screens, around $32M or less.


	Critics like this Karate Kid a little less than the 2010 Chan one, 55% Rotten vs. 67% fresh. Karate Kid: Legends received 4 stars on PostTrak and a 68% definite recommend from definite audiences, 4 1/2 stars from parents and a 63 definite recommend, and kids under 12 with 4½ stars and a 79% must-see right away. Boys ages 10-12 at 64% made up the majority of the under-12 set; that demo is an essential portion of the Cobra Kai cult. Overall, men showed up at 60% last night.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Karate Kid: Legends‘ Thursday night is just ahead of the $1.9M that Sony/Alcon's The Garfield Movie reboot made last May before a Friday of $8.4M and 3-day of $24M.


Karate Kid: Legends was made for $45M net before P&A; that's $5M more than the 2010 version cost (unadjusted for inflation). The Karate Kid franchise is 41 years old and counts $620M at the global box office from five previous movies; the bulk of that figure is from the Chan/Jaden Smith version 15 years ago, which made $359M worldwide.

	











	A24's Danny and Michael Philippou horror movie Bring Her Back made $850K in previews at 2,409 theaters that began at 4 p.m. Thursday. That figure is just under A24's fall sleeper Heretic, which made $1.2M in previews starting at 7 p.m. before turning into a $4.3M Friday and $10.8M opening. The Philippou twins' previous A24 movie, 2022's Talk to Me, opened to $10.4M. A good definite-recommend from the fanboy crowd last night for Bring Her Back at 58%, with women over 25 giving the movie its best positive score at 83%. The Thursday crowd was male-heavy at 57% to female's 43%. Women overall enjoyed it more than the guys, 83% to 77%. Go Sally Hawkins. The pre-weekend outlook is $5M-$7M. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bring Her Back has been stamped with 88% certified fresh. No audience score yet.


Lilo & Stitch ends its first week with $217M at 4,410 theaters, after $9.2M yesterday, -9% from Wednesday. The pic's first week is 15% behind that the $255M for  Inside Out 2, which ended its run at $652.9M, and it's 9% behind Moana 2‘s first seven days of $239.3M (final $460.4M). No, we're not saying the movie is doing badly, we're just trying to give you an idea of where Lilo & Stitch lives. While no one is forecasting this for Lilo & Stitch, sometimes these fan-fave Disney movies can go into overdrive, i.e. Inside Out 2 owns the best second weekend ever for a PG movie of $101.2M. And nobody saw that coming…


Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ends its first week with an estimated $95.3M at 3,857, which is 7% ahead of the first week of 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout ($220.1M final domestic) and 4.7% ahead of the first seven days of 2022's Dead Reckoning (final domestic B.O. was $172.6M).


	The rest of the top 5 for the week:


	3. Final Destination Bloodlines (WB/NL) 3,523 theaters, Thu $1.85M (-13% from Wed), Week $30.7M (-56%), Total $100.9M/Wk 2It was the highest grossing of the franchise out of the gate. Nothing in its way.


	4. Thunderbolts* (Dis) 3,180 theaters, Thu $765K (-10%), Wk $14.8M (-36%), Total $177M/Wk 4


	5. Sinners (WB) 2,632 theaters, Thu $880k (-15%), Wk $14.06M (-37%), Total $261.8M/Wk 6

	Doff made his feature debut with the 2019 dark comedy Get Duked!, which won the Audience Award in the Midnighters section of SXSW before going on to release through Amazon and was nominated for Best Debut Director at the British Independent Film Awards. A prolific music video and commercial director, he was behind The Chemical Brothers' Grammy-nominated “We've Got to Try” and has also developed pilots for 20th Television/Broadway Video and Lionsgate/Point Grey. He is repped by UTA. 


	Most recently putting out titles like Fair Play, G20 and Saltburn, MRC's upcoming slate also includes Wuthering Heights — from Saltburn‘s Emerald Fennell — along with titles like The Gallerist and The Only Living Pickpocket in New York.

EXCLUSIVE: Multi-platinum-selling country star Kane Brown will make his feature film debut opposite Taylor Lautner in The Token Groomsman, a new romantic comedy from director Natalie Simpkins.


	The indie follows the career-focused Scott (Lautner), who has hit rock bottom at work when he finds himself invited to be a groomsman at an elite, luxury, destination wedding. The only problem is he doesn't remember who the groom is!  Enticed by the rich and powerful, and hoping to make some new business connections, Scott jets off to Italy planning to blend in and quickly cash out. But when sparks unexpectedly fly with the groom's sister Mia, Scott has to decide between “closing the deal” for money, or for love.

	











	Brown will play Neil, the best friend and moral compass to Scott. As Scott stumbles through a chaotic weekend, Neil proves a ride-or-die friend who may be the only sane voice in the madness of wedding season.




			Watch on Deadline		







	When casting the part, said Simpkins, “We knew we needed bold, lovable personalities to match the heart and humor of this story. Kane brings something so unique. He has a rare mix of vulnerability and magnetism that's incredibly compelling.”


	Simpkins co-wrote the screenplay for The Token Groomsman with John C. Hall and Sohale Andrus Mortazavi, working from a story by Hall. Pam Renall and Hall will produce through their Retinue Media production company, along with Simpkins. Production begins later this year. The Fithian Group's Attend will oversee a 2,500-screen U.S. theatrical release, with Radiant Films International handling global sales.


	A three-time host of the CMT Awards, Brown made his acting debut in an episode of CBS's Fire Country in 2023. He first broke onto the music scene in 2016 with his self-titled, 2X Platinum debut album, where he became the first artist ever to lead all five of Billboard's main country charts simultaneously and earned two of the most-streamed country songs of all time. With 12 No. 1 singles at Country radio, internationally sold-out tours and stadium dates, he's already in his career been named to the Time100 list and secured multiple ACM, Billboard, AMA, CMT and People's Choice Award nominations. His fourth studio album, The High Road, is out now.

Joseph Kosinski wasn't looking for a “Top Gun: Maverick” reunion with Tom Cruise when casting his upcoming “F1.” In fact, the filmmaker shared that working with Cruise for the Formula 1 racing feature might even have been “scary,” due to Cruise's well-known dedication to stuntwork.

Director Kosinski told GQ that he did not consider Cruise to lead the film when asked about casting Brad Pitt in the feature. “Tom always pushes it to the limit, but at the same time is super capable and very skilled,” Kosinski said. “They both have the natural talent for driving. But, yeah, I could see Tom maybe scaring us a little bit more.”

In the film, Pitt plays a fictional former Formula 1 driver who partners with a rookie (Damson Idris) for a big race. “F1” action-vehicle supervisor Graham Kelly, who previously worked with Cruise on Kosinski's “Top Gun: Maverick” and a slew of “Mission: Impossible” films helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, agreed that Cruise could have pushed things a bit too hard.

 










“We'd have had a crash,” Kelly joked about Cruise starring in “F1” instead of Pitt. “Tom pushes it to the limit. I mean, really to the limit. That terrifies me.” 

He added, “I've done loads of ‘Mission: Impossibles' with Tom and it's the most stressful experience for someone like me building cars for him, doing stunts with him. Whereas Brad listens and he knows his abilities, and I think he'd be the first to say, ‘Yeah, I'm not going to do that.'” 

As Variety noted, Cruise and Pitt were both set to star in Kosinski's shelved version of “Ford v Ferrari.” Instead, Christian Bale and Matt Damon led the film, with James Mangold directing. Variety cited that Kosinski's film was never made due to budget issues because of both Cruise and Pitt wanting to do their own driving stunts in the movie. Lest we forget that Pitt also garnered an Oscar for playing a stunt man in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and will be reprising the role for a David Fincher-helmed quasi-sequel at Netflix.

Meanwhile, Cruise has been hanging out of biplanes for “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” and will also return to the skies for a third “Top Gun” movie with Kosinski directing. Kosinski previously told Deadline that “F1” was the “next generation” of stunts from what he did on “Maverick.” 

 










“Everything is much smaller and the big innovation is that we're now able to control the movement of the cameras on the cars. We're not locked into these kinds of fixed positions we had on ‘Top Gun,'” he said. “Now we have real-time control of panning and focusing them while shooting through a very extensive RF network that we've built around the tracks.” 

Kosinski continued, “We've got Brad and Damson actually driving the cars, which is pretty spectacular in itself, but to do that in front of a live audience and at the speeds they're doing it and figuring out a way to capture it. … The logistics of it are unlike anything I've done before. We're shooting at the actual Grands Prix, there are certain aspects of this film where we're working in very, very tight windows, shooting on the track, between practice and qualifying sessions, in front of hundreds of thousands of people.”

Taylor Swift finally revealed why we haven't seen Reputation (Taylor's Version) yet — are you ready for it?


	In a heartfelt letter to fans, Swift excitedly announced that she regained control of her music, purchasing her recordings from the investment firm Shamrock Capital. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but never owned until now,” she wrote. “All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.”


While the news was certainly a reason to celebrate, it left fans with one major question: What about Reputation (Taylor's Version), one of two albums left to re-record and release? (Fans have also been waiting for her to release her debut album, as well, but Reputation was largely speculated to be the next drop.)


	Well, Swift came with answers and offered an update on the re-recording of the 2017 album, which fans have been feverishly waiting for ever since the last Taylor's Version, 1989, in October 2023. “I know, I know,” she wrote, causing the ears of every Swiftie across the globe to perk up. “What about Rep TV? Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	She continued: “The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”

	











	That's not to say that Swift won't release the Reputation vault tracks — or her complete re-recording of her 2006 self-titled debut, which she confirmed is already in the can. “There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch,” she said. “I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”

	It's important to note that this doesn't kill the Debutation fan theory — that Swift would release both Reputation TV and the debut TV simultaneously. But neither appear to be imminent, as Swifties were anticipating (they most recently expected the announcement to be made during the 2025 AMAs). 


	Swift herself seemed to tease Reputation TV during the Eras tour, particularly during her first Miami show in October 2024, when she sported a new Reputation bodysuit — the only costume she hadn't swapped since launching the tour in March 2023. She premiered “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version),” the first taste of the Reputation re-recording, on the Amazon Original series Wilderness in August 2023. It was featured on another series just last week, in the penultimate episode of The Handmaid's Tale (star and executive producer Elisabeth Moss confirmed she's a Swiftie).


	Back in 2019, Swift spoke about Reputation in her Rolling Stone cover story, and how, despite it being dark and divisive, the album represented a period of happiness in her personal life. “The one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story,” she said. “It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows, and then there was what was happening inside my world — my newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time.”

	Swift first released Fearless (Taylor's Version) in April 2021, following Scooter Braun's multi-million-dollar acquisition of her original masters in 2019. She followed up Fearless TV with re-recordings of Red (November 2021), Speak Now (July 2023), and 1989 (October 2023).

	Whether or not she ever releases Reputation TV and Taylor Swift TV, her re-recordings were highly influential to the music industry, encouraging other artists (including recently, John Fogerty), to do the same. “Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this flight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen,” Swift said.

	











	But Swift regaining control of her recorded music is a massive, joyous achievement in itself, one that she joked she might celebrate by getting a shamrock tattooed on her forehead (please don't).

I
t's an early May afternoon in Washington, D.C., and as a group of demonstrators gather outside of the Capitol protesting cuts to Medicaid, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in her congressional office, excitedly pulling bright pink, blue, and yellow yarns out of her purse. 


	“I am knitting a cardigan; I call it my Fruity Pebble sweater,” says Ocasio-Cortez, holding the colorful jumble against her black dress. The congresswoman has recently started knitting as an alternative to doomscrolling. “This is a practice that forces me to slow down. In a moment like this, when there's so much chaos, it is designed to basically just wear our nervous system down raw, so we are then overwhelmed, paralyzed, and have to accept whatever new development there is going on that day.” 


	Ocasio-Cortez is no stranger to existing in chaos — she was thrust into the national spotlight in June 2018 when she upset House Democratic Caucus chair Joe Crowley in New York's 14th congressional district primary election. The attention has brought Ocasio-Cortez her fair share of both recognition and abuse, which we talked about when we met last year at a diner in Queens to discuss her legislation to end nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes online. A lot has changed since then, especially politically. President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him on the top of the ticket, and Donald Trump was elected for a second time. 

	











	Trump's whirlwind first 100 days in office steadily chipped away at democracy as we know it, with free speech, due process, and the balance of power in the crosshairs. In that time, the Democratic Party has come under fire, accused of not being ready to meet the moment that is demanded of party leadership. But a notable exception to this narrative has been Ocasio-Cortez, whose “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies with Sen. Bernie Sanders have drawn tens of thousands of people in states like California, Utah, and Colorado.

	Ocasio-Cortez brings up this “moment in history” throughout our conversation this spring. She talks about how this is a time when communities need to come together with courage rather than fear, how Democrats need to chart a path for a more inclusive future rather than constantly play defense, and how, above all, connectivity helps to avoid despair.


	The congresswoman has a background of community organizing, and there's evidence of that throughout her D.C. space. A gallery wall in her office features posters of political calls to action — End Evictions! Climate Justice for All! — alongside photos of rallies and protests. “It's a way for me to bring home here,” she says. As we speak, people line up outside of her office to write on the neon Post-it notes covering her door. There are handwritten messages from people from the U.S. and abroad, thanking her, telling her different versions of “never stop fighting” or, as it's written in Spanish, “nunca dejas de luchar.” 


	“I feel very indebted to people for how powerfully people are choosing to show up, when everything about this moment would support tuning out,” Ocasio-Cortez says. “We need Democrats that are willing to stand up and brawl and not be afraid to fight on these issues, and we need mass collectives of people organizing in the streets,” she says. “I believe it's always been that combination that is able to stop the encroachment of authoritarianism and fascism.”


The last time we met, we talked about the Defiance Act, the bill you are co-sponsoring that would give survivors of sexually explicit deepfake AI abuse recourse to sue. Why is it more important now than ever?We saw Trump's announcement at the State of the Union for the Take It Down Act [legislation requiring platforms to remove nonconsensual deepfake porn], which passed through. But what we are still missing is victim-centered legislation that actually gives victims the power and the ability to advocate for themselves and to fight for themselves and have their day in court, and that's what Defiance does. It gives people who have been subject to nonconsensual, deepfake pornography the civil right of action so that they can pursue justice for themselves and to seek damages for this kind of sexual abuse and harm. Defiance is tremendously important, because Take It Down centers other people, right? But Defiance is about helping the disproportionately, and overwhelmingly, women and children who are affected by this.

So much has changed in the world of AI even since last year. Since we last met, the outsize influence of tech billionaires in politics and on democracy itself has only grown. How does that affect the average person in America?There is almost no area of our lives that has not been affected by this tech-billionaire class because they're buying elections. The balance of the Senate has been shifted because of the crypto lobby dumping millions of dollars into right-wing authoritarian candidates. And it's important to note that this money is not going into just issue-lobbying alone. This isn't about crypto billionaires trying to buy favors for the crypto industry. This is about crypto billionaires trying to install and support authoritarians and fascists, because they believe that if those fascists are personally close to them, then they can control far beyond the regulation of financial instruments. They think they can really start imposing this dystopian worldview that includes everything from the subjugation of women to democracy itself. And we're seeing this play out right now in the fight over Medicaid. Beyond the Senate, Elon Musk dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into trying to buy the U.S. presidential election, and he is trying to recoup that investment by getting one of the largest tax cuts for billionaires in American history — which the Republican Party is trying to pay for through massive cuts to Medicaid, for Americans with disabilities, health care for the poor. They're trying to cut Medicaid and SNAP food assistance to pay for additional tax cuts for Elon Musk and his industries, as well. And so it's really important for people to understand that this goes beyond tech. This is about the extreme concentration of money and power.


What did you think when you watched President Trump's inauguration and powerful tech CEOs Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sundar Pichai were sitting so close to him? This is a moment in history personified. This is not just people buying favors. This is about who controls this country, and everyone else is just a formality, and that is the worldview that we are up against right now. This is the stakes of the present moment. And when Sen. Sanders and I talk about oligarchy, this really is what this is. It is beyond partisan as well. It is concentrated. It is most concentrated in the Republican Party. But it's also the power that controls our politics writ large. 


Your Fighting Oligarchy rallies with Sen. Sanders have drawn enormous crowds. What are you tapping into that other politicians haven't been able to access?We are willing to name the problem in a way that has been challenging for [others] in the Democratic Party to confront. There's been this debate about “Do Americans understand oligarchy or not?” And I think that's a farce. I think that's a cover for the fact that a lot of Democrats don't want to talk about oligarchy. There's a lot of Democrats that are uncomfortable with the fact that Americans feel this way, that Americans see the extreme concen­tration of wealth, they recognize viscerally that it is untenable and, frankly, un-American. I think a lot of folks are uncomfortable squaring that with the fact that they're having dinner parties with the very people that are — and trying to court and curry favor with — the very individuals who hold power in a way that is unsustainable in this country. And so I think it's less about the fact that Americans don't understand oligarchy, and I think it's more about the fact that people in power are uncomfortable with the degree that Americans do actually see it.

	











Some people online joked that the Fighting Oligarchy name was the FO in “fuck around and find out.” Was that intentional?[Laughs.] I can't say that it was intentional, but I do think that hindsight is twenty-twenty. We should — I will unofficially adopt it as a part of the slogan, because we are in the “find out” part now for sure.


What does being on this tour with Sen. Sanders mean to you?It means a lot to me, personally, and also in this moment. I would not be in Congress were it not for Sen. Sanders, in a very literal way and in a figurative way. I never, ever, ever thought that someone like me could be in politics, and it wasn't until Sen. Sanders ran [for president] in 2016 and showed that grassroots, small-dollar fundraising can actually help working people and unlikely candidates run for office. Even just from his literal example and how he structured his campaign; if it weren't for that, I wouldn't have ever even considered running for office. But then, of course, in a deeper and more meaningful way, his commitment, his values, that someone who shares my beliefs can make it in American politics, can even exist in American politics is — he is a huge inspiration for why I ran in the first place. He has continued to be a friend and provided a lot of guidance and counsel on my loneliest days here, and so to be able to do this with him is something I will cherish forever.

“We need Democrats that are willing to stand up and brawl.”


	And also zooming out for the country, I think it's been tremendously important, too. It's not only that I'm doing this with Bernie, but that I'm doing this with every American who shows up. I had this moment on the rope line in Denver — when I first got elected, the crush of media and attention was very, very overwhelming. It was genuinely overnight. It's kind of funny, sometimes I talk to my colleagues, or sometimes I'll talk to other members, and they'll be like, “Yeah, like the waitressing thing that's just a story, right? Like you waitressed once, right? But what were you really doing?” But it's real. 


	I was literally bartending while I was running for office. And so it was an overnight, light-switch kind of situation. I wasn't steadily building a career or anything like that. And so overnight, I win this primary, and because of the nature of that victory, it was just this massive crush of media and attention. Of course, a lot of hate, but also a lot of support. But all of it was very overwhelming. I don't think I was able to really allow it to sink in, and, on a personal level, I wasn't really able to feel it all, because it was so overwhelming.


What happened at the rally in Denver?On this tour and especially after all of these years, duking it out here in Congress, and being subject to a lot of … whatever, even within my own party — this tour has been very healing for me, personally. It is tens of thousands of people who, despite everything falling apart around us, still want to work for something. On a personal level, I'm more of a low-key person, and so sometimes [with] all the people, it can feel like a lot. But I was on this rope line in Denver, it really started to feel like — I am feeling trans­formed by this, and I feel like people are feeling transformed by this. It is a collective experience. And so to me, it's just to be able to do this, to do it with Bernie, to do it with people, it has been so powerful, and it has been the privilege of my life.

	











Switching to immigration, I've been reporting on U.S.-citizen children who are being illegally removed from the country, one of whom was a four-year-old boy in active treatment for metastatic cancer. He's the second U.S.-citizen child with cancer that President Trump has deported. How do you think the public should be responding to this?Listen, I come from a background of organizing. If this president is breaking the Constitution and if he's starting to deport and force out U.S. citizens from this country, that, to me, is shut-it-down territory. We've seen collective action happen before, and mass civil resistance is one of the critical pieces that we have, and it requires both, right? We need Democrats that are willing to stand up and brawl and not be afraid to fight on these issues, and we need mass collectives of people organizing in the streets. I believe that it's always been that combination that is able to stop the encroachment of authoritarianism and fascism.


President Trump recently implied he's not sure he has to uphold the Constitution, and many of the actions of his administration involve denying people due process. Beyond kids, we've also seen this in the cases of people deported to El Salvador, including Bronx resident Merwil Gutiérrez, who you've spoken about. What do we risk when we don't have proper due process for everyone in the country, U.S. citizens or not?The Constitution is the only thing that really defines us as Americans. Despite the right wing's attempts, we are not a country that is ethnically defined. We are not a country that is defined by any one person, ideology, etc., except for the Constitution. What makes America America is enshrined in that document, our freedoms. People need to understand that when the president attacks the Constitution, he is attacking our country. We all swear an oath to the Constitution. As federally elected officials, we swear an oath to uphold, to defend, to protect the Constitution of the United States. First and foremost, if the president is in any way confused about his responsibility, he should resign. Any president should resign if they don't understand that, at the core, that's what his job is. Trump knows exactly what he's doing. He wants to transform the definition of what it means to be an American — from upholding the Constitution and our freedoms — to a pledge of loyalty to him. That is what a cult of personality and authoritarian regimes are all about.


While on the subject of deportations, I want to talk about the students who are losing their visas and being detained in detention centers because they've been outspoken on Palestine. What does this mean for free speech in America?This has been our concern even before this moment. I have a history and a record of opposing a lot of the slush-fund dollars that Congress was approving into ICE [Immi­gration and Customs Enforcement] and CBP [Customs and Border Protection], because I felt like we could see the risk of this moment happening. When you funnel tons of money and no strings and exert little to no oversight or authority into ICE and CBP, you can set up the breaking of the Constitution, using ICE and CBP as the mechanism for violating our civil and constitutional rights. And it's the same thing when it comes to Palestine.

	











	In the United States, everyone can talk about free speech as much as they want. The right wing can, as they have been, play this victim card around free speech all they want. And it's not just Republicans. In both parties, everyone was talking about cancel-culture fears. Social repercussions for saying hurtful things [were] treated as though [they were] a constitutional crisis. When the fact of the matter is the most heavily policed speech in America, no matter who is in charge, has always been the advocacy and the recognition of the humanity of Palestinians.

“When the president attacks the Constitution, he is attacking our country.”


	For a very long time, this groundwork has been laid and enforced. This idea conflating that recognizing the human rights of Palestinians is somehow equal to antisemitism, those bricks and those dangerous foundations have been laid for a very long time, especially since Oct. 7, 2023. It should not come as a surprise when we also see organizations like AIPAC [pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee] and the crypto lobby going after and attacking human rights advocates and trying to unseat those in Congress, conflating antisemitism with people who just want to see Palestinian kids have their human rights protected. It all lays groundwork for this moment, because this administration has seized on that predicate. They have seized on all of those pretenses that have been laid before and say, “OK, well, if you believe that recognizing the plight of Palestinians is antisemitic, then it shouldn't be that much more of a step further to revoke people's green cards, accuse them of terrorism, accuse them of working with Hamas,” because that is some of the discourse that has been allowed in the Democratic Party as well. 


	You can take on that mantle, you can pretend that it's bipartisan, and what's important for people to understand is that that then becomes the predicate for attacking our Constitution. An authoritarian regime, or the Trump administration, is never going to use politically popular or overwhelmingly sympathetic targets to dismantle the Constitution. They are always going to use the people most maligned and most marginalized in order to attack and erode the rights of every American, precisely because they know that not everyone will come to their defense.


After the election, you reached out to people in your district who voted for you and also voted for Trump. What did you learn about these voters?I know it's a hard pill for some people to swallow. But at the end of the day, if you are interested in the psychology of people who overlap between throwing a vote to Trump and throwing a vote to me on the same ballot, no matter what you think about it, those people believe he and I to be honest, to be direct. Honest about what we think, right? I say what I believe. They don't think I'm bullshitting them. They know that I'm fighting for them. And it's true, in terms of my relationship to these folks: You send me to Congress, and I'm going to fight for you, and I'm going to put your interests first. It's strength, too. 

	











	It's also [about] where people get their information. I tend to be in the places where sometimes Trump is in terms of where they get their news.


	In national conversations, people see one thing, but at home, what people experience is my presence. I'm very present in New York. It's not unusual for me to be walking down the street in Jackson Heights or in the South Bronx or in Astoria, and people see me and they have eyes on me. Trump did that, too, in this last election — he had [hundreds of] rallies in the last cycle. It's something that I think sometimes gets overlooked.


Polling indicates that while President Trump's approval rating has fallen substantially, Democrats aren't necessarily gaining. What should the party's leaders be doing differently? And what can voters do to influence how Democratic leaders handle Trump? It's sometimes less about party leadership and more about the party, because this is a party that selects its leaders. The Democratic Party selects its leaders, and its leaders act at the behest of the party members in the caucus. In a moment where we see Trump losing but you don't see Democrats gaining in that loss, first and foremost, it cuts directly against a lot of assumptions here about politics being zero-sum. Politics are not zero-sum. 


	And I think one of the things that people can see, if they want to see it, in November, is that this isn't just this binary spectrum where one person's gain is another person's loss and vice versa, and also moving to the quote-unquote right, or picking up moderates, doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to keep your base. We run real risks in collapsed turnout, and the trick is not necessarily always in choosing one or the other, but we actually need all of it in order to win. One of the struggles that the party has is in deciding what the party itself stands for and who it wants to be. In fact, one of the most uniting principles, which is economic populism and genuinely fighting the oligarchy in this country, is also a political third rail inside the beltway of Washington, D.C. 


What do you mean by political third rail? It's something that is tremendously popular with people, but a lot of our electoral system is based on appealing to the one percent.

	











So it's a political movement that's being missed because of how the electoral system works?Right. If you depend on big money to win, it's hard to get in front of a crowd and talk about the problems with big money.


Trump says he's using tariffs to try and bring manufacturing back for the American worker. Is there any part of this idea that you support?The way that they've gone about this tariff business is insane. The Biden administration used targeted tariffs. The existence and presence of tariffs, in and of itself, is not this explosive Chicken Little the-sky-is-falling kind of thing. Sometimes people have this blanket reaction, and it's like they have amnesia over the fact that President Biden did institute 100 percent tariffs on certain Chinese energy exports. So you can't look the other way when Biden does it and then act like every single tariff is bad when Trump does it. However, what Trump is doing is blowing a hole in not just the U.S. economy. The blanket nature of this — as though we're somehow going to start manufacturing mangoes in the United States of America — I mean, give me a fucking break.

“I say what I believe. [Voters] don't think I'm bullshitting.”


You have been fighting against Republican cuts to Medicaid. Can you talk about how these cuts will affect people?Medicaid is one of the largest insurers in the United States of America. One in five people get their insurance in whole or part or in part from Medicaid, and that's before we even talk about Medicare. 


	If you buy your insurance off of a health exchange, even if you're buying a private health insurance plan off of an Obamacare or state exchange, you will be affected, because Medicaid expansion affects ACA coverage. 


	Medicaid expansion affects people with disabilities, people who are looking for work, whose job doesn't cover health insurance, whose job doesn't pay enough for them to have health insurance. Out of every 10 babies born today, four of [those births] will be covered by Medicaid. 


	We are talking about a massive devastation of our social safety net. And for all of this conversation that Republicans talk about with [Medicaid work requirements for] quote-unquote, able-bodied men — they are very literal in that —people with mental health issues, I think they would consider them able-bodied. We are talking about one of the biggest revocations of health insurance and health care in the United States of America. It is tremendously dangerous. 

	











Why do you think Republicans are pushing for this? Who benefits from it? The whole reason we're here is [because] they're talking about waste, fraud, and abuse. I've been sitting through a lot of these debates. The only time the Republicans brought up a number of alleged waste, fraud, and abuse is $50 billion. Even if you believe them, then why did they put $850 billion as the number for their cuts? Where's that other $800 billion coming from if you said the waste-fraud-abuse number was $50 billion? And the reason for that is because this is not a health-care-cut bill. This is a bill where they have an assignment — they are trying to give trillions of dollars in collective tax cuts to billionaires, and they have to pay for it. And so the thing that they have identified to pay for it is one of the largest areas of expenditures in the United States, which is health care.


Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency has made significant, broad sweeping cuts to federal agencies, and the destruction of the social safety net has been a long-term goal of Republicans. How can Democrats rebuild it after this assault has caused so much harm, and are you scared of what you're seeing happen to democracy?When it comes to social safety net, I am very concerned, because one thing we see in terms of patterns is that Republicans will gut something, and then when Democrats are in the majority, we're not able to get the votes to bring it back at one hundred percent. For the last 30 years, we've experienced death by a thousand cuts — the slow erosion of our everyday quality of life. 


	I genuinely do believe that an important response to all of this stuff getting decimated is rethinking our social safety net entirely. Making it more inclusive, making the middle class not feel cut out from these kinds of supports, saying, instead of how do we just try to climb our way back to what was, what if we just expand Medicare? What if we either lower the age of Medicare to include everybody, let everyone buy into it, or if the party is not there yet, what if we lower the age of qualifying for Medicare to 50, or even lower? So that people can understand that we're not just constantly trying to stop bleeding, but that we actually have an ambitious vision for this country. 


	That kind of offense is the only thing that's going to get us back to the place that we need to be.


Do you listen to music or watch any TV shows to wind down?I have had the Bad Bunny album on repeat. I love that he's bringing salsa back. Rauw Alejandro is doing that, too. I'm a big salsa person. It's such a nice outlet. I like it because the lyricism is so dramatic. Everyone's breaking up, everyone's got the love of their life. It's so funny.

	











	As a Puerto Rican, the album is very cathartic, and it's very political. It speaks to a lot of what's happening to us and our people right now.


Did you see that this morning Bad Bunny announced that he's going on a world tour and he's not going anywhere in the United States, other than his residency in Puerto Rico?We just don't have figures like that anymore. I think about the Civil Rights Movement, and I think about people like Harry Belafonte and all of these artists who really did risk everything, risk their careers and their popularity in order to support and take part in people's movements, and to use their art, a whole album about that. It's more rare now, or at least it feels that way; I wasn't around then. The pressures of the industry are to be as broad as possible. When you have someone who does something gutsy like that, first of all, people come through for it, and it's super compelling. 


Speaking of tours, do you know what you want to do with the momentum from your Fighting Oligarchy rallies? I think there are different ways of looking at politics. Some politicians look at voters and electorates and try to make predictions. I really do believe, even despite all of this, I really do believe in people. I believe in our collective conscience. So, I don't have any master plan, but I believe that the people will show me the way.

By Jacob Burg Contributing Writer 

A pilot flying near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported seeing an “unknown phenomenon” strobing and moving as if running on a racetrack hundreds of feet above the busy airport before vanishing from the morning sky. 

Earlier in 2021, the same year as the Ronald Reagan airport sighting, pilots reported a “long cylindrical object” that passed right over the top of their aircraft. 

It was eerily similar to the description of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) that the Pentagon told Congress about in 2024, in which government contractors saw a “large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane” float in midair before suddenly disappearing. 

These pilot reports come from a centralized digital hub containing thousands of government records on unidentified flying objects — now referred to as UAPs by the Pentagon — that the National Archives released to the public in April. 

Among troves of photos, documents and videos from the government's own investigations into UAPs is a batch of records from the Federal Aviation Administration that contain UAP reports filed by pilots spanning from 2007 to 2024. 

Opinion is split on the veracity of these reports, with some standing behind the pilots' testimonies and others offering a skeptical interpretation. 

Explained and Unexplained UFO Reports 

As with any reports of potentially unidentified phenomena, many of the sightings pilots gave to the FAA between 2007 and 2024 include misidentifications of satellites, balloons, space debris, and other aircraft, along with sightings of lights or objects that seemingly defy conventional explanations. 

In one sighting from 2009, a pilot reported seeing an object that “resembles a very large kite.” 

In September 2022, a pilot flying near Liberal, Kansas, described a “sea of flashing white lights” flying beneath his plane. 

Similar to the explanation the U.S. military gave for the famous Roswell event in 1947, the debris of which was eventually attributed to a weather balloon, many of the FAA reports were determined to be balloons, including one from 2021 that the agency said was a “silver balloon traveling upward at approximately 11,000 feet.” 

On Feb. 3, 2023, there was a multi-sighting event of a large balloon that generated more than a dozen individual reports. Notably, that was one day before the Air Force shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had been seen over U.S. airspace the previous week. 

It's not clear whether these reports are of the same balloon, and the FAA did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. 

Some of the other UAP reports from pilots submitted to the FAA were attributed to space debris, rockets, or potentially other airplanes, while others included potential satellites or possible cases of Starlink satellite sightings. 

Others, however, were not as easily explained within the reports themselves. In an early report from 2007, at least 12 aircraft reported seeing a UAP near Hayden, Colorado, that was apparently “tracking” them. The FAA did not see a radar return for the object. 

Many pilots report seeing lights that move erratically or rapidly change altitude before hovering. In another report, a pilot saw a UAP “strobing in a race track formation” near Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington before disappearing minutes later. 

Another pilot reported seeing a UAP with alternating red, white and green lights match his speed, direction and altitude for more than 15 minutes. A different aircraft confirmed the object, while the North American Aerospace Defense Command stated it “observed nothing in the area” such as other planes or military aircraft. 

In November 2024, the Pentagon told Congress that people in two cars belonging to government contractors saw a “large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane” while leaving a U.S. government facility at about 9 a.m. local time. 

The object was stationary and had a “very bright white light behind or around the object.” 

After roughly 15 to 20 seconds, the object suddenly disappeared. Because of its size and the fact that it vanished without a trace, the sighting was left as unexplained or “anomalous,” according to the Pentagon. 

In 2018, a circular object with “red and green strobe lights” was seen over Columbia City Hospital in Columbia City, Indiana, by multiple witnesses, according to the FAA's UAP reports. 

During the Pentagon's testimony to Congress in 2024 on UAPs, Jon T. Kosloski, the new director for the Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, noted a second unexplained sighting. 

A law enforcement officer observed a large orb floating several hundred feet above the ground a couple of miles from the officer's position. When he headed to its approximate location, which was well-lit, he observed the orb as being a “blacker-than-black” object about 4 to 6 feet wide, Kosloski said. 

When the officer was about 130 to 200 feet from the black object, it tilted roughly 45 degrees before shooting vertically into the air many times faster than any drone the officer had seen before, Kosloski said. 

“It did that without making a sound,” he said. “And just as it left his field of view through his windshield, then it emitted very bright red and blue lights that illuminated the inside of his vehicle as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside.” 

The case remains unexplained because of the object's size, its rapid acceleration, and the lack of any disturbance on the ground beneath it after disappearing, Kosloski said. 

Implications of UAP Reports 

Speculation regarding the source of the unidentified objects that pilots have reported seeing has persisted long before the FAA began compiling them in its databases. 

A veteran pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his job at a U.S. commercial airline, said that he wonders whether some of these UAPs are advanced U.S. military projects.  

However, there is no way of knowing for sure if one is not “read into” the classified program, he said. 

Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves told Congress in July 2023 about two incidents he experienced off the coast of Virginia Beach. 

In 2013, and again in 2014, Graves saw UAPs that had no visible means of lift or propulsion, lacked control surfaces, and did not resemble known aircraft with wings, flaps, or engines.  

Similar to other FAA UAP reports, Graves said some of the objects flew in a racetrack formation. 

After repeatedly seeing those objects making abrupt and unexplained maneuvers on radar screens more than 10 years ago, Graves founded Americans for Safe Aerospace to provide support, research and public education for pilots who experience UAPs. 

“The specific definition that [the Pentagon] uses for [UAPs] … is exhibiting capabilities beyond the state of the art. That's what my data supports,” said Graves, describing the voluminous reports he has compiled from pilots. 

However, he doesn't believe the theories that suggest his experiences were caused by U.S. military tests being conducted on its own soldiers, noting it would be illegal under the executive order that created the current classification system. 

“Not telling us and exposing us to the technology would be illegal,” Graves said. “It would be no different than if they handed me a file of top secret information that I wasn't cleared to. That's because I'm not ‘read into' the program. They have a responsibility in order to avoid spillages such as that.” 

What, then, do commercial aviation experts have to say about pilots reporting UAPs? 

Richard Levy, who worked for decades as an American Airlines pilot and consults on aviation safety, said that while he has never seen a UAP himself, he supports pilots making reports. 

“I stand by them if they're attesting that with their sensory eyeballs and judgment that they see something that they cannot explain, some aircraft, some light that makes no sense to them, or does not have any traffic [on radar] to explain that,” Levy said. 

“What they saw, that's a different issue. But I stand by what they say.” 

However, some in the industry are skeptical of the veracity of pilot UAP reports. 

Shem Malmquist, who has worked in aviation for nearly 40 years, including as a commercial pilot, professor and safety consultant, said that he believes most reports are misidentifications of common phenomena such as space debris or satellites, or merely optical illusions. 

“These are really cool optical illusions. The thing is that our brain just did not evolve to be in that kind of environment,” he said. “Your perception, your space, your distances, heights, altitudes — it's all just outside of how your brain processes information.” 

He said both airline and military pilots are “not trained on visual perception or looking at different things,” but instead trained on very specific tasks. 

“They'll look at something and they think they know what they're talking about. They think they understand it, but it's … something outside their area of expertise.” 

Shawn Pruchnicki, an aviation professor at Ohio State University and a former contract senior research engineer at NASA's Ames Research Center, agrees that pilots are not directly trained to spot unexplainable phenomena in the sky. 

“Nowhere through those training steps is there any type of training or discussion … anywhere about doing just that: trying to differentiate one from another, and trying to distinguish physical, visual illusions from potential actual targets, or anything of the like,” Pruchnicki said. 

He has looked at scores of pilot UAP reports and says some are truly out of the ordinary. And, he says, pilots like himself are familiar with aircraft performance. 

“So it isn't always so much a matter of colors of orbs and these types of things, but rather simply, the movements that the apparent vehicles are making are what makes them interesting,” he said. 

Pilots also have an understanding of aerodynamics at high altitudes, he said. 

“We understand that all of a sudden to be able to just turn on a dime, so to speak, and go straight up and disappear, that, aerodynamically speaking — and from a human performance standard — that is extremely unusual and very, very unlikely,” Pruchnicki said. 

He said there are some reports, confirmed on radar, of objects traveling incredible distances in a matter of seconds, upwards to Mach 30. 

“That's incredible. No one possesses anything like that,” he said. “We're still struggling on the planet with developing vehicles that can sustain around Mach 5 or Mach 6.” 

While there's a possibility the radar could be misled into thinking the objects are traveling at those speeds, pilot UAP reports still need to be analyzed, Pruchnicki said. 

“At the end of the day, the bottom line is, what does this threat pose to flight safety?” he said.

We go over these alien films and dissect which are our favorites. 

'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' 

Do you ever look up into the night sky and wonder whether or not we're all alone? Well, there are a ton of great movies that do that, and then try to provide answers to what would happen if we learned we were not alone. 

Today, I want to go over a list of UFO movies, that is, movies directly centered on unidentified flying objects, and their place in our society. 

So don't think of these as the best alien movies, think of these as a niche within a niche. 

Hopefully, we can find some poignant answers to life's biggest questions. 

Let's dive in. 


            
                1. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
            
            
        Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is arguably the quintessential UFO film. This is such a poignant and emotional look at what it would mean to make contact with life from elsewhere. The story is driven by the escalating appearances of mysterious lights and craft, leading to an obsessive quest for understanding by ordinary people. The UFOs themselves are central to the awe and wonder of the film.And you'll never forget the music. 
            
                2. Arrival (2016)
            
            
        To me, this feels like one of the most realistic depictions of what an alien invasion would entail. The crafts here land, but the real unidentifiable things in this movie are the human reactions to them. The film deeply explores humanity's attempt to understand the purpose and origin of these inexplicable objects before significant direct interaction with their occupants.
            
                3. Contact (1997)
            
            
        I love this movie so much. I think I watched it five times last year because I got so into it and the actual science depicted in the film. Based on Carl Sagan's novel, this Robert Zemeckis film stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who discovers a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, leading to a journey to make first contact. It's a more scientifically grounded and philosophical exploration of the implications of alien communication and it asks huge questions of the people in the movie that translate to the audience. 
            
                4. Flight of the Navigator (1986)
            
            
        As a kid, this VHS tape was heavy in rotation. This family-friendly film centers on a boy's encounter with a sleek, sentient alien spacecraft. Much of the film explores the ship's incredible abilities, its distinct design, and the mystery of its journey and purpose, making the UFO itself a key character.
            
                5. Independence Day (1996)
            
            
        This is also one of those massive cultural movies that I just thought was deeply fun and inventive. The sheer scale and destructive power of the city-sized UFOs are the primary drivers of this blockbuster. The initial awe at their arrival quickly turns to terror as their devastating capabilities are unleashed. There are points in this movie where I have no idea how the humans are going to make it out alive, and I've probably seen it like 20 times. It has such a fun hook and ending. 
            
                6. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
            
            
        UFOs have been in our minds since the dawn of cinema, and this science fiction classic stands with the best of them. The iconic flying saucer that lands in Washington, D.C. is a powerful thematic symbol. Its seamless design, advanced capabilities, and the silent, imposing presence of Gort, the robot guarding it, create an immediate sense of technological superiority and alien mystery before Klaatu even delivers his message of warning. It's a very prescient movie. 
            
                7. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
            
            
        Another Spielberg classic, E.T. is a heartwarming tale of friendship between a lonely boy and a gentle alien stranded on Earth by his own UFO. The movie takes so many distinct points of view, but the idea of the recurring man with the keys, who turns out to be full of wonder, just like a child, sort of sums up the way we all think about UFOs. It remains a beloved film for its emotional depth and timeless story of understanding and connection.
            
                8. War of the Worlds (2005)
            
            
        I could have made a whole list of just Spielberg movies. His modern adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel offers a visceral and terrifying depiction of an alien invasion, focusing on the desperate struggle for survival of one family. Its intense action and unsettling imagery make it a memorable entry in the genre.It has real 9/11 vibes and seems to be a deep exploration into the way the world handles terror and how hard it is to go back to our normal lives after trauma. 
            
                9. District 9 (2009)
            
            
        This is one of those movies that feels like it happened in real life. It uses UFOs for an allegory about immigration and humanity. Neill Blomkamp's powerful and thought-provoking film uses the arrival of alien refugees as a biting deconstruction of xenophobia and social injustice.
            
                10. Signs (2002)
            
            
        I am a massive fan of this crop circle movie, and I think it's one of Shyamalan's best. This thriller explores a family's experience with the sudden appearance of crop circles and the growing dread of an impending alien presence. It's a film that masterfully builds suspense and plays on primal fears of the unknown.And it all hinges on the core performances of an amazing cast. 
            
                11. Nope (2022)
            
            
         Jordan Peele's sci-fi horror film features a mysterious, predatory UFO that terrorizes a remote California horse ranch. It's such a good story about predators, prey, and documenting history that I often forget the alien aspect of the movie..even though the film is dedicated to the characters observing, attempting to understand, and ultimately trying to capture evidence of the elusive and uniquely designed object in the sky, which behaves more like a living creature than a traditional spacecraft.
            
                Summing It All Up 
            
            
        So, there you have it. That's my list for the best UFO movies, but by no means is it prescriptive. I'm sure you have a bunch to add, and I'm always looking for more of these kinds of films to watch.

It's such a good story about predators, prey, and documenting history that I often forget the alien aspect of the movie..even though the film is dedicated to the characters observing, attempting to understand, and ultimately trying to capture evidence of the elusive and uniquely designed object in the sky, which behaves more like a living creature than a traditional spacecraft.

So, there you have it. That's my list for the best UFO movies, but by no means is it prescriptive. I'm sure you have a bunch to add, and I'm always looking for more of these kinds of films to watch. 

Let me know what you think in the comments. 

For our ""Deals of the Week"" we're looking at some amazing deals on several different Apple laptops and iPad devices.

In today's modern age of digital filmmaking, it's almost impossible to work on a project without having some sort of laptop or electronic device with you on set to help with your production planning. From shot-lists and scripts to calendars and even DIT and editing needs, having a powerful laptop with you can be essential.

In our latest ""Deals of the Week,"" we're looking at some nice savings deals for some Apple laptops and iPads that can get you connected and organized while on set. Plus, you know, we got some nice savings here, which might not always be the case in the future.



A look at the new Viltrox DC-A1 7"" HDMI 2.0 High-Bright Monitor and how it can allow shooters to review their camera's image on an ultrabright, sharp 7-inch display.

While many might argue that we're living in the golden age of cameras, or the dawning of the age of AI, just based on the amount of innovation, competition, and great prices available, you could also contend that we're living in the age of the high-bright production monitor.

With so many HDMI monitors available for shooters and cinematographers of all types looking to keep an eye on their images and compositions, it's never a surprise to see more options hit the market in this space.

By Jacob Burg Contributing Writer 

A pilot flying near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported seeing an “unknown phenomenon” strobing and moving as if running on a racetrack hundreds of feet above the busy airport before vanishing from the morning sky. 

Earlier in 2021, the same year as the Ronald Reagan airport sighting, pilots reported a “long cylindrical object” that passed right over the top of their aircraft. 

It was eerily similar to the description of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) that the Pentagon told Congress about in 2024, in which government contractors saw a “large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane” float in midair before suddenly disappearing. 

These pilot reports come from a centralized digital hub containing thousands of government records on unidentified flying objects — now referred to as UAPs by the Pentagon — that the National Archives released to the public in April. 

Among troves of photos, documents and videos from the government's own investigations into UAPs is a batch of records from the Federal Aviation Administration that contain UAP reports filed by pilots spanning from 2007 to 2024. 

Opinion is split on the veracity of these reports, with some standing behind the pilots' testimonies and others offering a skeptical interpretation. 

Explained and Unexplained UFO Reports 

As with any reports of potentially unidentified phenomena, many of the sightings pilots gave to the FAA between 2007 and 2024 include misidentifications of satellites, balloons, space debris, and other aircraft, along with sightings of lights or objects that seemingly defy conventional explanations. 

In one sighting from 2009, a pilot reported seeing an object that “resembles a very large kite.” 

In September 2022, a pilot flying near Liberal, Kansas, described a “sea of flashing white lights” flying beneath his plane. 

Similar to the explanation the U.S. military gave for the famous Roswell event in 1947, the debris of which was eventually attributed to a weather balloon, many of the FAA reports were determined to be balloons, including one from 2021 that the agency said was a “silver balloon traveling upward at approximately 11,000 feet.” 

On Feb. 3, 2023, there was a multi-sighting event of a large balloon that generated more than a dozen individual reports. Notably, that was one day before the Air Force shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had been seen over U.S. airspace the previous week. 

It's not clear whether these reports are of the same balloon, and the FAA did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. 

Some of the other UAP reports from pilots submitted to the FAA were attributed to space debris, rockets, or potentially other airplanes, while others included potential satellites or possible cases of Starlink satellite sightings. 

Others, however, were not as easily explained within the reports themselves. In an early report from 2007, at least 12 aircraft reported seeing a UAP near Hayden, Colorado, that was apparently “tracking” them. The FAA did not see a radar return for the object. 

Many pilots report seeing lights that move erratically or rapidly change altitude before hovering. In another report, a pilot saw a UAP “strobing in a race track formation” near Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington before disappearing minutes later. 

Another pilot reported seeing a UAP with alternating red, white and green lights match his speed, direction and altitude for more than 15 minutes. A different aircraft confirmed the object, while the North American Aerospace Defense Command stated it “observed nothing in the area” such as other planes or military aircraft. 

In November 2024, the Pentagon told Congress that people in two cars belonging to government contractors saw a “large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane” while leaving a U.S. government facility at about 9 a.m. local time. 

The object was stationary and had a “very bright white light behind or around the object.” 

After roughly 15 to 20 seconds, the object suddenly disappeared. Because of its size and the fact that it vanished without a trace, the sighting was left as unexplained or “anomalous,” according to the Pentagon. 

In 2018, a circular object with “red and green strobe lights” was seen over Columbia City Hospital in Columbia City, Indiana, by multiple witnesses, according to the FAA's UAP reports. 

During the Pentagon's testimony to Congress in 2024 on UAPs, Jon T. Kosloski, the new director for the Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, noted a second unexplained sighting. 

A law enforcement officer observed a large orb floating several hundred feet above the ground a couple of miles from the officer's position. When he headed to its approximate location, which was well-lit, he observed the orb as being a “blacker-than-black” object about 4 to 6 feet wide, Kosloski said. 

When the officer was about 130 to 200 feet from the black object, it tilted roughly 45 degrees before shooting vertically into the air many times faster than any drone the officer had seen before, Kosloski said. 

“It did that without making a sound,” he said. “And just as it left his field of view through his windshield, then it emitted very bright red and blue lights that illuminated the inside of his vehicle as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside.” 

The case remains unexplained because of the object's size, its rapid acceleration, and the lack of any disturbance on the ground beneath it after disappearing, Kosloski said. 

Implications of UAP Reports 

Speculation regarding the source of the unidentified objects that pilots have reported seeing has persisted long before the FAA began compiling them in its databases. 

A veteran pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his job at a U.S. commercial airline, said that he wonders whether some of these UAPs are advanced U.S. military projects.  

However, there is no way of knowing for sure if one is not “read into” the classified program, he said. 

Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves told Congress in July 2023 about two incidents he experienced off the coast of Virginia Beach. 

In 2013, and again in 2014, Graves saw UAPs that had no visible means of lift or propulsion, lacked control surfaces, and did not resemble known aircraft with wings, flaps, or engines.  

Similar to other FAA UAP reports, Graves said some of the objects flew in a racetrack formation. 

After repeatedly seeing those objects making abrupt and unexplained maneuvers on radar screens more than 10 years ago, Graves founded Americans for Safe Aerospace to provide support, research and public education for pilots who experience UAPs. 

“The specific definition that [the Pentagon] uses for [UAPs] … is exhibiting capabilities beyond the state of the art. That's what my data supports,” said Graves, describing the voluminous reports he has compiled from pilots. 

However, he doesn't believe the theories that suggest his experiences were caused by U.S. military tests being conducted on its own soldiers, noting it would be illegal under the executive order that created the current classification system. 

“Not telling us and exposing us to the technology would be illegal,” Graves said. “It would be no different than if they handed me a file of top secret information that I wasn't cleared to. That's because I'm not ‘read into' the program. They have a responsibility in order to avoid spillages such as that.” 

What, then, do commercial aviation experts have to say about pilots reporting UAPs? 

Richard Levy, who worked for decades as an American Airlines pilot and consults on aviation safety, said that while he has never seen a UAP himself, he supports pilots making reports. 

“I stand by them if they're attesting that with their sensory eyeballs and judgment that they see something that they cannot explain, some aircraft, some light that makes no sense to them, or does not have any traffic [on radar] to explain that,” Levy said. 

“What they saw, that's a different issue. But I stand by what they say.” 

However, some in the industry are skeptical of the veracity of pilot UAP reports. 

Shem Malmquist, who has worked in aviation for nearly 40 years, including as a commercial pilot, professor and safety consultant, said that he believes most reports are misidentifications of common phenomena such as space debris or satellites, or merely optical illusions. 

“These are really cool optical illusions. The thing is that our brain just did not evolve to be in that kind of environment,” he said. “Your perception, your space, your distances, heights, altitudes — it's all just outside of how your brain processes information.” 

He said both airline and military pilots are “not trained on visual perception or looking at different things,” but instead trained on very specific tasks. 

“They'll look at something and they think they know what they're talking about. They think they understand it, but it's … something outside their area of expertise.” 

Shawn Pruchnicki, an aviation professor at Ohio State University and a former contract senior research engineer at NASA's Ames Research Center, agrees that pilots are not directly trained to spot unexplainable phenomena in the sky. 

“Nowhere through those training steps is there any type of training or discussion … anywhere about doing just that: trying to differentiate one from another, and trying to distinguish physical, visual illusions from potential actual targets, or anything of the like,” Pruchnicki said. 

He has looked at scores of pilot UAP reports and says some are truly out of the ordinary. And, he says, pilots like himself are familiar with aircraft performance. 

“So it isn't always so much a matter of colors of orbs and these types of things, but rather simply, the movements that the apparent vehicles are making are what makes them interesting,” he said. 

Pilots also have an understanding of aerodynamics at high altitudes, he said. 

“We understand that all of a sudden to be able to just turn on a dime, so to speak, and go straight up and disappear, that, aerodynamically speaking — and from a human performance standard — that is extremely unusual and very, very unlikely,” Pruchnicki said. 

He said there are some reports, confirmed on radar, of objects traveling incredible distances in a matter of seconds, upwards to Mach 30. 

“That's incredible. No one possesses anything like that,” he said. “We're still struggling on the planet with developing vehicles that can sustain around Mach 5 or Mach 6.” 

While there's a possibility the radar could be misled into thinking the objects are traveling at those speeds, pilot UAP reports still need to be analyzed, Pruchnicki said. 

“At the end of the day, the bottom line is, what does this threat pose to flight safety?” he said.

Jensen Ackles is setting his sights on another television role post-Supernatural, with Prime Video's upcoming crime drama Countdown on the 2025 TV schedule. It was announced in June 2024 that he landed a new show from Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas, and he's been keeping fans updated throughout filming. Now that production is over and Amazon is starting to drop some new looks at Countdown, the excitement is getting pretty big. Now Supernatural fans are saying it all after the streamer dropped a brand spankin' new look.

Earlier this week, Ackles took to Instagram to share the first trailer for Countdown, which also stars Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho. Already the series seems to be a good one, between the cast, intense storylines, explosions, and much, much more. And I just need it to be June 25:

A post shared by Jensen Ackles (@jensenackles)

A photo posted by on 

Plenty of Supernatural fans had comments about the trailer, mostly just excited that they get to see Ackles on their television screens again. Some have also pointed out that Ackles and Dane together on the same show is a dream come true, and I can't say I disagree. There are also some sweet comments from some of Ackles' Supernatural co-stars that prove the SPN Family is truly forever:

Jensen Ackles is Dean Winchester no more, but it's clear that many fans of the CW series will be watching his new show. Demons may not be involved, but the actor previously explained that fans will find a “familiar taste” with Countdown and his new character, Mark Meachum, an L.A. detective. Of course, it will be hard to see him in a new role, but Ackles has already done a few TV parts since Supernatural, most notably his turn as Soldier Boy on The Boys, which he will be reprising in the show's fifth and final season that will include a Supernatural reunion.

Since the trailer has made fans more excited for Countdown, people will be happy to know that the wait won't be too long. The first three episodes of the series will be streaming for those with a Prime Video subscription beginning June 25, with new episodes dropping weekly. There will be a lot to look forward to, and if Supernatural fans are already excited, there is no telling what they will think of the show when it finally premieres. Considering it's from Derek Haas, whose credits include the One Chicago and FBI franchises, it's going to be a good one.

Countdown will be premiering in less than a month, and just from the looks of the trailer, the wait will be worth it. Tune in to the first three episodes on June 25 only on Prime Video. For now, if people are so inclined while they are waiting, all 15 seasons of Supernatural are streaming with a Netflix subscription.

The psion makes its 5e debut in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3's success

by  Samantha Nelson

Dungeons & Dragons makers Wizards of the Coast has put a strong focus psychic powers since 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 pitted adventurers of the Forgotten Realms against a mind-flayer invasion. WotC embraced the game's success in its 2024 ruleset with an emphasis on psionics, with aberrant sorcerers, psychic warriors and soulknives all appearing in the Player's Handbook. And Thursday's Unearthed Arcana continued that trend, putting out rules for the psion class for the first time since 4th edition. 

The psion dates back to earliest days of and D&D, mentioned in the first edition Player's Handbook and fully developed with the 1991 release of The Complete Psionics Handbook. While a version of a psion called a mystic was tested for 5e in a 2017 Unearthed Arcana, it was never officially published. The amount of psion-focused art shared in a 9-minute video with the designers makes it feel more likely that this class is a keeper, possibly debuting in Forgotten Realms Players Guide releasing later this year.

The psion is a devoted spellcaster, like a wizard, but doesn't speak arcane words or use special material components. Their spells are enhanced by a well of internal energy that manifests as bonus dice in the same way as the soulknife and psychic warrior subclasses. At first level, a psion can expend the dice to telekinetically propel creatures around the battlefield or extend their natural telepathy. The number and size of their dice expand as they level up along with the ways a psion can use them to attack or defend themselves.

The playtest offers options for four subclasses. The telepath is the most classic psion, a defensively strong class focused on psychically linking their party to bolster them. They can also subtly infiltrate thoughts to gather information. Psykinetics are good at utilizing forcefields and blasting people with telekinetic energies while psi warpers manipulate the battlefield by repositioning themselves and their allies. The metamorph is the most twisted option, letting the psion turn their body into a weapon by growing bone blades, extending their limbs, and flinging bolts of bile.

Players who just want a taste of psionics without fully committing to a dedicated class or subclass can try one of the 10 new wild talent feats. The empath gains emotional sense they can use to influence others along with the ability to psionically cast charm person and calm emotions, while a pyrokineticist can change the damage of their attacks and spells to fire and cast some fire spells. The playtest also introduces a few new spells, including the chance to summon a psionic entity.Players can download the psion rules for free on the D&D Beyond website and offer feedback through June 3.

Johnson

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has again waded into long-debunked conspiracy theories, suggesting without evidence that someone, presumably with the government, imploded one of the buildings destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks hours after the Twin Towers collapsed.

Speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, Johnson, R-Oshkosh, said his interest in the attack on New York City, particularly regarding Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell several hours after planes were flown into the nearby Twin Towers, is ""because the 9/11 families want to know the answer.""

""I'm just as prone as everyone else to go, ‘Well, that's wacko. That's a conspiracy,'"" Johnson said. ""But then you start getting the information and you start going, ‘Wow, is that weird.'""

“Building number 7 — you see it come down — and we've all watched, because it's cool to watch these buildings being demolished, boom, just freefall,"" Johnson said. ""The only way that happens is if you remove all of their supports at the same time. You blow them all out so a building can really free-fall. If it's collapsing from something else, it's like, you know, you build like a fire, and it collapses off to the side or something, right?""

The National Institute of Standards and Testing concluded that uncontrolled fires caused by debris from one of the center's Twin Towers caused steel beams and girders to expand, “leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail.

“The failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building,” the group stated in the final report on its investigation.

Speaking with conservative radio host Meg Ellefson a day later, Johnson again cited the 2020 film “Calling out Bravo 7,” a production he's referenced in the past that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 in New York.

""And as we find out, in so many different instances, you really can't trust the government what they told you,"" Johnson said. ""I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. It's sad. It shouldn't happen, but it does.""

In a statement, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Phil Shulman criticized Johnson's remarks.

""Almost 3,000 Americans died in the 9/11 attacks — and Ron Johnson thinks it's ‘cool' to watch buildings collapse as a result of the worst terrorist attack on American soil,"" Shulman said. ""It seems Ron Johnson could not care less about the devastation these attacks caused on our country.""

Johnson's latest comments come about a month after the the Oshkosh Republican told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson he believes there are “an awful lot of questions” surrounding one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.

Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has called for more congressional hearings on the attacks while also criticizing as “corrupt” the investigation carried out by the standards and technology institute.

The institute's final report was the work of more than 200 experts, including scientists and engineers, and found that Building 7 collapsed due to the hours-long fire that consumed much of the building and inadequate water pressure to combat the fire.

“Had a water supply for the automatic sprinkler system been available and had the sprinkler system operated as designed, it is likely that fires in (Building 7) would have been controlled and the collapse prevented,” the report states.

Invisible radiation leaking out of private satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink spacecraft, is disrupting radio astronomers' ability to detect important signals from across the universe. If left unchecked, we could reach an ""inflection point"" beyond which we can no longer properly study the cosmos, researchers warn.

If you look up at the sky on a clear night, shortly after one of SpaceX's many Falcon 9 rocket launches, you might see a bright string of lights zooming across the heavens.

This phenomenon, known as a Starlink train, occurs when light reflects off a newly deployed batch of SpaceX satellites before they eventually fan out and become part of the wider Starlink network. It is also a common reminder that giant groups of private satellites, known as ""megaconstellations,"" are quickly becoming a reality.

But behind these lights lurks an invisible — and much more problematic — form of radiation: radio waves.

If our eyes could also detect this hidden radiation, the sky would be full of bright spots and nonstop flashing that would obscure the distant signals from objects beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). And unlike the light pollution we see from satellites, these intrusive signals don't just happen at night or in the hours after new satellites are released — they happen all the time.



Some researchers are so worried about this invisible pollution that they think we could eventually reach an ""inflection point,"" beyond which ground-based astronomy instruments could become radio-blind to the cosmos.

""It would basically mean that no radio astronomy from the ground would be possible anymore,"" Benjamin Winkel, a radio astronomer at the Max Planck Institute of Radio Astronomy in Germany, told Live Science. ""It will eventually reach a point where it is not worthwhile to operate a [radio] telescope anymore.""

At the rate that megaconstellations are growing, this could happen within the next 30 years, some experts predict.

Radio astronomy allows us to see a host of hidden cosmic structures and phenomena that we can't detect through visual light alone.

Scientists use radio frequencies to study a range of phenomena, from the jets of energy shooting from supermassive black holes to the subtle changes in the trajectories of near-Earth asteroids.

Radio telescopes are also constantly finding phenomena, such as fast radio bursts — millisecond pulses of ultra-energetic radiation, some of which repeat at regular intervals — that come from super-dense, highly magnetic objects such as neutron stars. Their observations also provide some of the best insights into the ""Age of Reionization,"" as far back as 400 million years after the Big Bang, when the first stars and galaxies were emerging from clouds of primordial hydrogen.

Scientists scouring the skies for signs of alien life, such as those at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, also favor hunting in radio waves because any advanced civilizations will likely use these wavelengths for communication, just as humans do.

We also rely on radio telescopes to pin down our precise location compared to other cosmic objects, which is constantly shifting.

The radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum ranges from roughly 3 kilohertz to over 300 gigahertz — equal to wavelengths from more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) long down to 0.04 inches (1 millimeter). However, not all of these wavelengths are visible from Earth, and most astronomers hunt for signals somewhere between 1 megahertz and 100 GHz, according to the British Astronomical Association.



Many of the world's biggest radio telescope arrays focus on even narrower ranges. For instance, the world's largest single telescope, China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, searches between 70 MHz to 3 GHz; while the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), the world's largest array of radio telescopes scattered across Australia and South Africa, scans between 50 MHz to 14 GHz.

But increasingly, many of these frequencies are being bombarded by noise from Starlink and other satellites.

While satellite messages deliberately beamed down to operators on Earth, known as intended downlinks, are problematic, the biggest risk to these projects is what's known as unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR), or the radio waves that inadvertently leak out of the spacecraft at all times.

""This was not a problem before, when the number of satellites was low,"" Federico Di Vruno, a radio astronomer at SKAO and co-director of the International Astronomical Union's recently created Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS), told Live Science. ""But now the situation has changed.""

And UEMR is particularly prevalent among private satellite constellations, such as Starlink.



When Di Vruno and colleagues used Europe's Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) to observe a group of Generation 1 Starlink satellites, they found that the satellites were leaking UEMR at a much higher rate than other orbiting spacecraft. In their results, published in 2023, they reported that this radiation had frequencies between 110 and 188 megahertz, representing a large portion of the operating range of LOFAR (10 to 240 MHz), which scans for signals from pulsars, solar wind, cosmic rays and galaxies from the Age of Reionization.

""We were not surprised that we detected something,"" Winkel, who was a co-author of the study, told Live Science. ""But we didn't anticipate that the level would be so high."" However, what came next was even more shocking.

In September 2024, Di Vruno and Winkel were co-authors of a follow-up LOFAR study that showed that the newer Generation 2 Starlink satellites were leaking over 30 times more UEMR than their predecessors, even though the researchers had previously warned SpaceX about the findings of the initial study. This radiation was emitted in roughly the same frequency bandwidth as the Gen 1 satellites.



And SpaceX will not be the only source of UEMR. Other companies, agencies and countries are also launching competing satellite constellations. These include Amazon's Project Kuiper, Eutelsat's OneWeb network (which is being launched by SpaceX), the European Union's IRIS² network, AST SpaceMobile's giant communication satellites, and China's Qianfan, or ""Thousand Sails,"" constellation, Di Vruno noted.

""We don't know [how much UEMR these spacecraft will emit] yet,"" Winkel said. ""Every satellite will have UEMR, but it remains to be seen, at what level."" As a result, many other frequencies could be affected, he added.

In addition to overlapping with the frequencies of distant signals, UEMR is also much more intense, or brighter, than naturally occurring radio-emitting objects.

For example, the UEMR emitted by the Gen 2 Starlink satellites is up to 10 million times brighter than the faintest radio-visible objects in the night sky, which include ancient galaxies located billions of light-years from Earth.

""This difference is similar to the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and the brightness of the full moon,"" Cees Bassa, an astronomer at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) and lead author of the 2024 study, previously stated.

Trying to detect signals from beyond one of these satellites is ""like taking a photograph while someone points a flashlight in your direction,"" Winkel said.

Some radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, will be hit harder than others, due to the frequencies they specialize in, but all radio telescopes will be affected ""in different ways,"" Di Vruno said.

Studies that require long-term datasets will be particularly susceptible to interference because there is a greater chance that leaky satellites will pass over them during the data collection period.

""As some projects need to continuously record data over hours, days, months or years, even tiny interference signals can have a statistical impact on the results,"" Winkel said. ""And perhaps the astronomer analyzing the data is not even aware of it.""

Intended downlinks, which are sent in multiple frequencies over 1 GHz, are also extremely bright and often appear in tandem with UEMR, exaggerating these effects.

As the problem gets worse, certain frequencies will become increasingly hard to study.

""Some radio bands could be completely wiped out,"" Di Vruno said. ""And if [these] science cases are just not possible anymore, it would mean that we are effectively closing 'windows' to observe our universe.""

As of May, there are 11,700 active satellites orbiting Earth. More than 7,300 of those (over 60%) are Starlink satellites, which have all been launched since 2019, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has been tracking satellite launches and reentries since 1986.

But this is just the beginning. Well over 1 million satellites have been proposed by various organizations across the globe. And, while most of these may never be launched, many experts agree that we could eventually have up to 100,000 private satellites in LEO, potentially by as early as 2050. (This will likely be the maximum number that can be sustained at once without satellites crashing into one another.)

If that maximum number is reached, there is ""real possibility"" that we could reach an inflection point, beyond which ground-based radio astronomy would become effectively impossible, Di Vruno said.

Not all radio frequencies will be impacted. However, the obscured wavelengths will likely be lost for good, and the unaffected frequencies are unlikely to yield as many meaningful discoveries, he added.

At this point, we would no longer be able to ""observe faint signals far out into the universe,"" which would be ""a serious problem,"" Fionagh Thomson, a research fellow at Durham University in England who specializes in space ethics and was not involved in the LOFAR research, told Live Science.

Some radio astronomy could also still be achievable from space on a smaller scale. For example, there are plans to build a radio telescope on the moon. However, this would be very expensive and would capture limited data compared with the current suite of radio telescopes on Earth.

But even if we avoid the ""worst-case scenario,"" we risk severely limiting our astronomical capabilities unless satellite operators and researchers can find viable solutions to the problem, Thomson said.

Satellite operators can limit the impacts of their spacecraft on radio astronomy in a few ways.

For example, most intended downlink frequencies are kept separate from those used by radio astronomers. Some companies, including SpaceX, are also investigating the implementation of ""boresight avoidance,"" in which the satellites temporarily halt signal sending as they pass over radio ""quiet zones,"" or areas where radio telescopes are actively collecting data.



However, for astronomers, it is also imperative that these companies minimize UEMR. We know that this is possible because spacecraft from NASA and other space agencies produce much less accidental radiation than private satellites do.

But companies can only mitigate a satellite's UEMR before it is launched into space. Once in LEO, ""they are hard to fix,"" Winkel said, so it is vital that they are tested for leaks before launch.

""If satellite operators care about the UEMR, we will be OK,"" Di Vruno said. ""It will be more difficult to conduct radio astronomy than it is now, but we understand technology evolves and we will evolve with it.""

Astronomers can also limit the impacts of radio pollution by removing the interfering signals from their datasets. However, this ""cleaning"" may cause astronomers to miss crucial data that is masked by the interference.

""The amount of data you have to discard or the effort that you need to put in to somehow clean the data also increases the more interference there is,"" Winkel said. One way around this is to collect more data so that there is more left once you've cleaned it, but this also makes it much more expensive to do research, he added.

By working together, satellite operators and radio astronomers can solve the radio pollution issue without any external help, Thomson said. ""But inevitably, satellite operators and the radio astronomy community have different goals, priorities and budgets, and finding workable solutions is no easy feat.""



Because private companies and scientists have different priorities, the most effective solution to the problem is to impose strict limits on the amount of UEMR that private spacecraft can give off, experts told Live Science.

""We would, of course, be more relaxed if proper regulation was in place,"" Winkel said.

At present, specific radio frequencies, like those used by LOFAR, are protected on behalf of astronomers by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) — a United Nations agency responsible for regulating global communications technologies. However, these regulations apply only to Earth-based sources of radio pollution, not to private spacecraft.

Most satellite operators do try to respect the ITU's guidelines when using intended downlinks — with limited degrees of success. But UEMR frequently overlaps with the protected wavelengths and remains perfectly legal.

—Sci-fi inspired tractor beams are real, and could solve a major space junk problem

—How many satellites could fit in Earth orbit? And how many do we really need?

—NASA plans to build a giant radio telescope on the 'dark side' of the moon. Here's why.

Some experts also argue that the ITU's radio-quiet frequency bands are no longer wide enough to protect radio astronomy: ""They were set in a different era and are arguably too narrow for modern radio astronomy,"" Thomson said.

The IAU's CPU is hoping to have strict new regulations in place by the end of the decade and hopes that a breakthrough can be achieved at the next World Radiocommunication Conference, in 2027, Di Vruno said. Therefore, it is important for researchers to closely monitor the radiation leaking from private satellite constellations over the next few years, so that any new rules can have an effective and long-standing impact, he added.

However, even stricter guidelines might not be enough if organizations don't respect them.

""There is an assumption that imposing laws will fix complex problems,"" Thomson said. ""But not all viable solutions involve implementing binding legislation,"" she warned.

Key developments on May 28:

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent.

If confirmed, the Vladivostok operation would be Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory - approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

According to the source, two blasts occurred early in the morning at a site where Russia's 47th Separate Air Assault Battalion of the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade was stationed.

The 155th Marine Brigade has been actively involved in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including battles in Mariupol and Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, as well as operations in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Local media reported two loud bangs, followed by temporary road closures and emergency vehicles seen in the area, but did not mention anything about a military base.

Russia's Anti-Terrorist Commission of Primorsky Krai attributed the explosions to the ignition of propane-butane cylinders inside a vehicle. No official casualties have been reported.

One of the explosions allegedly happened near a checkpoint, while the other hit the location of personnel and the unit's command.

""Manpower, military equipment, and special equipment were hit,"" the source claimed.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

Desantnaya Bay is located in Vladivostok in Russia's Far East, which lies some 185 kilometres (114 miles) from the Russian-North Korean border.

Ukraine is ready to attend the second round of peace talks with the Russian delegation in Istanbul on June 2, but seeks to receive a draft of Russia's proposed ceasefire memorandum before the meeting, said Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak on May 29.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine, despite escalating its attacks on the country.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 29 that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present the memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the next Istanbul meeting.

Kyiv insists on receiving the memorandum ahead of the new round of talks in order to understand Russia's proposed steps toward a ceasefire. Ukraine has already submitted its own document to the Russian side.

""Ukraine is ready to attend the next meeting, but we want to engage in a constructive discussion. This means it is important to receive Russia's draft. There is enough time – four days are sufficient for preparing and sending the documents,"" Yermak said during a conversation with advisors to the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy.

Security advisors from the four countries are expected to attend the second round of peace talks in Istanbul, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said.

The U.S. Senate is expected to ""start moving"" next week on a bill introducing sweeping new sanctions against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said at a press briefing in Kyiv on May 30 attended by The Kyiv Independent.

The proposed bill would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products. At least 82 U.S. senators are prepared to vote for the bill, Graham said.

""I would expect next week that the Senate will start moving the sanctions bill,"" Graham, a vocal supporter of Ukraine and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said. ""There are House members that are ready to move in the House, and you'll see congressional action. President Trump said that the next two-week period will be outcome-determined.""

Asked whether Congress would pass the bill before its summer recess and whether Trump would sign it, Graham responded: ""I've never been more optimistic than I am today.""

The senator dismissed the upcoming June 2 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks in Istanbul, where Moscow is expected to present a draft ceasefire memorandum, as unlikely to yield progress.

""I see nothing about the meeting on Monday in Istanbul to give me any hope at all that Russia is interested in peace,"" he said. ""So when this two-week period is over, I think it'd be pretty clear to everybody (that) Russia is playing a game at the expense of the world, not just the United States.""

The senator also credited growing global recognition of Ukraine's willingness to negotiate in good faith and Russia's refusal to reciprocate.

""It's clear to almost anyone — Putin is not remotely interested in anything that would lead to peace,"" he said. ""So there's a card game going on this summer. The first cards are going to be played by the United States Senate and the House.""

Graham accused Moscow of stalling while ramping up its war effort and warned that the U.S. response would be swift and severe. He also issued a stark warning to Beijing.

""China, the game you're playing with Russia is about to change. If you keep buying cheap Russian oil to fuel Putin's war machine, there will be a 500% tariff on all of your products coming into the United States,"" he said.

He added that ""70% of Russian oil is bought by China and India.""

Russia is prepared to consider a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine, but only if Kyiv stops receiving Western weapons and halts mobilization, Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's envoy to the United Nations, said on May 30, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.

""In principle, we are ready to consider the possibility of establishing a ceasefire, which would subsequently allow for a sustainable resolution of the root causes of the conflict,"" Nebenzya said at a U.N. Security Council meeting.

Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, convened the meeting to accuse European nations of undermining peace efforts. The Russian ambassador said that any ceasefire would require Western governments to end their support for Ukraine's armed forces.

""During the ceasefire, it is essential that Western countries stop supplying weapons to the Kyiv regime (the Ukrainian government) and that Ukraine halt its mobilization,"" Nebenzya said.

The statement comes just days ahead of the next round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. Despite the stated offer, Nebenzya also pledged that Moscow would ""continue and intensify military operations for as long as necessary.""

Ukraine swiftly rejected the demand as disingenuous.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the remarks a ""slap in the face to all who advocate for peace,"" including countries like China and Brazil, which have pressed both sides to end the war.

""When the entire world insists that it is time to stop the killing immediately and engage in meaningful diplomacy, Russia uses the highest fora to spew such belligerent rhetoric,"" Sybiha wrote on X.

""We insist that the pressure on Moscow be increased already now. They do not understand normal attitude or diplomatic language; it is time to speak to them in the language of sanctions and increased support for Ukraine.""

Despite growing global calls for a truce, Russia has so far rejected Ukraine's U.S.-backed proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The Kremlin has instead escalated its aerial assaults across Ukrainian territory and is reportedly preparing a new summer offensive.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""fundamentally in favor"" of meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 30, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

The statement comes amid renewed diplomatic maneuvering to schedule the next round of peace talks in Istanbul, tentatively proposed for June 2.

Peskov stressed that a high-level summit would require concrete outcomes from the negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations.

""President Putin has repeatedly said that he is fundamentally in favor of high-level contacts, which are undoubtedly needed,"" Peskov said. ""But they must be prepared, and first, a result must be achieved in negotiations between the delegations.""

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on May 30 that Turkey would be open to hosting a possible meeting among the three leaders, with the participation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well. Fidan's statement followed his visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.

Zelensky previously invited Putin to Istanbul for direct talks on May 16, proposing a three-way format with Trump to push forward peace efforts. Putin declined to attend, sending a low-level delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

The Istanbul talks ended without agreement on a ceasefire or broader political settlement, though the sides did agree to the largest prisoner exchange of the full-scale war.

The Kremlin has repeatedly attacked Zelensky's legitimacy as president, pointing out that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024.

Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky's term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

Trump, who held a two-hour phone call with Putin on May 19 and is pushing to broker a ceasefire deal, has backed the idea of a high-level summit. Putin and Zelensky have met only once — in December 2019, during the Normandy Format talks in Paris.

The village of Blatten could be seen partly submerged under water, mud and rock on Thursday following the collapse of a large chunk of glacier a day earlier.

Residents struggled on Thursday to absorb the scale of devastation caused by a huge slab of glacier that buried most of their picturesque Swiss village, in what scientists suspect is a dramatic example of climate change's impact on the Alps.

A deluge of millions of cubic meters of ice, mud and rock crashed down a mountain on Wednesday, engulfing the village of Blatten and the few houses that remained were later flooded. Its 300 residents had already been evacuated earlier in May after part of the mountain behind the Birch Glacier began to crumble.

Rescue teams with search dogs and thermal drone scans have continued looking for a missing 64-year-old man but have found nothing. Local authorities suspended the search on Thursday afternoon, saying the debris mounds were too unstable for now and warned of further rockfalls.

With the Swiss army closely monitoring the situation, flooding worsened during the day as vast mounds of debris almost two kilometres across clogged the path of the River Lonza, causing a huge lake to form amid the wreckage and raising fears that the morass could dislodge.

Water levels have been rising by 80 centimetres an hour from the blocked river and melting glacier ice, Stephane Ganzer, head of the security division for the Valais canton, told reporters.

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter is returning early from high-level talks in Ireland and will visit the site on Friday, her office said.

“I don't want to talk just now. I lost everything yesterday. I hope you understand,” said one middle-aged woman from Blatten, declining to give her name as she sat alone disconsolately in front of a church in the neighbouring village of Wiler.

Nearby, the road ran along the valley before ending abruptly at the mass of mud and debris now blanketing her own village. 

A thin cloud of dust hung in the air over the Kleines Nesthorn Mountain where the rock slide occurred while a helicopter buzzed overhead.

Werner Bellwald, a 65-year-old cultural studies expert, lost the wooden family house built in 1654 where he lived in Ried, a hamlet next to Blatten also wiped out by the deluge.

“You can't tell that there was ever a settlement there,” he told Reuters. “Things happened there that no one here thought were possible.”

The worst scenario would be that a wave of debris bursts the nearby Ferden Dam, Valais canton official Ganzer said. He added that the chances of this further mudslide were currently unlikely, noting that the dam had been emptied as a precaution so it could act as a buffer zone.

Local authorities said that the buildings in Blatten which had emerged intact from the landslide are now flooded and that some residents of nearby villages had been evacuated.

The army said around 50 personnel as well as water pumps, diggers and other heavy equipment were on standby to provide relief when it was safe.

Authorities were airlifting livestock out of the area, said Jonas Jeitziner, a local official in Wiler, as a few sheep scrambled out of a container lowered from a helicopter.

Asked how he felt about the future, he said, gazing towards the plain of mud: “Right now, the shock is so profound that one can't think about it yet.”

The catastrophe has revived concern about the impact of rising temperatures on Alpine permafrost where thawing has loosened some rock structures, creating new mountain hazards.

For years, the Birch Glacier has been creeping down the mountainside, pressured by shifting debris near the summit.

Matthias Huss, head of Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland, pointed to the likely influence of climate change in loosening the rock mass among the permafrost, which triggered the collapse.

“Unexpected things happen at places that we have not seen for hundreds of years, most probably due to climate change,” he told Reuters.

Live Updates


            • Musk's departure: President Donald Trump and Elon Musk spoke in the Oval Office today as the tech billionaire's formal government role ends, with Trump heaping praise on Musk's work to overhaul government spending and both men indicating Musk will still serve as an informal adviser. The Tesla CEO has acknowledged this week that he sometimes finds himself at odds with administration decisions.
    


            • Steel deal: Trump will be in Pennsylvania tonight for an event touting the new partnership between US Steel and the Japan-based Nippon Steel, which he says will keep the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.
    


            • Tariffs reinstated: ﻿A federal appeals court temporarily restored Trump's ability to levy tariffs using the emergency powers he declared this year while the case goes through the courts. The pause adds to the confusion and uncertainty swirling around Trump's trade policy.
    


            Leonard Leo, a conservative legal activist, issued a statement after President Donald Trump called the former Federalist Society chair a “sleazebag” who “probably hates America” in a lengthy post on Truth Social.
    


            In a statement provided to CNN, Leo said “I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved.”
    


                    “There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy,” Leo said.
                





            Leo did not respond directly to Trump's attacks, including calling him “a bad person” who brags about controlling judges Instead, Leo highlighted how he and the Federalist Society shaped much of Trump's judicial legacy in his first term.
    


            Trump's attacks and Leo's response came after a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade ruled against Trump's tariffs. One of those judges, Timothy Reif, was appointed by Trump. The ruling was later paused by an appeals court.
    


            But a person familiar with the matter disputed Trump's assertion that the Trump appointee in question in the tariff case was a Federalist Society recommendation.
    


            Instead, this person, who worked during Trump's first term, said he was not and that members of Trump's trade team back then actually advocated for Reif.
    


            Reif was previously a political appointee in the Trump administration, who served as a senior adviser under then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer before his nomination to the federal trade court, CNN has reported.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he was “surprised” and “disappointed” by recent Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, but stopped short of labeling President Vladimir Putin a “bad guy” when pressed by a reporter in the Oval Office.
    


            “We were going to solve a problem, and then all of a sudden, rockets got shot into a couple of cities and people died,” Trump said.
    


            “I saw things that I was surprised at, and I don't like being surprised, so I'm very disappointed,” he added, sidestepping a direct answer when asked whether he now views Putin “as the good guy or the bad guy.”
    


            Trump went on to express concern over the human toll of the conflict.
    


            When asked how his administration is managing “a very stubborn Vladimir Putin,” Trump was quick to interject and include Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in the characterization.
    


            “And Zelensky, too,” he said.
    


            Trump spoke with Putin on the phone last week, and the Russian leader reportedly committed to drafting and sending a “memorandum of peace” detailing Russia's conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official and a White House source familiar with the matter. However, more than a week after the call, the U.S. has yet to receive the promised document, the sources said.
    


            In response to the continued violence, Trump is now weighing additional sanctions on Moscow, according to individuals familiar with the situation, as he vents his frustration over the stalled peace process.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he wants to get rid of the debt limit and emphasized the dangers of default — a turnaround from his stance on the topic when President Joe Biden was still in office.
    


            “If we don't extend debt, we're in default. Now, the Democrats might like our country to be in default, but in 250 years, we've never been in default,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
    


            In a May 2023 town hall with CNN, then-candidate Trump said he believed the US should default if the Biden White House didn't agree to spending cuts.
    


            “It's psychological,” Trump said of a default at the time. “It's really psychological more than anything else. And it could be really bad, it could be maybe nothing. Maybe it's a … you have a bad week or a bad day.”
    


            In a 2016 interview on CNBC, the then-presumptive Republican nominee seemed to suggest that rather than pay its outstanding national debt in full, the country could renegotiate.
    


            Trump's changing demands on the debt ceiling also caused chaos last December, when he demanded Republicans try to use a government spending bill to increase the debt limit at the last minute. Trump made it clear he wanted the debt ceiling raised under Biden, rather than having to deal with it once he was president.
    


            Ultimately, the spending legislation passed Congress without a debt ceiling provision. Now, the GOP is trying to raise the limit under Trump's “one big, beautiful bill,” which is currently moving through Congress.
    


            Today, Trump brought up Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's calls to get rid of the debt ceiling and said, “I always agreed with her.” Most Republicans adamantly oppose that idea, believing it would lead to more spending.
    


            “She happened to be right on that. It should be gotten rid of or it should simply be extended,” Trump said. “But that's one of the things it gets taken care of in this bill — that automatically gets extended for a four-year period.”
    


            Elon Musk dodged a question in the Oval Office today about a New York Times report that said the tech billionaire used drugs more extensively than previously known.
    


            Musk interrupted the reporter and questioned the credibility of The Times before saying “let's move on.”
    


            “The New York Times? Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate? Is it the same organization? I think it is,” Musk said. “So I think they, I think the judge just ruled against New York Times for the their lies about the Russiagate hoax, and that they might have to give back their Pulitzer Prize. That New York Times? Let's move on.”
    


What you need to know about the report: The New York Times on Friday reported Musk — who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding under the Department of Government Efficiency — was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities.
    


            The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year.
    


            In a 2024 interview with Don Lemon, Musk acknowledged he took “a small amount” of ketamine to treat negative moods, under a prescription, but that a heavy workload prevented him from using too much. But the Times reports Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar.
    


            CNN has reached out to Musk's representative. Neither Musk nor his lawyer responded to the Times' request for comment about his drug use.
    


            President Donald Trump said Elon Musk is “really not leaving” and that he believes the tech billionaire will still be “back and forth” during remarks from the Oval Office on Musk's final day as a special government employee.
    


            “Elon is really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth. I think, I have a feeling — it's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things,” Trump said as he praised the Tesla CEO's work in the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            The president emphasized that the department's work will continue and praised Musk for delivering what he called a “colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington.”
    


            “But Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history. He's already running one of the most innovative car companies in the world,” the president added. “Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind, too, so they're not leaving,” Trump continued.
    


            During their joint appearance in the Oval Office, Trump presented Musk with a gift as part of his official send-off from federal service. “As a presentation from our country. Thank you, Elon. Take care of yourself,” Trump said as he handed Musk a ceremonial key.
    


Some background: Trump's praise for Musk comes amid recent tension following an interview in which the tech billionaire said he has some “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration but feels “a little stuck in a bind” when disagreements arise, not wanting to publicly speak out against them.
    


            Musk oversaw a massive transformation in the size and scope of the federal government through DOGE, with at least 121,000 federal workers laid off or targeted for layoffs in Trump's first 100 days and thousands more taking buyout offers.
    


            Still, the efforts fell short of his stated goal of saving $1 trillion in government spending.
    


            Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the Oval Office today that he still expects “over time” to achieve his promise that the Department of Government Efficiency will deliver a trillion dollars in cuts to the federal government.
    


            During his time as a “special government employee,” Musk oversaw DOGE's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to vastly reduce federal spending. While he initially boasted that he could cut $2 trillion from the nation's roughly $6.8 trillion federal budget, he eventually walked that back to $1 trillion — and reportedly seemed to lower the total to $150 billion for the coming fiscal year at a Cabinet meeting last month.
    


            Reflecting on his time heading DOGE, the billionaire said identifying cuts takes “a lot of hard work.”
    


            “It's just a lot of work going through the vast expenses of the federal government and just really asking questions,” he said.
    


Continuing role: During his appearance alongside President Donald Trump today, Musk said he still intends to give the president advice even as he closes out his time in the administration.
    


            “I expect to continue to provide advice, whenever the president would like advice,” Musk said in response to a question from a reporter.
    


            “I hope so,” Trump chimed in.
    


            “I expect to remain a friend and an adviser and certainly, if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's service,” Musk added.
    


            President Donald Trump weighed in Friday on a video that appeared to capture French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, pushing his face as he was about to disembark a plane in Hanoi, Vietnam.
    


            Asked for marital advice for his French counterpart, Trump paused before saying, “Make sure the door remains closed.”
    


            Trump appeared to indicate that he spoke to Macron after the incident, which he described as “not good.”
    


            “That was not good. No. I spoke to him and he's fine, they're fine, they're two really good people,” Trump said of the Macrons, with whom he and first lady Melania Trump have spent significant time.
    


            He added, “I don't know what that was all about, but I know them well, they're fine.”
    


            Macron dismissed the situation, telling reporters, “There's a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he would “look at the facts” of the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial before considering a pardon if the music mogul is convicted.
    


            Asked about a potential pardon, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he hasn't been watching the trial closely.
    


            “I haven't seen him, I haven't spoken to him in years,” Trump said about Combs, whom he had called a good friend on his show “The Apprentice.”
    


            “He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics, he sort of, that relationship busted up,” Trump said.
    


            But he later added: “If I think somebody was mistreated, whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact on me.”
    


            President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are appearing together at an event in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that today is Musk's “last day.”



            The tech billionaire announced Wednesday his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” Musk oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, which made major cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to vastly reduce federal spending.
    


            Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday that he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions.
    


            He also has criticized the GOP's “big, beautiful bill” advancing Trump's domestic policy agenda for increasing the deficit.
    


            President Donald Trump announced today that he is removing Kim Sajet as director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing his concerns over her political leanings and support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
    


            “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am herby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery. She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
    


            Sajet, who has led the Smithsonian-affiliated institution since 2013, is the first woman to serve in that role. Trump's statement did not cite specific incidents or provide evidence of partisanship.
    


            Trump did not offer any names or a timeline for a replacement.
    


            CNN has reached out to Portrait Gallery for comment.
    


            The new US ceasefire proposal for an end to hostiles between Israel and Hamas calls for negotiations on a permanent end to the war beginning on day one — and promises President Donald Trump's support in the process.
    


            The proposal, viewed by CNN, includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began.
    


            Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the ceasefire under US envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the proposal. If Israel and Hamas fail to reach an agreement for a permanent ceasefire by the end of the 60-day period, the pause in fighting “may be extended under conditions and for a duration to be agreed upon by the parties so long as the parties are negotiating in good faith,” the proposal says.
    


            But the agreement contains no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, a key Hamas demand, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Instead, the proposal says that Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.”
    


            The US, Egypt and Qatar would guarantee the ceasefire agreement, according to the proposal.
    


                    The proposal also appears to stipulate that Trump would take credit for a deal. “President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement,” it says.
                





            President Donald Trump pushed back against a preliminary report from the Congressional Budget Office that his administration's massive spending bill would add trillions to the deficit, taking to Truth Social to blast the agency today.
    


            He took particular issue with the CBO's estimate that GDP would grow an average of 1.8% annually over the next 10 years.
    


            “The Democrat inspired and ‘controlled' Congressional Budget Office (CBO) purposefully gave us an EXTREMELY LOW level of Growth, 1.8% over 10 years. How ridiculous and unpatriotic is that!” Trump said. “They did the same thing to us in 2017, and we DOUBLED their numbers. The information they recently released is even more absurd and indefensible. I predict we will do 3, 4, or even 5 times the amount they purposefully ‘allotted' to us (1.8%) and, with just our minimum expected 3% Growth, we will more than offset our Tax Cuts (which will, in actuality, cost us no money!).”
    


            Trump's “big, beautiful bill” includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security spending – largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs.
    


            The nonpartisan CBO has estimated that the tax portion of the bill would pile another $3.8 trillion to the deficit. The legislation narrowly passed the House last week, and is now being considered by the Senate, where it will likely face many changes.



            The Trump administration and Chinese officials are discussing setting up a call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, two senior White House officials told CNN, adding that the White House believes a call is the necessary next step to revive trade negotiations.
    


            The two officials said the president is not currently considering re-imposing tariffs of 145% on China if Xi continues to not live up to the commitments struck in Geneva earlier this month.
    


            However, Trump's economic officials have told the president that there are “other tools at our disposal, other ways to hurt China” if the country continues to avoid fully complying with the terms of the deal.
    


            The official said one of main options being considered includes leveraging export controls over Chinese goods, controlled by the Commerce Department.
    


            Trump blasted China in a Truth Social post this morning, saying the country “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today that the White House will not use the conservative Federalist Society to make judicial picks moving forward, blasting what he called “rogue judges” who've blocked the administration's domestic policies.
    


                    “You heard President Trump himself say that the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo have created a broken system for judicial vetting,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown. “What it means is simply this, and nothing more: We're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.”
                





            Trump himself took to Truth Social yesterday to blast former Federalist Society head Leonard Leo as “a real ‘sleazebag'” and a “a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America.”
    


            He added: “I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.”
    


            Miller wouldn't say what checks and balances he believes should be in place to curtail the power of the executive branch, telling CNN, “It is not the job of a district court judge to perform an individual green light or red light on every single policy that the president takes as the head of the executive branch.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN Friday he has no concerns over a New York Times report that Elon Musk used drugs more extensively than previously known.
    


            “I don't have any concerns, but also I believe there's a press conference today with Elon Musk, so everyone will be having an opportunity to ask these questions themselves,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown in an interview.
    


            He quickly pivoted to complimenting Musk's efforts to cut government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            “All I can say is that DOGE has done an extraordinary job rooting out systemic waste, graft, grift, and corruption from the federal government, and you're going to hear from the President today, his thanks to Elon Musk for leading that effort to save taxpayers billions of dollars,” Miller added.
    


            The New York Times on Friday reported that Musk – who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding – was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities.
    


            The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year.
    


            In a 2024 interview with Don Lemon, Musk acknowledged he took “a small amount” of ketamine to treat negative moods, under a prescription, but that a heavy workload prevented him from using too much. But the Times reported that Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar.
    


            CNN has reached out to Musk's representative. Neither Musk nor his lawyer responded to the Times' request for comment about his drug use.
    


            On Friday, Miller – whose wife Katie Miller, a top adviser and spokesperson for DOGE, also left her position and is now working with Musk – wouldn't say if drug testing was required for Musk during his tenure as special government employee.
    


            “The drugs I'm concerned about are the drugs that are coming across the border from the criminal cartels that are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans,” Miller told CNN.
    


            President Donald Trump will travel to Pennsylvania today to tout a partnership between US Steel and the Japan-based Nippon Steel that he says will keep the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.
    


            Trump announced the deal last week on Truth Social, saying it will draw $14 billion in investment toward the US economy and create at least 70,000 jobs.
    


            But Trump's post included few details about what's included in the deal, such as whether this is truly a partnership instead of an acquisition and how much control would remain with US Steel.
    


Some background: Former President Joe Biden blocked the $14.3 billion acquisition during his last week in office. The deal has been controversial since it was first announced in December 2023, with both sides of the political aisle opposing foreign control of a once-key component of US industrial might that has fallen on hard times.
    


            Trump found rare convergence with Biden when he also began his term opposed to an outright deal. But in March, the Trump administration signaled it may allow the deal to go through after it filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit US Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks.
    


            The committee launched a review into the acquisition in April, and submitted a recommendation to Trump on whether any of the measures proposed by the companies would mitigate national security risks, Reuters reported.
    


            Nippon raised its investment pledge in US Steel's operations to $14 billion, which would include a new $4 billion steel mill in the US, if its bid was greenlit, according to Reuters.
    


            The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era parole program that allowed a half million immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to temporarily live and work in the United States.
    


            It was the second time this month that the high court sided with Trump's efforts to revoke temporary legal status for immigrants. The Supreme Court previously cleared the way for the administration to revoke another temporary program that provided work permits to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
    


            The court's brief order was not signed. Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the decision.
    


            Though the emergency decision from the Supreme Court is not final – the underlying legal case will continue in lower courts – the order will allow the administration to expedite deportations for those who had previously benefited from the program.

            Elon Musk said he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions – his latest comments as he exits the administration.
    


                    “It's not like I agree with everything the administration does,” Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday. “So, it's like I agree with much of what the administration does, but we have differences of opinion.”
                





            He continued, “There are things I don't entirely agree with. But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't want to, you know, speak up against the administration, but I don't want to … take responsibility for everything the administration's doing.”
    


            The tech billionaire announced Wednesday his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” Musk oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, which made major cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to reduce federal spending.
    


            Musk also raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by DOGE.
    


            President Donald Trump lashed out against conservative legal activist Leonard Leo yesterday, lambasting the former head of the Federalist Society as “a real ‘sleazebag'” and “a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America,” in a post to his Truth Social platform.
    


            The post followed a three-judge panel – including a judge he appointed to the bench – blocking enforcement of his administration's tariffs Wednesday night. An appeals court the next day temporarily reinstated the administration's powers to levy broad tariffs while the case is pending.
    


            “[Leo] openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court – I hope that is not so, and don't believe it is!” Trump wrote. “In any event, Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own ‘thing.' I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a CNN interview this morning that “we're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.”
    


            Leo and the Federalist Society were instrumental during Trump's first term in assembling a list of conservative judges for judicial appointments. In a 2016 interview, Trump touted his work with the organization, telling a conservative radio host he “actually got the names from the Federalist [Society], and that's considered pretty much the gold standard.”
    


            And in 2019 remarks marking his administration's judicial confirmations, Trump offered effusive praise for Leo's work with the administration on confirming conservative judges.
    


            In a statement responding to Trump's post, Leo wrote: “I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved. There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.”
    


            Still, Trump's ire for the group did not seem to extend to his more recent judicial picks. Of the six judicial nominees he announced Wednesday, two – Ed Artau and Jordan Pratt – are Federalist Society members.
    


            United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Friday he's going to speak with his European Union counterpart next week to discuss an EU trade deal.
    


            “I would say that when it comes to the trade deficit, China is the biggest problem but the EU is right behind them, and when it comes to non-tariff barriers, certainly we have that in China, but we also have that in the EU with respect to their standards on industrial goods and ag (agriculture), where they effectively block a lot of our products,” Greer told CNBC.
    


            “Obviously, with China, you have a geopolitical layer on top of that, where their geopolitical goals are different and at odds with ours, and so that's its own challenge when it comes to the pure economics. I mean, we have problems with all kinds of countries, friend or foe, and we're trying to resolve those.”
    


            Greer said President Donald Trump's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week “went very well,” adding that the EU was “responsive” to trade talks, but criticized the EU for an ongoing trade deficit.
    


            “There is a very long list of problems in US-EU trade, where the EU has enjoyed very broad market access to the United States, and the EU, on its end, has somewhat higher tariffs than the US,” he said. “And they have these non-tariff barriers. … These are things that have gone on for a really long time, and that's why the EU, you know, it's one reason why the EU has a $240 billion surplus with us.”
    


            “It's not because they're competitive — we had come out several months ago saying how the EU is not competitive. So, the fact that they, despite that, managed have a huge surplus with the US certainly shows there's a structural problem there that needs to be resolved,” he added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.

Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.

The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court. 

On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April. 

The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the government's latest inflation reading.




Overall consumer spending — which includes spending on services — rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March. 

The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs. 

“The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. “We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.” 

Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a “last resort.” 

Makeup company E.l.f. Beauty, which sources 75% of its products from China, said earlier this week it would raise its prices by $1 a product starting Aug. 1 to offset the cost of tariffs. 

And on Thursday, warehouse retailer Costco said it has already raised prices for some products, but has held the line on others. The company largely absorbed the duties on pineapples and bananas “because they are key staple items” and “we felt it was important to really eliminate the impact there,” said Gary Millerchip, Costco's chief financial officer. 

But the company did increase prices for flowers from Central and Source America, for example, “because we felt that was something that the member would be able to absorb,” Millerchip added. 

At the same time, incomes — before adjusting for inflation — rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits. 

The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs. 

The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place. 

But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.

Nick Wright shares his dream roster for Team USA's debut in Olympic flag football at the 2028 Games. He breaks down his top NFL players he would choose to represent the country and what this new opportunity means for the sport and the athletes.

After NFL owners approved players to play flag football at the Los Angeles Summer Olympics in 2028 earlier this month, players and fans alike have been dreaming about the potential squad the United States could have. 

However, U.S. men's flag football national team quarterback, Darrell Doucette III, has been firm in his belief that flag football players should not be put aside just because NFL players are now allowed to participate. 

Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce proposed an idea that would help determine which players, flag football or NFL, would represent Team USA in the Olympics.

""Let's just have these (flag football) guys play an NFL team that's picked and may the best team win and represent the USA,"" Kelce said during a recent episode of ""New Heights.""

""I think a coach that is familiar with flag football should select an NFL-represented team. That team should just play this flag football team that's been playing for a long time and feels like they are the best at it, and they don't need other guys. Then whoever wins (goes to the Olympics).""

Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce wondered whether Doucette is ""afraid"" of NFL competition.

""Is this guy afraid of competition?"" Travis said. 

""Have a tryout, and the best players make the team. He's just boxing out other people from joining the sport because they haven't played the specific style of football?""

The United States, led by Doucette, sat on top of the world flag football rankings last year. Regardless of their rankings, Jason is ""really confident"" that NFL players would be better.

""If these guys are the best, they should represent (Team) USA,"" Jason said. ""I don't know anything about flag football, but I feel really confident they're not the best.""

Development comes a day after Bilal Bin Saqib pitched crypto promotion during his US visit

The federal government and the central bank reiterated on Thursday that the use of crypto currencies was illegal and anyone dealing in these currencies was liable to be investigated by the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).

The statements were made by Federal Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Executive Director Sohail Jawad during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance.

The development also came a day after the newly appointed Special Assistant to Prime Minister on crypto and blockchain, Bilal Bin Saqib, made a pitch for the promotion of cryptocurrencies during his visit to the United States.

Crypto is not a legal currency in Pakistan, said Bosal. He recommended that the committee invite the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) for further briefing. SAPM Bilal Bin Saqib is also the chief executive officer of the PCC.

""The work on the crypto currencies is at a very, very preliminary stage and whenever the government decides to take it further, we would recommend to first have a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for it,"" Bosal said, adding that so far, there was no such framework.

Sitting on the committee, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sharmila Faruqi raised the issue of the contradictory policy statements by the government with regard to the promotion of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan.

""There seems to be no legal framework for the cryptocurrencies despite the fact that Pakistan has recently come out of the Financial Action Task Force [FATF] grey list,"" she said.

In reply, Jawad hoped that the PCC would involve other stakeholders to agree on a robust legal and regulatory framework.

Whereas the finance secretary was telling the National Assembly committee that the use of cryptocurrencies was illegal in Pakistan, his ministry was promoting these new currencies through a different set of announcements, at least two of them coming out this week.

Jawad, the SBP executive director, said that in 2018, the central bank had issued instructions to its regulated entities. ""Under these instructions that are still valid, the trading and holding of the crypto currencies is illegal, and these entities are bound to report such cases to the FMU for ongoing investigation by the FIA"", he said.

Earlier in the day, a finance ministry statement quoted Bilal Bin Saqib as saying that the government of Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in Phase 1 for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Bilal Bin Saqib further stated that this would open doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners worldwide. To harness this momentum, Saqib is also leading the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), it added.

The PDAA would be a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future, according to the ministry. However, the committee proceedings revealed a gulf between Pakistan's legal framework and the country's ambitions to go on the path to promoting digital currencies.

The SBP executive director said that there was only one country in the world that declared crypto as legal tender but it too had decided to withdraw the decision. He stated that there were different forms of digital currencies, including bitcoins, stable coins, other coins and non-fungible tokens and all these classes would require a separate set of regulations.

Even if the crypto currencies are banned as legal tenders, it is still being used for sending money overseas, including for buying used cars from Japan, said MNA Usama Mela of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). There is an impression that the government itself was going to mine coins by using the 2000 megawatts of recently allocated electricity, he added.

The committee also inquired about the legal backing of the council to which the finance secretary said that so far, the council was working under the executive orders of the prime minister but the government was planning to bring a law to give it the legal cover.

The way the crypto currencies are promoted in the media by the government, the people have started heavily investing in it that also caused a rise in the prices, said Mirza Ikhtiar Baig of the PPP.

The Finance Ministry said in its press release that Bilal Bin Saqib spoke in front of an elite audience that included the US Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025. Delivering a keynote speech, he unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - and with it, a radically new vision of Pakistan on the global map, the Finance Ministry added.

""Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation - powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,"" Bilal stated.

""I'm not just here as a minister,"" he continued, ""I'm here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.""

Bilal announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin wallet, holding digital assets already in state custody, not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signaling long-term belief in decentralised finance. He also thanked President Donald Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.

Why This Hurricane Season Has Experts on Edge

Predictions for an above-average number of storms, communities that are still recovering and cuts to the National Weather Service have meteorologists and other experts worried about this hurricane season

By Andrea Thompson edited by Dean Visser

June 1 marks the official start of the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean—and once again, the season looks like it will be busy.

Though it is impossible to tell this far in advance exactly when storms will form and where they might hit, the presence of hurricane-friendly environmental conditions this season—along with the federal government cuts and policy chaos—have experts worried about the accuracy of forecasts and the resulting safety of communities. Scientific American asked several forecasters and hurricane researchers what they were most concerned about this year.

Seasonal forecasts—including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's—put the odds in favor of having more storms than average this season, which will last until November 30. NOAA predicts 13 to 19 named storms, meaning those of tropical storm strength (with winds of 39 to 74 miles per hour) or higher. Of those, six to 10 are expected to become hurricanes (with winds of more than 74 mph). And among those hurricanes, three to five are expected to reach major hurricane status—meaning they will have winds that will fall within Category 3 (those of 111 to 129 mph) or a stronger category on the Saffir-Simpson scale.

The expectations of an active season arise from a combination of a favorable atmospheric environment and abundant ocean heat to fuel storms. For one thing, there's no El Niño in place right now to influence winds in a way that tends to shred storms apart, says Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, whose team releases its own seasonal forecast each year.

And waters in the Gulf of Mexico are extremely warm right now, providing ample fuel for the convection that drives tropical cyclones. “Over 60 percent of the Gulf is at record or near-record warmth for the time of year, and waters east of Florida and around the Bahamas are as warm as we've seen them for the start of any hurricane season in the satellite era,” says Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG Local 10 News in Miami. Warm ocean water in these areas can cause storms to rapidly intensify right before landfall, giving communities less time to prepare for the onslaught. This is a major concern for Jill Trepanier, a hurricane researcher at Louisiana State University. “That is just a devastating situation when it occurs,” she says.

It's a situation that has played out many times in recent years, including with Hurricanes Beryl and Milton last season. “The sticky heat of the Gulf is a worrisome trend that's undoubtedly fueling the spate of big hurricane hits along the Gulf Coast over the past decade or so,” Lowry says. “This is consistent with recent research that suggests the Gulf has seen a significant increase over the past 42 years in the number of days where it can support high-end hurricanes.”

Because of that abundant hurricane fuel, “I would not be surprised if we see early-season activity well ahead of the peak” of activity in September, says Marshall Shepherd, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Georgia.

Several experts noted that this year's conditions have some slight differences from the most recent seasons. For one, “the waters of the deep tropical Atlantic east of the Caribbean—often a bellwether for overall hurricane season activity—are the coolest we've seen them to start a hurricane season since 2021,” Lowry says. But, he adds, they are “still plenty warm ... and forecast to remain so, which should favor above-average activity.”

Though the overall message is that this will be a busier-than-normal season, it is not predicted to be quite as busy as those of the past few years. Klotzbach is worried that could lead to complacency. “My biggest concern is that, because the seasonal forecasts are a bit less aggressive than last year..., people may tend to let their guard down,” he says.

Inevitably, each time a new hurricane season begins, some communities are still reeling from storms from the previous year—and often even further back in time. This year “places in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are still recovering from Helene, Milton and Debby,” Shepherd says, citing three of the worst storms of the 2024 season.

A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report released last year warned that the Gulf Coast in particular risked being in “perpetual disaster recovery” mode. The report noted that seven hurricanes struck the region in 2020 and 2021 alone.

It's entirely possible that some of the communities pummeled in recent years could face hurricane peril again this year. “With projections of average to above-average activity, all it takes is one storm to compound an already bad situation for many people,” Marshall says.

Piled atop these concerns is the situation within the federal government, with substantial budget and staffing cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). “It remains to be seen what the impacts of reduced staffing across relevant NOAA offices and agencies will be,” says Brian McNoldy, a tropical storm researcher at the University of Miami. “But any loss of expertise, data collection capabilities and around-the-clock monitoring is troubling during critical, high-impact situations.”

Though the National Hurricane Center (NHC) monitors the development of tropical storms and hurricanes and produces the main forecasts, local NWS offices still play a crucial role in providing more localized warnings about storm surge, flooding and winds. Many offices in hurricane-prone areas are understaffed, says Jeff Masters, a writer at Yale Climate Connections and a former Hurricane Hunter at NOAA. Among those, the NWS's Houston and Miami offices are suffering the largest staff shortages. The NWS has asked staff from other offices to move into some of these open slots.

Lowry and Masters also point out that the cuts have reduced the number of weather balloons launches. Balloon data are crucial for understanding the larger atmospheric patterns that determine where a hurricane will go—and who might need to evacuate or take other precautions.

There is one positive note: “I was very pleased to see the Hurricane Hunters reinstated,” Trepanier says, referring to three of the meteorologists who fly specialized, equipment-laden planes directly into storms to gather data that significantly improve forecasts. “Though it isn't enough to offset the concern, it is a move in a good direction.”

James Franklin, former chief of the NHC's Hurricane Specialist Unit, says he is concerned about trainings for emergency managers that were canceled earlier this year Their absence could leave areas less prepared and less able to know what decisions to make based on forecasts. “When training has to be cut down…, it just makes those kinds of mistakes on the emergency management side more likely to occur,” he says.

Finally, another big worry is simply the government's ability to respond with help for victims when a storm hits. Masters' biggest worry is that FEMA won't “be capable of managing a major disaster right now.”

Reports by CNN and other news outlets have cited internal FEMA memos that report the loss of 30 percent of full-time staff. “I wrote the plan FEMA uses to respond to hurricanes,” says Lowry, a former employee of both the NHC and FEMA, “and it's hard to imagine the agency will be able to meet its mission-critical functions this season with such depleted staffing and without a fully revised plan.”

One of Gigabyte's B650 (AM5) motherboards now lists support for AMD's unreleased and likely soon-to-launch Ryzen 9000G series APUs, as reported by VideoCardz. This suggests that AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9000G APUs will probably be supported on existing 600 and 800 series motherboards, of course, with a necessary BIOS update. That being said, names, specifications, and pricing still remain unconfirmed.

We first heard of AMD's Ryzen 9000G processors in late March, with leakers suggesting they'd employ Gorgon Point silicon. These APUs succeed AMD's incumbent Phoenix-built Ryzen 8000G lineup, which first debuted in January 2024. As for the underlying silicon, there are some nuances since Gorgon Point is rumored to be a refresh of Strix Point (Ryzen AI 300), alleged to offer single-digit performance increments across the board.

Gigabyte has inadvertently published a list of supported memory modules for unreleased Ryzen 9000G APUs on its B650M GAMING WIFI6E motherboard. This marks the second unofficial confirmation that these APUs will slot into existing AM5 motherboards. Nothing is official until AMD gives the official green light, so we'll still mark this as a leak.



In terms of expected specifications, we're looking at up to 12 hybrid cores (4x Zen 5 + 8x Zen 5c) / 24 threads, a 16 Compute Unit equipped graphics engine based on RDNA 3.5, and an XDNA 2 based NPU that can dish out between 50-55 TOPS of AI performance. As such, these could be in the running to power the first desktop Copilot+ PCs, if that badge matters to you. Additionally, leaks suggest a Q4 2025 release timeline for these processors, which is several months off.

Gorgon Point has several tiers (GorgonPoint1, GorgonPoint2, and GorgonPoint3) based on a previous leak. Some of these dies may be recycled further down the stack as Krackan Point silicon. Still, these are just technical nuances as most of these dies are quite similar in terms of features, unlike Phoenix1 and Phoenix2, the latter of which lacked an NPU. This raises the question of whether AMD will scale Krackan even further down to dies that lack NPUs or shift to a monolithic core design.

 May 30, 2025  

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has just updated its child and adolescent immunization schedule in a way that states that parents who want to vaccinate healthy children could do so, based on shared decision making with a clinician.

The agency also updated the adult immunization schedule to say there is “no guidance” on use in pregnancy.

The update for children and adolescents seems to contradict the May 27 announcement on COVID vaccines by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. In a 58-sec video posted to X, Kennedy said the COVID vaccine was “being removed from the CDC-recommended immunization schedule” for healthy pregnant women and also for healthy children. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, said on the video that “there's no evidence healthy kids need it today,” while National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, MD, called the move “good science.”

As of press time, HHS had not issued a formal proposal or written policy to further detail the announcement, but the CDC had change its online immunization schedules.

The see-sawing of the policy announcements — without any public meetings or input — have left clinicians perplexed and fearful about availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy pregnant women and healthy children in advance of what is typically a surge of infections during the summer and fall months in the US. 

Linda Eckert, MD, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington in Seattle, said she was “horrified” when she heard the announcement. “I was just like, why did this happen?” she told Medscape Medical News.

COVID during pregnancy “is dangerous to my patients, and when my patients don't do well, their pregnancies don't do well,” Eckert said. The virus is also very dangerous to infants during the first 6 months of life, “and maternal antibody transfer is the way that those infants are protected,” said Eckert, a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) immunization committee.

The announcement prompts questions, but not many answers, she said. “What are we going to do with our patients? How are we going to have these conversations now?” said Eckert.

“We're all trying to read the tea leaves as to what [Kennedy] really means,” said Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Leaving clinicians, insurers, and patients to guess is “a wholly irresponsible way to do business,” Offit told Medscape. 

Offit said that Kennedy has made no secret of his intent to focus on chronic disease while reducing resources for infectious disease. The Secretary “has for 20 years been an anti-vaccine activist and science denialist,” said Offit. “He's basically doing what he can to tear down the vaccine infrastructure in this country,” he said.

Many professional organizations expressed alarm at Kennedy's announcement. The HHS Secretary bypassed the traditional process for vaccine recommendations, which includes discussion of evidence for safety and effectiveness at open public meetings held by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP then makes a recommendation, which the CDC director approves or disapproves.

“It is concerning that such a significant policy change was made unilaterally outside an open, evidence-based process with no regard for the negative impact this will have on millions of Americans,” said Tina Tan, MD, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in a statement.

“By removing the recommendation, the decision could strip families of choice,” said Sean O'Leary, MD, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement. “Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear,” he said. “It's also unclear whether healthcare workers would be eligible to be vaccinated.”

O'Leary said that the evidence shows that pregnant women, infants, and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID and that the vaccine's safety “has been widely demonstrated.”

“Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed,” said ACOG President Steven J. Fleischman, MD, in a statement. Most infants under the age of 6 months who are hospitalized for COVID are born to unvaccinated mothers, said Fleschman. Kennedy's announcement may mean pregnant people are less likely to choose to vaccinate, he said. “We are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future,” said Fleischman.

Jason M. Goldman, MD, president of the American College of Physicians, agreed. “The HHS announcement will likely further erode public confidence in the safety of these vaccines, despite the evidence demonstrating their benefits,” he said, in a statement. Goldman also said the policy change has “the potential to threaten insurance coverage for COVID vaccines and boosters, increasing the cost and placing them out-of-reach of individuals who do still want to be vaccinated.” 

Uptake of the vaccine has been waning, even with insurance coverage. 

According to CDC's COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard, 14% of pregnant women had received the 2024-25 vaccine. As of late March, just under 13% of children 6 months-to-17 years had received the vaccine, the CDC reported at the ACIP's last meeting in April.

Children under 6 months have the second highest COVID-related hospitalization rates, comparable to those of adults aged 64-75; only adults aged 75 or older have higher rates, the CDC has reported. A fifth of 1000 hospitalized infants with COVID-19 during a 2-year period were admitted to an intensive care unit; nine died while hospitalized. Vaccination of mothers has led to a decline in hospitalizations, however, said the agency. Even so, 96 children under age 4 and 56 aged 5-17 died from COVID from September 2023 to August 2024, said CDC officials at the last ACIP meeting.

COVID's dangers during pregnancy have been documented in many studies. Researchers from George Washington University in Washington, DC, reported in a 2023 paper that pregnant women with COVID-19 experienced 7 times greater risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth, 3 times greater risk of being admitted to the ICU, 23 times greater risk of developing pneumonia, and 5 times greater risk of thromboembolic disease.

Eckert said that, despite the dangers, fewer patients have been opting for vaccination over the last few years “because people view COVID as less of a threat.” She still talks to patients about protection. The new recommendation is going to make it more difficult to help patients stay safe, she said.

Meanwhile, as reported by Medscape, the FDA announced earlier in May that it would be calling for more studies of COVID vaccines in healthy Americans and that it would recommend against approval except for individuals with a long list of conditions that put them at risk for more severe disease. One of those conditions is pregnancy or recent pregnancy.

The COVID vaccine announcements are “at the least, confusing for patients,” Eckert said. 

It is not clear whether anyone can or will challenge the HHS policy announcement.

Normally, not even a CDC director would circumvent the ACIP's process, said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. Currently, there is no acting CDC director, she said, adding that it appears that Kennedy has stepped into the role, as he reportedly approved an ACIP recommendation on a chikungunya vaccine.

While Kennedy is not violating a statute or regulation with his COVID vaccine announcement, a court could find that the decision is “arbitrary and capricious” because it was offered without evidence or a rationale, said Reiss. “These decisions are generally written out with references and a lot of data. They didn't do that,” Reiss told Medscape.

Eventually, someone might legally challenge the policy, but it could take a while, said Reiss. The policy “will have to hurt someone” for someone to make a case, she said.

Reiss and Offit pointed out that vaccines could be prescribed off-label for groups that are not covered by any of the HHS recommendations.

“Probably 70% of the drugs on our formulary are not necessarily approved for pediatrics,” said Offit. But off-label use comes with its own set of headaches, he said. Clinicians might have to seek prior authorization from insurers, for instance.

When asked whether the administration might just remove approvals altogether for COVID vaccines, Offit responded that with Kennedy in charge, “anything is possible.”

Offit reports no relevant financial relationships. Eckert disclosed that she is the author of “Enough,” a book that calls for greater cervical cancer screening.

Bayern Munich could inject some revenue into its coffers this summer...

Bayern Munich supervisory board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was asked about club CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen's recent statements that winning the Club World Cup is a goal for the team and reiterated that is exactly what the squad is intending to do. 

“I think that's the right attitude. If we just take it easy because everyone wants to go on vacation as quickly as possible, nothing will come of it. Jan is right to set the bar so high, and our team has to jump over the bar,” Rummenigge told Sport Bild (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). 

When asked that the $30 million award for participating would do for the club, Rummenigge almost scoffed at the notion that it could make a big impact. However, when talking about the €100 million overall prize for winning, the executive sounded at least a little more enthused before pushing for football to have a salary cap.

“With just under €30 million, you can't really show off on the transfer market these days,” Rummenigge said with a laugh. “But even with over €100 million as tournament winner in the best case scenario, spread over four years, you can't be a ‘big player' on the transfer market. We shouldn't make the mistake of only looking at the money. On the contrary: We should introduce a kind of salary cap in all leagues that would lead to clubs operating more healthily.”

PARIS -- The New York Mets are hiring the person who oversees the US Open tennis tournament, Lew Sherr, as their new president of business operations.

Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA on Friday; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.

""For right now, my focus is the smoothest possible transition,"" Sherr said in an interview with The Associated Press at the French Open. ""But I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they're trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.""

Steve Cohen is among the bidders for three casino licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission and has been lobbying to have the state legislature reclassify the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field, also near the facility that hosts the US Open, from parkland to commercial land for a gaming facility.

The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations Tuesday; he was in that post since December 2023. Chief legal officer Katie Pothier, chief marketing officer Andy Goldberg, chief communications officer Nancy Elder and senior vice president of finance Peter Woll have left since November.

The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer.

In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in US Open attendance, sponsorships and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights.

""We've taken some big swings,"" Sherr said Friday, ""and thankfully, they're paying off.""

Just last week, he spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's US Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin.

""It's bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things -- and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,"" Sherr said. ""I'm leaving sleeping well at night, knowing (the USTA) is going to be well looked after.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"
