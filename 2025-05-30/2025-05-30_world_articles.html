                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent. Local media reported two loud bangs, followed by temporary road closures and emergency vehicles seen in the area, but did not mention anything about a military base. Desantnaya Bay is located in Vladivostok in Russia's Far East, which lies some 185 kilometres (114 miles) from the Russian-North Korean border. Ukraine is ready to attend the second round of peace talks with the Russian delegation in Istanbul on June 2, but seeks to receive a draft of Russia's proposed ceasefire memorandum before the meeting, said Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak on May 29. Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials. Kyiv insists on receiving the memorandum ahead of the new round of talks in order to understand Russia's proposed steps toward a ceasefire. Ukraine has already submitted its own document to the Russian side. This means it is important to receive Russia's draft. Security advisors from the four countries are expected to attend the second round of peace talks in Istanbul, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said. The U.S. Senate is expected to "start moving" next week on a bill introducing sweeping new sanctions against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said at a press briefing in Kyiv on May 30 attended by The Kyiv Independent. The proposed bill would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products. At least 82 U.S. senators are prepared to vote for the bill, Graham said. "I would expect next week that the Senate will start moving the sanctions bill," Graham, a vocal supporter of Ukraine and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said. President Trump said that the next two-week period will be outcome-determined." Asked whether Congress would pass the bill before its summer recess and whether Trump would sign it, Graham responded: "I've never been more optimistic than I am today." The senator dismissed the upcoming June 2 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks in Istanbul, where Moscow is expected to present a draft ceasefire memorandum, as unlikely to yield progress. "I see nothing about the meeting on Monday in Istanbul to give me any hope at all that Russia is interested in peace," he said. "So there's a card game going on this summer. Graham accused Moscow of stalling while ramping up its war effort and warned that the U.S. response would be swift and severe. "China, the game you're playing with Russia is about to change. If you keep buying cheap Russian oil to fuel Putin's war machine, there will be a 500% tariff on all of your products coming into the United States," he said. He added that "70% of Russian oil is bought by China and India." Russia is prepared to consider a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine, but only if Kyiv stops receiving Western weapons and halts mobilization, Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's envoy to the United Nations, said on May 30, according to the Russian state news agency TASS. "In principle, we are ready to consider the possibility of establishing a ceasefire, which would subsequently allow for a sustainable resolution of the root causes of the conflict," Nebenzya said at a U.N. Security Council meeting. The Russian ambassador said that any ceasefire would require Western governments to end their support for Ukraine's armed forces. Despite the stated offer, Nebenzya also pledged that Moscow would "continue and intensify military operations for as long as necessary." Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the remarks a "slap in the face to all who advocate for peace," including countries like China and Brazil, which have pressed both sides to end the war. "When the entire world insists that it is time to stop the killing immediately and engage in meaningful diplomacy, Russia uses the highest fora to spew such belligerent rhetoric," Sybiha wrote on X. "We insist that the pressure on Moscow be increased already now. They do not understand normal attitude or diplomatic language; it is time to speak to them in the language of sanctions and increased support for Ukraine." Despite growing global calls for a truce, Russia has so far rejected Ukraine's U.S.-backed proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The Kremlin has instead escalated its aerial assaults across Ukrainian territory and is reportedly preparing a new summer offensive. Russian President Vladimir Putin is "fundamentally in favor" of meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 30, according to Russian state news agency TASS. The statement comes amid renewed diplomatic maneuvering to schedule the next round of peace talks in Istanbul, tentatively proposed for June 2. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on May 30 that Turkey would be open to hosting a possible meeting among the three leaders, with the participation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well. Fidan's statement followed his visits to both Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky previously invited Putin to Istanbul for direct talks on May 16, proposing a three-way format with Trump to push forward peace efforts. Putin declined to attend, sending a low-level delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. The Kremlin has repeatedly attacked Zelensky's legitimacy as president, pointing out that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. As a result, Zelensky's term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president's call for a policy of “remigration” has been embraced by far right groups in Europe. Eight months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly called for a policy of “remigration” — a term that's become a rallying cry among far-right groups in Europe and sparked comparisons to ethnic cleansing — the U.S. State Department said Thursday that it plans to create an office devoted to the project, with refugee aid resources diverted to Trump's rapidly accelerating mass deportation campaign. Trump first called for a “remigration” program in September 2024 ahead of the presidential election, saying he would “return Kamala [Harris]'s illegal migrants to their home countries” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. The comment came amid his attacks on Haitian legal residents in Springfield, Ohio and Venezuelan migrants, claiming the U.S. was under an “invasion” and saying he would “ship them back to their country.” The term has been embraced by far-right groups in Europe including Alternative for Germany and Austria's Freedom Party, which called for the European Union to appoint a remigration commissioner last year. Remigration policy has long been promoted by Austrian far-right activist Martin Sellner, who had communications with the white supremacist who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. On his website, Wired reported on Thursday, Sellner “lays out a three-phase plan to implement remigration” that includes “striking similarities to Trump's current immigration policies”: Sellner's website also lists a number of “tools” that can be used to achieve remigration, which includes “stop family reunification” — something Trump was doing even in his first term in office. Far-right lawmakers and activists from the U.S., Germany, Ireland, and France were among more than 400 attendees at the first-ever Remigration Summit near Milan earlier this month. The State Department is planning to open the Office of Remigration as the administration ramps up its mass deportation operations, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller informing immigration officials last week that federal agents should begin arresting 3,000 immigrants per day — tripling numbers from earlier this year. The push has coincided with mandates for federal law enforcement agents to assist in raids and arrests and the targeting of people at formerly protected locations like courthouses. “They are desperate to reach a certain number of arrests per day. The Washington Post reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement in more than 20 states have been directed to arrest people at courthouses during court proceedings. “That is not the way Americans want and understand our judicial system to work. Gupta said the administration is “doubling down” on its “illusion that they had been given a broad mandate to effectuate an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.” Less than a third of Americans in a March Gallup poll agreed with Trump's stated goal of removing all undocumented immigrants from the United States; those who said “some” undocumented immigrants should be deported said that committing violent crimes should be a prerequisite for removal. “Public polling is showing decreasing support for Trump's immigration agenda,” said Gupta, “as Americans wake up to the reality that mass deportation means arrests of our neighbors and friends, masked agents in our communities, and people afraid to go to work and show up to school, in ways that undermine our local economies.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Organizers protested the Canadian government's planned investment into militarization at a weapons fair this week. Organizers protested the Canadian government's planned investment into militarization at a weapons fair this week. For just $61 billion, Canada can get in on Donald Trump's latest scheme: a space-based North American missile defense system that Trump has called the “Golden Dome.” Trump's plan revives a version of Ronald Reagan's spaced-based missile plan, popularly known as “Star Wars.” In a brief written in March 2025 for The Simons Foundation for Nuclear Disarmament, Ernie Regehr, senior fellow in Arctic security and defense, argues, “The new iteration of strategic missile defence in the form of the Golden Dome is every bit as ambitious (and just as unrealistic) as was Reagan's Star Wars.” While the throne speech didn't mention the Golden Dome plan, it did show that Canada is hoping to play to both London and Washington for military alliances. And it will invest to strengthen its presence in the North, which is an integral part of Canada, as this region faces new threats.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that joining ReArm Europe will reduce Canada's reliance on the United States. Carney told CBC's “Power and Politics”: “We're spending over 75 cents on every dollar of capital spending for defense that goes to the United Space. What's better if we spend more at home, have diversified partnerships.” By joining ReArm, Carney says that Canada would “become part of a very big build-out of [Europe's] defense industrial base, which will have big benefit for jobs in Canada.” The throne speech did not explicitly name Golden Dome, but that doesn't mean that Carney is publicly opposed to deeper integration with the United States around missile defense. “Is it a good idea for Canada?” Carney said. “Yes, it's a good idea to have protection against missiles in place for Canadians.” The Prime Minister's Office did not respond to two requests for comment. Rachel Small, Canadian organizer for World BEYOND War, says that Carney's apparent support for joining the Golden Dome program is confusing, given that Carney's election victory was thanks in no small part to “a promise to disentangle Canada's military from the U.S.… That's clearly his mandate. “I was quite shocked, to be honest,” Small told Truthout, “because it seemed unthinkable to me that at literally the same moment that Trump is trying to ramp up economic aggression, maybe annexationist threats against Canada, that we would consider partnering with them on hundreds of billions of dollars of new military projects, let alone one that will literally antagonize military powers around the world.” Small argues that the real security threats that need to be addressed do not come from abroad: “If we take an honest look, the biggest security threats facing Canada — literally the forces that risk killing the largest number of humans in this country — then it's clearly climate change, ecological collapse, disease epidemics, public health emergencies and poverty coupled with the ballooning cost on housing and food.” She says that spending money on war readiness rather than what Canadians need is “a slap in the face of everyone in Canada who is struggling to get by.” Carney's desire to spend more money on North American security alongside the United States feels like an about-face from where Carney was just a few months ago. Small points to Carney revisiting the F-35 contract as an example of a decision Carney makes when he is trying to gain favor from the Canadian population. “I don't think the Canadian public is with them on [expanding military spending]. It was the first time that Canada's newly minted minister of defense made public comments. In front of Canada's arms industry, David McGuinty took aim at Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and promised to triple defense spending by 2030. He reiterated Canada's desire to join ReArm Europe though did not mention the Golden Dome. Ottawa police said that they arrested 11 protesters, just before 11 am on May 28. The group, which included the Palestinian Youth Movement, Labour for Palestine and Independent Jewish Voices, is calling for an immediate two-way arms embargo on Israel, an end to the planned construction of a new weapons facility in Ottawa and redirection of military spending to health care, housing, education and climate justice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wiles' contacts on her personal cellphone were purportedly hacked and AI used to communicate with lawmakers The FBI is investigating an apparent impersonator who pretended to be the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, in texts and calls to her contacts, including prominent Republicans. Wiles has privately informed colleagues that the contacts in her personal cellphone were hacked, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, and has been asking people to disregard messages and calls that aren't coming from her phone number. Wiles also has a government phone that wasn't affected by the hack. In another case, Wiles' impersonator asked for a cash transfer, according to the report. Some requests came off as suspicious as they contained questions about Donald Trump that Wiles would know, and had broken grammar in other cases. Contacts who spoke to the Journal anonymously said that some of the calls came from a voice that sounded like Wiles, leading some to believe that an impersonator is using artificial intelligence to mimic Wiles' voice. Earlier this month, Trump demoted his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who mistakenly added Goldberg to the group chat. The US president has largely dismissed privacy concerns and said that Signalgate was “not a big deal”. Reporting has also revealed that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has shared details about a Yemen strike on a separate group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a reception at the International French School in Singapore on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron warned the U.S. and a large audience of Indo-Pacific countries Friday night that they risk a dangerous double standard as they concentrate on a potential conflict with China if that shift comes at the cost of abandoning Ukraine. He warned that abandoning Ukraine would eventually erode U.S. credibility in deterring any potential conflict with China over Taiwan. In a speech that emphasized France's tight ties to the Indo-Pacific, Macron said that any shifts to developing a more hard-line deterrent stance in the region is still tied to how the world – and particularly the West – treats other critical issues, including climate change and Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza. Ukraine keeps Russia guessing over its participation in June 2 peace talks “If you consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what would happen in Taiwan, what would you do the day something happened in” the Philippines? Both Europe and those same Indo-Pacific nations also find themselves increasingly pulled between the competing interests of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,” Macron said, in an apparent jab at Trump. Opinion: Strengthening Canada's relationship with Taiwan is a crucial piece of our geopolitical puzzle China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking it by force. The delegation was expected to speak Saturday on a panel on “co-operative maritime security” alongside representatives from Japan, Vietnam, Chile and the U.K. – notable in that China's aggressive global fisheries tactics have been a regular topic of concern not only in the Indo-Pacific but as far away as Latin America and the Arctic. “We can't account for whether China engages or not. And we will be here,” Hegseth said as he met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro.

The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France, which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kiwi Zhang, a computer science student from China, was full of hope for his academic future in the United States – until his visa was revoked at the US border last week. According to Zhang, he was detained at the border for 48 hours by US officials, who confiscated his phone and laptop, and searched his belongings. He said they questioned him about his ties to the Chinese Communist Party and meetings with friends while in China. He is now back in China and mulling his next steps. “I never imagined this could happen to me,” said Zhang, who – like everyone CNN spoke to for this story – asked to use a pseudonym and that CNN conceal specific identifying details out of fear of retaliation. “I didn't know things would get this extreme after Donald Trump returned to office. Now, many Chinese students studying in the US fear they could meet the same fate, after President Trump's administration vowed on Wednesday to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.” Student chat groups lit up with messages of disbelief. Many students aired their frustration and anger on social media. At a regular news conference Thursday, China's foreign ministry accused the Trump administration of using ideology and national security as a “pretext” for the “politically motivated and discriminatory” move. “What strikes me is how tiny individuals are in the tide of history – career plans can collapse overnight,” said Joyce, who received an offer from her dream school, Harvard, to pursue a master's degree in architecture. Her visa from her undergraduate program in the US is still valid for another year, but she did not dare to return to China for the summer, worrying that she might be denied reentry at the US border. For decades, China's brightest minds have flocked to America, as their home country played catch-up with the world's leading superpower. Until last year, Chinese students made up the largest group of international students in the US, contributing significantly to the economy and helping America maintain its competitive edge in scientific research and technological innovation. But as strategic rivalry between the two nations intensifies, mistrust has deepened. Both sides have ramped up national security measures and grown more protective of their advanced technologies – particularly in sensitive sectors with military implications. During his first term in 2020, Trump introduced a ban that effectively denied US visas to graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military. Within just three months, more than 1,000 Chinese nationals had their visas revoked, and the order remained in place under former President Joe Biden. It's unclear how quickly or widely the new revocations will be carried out. But the fear is palpable in CNN's interviews with Chinese students. Studying in a country that has long held itself up as a beacon of freedom, many were too afraid to speak openly under their real names – a fear all too familiar to those back in China. They include David Yang, whose heart sank when he saw Rubio's announcement. “This is just too surreal,” said the second-year PhD student in theoretical chemistry at a top university in the Midwestern US. In recent weeks, Yang has found it nearly impossible to focus on his research, simulating how molecules interact with each other in the human body. Instead, he's been glued to the news, anxiously tracking Trump's escalating war on elite universities and international students, trying to gauge whether he might land in the crossfire. Although a federal court has since blocked the move, the State Department soon followed with a diplomatic cable instructing US embassies and consulates worldwide to halt new student visa appointments. As Yang scrolled through the headlines, periods of anxiety would suddenly hit, and he found himself compulsively refreshing news sites over and over. “The constant policy changes bring so much uncertainty into our lives. His major could well fall under what Rubio called “critical fields” and – like millions of Chinese students – he's a member of the Communist Youth League, a youth branch of the 99-million-strong Communist Party for those aged between 14 and 28. In China, most students are Youth League members by the time they finish high school, or have party members among family and friends – thanks to the party's ubiquity across government and business, as well as cultural and social sectors. They then questioned him about his own affiliation with the Communist Youth League, he said. The Communist Youth League charges us seven or eight yuan (about $1) a year, but there are no activities at all. Facing potential deportation in the middle of their hard-won education, some Chinese students are considering other options. “Me and my parents are all praying that I won't be banned from entering the country in June,” she said. Liu was drawn to the US by its academic freedom and resources. But if the hardline visa policy continues, she might consider transferring to another university in Europe or Hong Kong. “I am very determined to study mathematics and there are also many excellent math resources in other countries, such as in France,” she said. Like many Chinese students, Liu comes from a middle-class family. Her parents saved for years for her to attend college in the US, where tuition and living costs can run to more than $80,000 – much more than getting a degree in Europe or Asia. Nelson Urena Jr., co-founder and director of college counseling at an education management firm in Shanghai, said that for years many Chinese families saw American universities as the “gold standard” for college education. Since around 2018, however, he has noticed more interest from students and parents alike in universities in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, as well as the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong. “A lot of families were concerned legitimately about their children's safety, and then also just the rhetoric of, you know, whether they're welcome in the US,” he said, citing issues such as gun violence and racist hostility or even violence against Asian people. “More recently, I think people are starting to see the growing disconnect between the US and China, and feeling like maybe things are going to be more difficult for them – from getting the visa to making payments for tuitions.” Rubio's announcement Wednesday also vowed to “revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications” from China, including Hong Kong. Since then, Urena has been inundated by phone calls from anxious students preparing to start their college education in the US. But he didn't have a ready response for them. The students are trying to figure out what to do…The options are very limited at this point – Do they do a gap year? Nevertheless, for some Chinese parents, the allure of American higher education has not worn off. Arno Huang, a 56-year-old businessman from China's coastal Fujian province, still wants to send his kids to the US for graduate schools after they finish undergraduate studies in Hong Kong. Although US-China relations are currently strained, smart people still recognize this fact,” said Huang. Having kids studying in the US gives a family “face,” he said, using a common Chinese phrase to refer to good reputation or social standing. Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a non-government think tank in Beijing, lamented a seemingly bygone era, when Chinese officials, entrepreneurs and scientists alike were trained in the US – especially those who played key roles during China's reform and opening-up era that began in 1978.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics warn the experiment will lead to low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime Yet on 1 June, it and the rest of Mexico will start to elect every judge in the country, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, by popular vote. It is a world-first democratic experiment, but one that has prompted warnings of low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime. Morena claims its reform will address these issues by making the judiciary more responsive to popular opinion. But critics say it will bulldoze the separation of powers, and that by throwing the doors open to less qualified candidates whose campaigns may be backed by opaque interests – including organised crime groups – it could aggravate the very problems it seeks to solve. Delia Quiroa, a well-known advocate for Mexico's disappeared, is no fan of the reform. It is just the latest unexpected turn in a life that was shattered the moment her brother, Roberto, was disappeared on 10 March 2014. Though born in Culiacán, Quiroa moved to the border state of Tamaulipas when she was a child. She had been studying to become an engineer, but as the years stretched on with no sign of her brother, she retrained as a lawyer to force the authorities into action. Threats from criminal groups eventually displaced her family to Mexico City. Then last year they moved back to Sinaloa, which for years had been relatively calm owing to the dominance of the eponymous cartel. In July 2024, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained by US authorities along with one of Guzmán's sons after a small plane touched down in Texas. Now a faction led by El Mayo's son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo who remain free in Mexico. As the conflict enters a ninth month, it has left well over 2,000 dead or disappeared. And it has made the judicial elections even more complicated. Friends and family came along, handing out pamphlets with her logo: a spade and a gavel crossed over the scales of justice. “That the only thing I want is a change in this country.” But as Quiroa bounced between market stalls, people's responses did nothing to dispel fears of an uninformed vote come 1 June. Unlike in other elections, parties cannot support candidates, nor can candidates openly profess a partisan affiliation, even if they clearly have one. Radio and TV spots are also banned, meaning largely unknown candidates are limited to handing out flyers and posting on social media. “I'm not going to vote for candidates I don't know,” said one shoe shiner, who was reading a dog-eared biography of the 19th-century president Benito Juárez. Even though Morena is not allowed to back candidates, many assume the ruling party will use its unrivalled capacity to mobilise voters to help its preferred candidates – particularly for the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena's executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line. “They don't want to leave a crumb for anyone else.” But other interests, including organised crime, may also seize the opportunity. Defensorxs, a civil society organisation, has identified various “highly risky” candidates, including a lawyer who was counsel to El Chapo and a former state prosecutor in Michoacán accused of alleged involvement in the murder of two journalists. “I don't think people have managed to find out who the candidates are and what each kind of position actually does,” said Marlene León Fontes of Iniciativa Sinaloa, a civil society organisation. “People will vote on the basis of personal connections or political parties. If Quiroa emerges a judge, she says she will be an “iron fist” against corrupt and negligent authorities – not least when it comes to searching for the more than 120,000 people registered as disappeared, and identifying the 72,000 bodies in Mexico's morgues. “It was the feeling of being tortured by the authorities who should be protecting me that made me put myself forward as a candidate,” said Quiroa. Yet as far as Quiroa knows, she is the only candidate to have emerged from the many thousands searching for their relatives. “And we don't know how it's going to go.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot depends on the circumstances under which you try to define or feel your own loneliness. In fact, I considered myself an anti-militarist — and still do. Yet, I see no contradiction between that and being proudly a senior lieutenant in the Armed Forces. Within three and a half months of participating in the liberation of the Kyiv Oblast and other operations further east, half of my platoon — eight of my subordinates and I — was captured by Russian forces in Luhansk Oblast. What followed were two years and four months of Russian captivity. I was a prisoner of war, held the entire time in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory — the very region we were defending. For some reason, keeping me as a POW wasn't enough — perhaps because they learned I was a journalist and human rights activist. The following year, I was sentenced as a “war criminal” to 13 years in a penal colony for supposed heinous crimes. The only evidence against me was a confession — extracted under duress. I prefer that phrasing, as it avoids the word “torture.” Naturally, I'm incredibly happy to be free. But it also breaks my heart — almost everyone I spent those years with in captivity, except for two, are still there. And of my own platoon, four remain incarcerated. As a former POW, when you're released and return to your native city — Kyiv, which I've never loved more — you meet hundreds, even thousands, of wonderful people, joyful to see you free. I felt an overwhelming lightness, warmth, and happiness. And yet, at the same time, I understood — and so did many of them — that something fundamental had changed between us. I've been to places and seen things they never have — and I hope they never will. But I also realized that our worldviews had diverged. Most of them, when they thought about it — without any prompting — said, “No, we don't know what you went through.” And that's true for every former prisoner of war or civilian detainee. This is what distinguishes a war veteran or a civilian under occupation from everyone else. It's a strange thing, to feel lonely in such a significant — perhaps even defining — part of your life. But it's a kind of chosen loneliness, because you don't want others to feel what you felt. In captivity, our guards deliberately tried to inflict another kind of loneliness. They worked to break us — morally, psychologically, and yes, physically. Especially in the first several months, we were held incommunicado, with no contact with the outside world. They repeatedly told us: “You've been abandoned. Other Ukrainian POWs came to hear me say it out loud: “We are not forgotten.” That kind of destructive loneliness didn't work. The loneliness I felt after my release was of a different kind. They had written letters, led campaigns, given interviews, and posted on social media. In the final months of my captivity, I learned there was a campaign of solidarity for me — but I couldn't have imagined the scale of it. After my release, I kept meeting strangers who had participated in it. I had plenty of time in captivity to reflect. My first degree is in philosophy — it never fades. I began to grasp how much I am human — at my best — because of others. I recently returned from an advocacy trip across Europe, specifically within the EU. And I felt something many Ukrainians abroad have shared with me — being in a peaceful country untouched by what we've endured for more than three years now. Watching groups of young people rushing through their day-to-day lives. I was so happy to see people living in normalcy. They should not endure what we're living through. War is a state of profound dehumanization. People aren't meant to live through it. I was glad to see them. I had this urge to walk up to someone, shake them, and say, “You don't know what's happening. We've lived through something I sincerely hope no other community or country will ever have to experience. And as terrible as it sounds, I want us to be alone in that experience. Because if we're not, it means we failed to defend ourselves, and others had to share this tragedy with us. I would hope we rather remain lonely in that regard. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise. Will you help us do it?</p>

MOSCOW, May 30. /TASS/. Direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin, his US counterpart Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky on the Ukrainian settlement can only take place after results in negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

"Putin has repeatedly said that he is fundamentally in favor of high-level contacts, which are certainly needed, but they must be prepared, and results must first be achieved in direct negotiations between the delegations of the two countries beforehand. If such results are achieved, and when they are achieved, then, of course, there may be talk of high-level contacts," the spokesman said.

This was how Peskov commented on the words of Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's words. The top diplomat expressed hope that Russia and Ukraine would complete the technical stage of negotiations on June 2. Afterwards, a meeting of the leaders of Turkey, the US, Russia, and Ukraine could be held.</p>

LUGANSK, May 30. /TASS/. By advancing in areas between the Belgorod and Kharkov regions, Russian troops have started to establish a new sector of the buffer zone in this direction, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

Since Russian forces liberated Stroyevka, which is situated near the Russian border, on May 29, they have built on their successes as they advance both north and south of this locality, he said.

"Meanwhile, our fighters have been clearing the border areas. Besides, pressure has intensified on the Ukrainian positions near Otradnoye and Bologovka. From this, we can conclude that a new sector of the buffer zone between the Belgorod and Kharkov regions is currently being established," Marochko concluded.</p>

The ceasefire development comes at an intense time in Gaza where people are desperate to obtain food. UN agencies have been warning that people there are at risk of famine. Last Friday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict.” He said that after a nearly 80-day blockade, Israel had allowed “finally, a trickle” of aid to cross over. The agency said that according to initial reports, two people died and several were injured. However, the Associated Press, citing hospital staff, reported that four people were killed. It added that it has warned of “alarming and deteriorating conditions” in Gaza and the risks imposed by limiting humanitarian aid to hungry people who are desperate for help. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel has signed off on the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Last week, Israel ended its blockade on humanitarian goods and allowed trucks carrying life-saving aid to enter the enclave. Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN's aid co-ordination office, has said that Israel is trying to bypass its system run by 15 UN aid organizations and 200 NGOs and partners. He warned before the new aid distribution system was launched that it appeared to be “a deliberate attempt to weaponize the aid.” He said aid should be provided based on need. An Israeli tank is used in Gaza, near the Israel-Gaza border, on May 29.Amir Cohen/Reuters Humanitarian aid organizations held a press conference on Parliament Hill Thursday criticizing the new aid distribution method, saying it politicizes an already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Oxfam Canada's director of international programs, Erin Kiley, said the new mechanism gives Israel power over who receives aid, where and from whom, turning relief into a tool of coercion. “These actions undermine international humanitarian law and set a precedent for occupying powers to dictate the terms of aid based on political agendas and military goals,” she said. The UN said this week its human-rights office received information that at least 47 people were injured Tuesday while trying to obtain aid. A spokesperson for GHF said the report of injuries is “completely false” and that GHF “has had no major injuries or deaths since we started operations on Tuesday.” GHF said that “misinformation” is circulating online and sought to clarify that no shots have been fired at Palestinian crowds at their distribution sites, nor have there been casualties. The company said in a statement that it continued its operations Thursday at three distribution sites and that they have plans to build more across Gaza, including in the north. “This is not going to work,” he said of the new aid distribution model.
