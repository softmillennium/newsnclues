                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ – Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber believes the FIFA Club World Cup this summer has been an “absolute terrific success,” and has set the stage for an exciting World Cup 2026 next summer. Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain and English Premier League standouts Chelsea will play in the Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium. And I think I'm pleased to see that three of our teams were part of that story,” Garber told USA TODAY Sports on Friday, July 11. “I think it did what it was intended to do – to launch something new, take some risk, show some courage, and then set the stage for 2026, which will be another example of soccer and football at its very best. While Seattle and LAFC were unable to win any of their three group-stage matches, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami helped clinch the first win by a North American club against a European side when they beat FC Porto in Atlanta on June 19. Inter Miami was eliminated by PSG in the Round of 16, which created a dream matchup for FIFA and MLS – Messi faced his former team in a game that would never be played outside of a friendly before the Club World Cup. Garber said there have been at least 3 million people who attended soccer matches this summer, watching either the Club World Cup or the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer. MLS games have also been ongoing following the group stages in both tournaments, and Garber believes another “half a million” people are expected to attend Leagues Cup matches when the tournament between MLS and LIGA MX clubs from Mexico begins later this month. “I think all of us at MLS for a generation now have been trying to build what we call ‘a real soccer nation' – a country that has strong understanding of the sport, and supports their local clubs, supports their national teams, comes out and passionately celebrates like the rest of the world. “I think Club World Cup was a great platform to tell that story. I hope to see it come back,” Garber added. MLS – which is celebrating its 30th season in 2025 – helped FIFA promote and market the event, while seven MLS training facilities hosted club practices, and four of the league's soccer-specific stadiums hosted select matches during the tournament. We showed the world that this country is a soccer nation with passionate fans, and spectacular stadiums, and a knowledgeable fan base,” Garber said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He brands playing conditions in US as ‘very dangerous' Enzo Fernández has said that the high temperatures at the Club World Cup are dangerous and revealed that he needed to lie down during Chelsea's win over Fluminense because the heat left him feeling “really dizzy”. Thunderstorms have caused delays to games, and teams have also had to deal with mid-afternoon kick-offs in intense heat. Temperatures were high when Chelsea faced Fluminense at 3pm in the first semi-final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last Thursday. Local authorities had issued a heat warning and Fernández, who was conducting media duties before Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final, saying that he needed treatment in the second half will heap pressure on Fifa to consider late kick-off times at the 2026 World Cup. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?” Levi Colwill agreed that the heat has led to slower games. “If you turn the game into a basketball match in this heat, it's not going to help anyone,” the Chelsea centre-back said. There was an attempt to ask Fernández, who spoke and fielded questions exclusively in Spanish, about him singing a homophobic and racist song after Argentina's Copa América triumph last year, but the 24-year-old did not appear to understand the question. Chelsea are underdogs before facing PSG but have been boosted by Moisés Caicedo shaking off an ankle injury. Bournemouth have agreed a £25m deal to sign the Chelsea goalkeeper, Djordje Petrovic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has said the heat during Club World Cup matches has been “very dangerous” to play in. The 24-year-old Argentina international has joined the voices who have called on FIFA to consider changes ahead of next summer's men's World Cup that will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. “The heat is incredible,” Fernandez said on Friday, two days ahead of his side's final against Paris Saint-Germain. “Let's hope for next year they change the times so, more than anything, the football continues to be nice and attractive.” Those slots, however, have been considered more attractive for broadcast audiences in Europe and Asia. The topic was reignited on Thursday after former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann stressed that part of tournament football is adapting to all circumstances, including the heat. “Everyone's playing in the heat,” Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said on Friday. “Both teams are playing in the heat, so we can't really make excuses on our side. The extreme heat has been an ongoing narrative during this summer's tournament; players have been seen with cooling towels on the backs of their necks or over their heads, and some teams have directed their substitutes to watch matches from the locker room. To adapt, FIFA has issued hydration breaks during both halves. Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac early in the competition called on FIFA to prioritize the welfare of players in 2026 by pushing back kick-off times. FIFA's Technical Study Group on Thursday spoke with reporters in Manhattan, addressing a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. The tournament concludes on Sunday with the final between Chelsea and PSG at 3pm local time, which is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit with partly cloudy, sunny skies. The heat is expected to peak around kick-off time. Melanie Anzidei  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arsène Wenger has refuted Jürgen Klopp's claim that the revamped FIFA Club World Cup is the “worst idea ever,” insisting clubs are desperate to be involved in the new-look tournament. Former Liverpool manager Klopp has been among those to criticise the 32-team, month-long Club World Cup on account of it further congesting the already bloated football calendar. 63 matches in total are played during the competition, which has been held in the United States and concludes on Sunday, July 13. However, ex-Arsenal manager Wenger, who now works for FIFA as chief of global football development, has rebuffed Klopp's strongly-held opinion. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Jürgen Klopp at all,” said the legendary French coach. “I feel a Club World Cup is needed. If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here then 100% of answers would be that they would want to do it again. Despite Wenger's insistence that attendances were high at the tournament, there have been notably empty stadiums during a number of matches—especially in the group stage. Ticket prices have also been slashed for certain fixtures due to lack of interest. Chelsea will play the final match of this year's tournament when they meet European champions Paris Saint-Germain in the showpiece event this weekend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The inaugural Copa Gianni jamboree reaches its end game on Sunday as Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, two lavishly-backed super clubs based a short Eurostar trip apart, battle to be kings of the global game. PSG have undermined their rivals' complaints about packed schedules and player fatigue by flying in after Bigger Cup final and destroying better-rested teams. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benefited from a tournament that allows you to simply buy more players as you go – including those on opposing teams – in order to freshen things up. Whatever happens, football will be the winner, but has Copa Gianni been any good? Asked at the end of June, Jürgen Klopp was unequivocal in his criticism, calling it the worst idea ever implemented in football (and it has some serious competition – Football Daily Ed). Almost two weeks later, Arsène Wenger has bitten back. “Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Klopp at all.” With a full fortnight to prepare his riposte, we were expecting a Bielsa-esque PowerPoint takedown, but instead got the kind of unsubstantiated guff that may have earned Wenger the gig as Fifa's chief of global football development. If by clubs, Wenger means the boardroom bean-counters and PSR plate-spinners who oversee things, he may be right. We would ask Botafogo's Renato Paiva and Porto's Martín Anselmi what they thought, but they were both sacked for their Copa Gianni failures (which, in Paiva's case, included beating PSG). How did Pep Guardiola enjoy Manchester City's daring run to the last 16? “Maybe [in winter] it will be a disaster, we are exhausted and [Copa Gianni] has destroyed us,” trilled Guardiola. “My teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament,” said Manuel Akanji, who joined the rest of City's back line in downing tools against Al-Hilal. Wenger also took on the issue of low fan turnout, saying “we believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher,” while squinting up at an empty stand as invisible to him as a contentious decision in Arsenal's favour. “We shouldn't underestimate the quality of the permanent pitches,” he added, rubbing a scorched blade of grass between forefinger and thumb. Well, it turns out he was doing the training wrong. “I asked our analysts to analyse the impact of the heat,” Wenger added, while stuffing party packs of ice cubes inside his extra-long puffer jacket. “We found heat of over 35C had an impact on high-speed running, so sprints, not distances.” So, it's simple – to succeed in this tournament, or next year's Stay Away World Cup, players need to stop running. After all it's not like this is an elite competitive sport, right? It's the final round of Group B fixtures, with Portugal needing to gain three points and several goals to overhaul Italy in second place. Join us for Italy 1-4 Spain and Portugal 3-1 Belgium to see how it all shakes down (both 8pm BST kick-offs). It is great to see and it's proof that women's footballers are great, and that is the way that game is going, so long may that continue” – England's Lauren Hemp weighs in on the news that Arsenal will make Canada forward Olivia Smith the first £1m signing in the women's game, as revealed in a Big Website exclusive on Thursday. Re: John Terry's revelation in yesterday's Daily that he would not have played against his old muckers at Chelsea left me pondering the eternal existential question with JT. Would he have sat on the bench in his full Aston Villa kit regardless?” – Justin Kavanagh. Perhaps David Mack (Thursday's letters) should also have told Bryan Evans, Frankie Dodds and Barry Glendenning that the M1 (Republic of Ireland version) only starts at the Turnapin Interchange [OK, that's enough of that – Daily Ed]” – Frank Derwin. Today's prizeless letter o' the day winner is … Justin Kavanagh. Terms and conditions for our competitions can be viewed here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has already lowered prices for the Club World Cup final in an effort to attract more fans to attend the match on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The cheapest standard admission ticket, to see reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain face Premier League standout Chelsea, has dropped from $312.20 to $249.75 two days before the final. However, premium club seats remained the same prices from Wednesday to Friday. FIFA has been criticized for high initial prices for tickets, but has adjusted pricing, taking supply and demand into account. FIFA says 2.4 million fans have attended Club World Cup matches – with an average of 38,000 – and 21 of the 62 matches already played saw at least 50,000. While empty seats were a major storyline, the tournament featured NFL-sized stadiums in addition to soccer-specific venues in order to potentially fit more fans. The first semifinal between Chelsea and Brazilian side Fluminense had an announced crowd of 70,556. The Club World Cup's semifinal match, which saw PSG dismantle Real Madrid had an announced crowd of 77,542 people at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday, July 9. Real Madrid's elimination certainly doesn't help ticket sales for the final, which could possibly see prices drop further into the weekend. However, the most attended Club World Cup match saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid in front of 80,619 fans at the Rose Bowl Stadium outside Los Angeles on June 20.</p>

The US International and two-time World Cup winner has been away from the sport for several years due to injury.

Tobin Heath, one of the most influencial women's players in U.S. history, has announced she is retiring from professional football, disappointing many of her fans who had hoped to see her take to the pitch once again.

The 37-year-old four-time Olympian revealed the decison on her RE-CAP Show podcast on Thursday (10 July).

“I think I had a few more mountains I wanted to climb with football, even though I'm really grateful for the career that I had,” she on the podcast.

“I get the question all the time: ‘So, are you coming back?' — and kind of like, well, the writing's on the wall.”

Heath earned 181 caps for the U.S. Women's National Team, winning gold at Beijing 2008 and London 2012. Known for her creativity, intelligence, and calm presence on the pitch, she was named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year in 2016.

She also won two NWSL titles with the Portland Thorns and most recently played for OL Reign before a knee injury in 2022.

“I just played because I loved it,” she said.</p>

FIFA's strong working relationship with Real Madrid has been a key factor in this decision. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. The future of Rodrygo has become a key talking point at Real Madrid lately as the forward continues to fail in his bid to impress new coach Xabi Alonso. This has led to intense speculation over Rodrygo's future, with the likes of Arsenal, PSG and Manchester City interested in his services. However, despite all the speculation linking him with a move away from Santiago Bernabeu, Rodrygo is determined to stay at Real Madrid. However, Rodrygo's prolonged spell at Los Blancos will not bode well for the club knowing the player's value is bound to go down if he fails to gain regular game-time under Xabi Alonso. The new Real Madrid coach has already made it clear that he would prefer players such as Guler to be orchestrating things in the final third and that he isn't afraid to try out new things.</p>

Arsenal are reportedly considering giving up on their pursuit of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with only a “glimmer of hope” remaining.

The Gunners remain in the market for a proven No.9, with Mikel Arteta considered to have been in need of a prolific performer to fill that role for some time. Gyokeres ticks plenty of boxes after netting 97 goals for Portuguese employers through 102 appearances.

He has been pushing for a Premier League transfer, with the 27-year-old given permission to stay away from pre-season training while talks regarding his future continue. A delegation from Arsenal, led by sporting director Andrea Berta, has held discussions in Lisbon.

No agreement was reached, with Sporting demanding £69 million ($93m) for their most prized asset - with much of that fee being due up front. Arsenal are yet to bow to those demands, with the north London giants mulling over their options.

A Bola reports on how Arsenal are preparing to throw in the towel, with Sporting refusing to budge on the structure of a big-money deal. It may be that Arteta and Co turn their attention to alternative options.

It is claimed that a “glimmer of hope” remains when it comes to Gyokeres and a proposed switch to Emirates Stadium, with the Swedish sensation making it clear that his preference would be to head for England before the summer window closes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's all gas, no brakes for Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna. Just four days after the U.S.'s loss in the final, Luna was sitting in Real Salt Lake's training facility in Herriman, Utah, speaking with media about his Gold Cup campaign and return to Real Salt Lake. “I feel good after this tournament, and now I'm coming right back into club and ready to perform for RSL, keep my foot on the gas because I'm feeling good,” he said. At the Gold Cup, Luna started four of the U.S.'s six matches, tallying three goals — his first-ever national team goals — and two assists. “To represent your country at an international level is a feeling that you can't really put into words,” he said. His performance earned him Man of the Match honors. While the Gold Cup showcased Luna's scoring ability, the tournament also served as a teaching moment for Luna, he said. “It really showed me that I can perform at these high levels. But at the same time,” he said, “there are other players out there that are doing things well that I need to match, that I need to become better at and different areas of the game that I think I can still learn.” “I think this is the year to give it all, right?” he said. “I think this is the year to make sure I'm at my best and then see what happens from there.” “I think if it isn't obvious enough to see that this past Gold Cup team had many guys from the MLS, and we did extremely well — made it to the final — and I think that goes to show that it doesn't matter the league you're playing in. “I'm really focused here and now for the game on Saturday. That's kind of how it is, quick turnaround and yeah, ready to go,” he said. Luna expressed his excitement to play in front of his home fans again, noting that he felt their support while at the Gold Cup. “It's something that I have been thinking about a lot throughout this camp is that I can't wait to get back and put on the RSL jersey and in front of the fans that have been amazing support while I was gone.” He specifically mentioned a video Real Salt Lake posted on social media of fans wishing him good luck ahead of the final. “It kind of made me tear up, and I'm excited to come back and play there and score goals in front of our fans because without them, without RSL, I wouldn't be where I'm at right now. Up next for Luna and Real Salt Lake is Saturday's home match against the Houston Dynamo.</p>
