                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The story of a group of children who are kidnapped by a mysterious organization for seemingly malevolent purposes, King's novel is a hybrid of his own Firestarter and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Yet like its source, it's a saga that's short on real sparks, treading such well-worn supernatural territory that even the best efforts of stars Ben Barnes and Mary Louise Parker aren't enough to make it more than a passable entry in the ever-burgeoning King-to-screen catalogue. That's not to be, since one evening Jake is snatched from his bed, and when he awakens, he's in a facsimile of his room that exists in a cold gray building. Emerging into a hallway that's covered in strange elementary school-style posters, Jake meets Kalisha (Simone Miller), who explains that he's now a resident of The Institute, whose pre-adult residents are all either TK (telekinetic) or TP (telepathic). Given that objects have a funny habit of moving around Jake when he's upset, this isn't altogether stunning news to the kid, and he's soon welcomed into a group that includes trusting George (Arien So), nervous Iris (Birva Pandya), and rebellious Nicky (Fionn Laird). As Jake learns, the Institute is run by cunning head honcho Ms. Sigsby (Parker), her ruthless chief of security Stackhouse (Julian Richings), and rational Dr. Hendricks (Robert Joy), who with the assistance of sadistic orderly Tony (Jason Diaz) conducts tests on the kids that are designed to instigate and enhance their extraordinary powers—and, in the best case scenario, reveal them to be PCs (precogs) who can see the future. From the outset, he's skeptical about everything sold by Ms. Sigsby, whom Parker embodies with a superficial positivity that reeks of deception, not to mention derangement—the latter of which is underscored by an early scene in which, upon returning home from work, she soothes herself by burning her leg with a red-hot wire hanger. Strange, sinister things are afoot at the Institute, and Cavell's series doles out hints about the organization's true motives at an enticing pace. Those revelations are at once horrible and complex, as well as thematically related to the recent ordeal plaguing former cop Tim Jamieson (Barnes). Arriving in small-town Maine with few belongings and no overt purpose, Tim successfully gets a job as the police department's “night knocker,” whose job it is to nocturnally patrol the enclave's streets. During the course of his duties, he meets officer Wendy (Hannah Galway), to whom he slowly grows closer, and local homeless crank Annie (Mary Walsh), whose intriguing conspiracy theories involve the Institute and psychic phenomena. Tim and Jake's paths are destined to cross, but The Institute is most captivating when focusing on the latter's plight, which involves bizarre experiments known as “Shots for Dots” that make subjects disturbingly sick and weak. Instead of just a one-note boogeyman nightmare, the show complicates matters by giving its villains a potentially altruistic reason for their monstrousness. While the moral questions raised by their conduct (and motivations) are ultimately discarded in a way that suggests no one involved really cared about them, they nonetheless add a tantalizing layer to the otherwise straightforward material. Freeman is competent, if lacking the charisma required to elicit real engagement with his suffering. The same goes for Viggo Hanvelt as Avery, the newest and youngest Institute victim, whose abilities are so great that they afford Luke and company a chance to break out of the Institute. Their functional turns are a burden the series can't totally overcome, and the visually unimaginative direction by Jack Bender, Brad Turner, and Jeff Renfroe doesn't do them any favor—and, at times, seems to actively work against them. As with the Lumineers' morose credit-sequence cover of Tears for Fears' “Shout,” the flat action is gloomy to a fault. Stackhouse and Tony are psychos that we've seen before, Tim is the sort of good-hearted hero that King has favored since Salem's Lot, and the plot weaves together its strands in a fashion that will be intensely familiar to the writer's Constant Readers. This isn't to knock those conventions (which remain sturdy and entertaining) so much as to wish that the narrative at hand were more animated and surprising. It's also, by design, an efficiently structured and thankfully self-contained affair, all the way to a finale that leaves little wiggle room for any (unnecessary) follow-up. It may be a middle-of-the-road tale from the Master of Horror, but that's still better than most.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolas Aujula, a psychic who is said to have accurately predicted the COVID-19 pandemic, has made a series of horrifying claims about 2025, and perhaps most shockingly, one of them has already come true. Whether you believe it or not, there's something strikingly alluring about predictions. From Baba Vanga's almost supernatural accuracy to Nostradamus' foretellings about global economic collapse, I will never refuse a brief – and somewhat shaky – look into the future. Considering the prevalence of WW3-themed articles right now, and growing conflicts in several areas of the world, this is proboably a prediction we were all expecting. Nicolas further noted how 2025 will be “a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world, where we will see horrific acts of human evil and violence towards each other in the name of religion and nationalism.” On the subject of slightly fluffier predictions, albeit still depressing, Nicolas accurately predicted the breakdown of Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's nine-year relationship. “Katy Perry will have marriage problems in 2025, and Cate Blanchett has a successful year,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old practice of spraying tiny particles into a rain cloud in the hope of pushing it to rain or snow just a little more. It's used in nine states, mostly to fight droughts that can hurt farmers, community water supplies and even some factories. It's important to lay this information out up front because one of the unfortunate aspects of writing about conspiracy theories is that people tend to remember the claims but not the facts that they're false. You're going to hear a lot about cloud seeding in the next few days. That's because a loose group of online conspiracy theorists have latched onto cloud seeding as an explanation for the devastating Texas floods. As a longtime reporter, I might say something like "there is no evidence for this claim" or cite some higher authority to say it's not true. I'm going to just come out and say it: This is bonkers. As I said at the beginning, no one knows whether cloud seeding even works. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in December found that studies of how much additional rain it produces "ranged from 0 to 20 percent." Even if the outliers are correct and cloud seeding can increase precipitation by as much as one-fifth, that would still not be enough to account for the 15 inches of rain that fell in Texas on July 3, more than double what had been forecast a day earlier. The cloud seeding that online theorists have seized on involved 70 grams of silver iodide sprayed into a cloud more than 100 miles away two days earlier, according to The Washington Post. They might as well blame a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil. Nevertheless, the theory gained ground after it was cited by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., GOP House candidate Kandiss Taylor and former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. In what appears to have been an effort to combat the misinformation, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted online resources explaining the science behind cloud seeding, geoengineering and even the condensation trails left by planes flying at high altitudes. But unfortunately, the administration's rhetoric isn't well-suited for this kind of debunking. "Americans have questions about geoengineering and contrails," Zeldin wrote on X. "They expect honesty and transparency from their government when seeking answers. For years, people who asked questions in good faith were dismissed, even vilified by the media and their own government. It's not what you write to promote a sober fact-check. That was because people who study conspiracy theories have found that it helps to use a "truth sandwich" that begins and ends with the facts, rather than highlight the conspiracy theories first and then rebut them. Noting that there have been "myths and misconceptions" about contrails for decades, the EPA site says it "addresses head-on various claims that these occurrences are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather." It would have been better if the EPA started off by citing some facts, then noted that there have been conspiracy theories about it (without repeating the spurious claims) and then went back through the facts again. The underlying problem is that Trump likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. The underlying problem here is that Zeldin's boss, President Donald Trump, likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. Over the years, he has made spurious claims about Barack Obama's birthplace, liberal donor George Soros, climate change and vaccines and cozied up to those who argue that there's a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who control the government. Trump's words have helped foster an environment in which conspiracy theories flourish and even a government agency trying to debunk obvious misinformation hems and haws.
