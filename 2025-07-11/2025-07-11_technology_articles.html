We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Apple is famously strict about discounts, and it rarely offers price drops even on the most affordable products. But this Prime Day, the prices are to be believed: a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for $64, which works out at about $16 an AirTag. To put it into perspective, four AirTags from Apple would run you $116 so this Prime Day discount is essentially… half price. The deal is only being offered to Prime members but if you aren't a member, you can just opt for the free 30-day trial in order to get access. If you don't need more than one, you can purchase the individual AirTag from Amazon for $20 rather than the normal price of $29. If you want an easy way of keeping tabs on your most valuable items, Apple's AirTag is a great choice. You can then use the Find My app to locate your item at any time. The AirTag leverages Apple's massive Find My network and uses hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you find lost things. When your AirTag is out of Bluetooth range, it can still be tracked by nearby Apple devices with communication encrypted and anonymous to maintain your information security. Your location data will never be transferred or stored on the AirTag itself. The AirTag is meant to last with a replaceable battery that still works after over a year and an IP67 rating for water and dust protection. That is, you can forget about rain, spills, or everyday bumps and drops. At $67 for a 4-pack, this Prime Day deal is the best opportunity you'll find to upgrade (better than during Black Friday) your tracking game.

And IMHO, a lot of the “magic” in LLMs is infrastructure-driven. We'll find out in September if it's true? They should have called their machine the AIps (AI Petaflops Supercomputer). OLMo is fully openAi2 believes in the power of openness to build a future where AI is accessible to all. This leads me to believe that the training data won't be made publicly available in full, but merely be “reproducible”. This might mean that they'll provide references like a list of URLs of the pages they trained on, but not their contents. “ Open LLMs are increasingly viewed as credible alternatives to commercial systems, most of which are developed behind closed doors in the United States or China”It is obvious that the companies producing big LLMs today have the incentive to try to enshitify them. Worse, some already have political biases they promote.It would be wonderful if a partnership between academia and government in Europe can do a public good search and AI that endeavours to serve the user over the company.

Grok has become a centerpiece of X, where users interact with the AI chatbot. And just yesterday, AI reporter Max Zeff discovered that xAI's newest model, Grok 4, seems to consult social media posts from Musk's X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, immigration laws, and other controversial issues. A well-known white hat hacker who uses the handle “Green the Only” dug into Tesla's firmware and made a few discoveries. For example, drivers will be able to choose certain Grok “personalities,” including ones that are NSFW (not safe for work), argumentative, kids story, sexy, therapist, unhinged, and more. He also found that “Grok currently requires premium connectivity and pairs into your existing account.” As we've reported before, there is a lot of hype and anticipation around Also — and Jony Ive's LoveFrom connection to the brand certainly helps raise its profile. Speaking of buzzy EVs that have raised eye-popping rounds, senior reporter Sean O'Kane interviewed the founders of Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles venture firm that launched five years ago and was an early investor in the Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto. Want to catch up on Slate Auto news? We created a handy Slate Auto timeline that covers all our scoops and news. Finnish e-motor startup Donut Lab raised €25 million ($29.2 million) in a seed funding round led by Risto Siilasmaa, the founder of cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure). INSHUR, an insurance products service focused on the on-demand economy, raised $35 million from Trinity Capital. President Trump has nominated Jonathan Morrison to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Morrison has a history of tussling with Tesla. Meanwhile, it looks like Tesla is trying to spread its robotaxi wings. Our story has a few interesting tidbits and explains the AV permitting process in Phoenix. One critical point: The company will also need a TNC permit to provide ride-hailing services. Musk also commented that robotaxis will come to the Bay Area once they receive regulatory approval in “a month or two.” There's just one issue with that: The California DMV, which regulates AVs, says Tesla hasn't even applied for a driverless testing or deployment permit yet. As of today, Tesla only has an autonomous vehicle testing permit for public road testing with a safety driver, which it's held since 2014. Waymo continues to expand, and not just geographically. The company is opening up its robotaxi service in Phoenix to teenagers. There are caveats here, namely that the teens can only sign up through a verified parent's account. Meanwhile, Waymo is sniffing around New York City (a famously restrictive place for AVs) and Philadelphia. Road trips can be viewed as early testing, although in New York City the vehicles will all be manually driven and used to map and collect data. Several new EVs broke cover this past week: Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius took the upcoming all-electric GLC for a test ride; Subaru said it will reveal its new all-electric compact crossover SUV at 7:30 p.m. ET on July 17; and Volvo shared information about the carbon footprint of the all-electric ES90, which starts production later this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Department of Justice this week released nearly 11 hours of what it described as “full raw” surveillance footage from a camera positioned near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The release was intended to address conspiracy theories about Epstein's apparent suicide in federal custody. But instead of putting those suspicions to rest, it may fuel them further. The file appears to have been assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage. The video may have simply been processed for public release using available software, with no modifications beyond stitching together two clips. In a case already clouded by suspicion, the ambiguity surrounding how the file was processed is likely to provide fresh fodder for conspiracy theories. Any aspect of the official story that isn't fully explained will be co-opted by conspiracy theorists, says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists. “So whatever your flavor of Epstein conspiracy is, the video will help bolster it.” For months leading up to the joint memo the DOJ and FBI published Monday, attorney general Pam Bondi had promised the release of records related to Epstein, raising expectations that new, potentially incriminating details might surface about the disgraced financier's death and his ties to powerful individuals. However, rather than revealing new information, the memo largely confirmed conclusions reached years earlier: that Epstein was found in a Manhattan prison cell on August 10, 2019, and died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Both versions of the video appear to have been processed using Premiere and include much of the same metadata. Using a metadata tool, reporters analyzed both Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data to identify signs of postprocessing. The “raw” file shows clear signs of having been processed using an Adobe product, most likely Premiere, based on metadata that specifically references file extensions used by the video editing software. According to experts, Adobe software, including Premiere and Photoshop, leaves traces in exported files, often embedding metadata that logs which assets were used and what actions were taken during editing. These entries appear under a metadata section labeled “Ingredients,” part of Adobe's internal schema for tracking source material used in edited exports. Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley whose research focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, reviewed the metadata at WIRED's request. Farid is a recognized expert in the analysis of digital images and the detection of manipulated media, including deepfakes. He has testified in numerous court cases involving digital evidence. Farid says the metadata raises immediate concerns about chain of custody—the documented handling of digital evidence from collection to presentation in a courtroom. Just like physical evidence, he explains, digital evidence must be handled in a way that preserves its integrity; metadata, while not always precise, can provide important clues about whether that integrity has been compromised. “Do a direct export from the original system—no monkey business.” “Why am I suddenly seeing a different aspect ratio?” he asks. The BOP did not respond to a request for comment. According to a 2023 report from the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG), MCC, the detention facility where Epstein was found hanged, had around 150 analog surveillance cameras—but starting on July 29, 2019, a technical error prevented roughly half of them from recording, including most inside the SHU. However, the recording includes a notable gap: Approximately one minute of footage is missing, from 11:58:58 pm to 12:00:00 am. The OIG's report found no evidence of a conspiracy to kill Epstein. Instead, it documented years of chronic staffing failures and system breakdowns at MCC. At a press conference on Tuesday, Bondi attributed the missing minute to a flaw in the surveillance system's daily cycle, claiming that one minute is missing from every night's recording. Given the years of high-profile conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein, any perceived inconsistency in the official narrative is likely to draw intense scrutiny. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones called the DOJ memo “sickening.” “Next the DOJ will say, ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,'” he wrote in a post on X. One media forensics expert, who reviewed the metadata and agreed with WIRED's analysis but requested anonymity due to privacy concerns and a desire to avoid having their name publicly associated with anything related to the Epstein case, put it bluntly: “It looks suspicious—but not as suspicious as the DOJ refusing to answer basic questions about it.” In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin Special Edition: You're not ready for what's coming next WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. These are the best Prime Day coffee maker deals on WIRED-tested and -approved brewers, espresso machines, grinders, concentrates, pods, and more. Updated 11:20 am ET July 11, 2025: We've removed some discontinued deals, added deals on the Breville Barista Express and De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine, and added an accessories section with the Oxo Conical Burr Grinder and Zulay Kitchen Milk Frother Wand. Italian coffee titan De'Longhi has created something close to automated perfection here. It will grind, brew, froth up milk, and deliver as many as 18 different variations on espresso, latte, cappuccino, and iced-coffee drinks. Ninja's Luxe Café semiautomated espresso machine (7/10, WIRED Review) made the quad shot I'm drinking right now. It also makes a good cup of drip coffee and cold brew as well. If you want want a machine that can do it all, and do it well, this is a good choice. With a built-in steaming wand and good pressure for full extraction, this slim little machine is perfect for tight kitchens. The De'Longhi superautomatic machine features a conical burr grinder; offers four preset recipes; and brews a nice, smooth espresso. The Casabrews 5700 PRO (7/10 WIRED Review) keeps it simple with easily accessible controls that make dialing in your perfect shot easy enough. The De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) features a built-in burr grinder and frother and can turn out great espresso right out of the box. A stalwart from our “buy-it-for-life” guide, the Moccamaster is crafted from metal, steel, and copper and is designed to last a lifetime. The appeal, beyond longevity, lies in its precision. The Moccamaster can hold brewing temperatures within a variance of 4 degrees Celsius and extract coffee within very tight parameters. This will make you great cups of coffee, probably for longer than you'll be around to drink them. There's no sediment to be found here, just a nice, bold cup of coffee. The spout could be bigger, but so long as you pour slowly, it's not a big deal. WIRED wrote about the AeroPress' inventor a decade ago, and we love the device because of its unique design, which uses a plastic tube to create pressure that's not quite espresso but closer than coffee. The Aeropress is like a fat syringe that brews amazing coffee, split somewhere between aromatic drip and powerful espresso. And this bigger “XL” is now the best-selling variant on Amazon: Turns out people just wanted more AeroPress at a time. Anyway, this is a great deal on an AeroPress fatty. Our favorite budget drip coffee maker, this Zojirushi consistently manages a well-extracted cup, complete with a pour-over-style bloom. The Clara has the company's trademark minimalist modern design, with a BPA-free plastic exterior and a matte black finish. This is a great choice for large groups. Not only is the capacity here 50 ounces, but the wide spout and sturdy handles make it easy to pour. It's been a minute since good ol' Joe Ray reviewed this upscale drip machine from Breville, but he gave it a 7/10. This is normally a lot of money to pay for a drip machine that is now the Fellow Aiden, but Prime Day brings the price down $130 to $200. It offers more control than most drip machines so you can optimize for your beans and taste. If even that is too slow, try a concentrate. The Bruvi BV-01 is our favorite pod coffee maker. The proprietary B-Pods are unfortunately only sold online as of now, but they come in coffee, tea, and espresso varieties, and they're meant to biodegrade in a landfill. The OG coffee pod brewer, the K-Mini does a solid job at what it's meant to do: brewing exactly one cup of coffee. It gets the job done, and in our testing, these machines will last a surprisingly long time. This adorable little pod coffee maker is the best for espresso. By “espresso” I mean “an espresso-like beverage,” but it's still solid for folks who like handcrafted lattes or straight shots with no chaser. If you're spending $8 per day on coffee, get this instead. Javvy (formerly “Javy”) comes in a wide range of flavors and isn't overly sweet. You only need a teaspoon or two for a full 8-ounce cup, and the original flavor is smooth enough that you can almost forget you're drinking a concentrate, with no bitter or funny aftertaste. It packs 150 milligrams of caffeine into a single tablespoon-size serving. Somehow it manages to not taste too acidic or bitter, either, which is an achievement. I love coffee, and under normal circumstances, I would never go four days without brewing a cup in either an AeroPress or a Chemex. However, Amazon Prime Day is not a normal time. These cans are normally $20 for 12, but right now they're down to $14, or just about a buck a can. I have ordered two flats for Prime Day. It's not all about coffee machines and coffee; you need some accoutrements to make the perfect cup to suit every taste. Quite simply the best grinder for this money, and 30% off right now. It may not be ideal for espresso, since the 15-grind setting doesn't get fine enough. But for Aeropress, drip, or French press, you will not find a better grinder for good extraction and an even grind. Who doesn't like tiny bubbles, at half price?

I travel a lot, be it by plane or by car, so my laptop bag is often filled with various cables, wall adapters, battery power bricks, and USB cables. So, when browsing around Amazon looking to see if there was anything I could score for myself for Prime Day, my eye was immediately drawn to two listings from Ugreen: 65-watt and 45-watt retractable USB-C charging blocks priced at $34.99 and $19.99, respectively. But the retractable power bricks intrigued me for multiple reasons. I currently use Apple 29- and 70-watt USB-C power adapters to charge my devices on the go. Of course, you can only charge one device at a time with these adapters. In my usage case, I could imagine using the 65-watt USB-C power brick to charge my MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch (or AirPods) simultaneously. There's no need to worry if I remembered to bring along a USB-C cable; it's already attached and stows away when not needed. It doesn't get any better than that. UGREEN's 45-watt GaN II fast charger can top off three devices simultaneously using a retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports. Finally, the overall size of these Ugreen retractable power bricks is a big draw. Compared to my 75-watt Apple adapter, these things are much smaller in comparison, due in part to the use of Gallium Nitride (GaN) power transistors. The 65-watt version has straight-through power plugs, while the 45-watt version uses retractable plugs to further reduce its profile in your bag. I bought one of each, and they're bound to be a helpful addition to my travel bag and will help cut down on cable/charger clutter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Covering tech news, you sometimes feel like the million-mile-per-hour footrace of Silicon Valley will inevitably result in a Wile E. Coyote-style calamity. When we actually receive it, the result is a little more cringe-worthy. Intel's new boss, Lip-Bu Tan, reportedly told staff the company was—effectively—cooked. That doesn't sound great, but for one of Intel's once-biggest partners, Apple, it may be a sign it can take it a little easier with the relentless yearly release schedule. We won't see any new MacBook Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's regular Apple leaker Mark Gurman, who says Apple may delay these devices to the first half of 2026. As much as I wish this supposed delay was to finagle a new Mac design, Gurman suggests new MacBook Pros with M5 chips will still have the same design as every other Apple laptop we've seen since 2021. The rumored OLED display that promises far better contrast and colors reportedly won't arrive until 2027. Later in October, the company debuted the M3 MacBook Pro 14- and 16-inch models in an all-black color at its “Scary Fast” event. Last year's M4 MacBook Pro launch was a slightly more subdued affair. According to Gurman's anonymous sources, there are new iPad Airs with M3 chips that would accompany a replacement for the baseline $350 iPad. While Apple wanted to keep its Macs in the oven, it apparently has no issues with its iPhone release schedule. We'll also see Apple Watch upgrades and—if the stars align—a new Vision Pro headset that may finally be more comfortable to wear. Apple's been on a roll with its MacBooks since it dropped Intel CPUs in favor of its own ARM-based M-series chips in 2020. The latest M4 designs outclass most other Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm chips in pure benchmark performance, though Apple has been sitting on its laurels for far too long. Apple is ending support for all older Intel-based Macs, but anybody not still using an Intel-based Mac has little reason to upgrade. Intel was also caught off-guard by the proliferation of AI and Nvidia's dominance of the AI training chip market. Those woes stacked so high they eventually led to the ouster of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan, who's now in the driver's seat, reportedly told staff that “we are not in the top 10 semiconductor companies” compared to 30 years ago. Intel is reportedly cutting thousands of workers across all sectors, and more could find their head on the chopping block in the next few months. If big tech companies would actually slow down with their rapid release schedule and instead focus on making sure their core products offer a real reason for consumers to upgrade, then we'd all benefit.

This keyboard cleaning kit comes with an excellent array of tiny tools to help pick dirt, grime, and anything else you can think of. Specifically, it comes with 16 different attachments all housed in a neat multi-tool arrangement. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. Cozoo Headphone Stand with USB Charger: now $8 at Amazon (was $15)This quirky device combines an under-desk headphone hook and a 20W PD USB charger with one USB-C and two USB-A ports. The 4TB QLC-based P310 NVMe SSD has hit an all-time low price this Prime Day. The QLC-based drive boasts excellent performance of up to 7,100 MB/s. It also has excellent thermals and won't throttle. This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. But there's a different screwdriver that Hoto makes that holds a special place in my heart: the Hoto 25-in-1 electric screwdriver kit. If you're opening laptops or tinkering with gadgets, it's a must-have. This 25-piece electric screwdriver is perfect for fixing up gadgets and working on hobby projects. I go to this set all the time for my laptop reviews, and often when I'm tinkering with other gadgets I own, opening battery doors on my kid's toys, building PCs, or even tighting screws on my kitchen cabinets. For anything that needs more strength, though, the Nex 01 Pro is where it's at.The 25 bits include Phillips head, Torx, tri-wing, pentalobe, and more — perfect for all sorts of small gadgets. The case also has a magnetizer so you can ensure your bit won't drop a tiny screw somewhere you'll lose it. That's cool, I guess, but the company is shipping out old and new stock randomly, and everything else should be the same. The humble surge protector is an often-forgotten but critical component of one's desk setup. The best kind of surge protector is a power tower which stands vertically on your desk so it doesn't take up too much table real estate. I'm moving into a new office during the day so I just bought this Passus brand tower, which is reduced to $21 from $28. The Passus tower has 12 AC outlets, three on each side. And what's special here is that each side of the tower has its own on/off switch, allowing me to turn some devices off and keep others on at the same time. I plan to have my monitors plugged into one side of the tower and to turn them off when I leave for the day by cutting their power, not using the screens' individual power buttons. However, I will leave the side that powers my phone charger on 24/7. There's four Type-A ports that do 3 watts in total, which is not very impressive but is adequate for slow charging something like my headphones. Then there's a single USB-C PD charger for charging my phone and it outputs 18W. At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws. I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage, and it is still going strong three days later. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. Full of those "must have" adapters that we never really have a use for, until that one, fateful day when you need to hook up a laptop / games console / camera to a display and then you become the IT hero who saves the day! This seven-pack of HDMI adapters will live in your junk drawer until called upon one day. There are also two HDMI to mini and micro HDMI, useful for connecting cameras, Raspberry Pi and slim laptops to a display. Grab these deeply discounted retractable USB-C GaN power blocks before Prime Day ends If you're looking to reduce cable clutter in your travel bag, UGREEN has two GaN power adapters that might be right up your alley. For Prime Day, the company's 45-watt retractable USB-C power block is just $19.99, a 35 percent discount off its everyday price. Likewise, the 65-watt version is $34.99, representing a 30 percent drop. In addition, the 45-watt block has two USB-C ports, while the 65-watt version has one USB-C port and one USB-A port. UGREEN's 45-watt GaN II fast charger can top off three devices simultaneously using a retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports.

The personal data seen by the researchers included applicants' names, email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers. Paradox.ai wrote in a blog post that it resolved the issues “within a few hours” after the researchers' report, and that “at no point was candidate information leaked online or made publicly available.” The researchers' findings were first reported by Wired.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When OpenAI was having its ChatGPT moment in 2022, Joe Scheidler, co-founder and CEO of Helios, was tackling a different kind of challenge: Helping build the White House's newly authorized cybersecurity office and navigating the complexities of public-private coordination on cyber policies. His current co-founder, Joseph Farsakh, was also at the State Department, working on Yemen Houthi peace negotiations. The founders thought: What if there was a better way to support decision making, one that combined AI-native tools with an understanding of how public policy is decided? To make it real, the co-founders brought on Brandon Smith, a long-time acquaintance of Scheidler's and a machine learning veteran who had worked at Microsoft and Datadog, to lead the technical vision. Helios' flagship product Proxi, an AI-based operating system built for public policy, regulatory affairs, legal, compliance, and government teams, is still in beta. But, Scheidler says, the company is already seeing early traction with workers in federal, state, and local agencies, as well as Fortune 500 companies and startups. “We wanted to empower all public policy, legal, and compliance professionals with end-to-end automation, deploying sort of a web of secure AI agents that are trained and fine-tuned against really robust public policy datasets to support them on anything from strategic advisement to very sensitive and complex writing products, data analysis, and stakeholder mapping,” he said. The first is dubbed “Consult,” and Scheidler describes it as a “conversational AI agent, your 24/7, always-on public policy team member who is constantly scanning the legislative and regulatory environment.” Proxi's second feature is called “Scribe.” This is a collaborative AI editing and writing tool that helps policy professionals turn their soundboarding sessions with Consult into memos, filings, and policy documents. “That's a lot of what I spent my time doing at the State Department when I would have far preferred to just be on the Hill, building relationships with people who are actually making draft amendments and provisions,” Scheidler said. Finally, Proxi offers a CRM (customer relationship management) tool that helps people visually map out their stakeholder environment and track their interaction history, including meeting notes. It's an all-in-one offering, Scheidler said, noting that Helios uses top encryption standards for federal clients, and is currently working through compliance audits. Rather than rushing to monetize quickly, Scheidler says the startup is focusing on building long-term business relationships and collecting meticulous feedback from early beta users. “Our goal in five to seven years from now is for Helios to be completely synonymous with all government public and private interaction,” he added. That may mean barrelling past short-term competition like Bloomberg Government and Fiscal Note Forum to challenge longer-term rivals like Palantir, OpenGov, and Civica, the co-founder said. “We think there's a lot of room to play in this space over time.” Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk's broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Performance of SM8466-based SSDs will by far exceed not only that of the best client SSDs, but also virtually all available enterprise-grade drives. In terms of capabilities, the SM8466 is expected to be compliant with an NVMe 2.0+ specification, as well as the OCP NVMe SSD Spec 2.5, making it suitable for hyperscale and cloud deployments. It includes SR-IOV/MPF for virtualization, SMART monitoring, and end-to-end data protection. Security features include Secure Boot, AES-256 encryption, TCG Opal compliance, and firmware attestation, a set that offers strong safeguards for sensitive enterprise environments. According to the chief executive of SMI, the company expects its partner to start shipping their SM8466-based products sometime in late 2026 – early 2027, which will coincide with the ramp of next-generation AI servers based on Nvidia's Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC. As for client PCs, Kou expects SSDs with a PCIe 6.0 x4 to address PC OEMs only in 2030 or later. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. We found plenty of great Walmart deals on many of our favorite tech items, like Apple laptops, Sony televisions, Garmin fitness trackers, and more. If you're looking for up-to-the-minute coverage of deals, check out our Amazon Prime Day liveblog, which will run from 5 am to midnight daily. Here are the best deals from other retailers. Updated July 11: We've added deals on the SanDisk Extreme Pro, LG C4 OLED TV, Vizio Elevate SE 5.1.2 Soundbar, Arlo Essential Indoor Security Camera, Petkit PuraMax 2, Segway E2 Pro Scooter, and Noco Boost Plus GB40 Jump Starter. Look, it's almost five years old, and if you can afford the extra $250, it's well worth buying the M4 MacBook Air instead, but if you're on a tight budget, this is probably the best laptop you can buy at this price. A true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users. The Asus Chromebook CX15 is quite nice for this price. Its bezels aren't overly large, and the keyboard feels great to type on. No one needs an iPad, but they're fun to have. These days, with support for conventional windowing (finally), you can justify it by saying you'll do some work on it. After you get done watching movies, thumbing through your social feeds, and messing around with Garageband. Asus mesh systems are great because they come with free, comprehensive security software and parental controls (no subscription required). That's part of why this router is the top pick in our Best Mesh Routers guide. The Asus RT-AXE7800 is a tri-band router with support for the 6-GHz band, making it a smart choice for congested homes. If you crave control over your network and want a router that covers all the bases, this deal is a good option. This is the best gaming mouse you can get for under $50. True, it does not have the extreme sensitivity of more expensive options, but so long as you're not an aspiring esports athlete, we don't think you need anything more. The linear switches feel luxurious, and we like that there's no number pad. It's got speed and reliability at a great price (even better right now). The durable aluminum case has a loop you can use to put it on your key ring. This deal is going fast (smaller sizes are already sold out, but this and the larger version remain available). Want to embrace (or re-embrace) film photography without spending a fortune? Just make sure it's the right model for your iPad before you invest. The top pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro offers speed and reliability in a sleek and durable aluminum case with a loop for attaching it to a key ring, and it's easy to slide open one-handed to reveal or hide the USB-A plug. This is a great deal on our favorite TV. It offers solid HDR, has good black levels, which help it get an impressive amount of contrast, along with rich, natural colors. This QLED TV has excellent clarity, accurate and intense colors, and brightness levels that make it look great even in the sunniest rooms. Sony's Bravia 8 II is a truly beautiful TV, with pristine image clarity and incredibly vivid colors. It looks good from the side and has some nice gaming features. LG's C4 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs and has dropped to half its launch price. You get all the same great apps as other devices, but also a voice remote and support for Dolby Vision HDR. Vizio's Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) cuts a few features to keep the price low, so there's no Wi-Fi streaming or even a remote, but it does have supercool rolling speakers that spin upward for Dolby Atmos effects and back down again for stereo and surround tracks. These affordable clip-based earbuds are perfect for the gym. They sound good enough for working out, and they come with a nice, large charging case that is easy to keep track of. At this price, you might as well grab two pairs. Every podcast you listen to probably started out with this mic. It has support for PartyBoost, JBL's system for connecting multiple models in tandem, something that was dropped from the Flip 7. This is the Best Robot Vacuum you can buy. We also like that there's no camera, so it can't spy on you. There are four separate wireless probes so you can track temps in multiple things or multiple areas of that massive brisket you're smoking. Walmart's deal saves you $80, an extra $5 off over Amazon. With 1080p video (nice, sharp, HDR video at that) and night vision, it'll give you a good view of wherever you aim it. It also sports a clear speaker and microphone. This is just the 1080p model of the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide, but it's still a solid indoor security camera with a video feed that loads quickly, excellent notifications, and two-factor authentication. The automatic litter box that we recommend for most people is even cheaper than usual. The best overall fitness tracker you can buy, the Fitbit Charge 6 is great for its accuracy, affordability, and high-end features. There's also great battery life and support for a full suite of health metrics. Battery life is excellent (up to 10 days), and the bright AMOLED screen makes it easy to see your stats even though it's on the small side. Want a fitness tracker that isn't so massive on the wrist and looks more like, well, a watch? Despite its watch-like appearance, it's still a fully functional fitness tracker. The E2 Pro is a nice entry-level scooter that can hit 15 miles per hour and go for around 21 miles before it needs a charge. The 41-pound weight is pretty manageable, and it has turn signals.

A South Korean gamer says that their two-year-old RTX 4060 Ti reportedly caught fire and melted while being used for gaming. According to their post on Quasar Zone [machine translated], the GPU wasn't overclocked, and they weren't using it for anything heavy. They primarily used their computer for simple tasks on Adobe, and the most demanding game they played was PUBG. Although high-powered Nvidia GPUs like the RTX 5090 and 5080 with their 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 power connectors were known for melting, lower-powered graphics cards like the RTX 4060 Ti are not prone to this issue. “I'd been using it for about two years, and suddenly, while gaming, the computer shut off. They also added, “About three months ago, I was in a rush for work and called a repair shop, expecting to get ripped off. Apparently, the user had an issue with their computer and had their motherboard replaced with a refurbished one a few months before this incident. They now suspect that the GPU bursting into flames was caused by the replacement, although it's unlikely to happen. There's also a massive melt pattern near where the LR22 inductors used for the GPU's voltage regulation are placed. This is such an unfortunate and potentially dangerous incident, and one that we did not expect, given that the GPU wasn't even a high-powered one. However, this is pretty unlikely, especially since the GPU has been in use for a couple of years without any issues. Although the GPU did not come from an international brand like Asus or Gigabyte, comments said that Emtek was a decent South Korean GPU brand. We hope that this is an isolated case and that the GPU manufacturer addresses the issue quickly. After all, with many gamers rocking this GPU in their systems, it's going to be a disaster if these start going up in flames during regular use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samsung released its first fitness-focused smart ring last year, adding to its stable of wearables that's mostly composed of smartwatches. The company is now looking to bolster its lineup with new wearables in different form factors, like glasses, earrings, and necklaces, CNN reported. Won-joon Choi, COO of Samsung's mobile experience division, told CNN that the company wants to explore form factors that let users communicate and do things without needing their phones. “We believe it should be wearable, something that you shouldn't carry, (that) you don't need to carry. So it could be something that you wear, glasses, earrings, watches, rings, and sometime (a) necklace,” CNN quoted Choi as saying. Earlier this year, Samsung said it was building smart glasses with Google, and in May, the Korea Economic Daily reported that the company was working on an advanced microdisplay for AR glasses.
