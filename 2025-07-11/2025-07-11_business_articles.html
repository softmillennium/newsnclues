A Brightline train in Miami.

Brightline Trains Florida, the Fortress Investment Group-backed passenger railroad, plans to defer a July 15 interest payment on its 10% and 12% unrated tax-exempt bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Brightline notified holders of the delay through the Depository Trust Company, said the people who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak publicly. The incident is not considered an event of default, according to bond documents. A default only occurs if the railroad misses three consecutive interest payments, the documents state. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts. I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though. Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro. This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus. Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers. OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below. device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers). Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills. If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp. Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus. If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line. Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen. I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit. They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too. Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today. You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past. I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home. Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights. As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area. I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate. This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen. No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water. If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good. I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type. Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit. The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying. The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it. For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year. Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks. A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. [Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day. One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures. These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price. Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday. Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise. This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later. The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' delivers a temporary higher limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. But the phaseout, or income-based benefit reduction, could trigger a tax surprise for some higher earners, experts say. If you itemize tax breaks, you can claim the SALT deduction, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. However, the $40,000 SALT cap starts to phase out once modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, exceeds $500,000. The SALT limit drops to $10,000 once MAGI reaches $600,000. MAGI is adjusted gross income with some tax breaks added back in. This phaseout can create a "SALT torpedo" — an artificially high tax rate — when MAGI falls between $500,000 and $600,000, certified public accountant Jeff Levine said in a LinkedIn post this week. In some cases, you could pay a 45.5% federal tax rate on earnings between those thresholds, experts say. More from Personal Finance:Tax changes under Trump's 'big beautiful bill' — in one chart'YOLO'-buying EVs: As $7,500 tax credit ends, consumers may rush to cash inTrump's 'big beautiful bill' cuts SNAP for millions of families: Report Here's how the "SALT torpedo" works and who could be impacted, according to tax experts. Under Trump's legislation, the SALT deduction limit for 2025 is now $30,000 higher. But a 30% phaseout kicks in once MAGI exceeds $500,000 for 2025. Between $500,000 and $600,000, "you're losing 30% for every dollar" of benefit between those thresholds, said certified financial planner Jim Guarino, managing director at Baker Newman Noyes in Woburn, Massachusetts. At $600,000, if you multiply the extra $100,000 of income by 30%, that's a $30,000 benefit reduction, which drops the $40,000 SALT cap back to $10,000. With the 30% SALT deduction phaseout between $500,000 and $600,000 of MAGI, some individuals could pay a higher-than-expected tax on earnings between those thresholds, according to Robert Keebler, a CPA with tax advisory firm Keebler & Associates in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Between $500,000 and $600,000, you're increasing taxable income while losing part of the SALT deduction, which raises your effective tax rate — the percent of taxable income you pay. If taxable income rises while the SALT deduction falls, your effective tax rate on income between $500,000 and $600,000 could far exceed your regular income tax rate, Keebler said in a LinkedIn post last week. "When people start actually crunching numbers, they might be in for some surprises." Whitehair also shared a basic example of the phaseout on LinkedIn this week. If your 2025 earnings could be near $500,000, you should run projections with a tax advisor and weigh strategies to reduce MAGI, experts say. With the steep tax penalty between $500,000 and $600,000, you may reconsider Roth individual retirement conversions, incurring large capital gains or other moves that could boost your income, according to Keebler.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the last day of Prime Day, you have until tonight to score one of the best air purifier deals. If you're sensitive to pollen, pet dander, or smoke, an air purifier can help filter the air in your home — giving you relief from allergy flare-ups. Thankfully, some of our top picks for the best air purifiers are deeply discounted right now. One of our favorite brands is Coway, and its Airmega Mighty Air Purifier, our favorite air purifier we tested, is down to its lowest price of the year at $155. Top brands like Shark are also discounted during Prime Day. Although some of the models below didn't earn top spots in our tests, we've included them because their prices are down to lows we've not seen in as much as a year, and we've tested and trusted the brands. For other air quality deals, check out our round-up of the best Prime Day air conditioner and dehumidifier deals. You can also save on everything from TVs and headphones to clothing and beauty products we're curating in our Prime Day deals hub. If you're on a budget and want to clean the air in a smaller room, the Lasko LP300 HEPA Tower Air Purifier is your best bet with its good purifying capabilities and low upfront and filter costs. Turn your home into a respite from the outdoor air with this medical-grade HEPA purifier. From one of our favorite air purifier brands, the Levoit Core 300 is a solid investment for keeping your air clean without breaking the bank. Blueair is one of the top names in air purifiers, and the Blue Pure 511 offers HEPA filtration at a budget price. This AROEVE air purifier is designed for large rooms, and removes dust, smoke, pet dander, and more from the air. If you need a powerful, energy-efficient air purifier for medium to large rooms, the Airmega AP-1521HH Mighty is your best option. The Levoit 300S Air Purifier does an outstanding job removing VOCs from small rooms and features a user-friendly app. Winix's large room True-HEPA air purifier (up to 1,700 square feet) has a washable carbon filter that not only purifies air but helps remove odors from smoke, cooking odors, and other household smells. The Dreo Air Purifier Tower Fan is a 2-in-1 design that quietly cools and purifies. It pairs with an app to provide historical air quality and temperature data. However, it didn't perform well at removing VOCs from the air. We tested a larger, pricier version of the Shark NeverChange Air Purifier Max and were impressed with its purifying performance in our tests. This model is virtually identical but designed for medium-sized rooms. HEPA filters are the gold standard for air purifiers. According to the EPA, a HEPA filter can remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micron airborne particles, which include pollen, bacteria, mold, and dust. We primarily only recommend air purifiers with true HEPA filters. An air purifier can help during a smoke emergency. Experts recommend running an air purifier with a HEPA filter, like one of our top picks from Coway or Lasko. One of the best air conditioners with a good HVAC filter can also supply some relief. Check out our roundup of all of the best Prime Day deals, or browse Amazon's website for the full selection. We highlight products and services you might find interesting. If you buy them, we may get a small share of the revenue from the sale from our partners. We may receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flight 127 departed Madrid around 1 p.m. local time on Sunday and was supposed to land in New York seven hours later. Roughly an hour later, it landed at Lajes Airport on the Portuguese island of Terceira. Marc Viscardi, a passenger on the flight, told Business Insider he was "very thankful to be home after our very scary ordeal." He also said that after the unplanned landing, a cabin crew member said "Welcome to the Azores," which he criticized as "tone deaf." "As safety comes before all else at Delta, the flight crew followed procedures to divert to Lajes, Azores, after indication of a mechanical issue with an engine," said an airline spokesperson. Losing an engine's functionality can be frightening, although pilots are well trained in such situations. About five hours after Flight 127 landed in the Azores, flight-tracking data shows another A330 left JFK Airport. Viscardi told BI he was unhappy with Delta's communication, only learning about the rescue flight via text message hours after landing in the Azores. He added that text alerts were "incomplete, vague, and often contradictory." The second plane arrived at Lajes shortly after 2 a.m. local time, before leaving around 9 p.m. on Monday. ET — roughly 31 hours after passengers expected to touch down on US soil. "We sincerely apologize to our customers for their experience and delay in their travels," the Delta spokesperson said. The flight had 282 passengers and 13 crew members. In that incident, passengers spent 12 hours on the island and some complained about a lack of communication from Delta before another plane arrived to take them on to New York. Airlines typically try to divert flights back to their origins or hub airports when possible, because this makes it easier to reroute passengers and repair any problems with the aircraft. However, in cases like these, concerns about safety can require landing at the closest available airport. In a similar case last year, Air France had to cancel a flight so the plane could be used to rescue passengers who were diverted to a remote town in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unloaded roughly $36.4 million worth of stock in the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The sale, which totals 225,000 shares, comes as part of Huang's previously adopted plan in March to unload up to six million shares of Nvidia through the end of the year. He sold his first batch of stock from the agreement in June, equaling about $15 million. Huang's net worth has skyrocketed as investors bet on Nvidia's AI dominance and graphics processing units powering large language models. The 62-year-old's wealth has grown by more than a quarter, or about $29 billion, since the start of 2025 alone, based on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. His net worth last stood at $143 billion in the index, putting him neck-and-neck with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett at $144 billion. Shortly after the market opened Friday, Fortune's analysis of net worth had Huang ahead of Buffett, with the Nvidia CEO at $143.7 billion and the Oracle of Omaha at $142.1 billion. The company has also achieved its own notable milestones this year, as it prospers off the AI boom. On Wednesday, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker became the first company to top a $4 trillion market capitalization, beating out both Microsoft and Apple. The chipmaker closed above that milestone Thursday as CNBC reported that the technology titan met with President Donald Trump. Brooke Seawell, venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, sold about $24 million worth of Nvidia shares, according to an SEC filing. Huang still holds more than 858 million shares of Nvidia, both directly and indirectly, in different partnerships and trusts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts. I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though. Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro. This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus. Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers. OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below. device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers). Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills. If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp. Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus. If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line. Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen. I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit. They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too. Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today. You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past. I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home. Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights. As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area. I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate. This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen. No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water. If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good. I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type. Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit. The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying. The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it. For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year. Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks. A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. [Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day. One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures. These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price. Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday. Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise. This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later. The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top models are often expensive, but there's still time to grab an excellent discount for Prime Day. Amazon's big sale has entered its final day, but we're still seeing great savings. The best Prime Day laptop deals include low prices on entry-level and midrange systems perfect for school and high-end models geared toward hardcore gamers. If you just want a cheap laptop for everyday browsing, check out the Asus Vivobook Go, which is only $220 for Prime Day. Meanwhile, gamers who want a solid system on a budget should check out this Acer Nitro V laptop with an RTX 4050 graphics card, which is 19% off for Prime Day. Apple fans can also save on select MacBooks, including $150 off the latest 13-inch MacBook Air. Keep scrolling to find all of the best Amazon Prime Day laptop deals so far. These discounts are set to expire at midnight, so don't hesitate to grab a deal before they're gone. And you can browse more of the event's best discounts in our complete Amazon Prime Day deals hub. This Vivobook Go by Asus with a 15.6-inch FHD display is excellent value for a basic laptop for casual workloads. This is a solid budget laptop for work and school. It has a touchscreen display and an entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 processor. That said, this isn't a good fit for power users who like to multitask with lots of apps open at once. This affordable Dell laptop uses an older Intel processor, so it's not meant for power users or people looking for a cutting-edge model with new AI features. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price. It's expensive, but this high-end gaming laptop has top-tier hardware, including an Intel Core Ultra 9, a powerful GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, and a big 18-inch screen. The newest MacBook Air is powered by an M4 chip for ultimate speed and efficiency. The 13-inch, 16 GB laptop comes in traditional silver and three other sky-inspired colors. The M4 MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, compared to the 8GB standard in previous generations, which is more appropriate for demanding workloads. Anyone running on older M1 or Intel MacBook Pros will experience notable performance gains with the M4 model. This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16 GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage. One of the biggest differences is that gaming laptops have more powerful graphics cards (GPUs), components that let them play modern games with realistic visuals. They also tend to have stronger processors (CPUs), meaning programs and files open faster and are better for multitasking. These laptops are great for users who want to play games, edit 4K videos, and quickly switch between dozens of apps. More typical laptops can have a range of CPUs, from basic to advanced, to power productivity apps like a web browser or the Microsoft Office suite. They usually have integrated graphics rather than powerful GPUs but offer significantly better battery life, as well as lighter and more portable designs. But they're often outfitted with customizable lights that give the keyboard and chassis a sleek neon glow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European stock markets have given up some of their recent gains by tumbling on the last trading day of the week, while waiting on an expected EU tariff letter from White House. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were both lower by around 0.9%. But according to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, there remains a greater risk that interest rates will instead need to be hiked again than most people believe. I would put that as a cause for concern," Dimon told an event at Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, arguing that there is a significant possibility of inflation becoming problematic again for the U.S. Read more of Dimon's comments — including why Europe is "losing" to the U.S. and China on global competitiveness — here. Market optimism that drove record highs for U.K. and Wall Street stocks on Thursday showed signs of fading, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index down nearly 1% at midday in London, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures falling 0.7%. Gains this week have come despite a slew of tariff announcements that might previously have shaken markets, including 25% duties on trading partners including Japan, a 50% rate on Brazil, and a higher-than-expected 50% rate on all copper imports. "Whether this is investors being reminded of headwinds or simply pausing for breath, it's clear that uncertainty will prevail well into the summer," Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said in a note. Coatsworth added that next week's focus is set to shift to earnings — kicked off by the U.S. big banks — providing a key insight into how companies are grappling with global uncertainty. China's demand for petrol and diesel is falling as electric vehicle sales surge, but the trend is being masked by the country's massive strategic stockpiling of crude oil, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday. This coincides with a 50% year-on-year jump in EV sales in the first half of 2025, which is directly "eating into end-user demand," Toril Bosoni, head of oil industry and markets division at the IEA, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday. Despite this, China's crude inventories swelled by 80 million barrels in the second quarter, absorbing a global supply glut, according to the agency. "Chinese companies taking a more strategic role and boosting reserves for energy security reasons," Bosoni added. Shares of Britain's BP rose 2% in mid-morning deals following the oil giant's trading update. "Finally some encouraging news from BP, with a 2Q25 outlook statement that should reverse the swath of negative revisions that consensus has made in recent weeks," Citi analyst Alastair Syme said in a research note. "We make minor adjustments to our estimates, last published back in May, but still sit c.15-20% above where consensus has moved to in recent weeks," Syme said. CNBC's Sam Meredith has been reporting from the Norwegian capital Oslo this week, where strong Tesla sales are defying a wider European slump. Check out his findings on why the Scandinavian country has emerged as a rare bright spot for the U.S. electric vehicle maker. Sales rose double digits in America and Asia, while the group confirmed its expectations for annual sales growth of about 10% this year and next. The U.K. meanwhile said it will pump 163 million euros ($190.5 million) into satellite operator Eutelsat, an aspiring rival to Elon Musk's Starlink. European governments view Eutelsat as a way to increase sovereign space capabilities and reduce European reliance on U.S. firms for satellite communications and defence. Sterling is trading lower after the U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank in May. Some economists say the weak growth figures mean the Bank of England is now more likely to cut interest rates in August. Economist Paul Dales forecast that U.K. GDP would rise by a "fairly subdued" 1% this year "due to the lingering drags from a weakening global economy and the rises in domestic taxes for UK businesses." Sentiment has clearly soured in Europe after four days of solid gains, with all Stoxx 600 sectors except oil and gas and insurance opening in the red on Friday. News of 35% U.S. tariffs set to be slapped on Canada from the start of August, along with the White House's 50% duty on all copper imports, may have reignited some concerns around global growth. Investors had largely brushed off a slew of tariff announcements this week, sending the U.K.'s FTSE 100 as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs. The big question now is what rate the European Union is facing, after weeks of negotiations over a framework trade deal. President Donald Trump indicated last night that the EU would receive a letter setting out its tariffs today. British oil major BP on Friday flagged lower oil and gas sales in the second quarter and an after-tax impairment of up to $1.5 billion across its portfolio. In a trading update released ahead of full second-quarter results on Aug. 5, the energy company said its gas and low-carbon sales will hit earnings by between $100 million and $300 million over the April-June stretch, also noting "average" results from the company's gas trading arm. In the oil products segment, BP said stronger realized refining margins would be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, and that "oil trading result is expected to be strong." BP has been struggling to recalibrate its strategic direction amid underperformance in its share price compared with oil and gas peers, particularly in the U.S. Speculation has been mounting in recent months over whether the company could become an acquisition target. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index notched a fourth daily gain on Thursday, but IG futures are pointing to a broadly negative open for major bourses on Friday. The big news overnight is that U.S. President Donald Trump will lift tariffs on imports from Canada to 35% from Aug. 1, and warned that the duty might be increased if Ottawa retaliates. Investors are also standing by in anticipation of the release of a letter from Trump in which he is expected to outline tariffs the European Union will face, after he told NBC News that he would be issuing tariffs "over the next couple of hours" to both the EU and Canada.

Trump's Tariffs:

Delta airlines Airbus planes at LaGuardia airport in New York.

Delta Air Lines Inc. has been cannibalizing new Airbus SE jets in Europe by stripping off their engines and using them to get grounded planes in the US back into service, as it seeks to overcome a shortage and avoid aircraft import tariffs.

The airline has been taking US-made Pratt & Whitney engines off new European-built A321neos and shipping them back to the States without any duties, according to people familiar with the matter. The engine-less aircraft, meanwhile, remain in Europe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a year before "F1: The Movie" would eventually hit theaters, Apple struck a deal with IMAX. The studio secured the use of IMAX's camera technology as well as a three-week release in its theaters, a partnership that helped the film generate nearly $300 million globally in its first 10 days in cinemas. More than 20% of that haul came from IMAX screenings. That feat is made even more impressive by the fact that IMAX screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide. Two other films released this year have exceeded 20% market share for the company — Warner Bros.' "Sinners" and Paramount's "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning." It's a sign of strength for IMAX's place in the rapidly evolving film industry. IMAX has long been a coveted destination for theatrical releases, but as consumer tastes continue to shift toward premium experiences, it's quickly gaining market share and poised for exponential growth in the coming years. CEO Rich Gelfond is forecasting a $1.2 billion year at the global box for the company, which would be 33% higher than 2024's haul and a record for the 55-year-old business. Wall Street analysts expect 2026 will be even better. "Post-pandemic a lot of activities, especially event activities, have really done well [for] premium brands," Gelfond told CNBC. "You look at concerts, ticket prices went up. You look at sporting events, same kind of thing. I think people, although they enjoy staying at home, streaming and watching streaming products, when they go out of the home, they want something sufficient distinguished from that." IMAX screens are notably larger than standard movie screens and the theaters feature immersive audio systems. "This year, we have eight movies in a row in North America that were filmed with IMAX cameras, and typically the box office goes higher when you shoot with the cameras," Gelfond said. "And there's a couple reasons for that. But also, the filmmakers typically get behind it more, and they tell their audiences that it's the best way to see their work. These "filmed for IMAX" titles include features like Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer," Denis Villeneuve's "Dune" films and even the latest "Mission: Impossible" flick from Tom Cruise. Tickets to see a film in IMAX typically cost a few dollars more than standard movie tickets, which can help to boost a box office haul. As you see margins improve in 2025, you're going to see not just better quality title signings in 2026, but what I expect to see is that the studios will take more ownership of the marketing campaigns with even greater upside." Roth's Eric Handler said that IMAX has a "high-class problem of too much content availability." The "F1" deal for three weeks of screen programming meant that Universal's "Jurassic World Rebirth" got edged out: the film missed out on a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. Domestically, the movie slate is strong is 2025 and 2026, with a number of major franchise film releases on the books. Warner Bros.' "Superman" hits theaters Friday, and coming soon is Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps." Then Universal's "Wicked: For Good" arrives ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday and Disney's "Avatar: Fire and Ash" hits theaters just before Christmas. 2026 kicks off with Amazon's "Project Hail Mary" and will also feature a new Avengers film, the first theatrical Star Wars release since 2019, a sequel to "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," a live-action "Moana" as well as "Toy Story 5" and "Shrek 5." New Hollywood releases are just one piece of IMAX's box office success. "Not only are they benefiting from Hollywood's recovery, they're also taking advantage of the global footprint and showing local language movies in China, in Japan and South Korea and parts of Europe," said Eric Handler, analyst at Roth. He noted that "Ne Zha 2," a Chinese release that has generated more than $2 billion in global ticket sales, was a particularly strong local language film for IMAX. And there's still room for IMAX to grow. Gelfond told CNBC that the company has contracts to build about 500 more IMAX screens. He said the company would share more specific details during its earnings report, which is due to be released later this month. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22. "That's when we started to really take out the top range," said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. "It's expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug," he added, nodding to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is expected to increase the federal deficit – and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin. This week's move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $550 million in short liquidations and ether more than $195 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated. Rates have been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That's when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the "termination" of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank's stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion. Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen. "Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not," Thielen said. "So we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer." For the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain and its best week since April 25, while ether is up more than 21%, heading for its west week since May 9.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's tariffs on Asian trading partners may ultimately pose less of a threat to regional markets than investors initially feared, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. Although the tariffs are expected to have a lingering impact, they could actually support investor confidence. But investors need clarity on what's coming, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Thursday note. "The fundamental growth impact may not be as negative as markets feared in early 2Q and the actual tariff announcements may serve as a risk-positive 'clearing event', even if the rates imposed are somewhat above current baseline expectations," the analysts wrote. They added that a stable and predictable tariff regime could actually improve investor risk appetite. Trump has notified around two dozen countries that new levies on their goods will begin on August 1 unless new trade deals are reached. North Asian markets in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan would face the highest revenue exposure to the US within Asian equity markets. By contrast, Southeast Asian markets and domestically oriented sectors — including utilities, banks, telecoms, and real estate — are far less exposed. Regional earnings could drop by 1% for every 5 percentage-point increase in tariffs, Goldman Sachs' analysis shows. Lower US short-term interest rates and a weaker dollar could partially offset the damage. The Federal Reserve's easing cycle may drive investors toward higher-yielding assets in Asia. A weaker dollar could also help Asian firms that rely on dollar-denominated borrowing, indirectly supporting growth. Asia markets sold off sharply after Trump made his first tariff announcement on "Liberation Day" but mostly recovered. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 is up about 1% year to date, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 25% thanks to an extra boost from a Chinese AI-driven surge.</p>
