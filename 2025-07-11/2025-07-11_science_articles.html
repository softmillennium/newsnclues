                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has said she will hold a hearing on geoengineering as conspiracy theories have swirled around cloud seeding after the recent floods in Texas Chair of the Subcommittee on Delivering On Government Efficiency (DOGE) U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-SC) presides over a hearing of the House Oversight Subcommittee in the Rayburn House Office Building on February 12, 2025 in Washington, D.C. CLIMATEWIRE | On a day when the EPA administrator elevated concerns about weather modification as his agency downplayed those worries, an outspoken House Republican said she would hold a hearing on the issue. In a statement provided to POLITICO's E&E News, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she plans to use her perch as a subcommittee chair on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel to investigate geoengineering, a nascent field in which chemicals are dispersed in the air to lower temperatures. “Let's be clear: Weather modification is no longer a ‘conspiracy theory.' It's real, it's happening, and the American people deserve a voice,” said Greene, who in the past has peddled fringe theories.

Such baseless assertions have been widespread in the aftermath of the deadly floods in Texas this past weekend, including that cloud seeding may have played a role in the disaster. On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin released a video empathizing with people who have questions about contrails and geoengineering, which have been fodder for online conspiracists. In her statement Thursday, Greene said that she planned to hold a hearing of her DOGE subcommittee "on this critical issue and advancing my legislation to make it a felony to inject, release, or disperse chemicals into the atmosphere for the purpose of altering weather, climate, temperature, or sunlight.” Moreover, this past weekend, Greene posted on social media that she planned to introduce legislation to bar such weather-changing technology. or seen headlines about private actors and even governments looking to blot out the sun in the name of stopping global warming, we've endeavored to answer all of your questions at the links on your screen." He added, “In fact, EPA shares many of the same concerns when it comes to potential threats to human health and the environment, especially from solar geoengineering activities.” In her statement, Greene said she spoke with Zeldin on Thursday morning. Some have suspected cloud seeding could have caused the drenching rain in Kerr County, Texas, leading to flooding that killed more than 100 people. That has been deemed impossible by experts, The Washington Post reported, and dismissed by elected officials, including Republicans in the state. “Let's put an end to the conspiracy theories and stop blaming others,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're already seeing substantial savings on some seriously iconic Lego sets. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Prime Day is a great time to stock up on some of the more highly sought-after sets on Amazon, and we typically find some pretty killer deals during the big event. This year, though, we're spotting unprecedented savings of up to nearly 60 percent on some of the most iconic Star Wars, Nintendo, Marvel, and DC sets. The problem with shopping Lego during Prime Day is that these items often sell out, so if you see a deal you want to shop, don't wait until the last minute. Plus, you can lock in that Millennium Falcon set you've had your eye on for months now without worrying about it going out of stock. This is truly a grail piece for Star Wars collectors, whether you're an avid Lego fan or not. The authentically detailed piece is not only 20 percent off, but it is, in all likelihood, the most affordable replica Falcon piece you'll find, period. It also comes with a Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary Brick you can display alongside the toy. Currently 30 percent off, this faux Lamborghini makes a great display piece for hobbyist collectors. Featuring a stunning, realistic design with authentic features, the Lamborghini model is a must-have for car enthusiasts of all ages. Batfans will appreciate this one—a replica Tumbler Batmobile from the Nolan-era films, along with Christian Bale's Batman facing off with the Joker and Harvey Dent himself. The minifigures are surprisingly detailed, and anyone who is a fan of the Lego Batman movies knows this is a pretty awesome fusion between Nolan's gritty films and the campy Lego adventures of Will Arnett's Caped Crusader. This other Nintendo-licensed set is from the popular Animal Crossing series. This Clone Wars Ahsoka spaceship set comes with some pretty awesome mini figures, including Ahsoka Tano herself,  Anakin Skywalker, and an R7-A7 Lego droid figure. If you're a fan of the Avengers films and want to channel your inner Thanos, this Infinity Gauntlet replica set is the perfect early Prime Day steal. And with over 2o percent in savings, it's a pretty fantastic deal, too. Here we have another addition to the list from Disney, and you'll certainly be singing "Hakuna Matata" after nabbing this Simba replica for a whopping 50 percent off. Not sure if I've ever seen a Disney-licensed Lego set this heavily discounted before, so you're going to want to jump on this before it's sold out. While not every “live-action” Disney remake has received rave reviews, its most recent rehash, Lilo and Stitch, has garnered some pretty solid marks across the board. Stich has become an iconic Disney character, and there's no better way to celebrate the pesky alien than a good old-fashioned replica Lego set. In this case, Stitch is enjoying some ice cream while donning a fun Hawaiian shirt, which perfectly encapsulates his personality. It can be built in three different ways, including a three-story canal house with an attic office, an art gallery and café, or a lakeside holiday home. You're essentially getting three sets for the price of one here, and it's now 40 percent off, to boot. For those passionate about nature, this three-piece Insect collector's set is a more than viable option. Now 20 percent off, the popular set features a stunning blue morpho butterfly, an impressive Chinese mantis replica, and a highly detailed Hercules beetle. R2-D2 is arguably the most iconic droid of the Star Wars series (although his cohort C-3P0 might have something to say about that). Either way, this is an impressive piece on sale for a great price. Getting it at a discount is just icing on the cake. You can kill two birds with one stone here—grab a piece of iconic art and take your time to build it out from scratch? Actually, make it killing three birds—you're also getting a fantastic pre-Prime Day deal here on a set that doesn't go on sale all that often. This 3D piece of Japanese artwork makes a great gift and represents an excellent display option. This is a two-for-one auto special—two very different Mercedes vehicles in one all-encompassing set. This toy also features two Lego mini figure “drivers,” in addition to a pair of highly detailed collectible cars. Anakin Skywalker made his mark during the legendary podrace in Episode I, so it's no surprise that a dynamic diorama was created in honor of the fictional race. And for over 30 percent off retail, you really can't go wrong here. If you want a similarly awesome piece of replica French architecture, consider this recently marked-down set of the Paris skyline, featuring famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, and more. The set is scaled accurately and, as a little kicker, comes with a complimentary booklet containing all types of information about the designer, architecture, and history of every structure. If you want to skip the building and go straight to the collecting, you can always opt for some BrickHeadz. This Star Wars collectors' piece features the main characters from the first prequel—Jar Jar Binks, Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Captain Panaka, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul, as well as some authentic accessories. Enjoy the spoils of Legos without having to, well, do anything. Other than buy them at a discount, of course. If you haven't been able to get your hands on one, well, at least you'll be able to immerse yourself in the world of Mario and co. with this Piranha Plant Lego set. Now 20 percent off, this buildable plant is iconic and represents the treachery our favorite fictional plumber faces in nearly every game. He has a strong affinity for cats, Batman, and early 90's Nicolas Cage films, in that order. Prime Day Generator Deals 2025: All The Best Sales</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For most people, the term “busy beaver” brings to mind a tireless worker or (for the biologists among us) an absolutely vital ecosystem engineer. However, for mathematicians, “busy beaver” takes on a similar-yet-unique meaning. True to the moniker's original intent, the idea represents a lot of work, but it's work pointed at a question. As computer scientists Christopher Moore puts it in a video for Quanta Magazine, “What's the longest, most-complicated thing [a computer] can do, and then stop?” In other words, what's the longest function a computer can run that does not just run forever, stuck in an infinite loop? Each state produces a certain number of programs, and each program gets its own Turing machine, so things get complicated fast. BB(1), which has just 1 state, necessitates the use of 25 Turing machines. For decades, many mathematicians believed that solving the Busy Beaver number to four states was the upper limit, but a group of experts managed to confirmed the BB(5) solution in 2024 (on Discord, of all places). Now, participants in that same Busy Beaver Challenge are learning fascinating truths about the next frontier—BB(6)—and how it just might represent the very edge of mathematics, according to a new report by New Scientist. The Busy Beaver number was first formulated by the Hungarian mathematician Tiber Radó in 1962, and 12 years passed before computer scientist Allen Brady determined that BB(4) runs for 107 steps before halting. For decades, this seemed like the absolute limit of what was discernible, but then mathematicians solved BB(5) in 2024 after sifting through 17 trillion (with a t) possible Turing machines. Quanta Magazine has an excellent explainer about how this was achieved. Of course, adding just one more rule makes the problem beyond super exponentially harder, as BB(6) is estimated to require 60 quadrillion Turing machines. “The Busy Beaver problem gives you a very concrete scale for pondering the frontier of mathematical knowledge,” computer scientist Tristan Stérin, who helped start the Busy Beaver Challenge in 2022, told New Scientist. In a new post, anonymous user “mxdys”—who was instrumental in finally confirming BB(5)—wrote that the answer to BB(6) is likely so unfathomably large that the number itself likely needs its own explanation, as it's likely too big to describe via exponentiation. Instead, it relies on tetration (written as, say, yx, as opposed to exponentiation's xy) in which where the exponent is also iterated, creating a tower of exponents. As Scott Aaronson, an American computer scientist who helped define BB(5), notes on his blog, that means 1510 can be thought of as “10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15 times.” One mathematician speaking with New Scientist said that it's likely that the number of all atoms in the universe would look “puny” by comparison. It's unlikely that mathematicians will ever solve BB(6), but if the Busy Beaver Challenge is any evidence, that fact likely won't stop them from trying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The competition between these two mega-retailers is heating up for discounts on one of our favorite tool brands. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Unless you're living under a rock, no doubt you've been busy shopping Amazon Prime Day, which kicked off earlier this week and runs through tomorrow, Friday, July 11. But when we did a side-by-side comparison of sales on Milwaukee tools, it turns out that Walmart had the deeper discounts, with savings up to 50 percent off. For example, our favorite cordless angle grinder is currently 44 percent off at Walmart (compared to a mere 21 percent off on Amazon). The angle grinder's max speed is a solid 5,800 rpm, and the tool features an impressive lineup of safety features, including overload protection and an electronic clutch. "It also comes equipped with a removable side handle that gives you tremendous control over the tool to keep you safe and your cuts accurate and straight," says Tony Carrick, one of our tool experts in his favorite Milwaukee tools story. These 18-volt batteries are compatible with over 150 M18 cordless tools and have a 6-amp-hour capacity. They also come with overload protection and a three-year warranty. And finally, you can't beat 40 percent off this mid-torque impact wrench at Walmart. "It produces 550 foot-pounds of fastening and 650 foot-pounds of loosening torque, yet it measures just six inches long and weighs only five pounds when loaded with the recommended 5Ah battery,"  Carrick says. At just 4.9 inches long, this is the most compact tool in its class. That makes it a better value than the Amazon kit, which lacks one. "This driver puts out tremendous power with a max torque of 2,000 inch-pounds and runs at a top speed of 3,900 RPM," says Carrick. The hammer drill is only 6.9 inches in length to get into tight spaces, and the impact driver's trigger is ultra-responsive for precise fastening.

Rolling into its final day, the shopping event offers some of the best discounts on a wide range of items, including tools and TVs. Some of the biggest discounts are on typically expensive items, including electric scooters. Electric scooters are great both as a fun way to get around town and as a portable everyday commuter for work or school. Throughout Prime Day, electric scooters from top-rated brands that we've reviewed and tested are on sale for hundreds off. Many of these scooters are likely to sell out before the final day ends, so make sure to check out all of our top picks before it's too late. With that in mind, check out our picks for the best electric scooter deals below. This electric scooter from Gotrax doesn't have quite the same range as more expensive models, but the quality motor still boasts 12 miles on a single charge for a fraction of the price. The honeycomb-style solid tires are designed to resist punctures and will never go flat. While many electric scooters rely solely on a front brake, the V40 from Navee comes with a dual-braking system that slows down both tires simultaneously. This helps you reduce speed more safely and lowers the chance of toppling over or falling on a hard brake. The scooter also has a speedy top range of 20 miles per hour. If you want a high-end model while it's on sale, consider the KQi Air electric scooter. Made of carbon fiber, the scooter is relatively lightweight, considering the powerful motor that runs for up to 31 miles on a single charge. This makes it ideal for running errands and picking up groceries without using your car. The seat also keeps you off your feet after hours of shopping. The ES4 from Segway is a sound middle ground option for city commuters and casual riders. It comes with a kickstand for easy upright storage and features turn signals on both the handlebars and the rear for improved visibility at night. This popular and affordable model from Segway has a range of just 16 miles but comes with a speedy motor that makes for perfect fun riding around town. This scooter also features front and rear lights for use at night. Furthermore, the Ninebot E2 is water resistant for comfortable riding in light rain or through puddles. If you plan to use your scooter for longer-range rides, this Max G2 is a perfect choice. The scooter boasts a range of up to 43 miles and can reach speeds of up to 22 miles per hour. Prior to his work here, he previously covered product reviews, startup news, pop culture and even professional wrestling. In his free time, he enjoys watching pretentious TV, low-brow movies, and exercising for beauty, not health. Forget Prime: Up to 50% Off Milwaukee Tools at Walmart</p>

Nature Reviews Cancer (2025)Cite this article Ageing is an important risk factor for cancer incidence and augments cancer progression. A shared hallmark of ageing and cancer is metabolic reprogramming, which has been suggested to be not only a cause but also a consequence of ageing. Strikingly, many age-regulated pathways are known to also drive tumour progression, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming connects ageing and tumorigenic processes and shapes whether malignant phenotypes manifest, thrive and evolve. With the rising average age of the world population, understanding how age-related changes in the body influence cancer progression is of paramount importance. In this Perspective, we discuss the metabolic changes that occur with ageing and their potential links with tumour initiation and progression and the development of metastatic disease. Finally, we discuss age-induced metabolic divergences that cause racial disparities and their consequences for the tumorigenic process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A mystery interstellar object discovered last week is likely to be the oldest comet ever seen - possibly predating our solar system by more than three billion years, researchers say. The "water ice-rich" visitor, named 3I/ATLAS, is only the third known object from beyond our solar system ever spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood and the first to reach us from a completely different region of our Milky Way galaxy. It could be more than seven billion years old, according to University of Oxford astronomer Matthew Hopkins - who is discussing his findings at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham - and may be the most remarkable interstellar visitor yet. "All non-interstellar comets such as Halley's comet formed with our solar system, so are up to 4.5 billion years old," Hopkins said. "But interstellar visitors have the potential to be far older, and of those known about so far our statistical method suggests that 3I/ATLAS is very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen." Hopkins' research predicts that, because 3I/ATLAS likely formed around an old, thick-disk star, it should be rich in water ice. "We think there's a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system, and that it's been drifting through interstellar space ever since." If confirmed, this could have implications for how many similar objects future telescopes, such as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are likely to detect. "We're in an exciting time: 3I is already showing signs of activity. "Some of the biggest telescopes in the world are already observing this new interstellar object - one of them may be able to find out!" It happened as they were gearing up for the beginning of survey operations with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which their model predicts will discover between 5 and 50 interstellar objects. "The discovery of 3I suggests that prospects for Rubin may now be more optimistic; we may find about 50 objects, of which some would be similar in size to 3I. The team's findings come from applying a model developed during Hopkins' doctoral research, which simulates the properties of interstellar objects based on their orbits and likely stellar origins. Just a week before the comet's discovery, Hopkins had defended his thesis, and when 3I/ATLAS was announced, he was set to go on holiday. Instead, he found himself comparing real-time data to his predictions. "It's a fantastic opportunity to test our model on something brand new and possibly ancient."

Scientists have grown hearts, liver and lung organoids with blood vessels.Credit: National Institutes of Health/Science Photo Library Researchers are making ever more sophisticated mini organs in the lab — and now they can grow their own blood vessels. But most organoids lack the vessels that transport blood, nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, which has restricted their size, function and ability to mature. Last month in Science1 and Cell2, two separate teams reported creating vascularized organoids using a new approach that grows the organoids with vessels from their earliest stages. The first attempts to vascularize organoids involved growing blood vessel tissue in a dish and then combining it with other cell types to form ‘assembloids'3. But these models were still limited in their ability to mimic the structure and maturity of real organs. While growing epithelial cells, which form the outer lining of some organs and tissues, several research teams, including a group at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, reported4 that their organoids also spontaneously formed non-epithelial cells of a type that lines the blood vessels. These cells are typically seen as ‘contaminants' to get rid of, but the Ann Arbor group tried to amplify that contamination in intestinal organoids. Capitalizing on the surprise find by other groups, Yifei Miao, a stem-cell biologist at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing and his colleagues decided to see whether they could control the simultaneous growth of both types of cell — epithelial and blood-vessel cells — in the same dish, starting with lung and gut organoids. But in early development, epithelial and blood-vessel cells require entirely opposing molecular triggers to grow.

Nature Climate Change (2025)Cite this article Global surface temperatures since the 1980s, when near-global satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) measurements became available, are presumed to be well known. Satellite-era warming trends in four commonly used global (land and ocean) temperature reconstructions agree closely, yet whether SST datasets also agree is unclear. Here we show that trends in four widely used SST datasets show first-order differences, with 1982–2024 60° S to 60° N trends ranging from 0.108 to 0.184 °C per decade. These large discrepancies are perplexing given the agreement between global temperature datasets and the fact that 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by ocean, but are legible upon recognizing that global temperature datasets use two SST fields whose trends agree more closely than those of the four SST datasets. Considering the trend uncertainty across SST datasets widens the range of plausible global temperature trends and impacts interpretations of recent record global temperatures, with implications for observational and model-based climate studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team led by Eske Willerslev, professor at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge, has recovered ancient DNA from 214 known human pathogens in prehistoric humans from Eurasia. The study shows, among other things, that the earliest known evidence of zoonotic diseases -- illnesses transmitted from animals to humans, like COVID in recent times -- dates back to around 6,500 years ago, with such diseases becoming more widespread approximately 5,000 years ago. The researchers analyzed DNA from over 1,300 prehistoric individuals, some up to 37,000 years old. "We've long suspected that the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease -- now DNA shows us that it happened at least 6,500 years ago," says Professor Eske Willerslev. "These infections didn't just cause illness -- they may have contributed to population collapse, migration, and genetic adaptation."

Nature Catalysis (2025)Cite this article Dual sites, positioned through atomically precise proximity coordination for C–C coupling, serve as an exemplary platform for CO2-to-C2H4 conversion. Nonetheless, their surface-only distribution results in inefficient photogenerated electron injection via long-range migration from the bulk phase, leading to inadequate site charge to drive the consecutive electron transfers for C2H4 synthesis. Here we demonstrate a reticular dual-site photocatalyst design by embedding semiconductor units (TiO2, polymeric carbon nitride or WO3·H2O) within ligand-defective copper-based metal–organic frameworks (CuBTC-D/PC). This system demonstrates a 75.5% selectivity in converting CO2 to C2H4 with H2O as the electron donor. The reticular copper dual sites facilitate short-range photogenerated electron transfer from the photocatalyst to active sites, ensuring a sufficient electron concentration for all elementary steps in C2H4 conversion. Enhanced electron injection allows for high C2H4 selectivity even under low-intensity irradiation (~0.4 Sun), demonstrating suitability for solar-driven applications. This work establishes the feasibility of CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 as a primary product, providing insights into multi-electron CO2 photoreduction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, Australian scientists have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate a ready-to-use biological protein, in this case, one that can kill antibiotic resistant bacteria like E. coli. This study, published in Nature Communications, provides a new way to combat the growing crisis caused by antibiotic resistant super bugs. By using AI in this way, Australian science has now joined countries like the US and China having developed AI platforms capable of rapidly generating thousands of ready-to-use proteins, paving the way for faster, more affordable drug development and diagnostics that could transform biomedical research and patient care. The Nature Communications paper is co-led by Dr. Rhys Grinter and Associate Professor Gavin Knott, a Snow Medical Fellow, who lead the new AI Protein Design Program with nodes at the University of Melbourne Bio21 Institute and Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute. "These proteins are now being developed as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors, with many other applications yet to be tested" Associate Professor Knott said. According to Dr Grinter, currently proteins used in the treatment of diseases like cancer or infections are derived from nature and repurposed through rational design or in vitro evolution and selection. Professor John Carroll, Director of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, said the new AI Protein Design Program 'brings Australia "right up to speed in this exciting new modality for designing novel therapeutics and research tools. It is testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of two fabulous young scientists who have worked night and day to build this capability from scratch." This in-depth knowledge of protein structure and machine learning makes us a highly agile program capable of regularly onboarding cutting edge tools in AI-protein design," Associate Professor Knott said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pain isn't just a physical sensation -- it also carries emotional weight. That distress, anguish, and anxiety can turn a fleeting injury into long-term suffering. Researchers at the Salk Institute have now identified a brain circuit that gives physical pain its emotional tone, revealing a new potential target for treating chronic and affective pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The affective part of pain is what makes it so unpleasant. How much we suffer or feel threatened by pain is determined by our affective processing, and if that becomes too sensitive or lasts too long, it can result in a pain disorder. However, previous studies using older research methods have suggested the circuitry of pain may be more complex. This long-standing debate inspired Han and his team to revisit the question with modern research tools. This particular group of neurons in the thalamus can be identified by their expression of CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), a neuropeptide originally discovered in Professor Ronald Evans' lab at Salk. When the researchers "turned off" (genetically silenced) these CGRP neurons, the mice still reacted to mild pain stimuli, such as heat or pressure, indicating their sensory processing was intact. However, they didn't seem to associate lasting negative feelings with these situations, failing to show any learned fear or avoidance behaviors in future trials. On the other hand, when these same neurons were "turned on" (optogenetically activated), the mice showed clear signs of distress and learned to avoid that area, even when no pain stimuli had been used. "Understanding the biology behind these two distinct processes will help us find treatments for the kinds of pain that don't respond to traditional drugs." Many chronic pain conditions -- such as fibromyalgia and migraine -- involve long, intense, unpleasant experiences of pain, often without a clear physical source or injury. Some patients also report extreme sensitivity to ordinary stimuli like light, sound, or touch, which others would not perceive as painful. Han says overactivation of the CGRP spinothalamic pathway may contribute to these conditions by making the brain misinterpret or overreact to sensory inputs. In fact, transcriptomic analysis of the CGRP neurons showed that they express many of the genes associated with migraine and other pain disorders. Notably, several CGRP blockers are already being used to treat migraines. This study may help explain why these medications work and could inspire new nonaddictive treatments for affective pain disorders. Han also sees potential relevance for psychiatric conditions that involve heightened threat perception, such as PTSD. Growing evidence from his lab suggests that the CGRP affective pain pathway acts as part of the brain's broader alarm system, detecting and responding to not only pain but a wide range of unpleasant sensations. Quieting this pathway with CGRP blockers could offer a new approach to easing fear, avoidance, and hypervigilance in trauma-related disorders. "Our discovery of the CGRP affective pain pathway gives us a molecular and circuit-level explanation for the difference between detecting physical pain and suffering from it," says Han. Other authors include Shijia Liu, Jong-Hyun Kim, Dong-Il Kim, Tae Gyu Oh, Jiahang Peng, Mao Ye, Kuo-Fen Lee, Ronald M. Evans, and Martyn Goulding of Salk.
