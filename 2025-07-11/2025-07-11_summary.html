Career diplomats and other staff begin receiving notices amid Trump administration cull of about 15% of workforce

US politics – live updates

The US state department has begun issuing the first of more than 1,350 termination notices as part of a huge reorganisation of America's diplomatic corps under the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, according to internal documents and US diplomats at the state department on Friday.

Career diplomats and other staff began to receive the notices on Friday morning, days after the supreme court lifted a ban on the Trump administration moving forward with mass firings of government employees that will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

“Hearing ‘I got mine!' around the floor,” one current state department employee told the Guardian.

In an internal email obtained by the Guardian on Friday, state department workers were told that nearly 3,000 employees would leave as part of a vast reorganisation meant to align the department's goals with Donald Trump's stated goal of putting America first.

“This [Reduction in Force] comprises 1,107 civil service and 246 Foreign Service employees with domestic assignments,” read the email. Another 1,600 employees are believed to have left the service via a voluntary redundancy scheme in recent months.

The state department had confirmed on Thursday that it planned to move forward with the layoffs.

The cull of approximately 15% of the state department workforce is unprecedented for the diplomatic corps, and confusion over the process as well as the temporary court injunction against mass firings of government employees have made the rollout even more chaotic.

“At a moment of great global instability – with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order – the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,” said a statement from the American Foreign Service Association, a professional group that represents US diplomats. “We oppose this decision in the strongest terms.”

“Morale has been rock-bottom since they announced [the reorganisation],” one US diplomat told the Guardian. “I think for some people the fact it is finally happening is a relief but it's awful,” the person added.

Some advocacy groups reported that the state department was unable to process the hundreds of RIFs simultaneously due to the limitations of internal systems.

“The state department has apparently encountered a problem with the RIF software that caps the number of emails that can be sent out at a time, so rather than one big RIF at 10.30am tomorrow, we may see ‘Rolling RIFs' throughout the day,” wrote Karl Stoltz, co-president of the Public Diplomacy Council of America, in an email to members.

A senior state department official said: “This is simply not true. Email systems always take time to roll these out, and the timeline has been consistent with expectations. We did not have plans for one big email blast at a specific time, and did not indicate any such time to the workforce.”

Members of the PDCA and other groups that support federal employees were expected to meet at the state department at 4pm on Friday in order to “clap out” employees who had received RIFs and to “protest the department's actions”.

A senior state department official on Thursday told journalists that the department was “going to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees and foreign service officers and civil servants who are affected by this.

“It's not easy for anyone,” the official said.

The layoffs were also criticised by Democratic senators, who said that the administration's decision “undermines our national security”.

“While there are targeted reforms that our government can pursue to maximize the impact of every tax dollar, that's not what this is,” read the statement, which was co-signed by 10 Democratic senators, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the US Senate foreign relations committee.

“There are active conflicts and humanitarian crises in Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza, Haiti and Myanmar – to name a few. Now is the time to strengthen our diplomatic hand, not weaken it. From pursuing peaceful resolutions to out-competing China diplomatically and economically, we can't afford to not have experienced diplomats at the table.”

            A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to US drug trafficking charges. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to enter a plea deal.
    


            Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the United States.
    


            As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.
    


            Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.
    


            Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.
    


            Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.
    


            Guzman Lopez's sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with US authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.
    


            Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.”
    


            “Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.
    


US prosecutors won't seek death penalty for son of Mexican drug cartel leader ‘El Chapo'



            Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.”
    


            “In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”
    


            Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the US government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.”
    


            “This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.”
    


Relatives of El Chapo enter US as part of ‘negotiation,' Mexico's security secretary says



            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.
    


Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel.
    


            Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea.
    


            Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the US on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

President hints at ‘major announcement' on Monday after halting arms shipments due to dwindling stockpiles

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump appears poised to deliver weapons to Ukraine by selling them first to Nato allies in a major policy shift for his administration amid frustrations with Vladimir Putin over stalling negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

During an interview with NBC News, Trump said he will probably have a “major announcement” on Russia on Monday and confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine.

Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on the same day for a week-long trip that comes after the US temporarily halted weapons shipments to Ukraine as part of a Pentagon review of dwindling stockpiles of crucial munitions including Patriot air defense missiles.

The White House has now sought to distance itself from the decision, and Trump has suggested he is ready to greenlight a major military aid package for Ukraine via Nato, reversing a previous policy of reducing support to the Ukrainian government to force Kyiv to sue for peace.

“I think I'll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,” Trump said during the interview with NBC News, which aired on Thursday evening. “I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

During the interview, Trump laid out a plan by which the US could sell weapons to Nato and then they could be sent on to Ukraine. Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine.

“So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv.

Germany and other member states of the security bloc had spoken publicly about ongoing negotiations to purchase weapons from the United States to transfer to Ukraine.

Ukraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions.

The Axios news website said that some officials had said the US would only sell Ukraine “defensive” weapons, while others said the package could also include “offensive” weapons such as the Himars missiles.

Yet a key stumbling block remains US military production. The US only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon's military plans, the Guardian revealed this month, and fulfilling new orders can take years depending on the priority level given to the contract.

Kellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump's inauguration.

During the interview, Trump also endorsed the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally seen as a leader of Russia hawks in the legislature. Graham has said that the bill would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil and other goods, potentially targeting China and India.

Congressional insiders have told the Guardian that there is strong support for Ukraine in both the House of Representatives and the Senate but that they would require Trump's political backing in order to pass the bill.

“They're going to pass a very major and very biting sanctions bill, but it's up to the president as to whether or not he wants to exercise it,” Trump said during the interview, his first explicit endorsement of the bill.

Experts have said that the bill would give Trump new methods to target Russia, but that he could also tighten enforcement or issue other sanctions unilaterally without waiting for authorization from Congress.

Trump has said in the past that he admires Putin but he increasingly has vented frustration over the lack of progress in peace talks and the continued airstrikes against Ukrainian cities.

On Wednesday night, Russia launched almost 400 Shahed drones and decoys, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles, in strikes against Kyiv that killed two and caused fires across the Ukrainian capital.

“We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting this week. “He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”

Pictures show Democrats like Chuck Schumer standing next to Netanyahu, smiling.

A bipartisan group of senators representing an eighth of the Senate posed for photos and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to the U.S. this week, sparking criticism over senators' smiles next to a man wanted in the Hague for alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Netanyahu met with senators on Wednesday, with leaders for both parties, Senators John Thune (R-South Dakota) and Chuck Schumer (D-New York) in attendance. Lawmakers proudly posted photos of the meeting, saying that they discussed the genocide in Gaza and praised Israel and the U.S.'s war on Iran during the meeting.

Netanyahu also met with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the latter of whom said in a post on social media that the two “discussed America's commitment to Israel's security and our shared goal of achieving a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.”

Pictures of the Senate meeting also showed Senators Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Jon Husted (R-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), and Adam Schiff (D-California). 

The lawmakers posed next to a table set with food and drinks. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has already drawn criticism for being on vacation in Greece amid the devastating floods in his state last week, was also at the meeting.

Lawmakers have drawn criticism for meeting with Netanyahu as his government moves toward expelling all Palestinians from Gaza, through death or force. Earlier this week, Netanyahu's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, told reporters that he has instructed the military to plan for confining all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp where they won't be allowed to leave — a plan likened to concentration camps by advocates for Palestinian rights.

“Yesterday these Senators took part in a photo-op with Netanyahu, who is wanted for war crimes. Shameful,” wrote the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project in a post on social media.

“Genocide is bipartisan,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan).

“In a just world, every one of these Democratic senators would be primaried — especially the hypocritical Cory Booker who is wisely trying to hide his face in this picture,” said Zeteo Editor-in-Chief Mehdi Hasan. Indeed, Booker and Klobuchar are standing behind other senators in photos posted online.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for the arrest of Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November. But both officials have since visited the White House, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, with U.S. officials purposefully defying the Hague.

In fact, earlier this week, the U.S. State Department threatened the ICC in a UN meeting ahead of Netanyahu's visit, demanding that it drop the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant and terminate “all investigations and all arrest warrants” against Israel. 

Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump this week to discuss a proposal for a temporary ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, despite agreement from both parties on the objectives of the genocide, Netanyahu left Washington without the parties announcing a deal. Netanyahu has been accused numerous times of purposely sabotaging ceasefire talks in order to prolong the genocide and stay in power.

Protocol was ‘clearly odd' relic of regime of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, administration says in revision of directives

Bangladesh's caretaker government has overturned a longstanding protocol requiring female officials to be addressed as “sir”, calling it an “odd” relic of the regime of the ousted leader, Sheikh Hasina.

The interim administration, headed by the Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, took office last year after the former prime minister was overthrown by a student-led uprising, forcing her to flee to neighbouring India.

A statement issued by the press wing of the caretaker government late on Thursday said the directive mandating the use of “sir” for women in official roles had been “annulled”.

“During Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16-year-long autocratic rule, a directive was reportedly issued requiring public officials to address her as ‘sir',” it said. “This practice extended to other high-ranking women officials, who were – and still are – being called ‘sir', which is clearly odd.”

A new committee has been formed to revise other protocol-related directives, the statement added.

A female official told AFP that the caretaker government took the call without consulting the women in public roles.

“The tradition began during Sheikh Hasina's tenure, but many women officers supported it, finding the address gender-neutral,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Hasina, 77, who has defied orders to return to Dhaka, faces several charges at Bangladesh's international crimes tribunal for alleged crimes committed during a crackdown on the protests that led to her toppling. Responding to the charges, Hasina's Awami League party condemned the trial process and said the tribunal was a “kangaroo” court.

Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations. Prosecutors claim that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence. She has denied all allegations against her.

As work stoppages spread, the Teamsters' president says a waste disposal company is at “war” with sanitation workers.

A local sanitation workers strike that began on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company.

The Teamsters said in an email on Friday that about 550 sanitation workers were on strike in multiple cities while 1,600 others refused to cross picket line extensions in solidarity with the strikers at local Republic Services sites in Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Washington State, and California. For example, workers in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better pay at a regional landfill near Stockton.

“Republic Services has been threatening a war with American workers for years — and now, they've got one,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien in a statement on Wednesday.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

While trash collection has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports. The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health issue.

In a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country, and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the picket line to job sites beyond Boston.

Republic Services did not respond to a request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters Local 25 “when they are ready to re-engage.”

“We will continue to focus on providing service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. “We call on Teamsters' leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal acts, and resolve this situation.”

The right to join a union and go on strike is protected by federal labor law, so it's unclear what “criminal acts” Republic Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O'Brien said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services “abuses and underpays” sanitation workers serving communities across the country. 

“They burn massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O'Brien said. “The Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide, and we will get the wages and benefits we've earned, come hell or high water.”

In a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has resorted to “union-busting tactics” and “illegal threats” in order to provoke a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we've ever come across.”

“Republic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,” Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9.

The war of words comes as work stoppages spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic Services.

“To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of Republic's strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,” said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division, in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.”

While Truthout was unable to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders last year.

Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California, said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services. Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line, and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in Boston extended its picket line this week. Alvarez and fellow workers are responsible for safely transporting hazardous materials, and their contract with Republic Services expires next year.

“The reason we support one another is there is strength in numbers,” Alvarez told Truthout in an interview.

Mineros said sanitation and waste management workers perform “dangerous, high-stakes jobs” that protect local communities and the environment from pollution and hazardous waste.

“They deserve a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said.

Meanwhile, after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State, Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.

The deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports. Union leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing an 8 percent annual increase. The average salary for a sanitation worker is $46,000 a year in Philadelphia, which the union argues is not a living wage.

Greg Boulware, president of the AFSCME local representing public workers in Philadelphia, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the strike is over and “nobody's happy” as he left negotiations with the city on Wednesday. If the rank and file reject the deal, Boulware said the strike could potentially resume.

“We felt our clock was running out,” Boulware said.

Advocates called the move, which also restricts minimum wage increases, "a slap in the face to workers."

Missouri's Republican governor on Thursday signed legislation repealing the paid sick leave portion of a ballot measure that the state's voters approved with nearly 60% support in the 2024 election.

The short-lived provision, which will officially be repealed on August 28, required Missouri employers to provide workers with an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work. Businesses with 15 or more employees were required to provide up to 56 hours of earned paid sick time per year, and businesses with fewer than 15 employees were required to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick time.

The Missouri Budget Project estimated before its passage that the ballot measure's paid sick leave benefits would reach 728,000 private-sector workers in the state.

The bill that Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed Thursday, known as H.B. 567, also restricts increases in the state's minimum wage. The voter-approved initiative called for raising the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2026 and indexing it to inflation thereafter. H.B. 567 eliminates the inflation adjustment.

The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a business lobbying group, characterized H.B. 567 as its top legislative priority. The bill was led by state Rep. Sherri Gallick (R-62) and state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter (R-6).

Kehoe's Facebook post announcing his signature was deluged with comments from Missourians decrying the governor's decision to overturn the will of the public.

“We the people collected signatures,” wrote one commenter. “We voted. And we passed Prop A into law. Remember you work for us. How dare you reverse the voice of your people?! The people you took an oath to serve.”

Missouri Jobs With Justice, which helped lead the campaign for the ballot measure, said in a statement that “with Governor Kehoe's decision to sign H.B. 567 into law, workers will again face increased economic insecurity when balancing being sick with maintaining their job.”

The group noted that Kehoe's support for repealing paid sick leave came after he “recently called a special session to approve spending millions of taxpayer dollars to subsidize billionaire-owned stadiums.” On Thursday, Kehoe also signed legislation slashing the state's capital gains tax.

“Simply put, Missouri workers and their families do not deserve to see their newly earned paid sick leave stripped away,” said Missouri Jobs With Justice. “Not only is this a slap in the face to workers asking for an opportunity to earn paid sick leave, it's an insult to over 57% of Missourians who voted for Proposition A in November.”

Throughout the process of pushing H.B. 567 through the Legislature, Missouri Republicans openly voiced contempt for voters who supported the paid sick leave and minimum wage initiative. One GOP lawmaker, state Rep. Mitch Boggs, said, “Of course the people voted for it.”

“It'd be like asking your teenager if he wanted a checkbook,” said Boggs.

A post shared by MO House Democratic Caucus (@mohousedemcaucus)

State Rep. Ashley Aune (D-14), the Democratic leader in the Missouri House, said Thursday that “the governor's action today demonstrates the absolute disdain Republicans have for working Missourians.”

“But in stripping workers of their legal right to earned sick leave,” Aune added, “the governor and his allies have probably guaranteed this issue will be back on the ballot next year as a constitutional amendment that will place worker protections beyond their reach.”

For ways to help those affected by the floods, visit CNN Impact Your World.



            US Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Florida, has called for an investigation into the Federal Emergency Management Agency, citing CNN reporting that the agency's response to the devastating flooding in Texas was slowed by bureaucratic red tape and cost control measures implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
    


                    “I am alarmed by reports that the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) response to the Texas floods was delayed and hampered by a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ‘cost-control' policy imposed by Secretary Kristi Noem,” Moskowitz said in a letter to leadership of the House Homeland Security and Transportation committees on Thursday. “If accurate, this represents a major deviation from long-standing FEMA protocol that may have slowed down life-saving efforts and contributed to the tragedy's severity.”
                





                    “In a crisis like this, FEMA's responsibility is clear: move swiftly, anticipate needs, pre-position resources, and launch rescue efforts without delay,” Moskowitz, who worked as director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management prior to his time in Congress, also said in the letter. “That did not happen here.”
                





            CNN reported on Wednesday that the federal disaster-management agency's response was slowed by new policies that required Noem's approval for relatively small expenditures. Urban search and rescue teams were not deployed to Texas until more than 72 hours after the flooding, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            DHS has defended its response to the Texas flooding and said that it sent other assets from the federal government outside of FEMA to Texas.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced that the federal government added additional counties to President Donald Trump's major disaster declaration following the flooding in central Texas.
    


            This update means that Burnet, Kerr, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties are now eligible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency Individual Assistance program. Additionally, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Menard, and San Saba counties have been approved for FEMA's Public Assistance program.
    


                    “There has been extraordinary collaboration with the state and the federal government to make sure that we address Texans' needs as quickly as possible through disaster assistance programs,” Abbott said in a statement today.
                





            The approval allows qualifying Texans who sustained damage to apply for grant funding to assist with repair and recovery expenses.
    


            Two new committees have been created to address last weekend's deadly flooding in Texas during the state legislature's upcoming special session, according to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.
    


            The joint committees on Disaster Preparedness and Flooding will examine flood warning systems, emergency communications, natural disaster preparation and relief funds during their first hearing on July 23 in Austin, the state capital, Patrick's office said in a statement.
    


            The second session will take place in the hard-hit city of Kerrville a week later “to give residents an opportunity to have their voices heard.”
    


            The House and Senate committees are “just the beginning of the Legislature looking at every aspect of this tragic event,” Patrick said in a statement.
    


                    “In the coming year, and into the next regular legislative session, we will gather all the facts and answer the many questions to which the public demands answers.”
                





More background: Gov. Greg Abbott called the legislature's special session earlier this week. It begins July 21 and will also address an array of topics including redistricting and abortion, according to Abbott's announcement.
    


            House Speaker Dustin Burrows, who co-created the new committees with Patrick, said in a statement that they will ensure “both chambers move in lockstep from day one of the special session.”
    


                    “With only 30 days to act, we must make every moment count,” Patrick said. “This effort is about moving quickly to help Texans recover and laying the foundation to better protect our communities—and our children—from future disasters.”
                





            President Donald Trump is en route to central Texas to survey damage from the catastrophic flooding that has killed more than 120 people.
    


            “It's a horrible thing, a horrible thing,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One earlier this morning.
    


            He is expected to tout the progress that search teams are making on the ground and to emphasize the White House's coordination with local officials.
    


Who else will be there: First lady Melania Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Ted Cruz are among those expected to be on site with Trump.
    


Questions about FEMA: While the administration pledges support for Texas, Trump officials continue the push to downsize federal emergency preparedness operations — or even eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether. Trump officials have doubled down on their vows to shrink FEMA and shift more responsibility for disaster management to individual states.
    


            The Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country announced today they have received over $30 million in donations that will start being distributed as grants immediately.
    


            The first $5 million in grants will be allocated to local organizations doing work on the ground, Austin Dixon, Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country CEO, said at a news conference.
    


            Additional grants will be available to directly support individuals and families with cash assistance, food, gift cards, rent assistance, utility assistance and other emergency needs.
    


            The foundation is also providing grants to local businesses and to first responder agencies for the tools and supplies needed for the crisis response.
    


            The Salvation Army will receive a grant for their work distributing pallets of supplies and offering spiritual care, which they will continue to provide for up to two years, according to Salvation Army Major Phil Swyers.
    


            “Our prayer is that the service provided will help to bring comfort and compassion to those that have suffered in our community unimaginable loss and grief, so that each tomorrow may bring more hope than the day before,” Swyers said.
    


            Other donors included James Avery Artisan Jewelry, which was founded in Kerrville by local resident James Avery 70 years ago. The company's charm line got its start when Avery began designing and making charms for campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, which lost 27 campers and counselors in the disaster, his son, Chris Avery, chairman of the James Avery board, said at the news conference.
    


            US Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, will join President Donald Trump Friday in central Texas as the president surveys damage from deadly floods while questions loom over how local and federal officials responded to the disaster.
    


            “The president is here for the right reasons and will be met with people who are thankful for his personal opportunity to come visit,” Sessions told CNN's Wolf Blitzer ahead of Trump's visit.
    


            Sessions added he believes Texas Gov. Greg Abbott acted quickly to alert Texas officials and “in that coordination that the federal government did provide the helicopter support that would be necessary.”
    


In case you missed it: Trump, with first lady Melania, is expected to meet with first responders in the area, receive a briefing from local elected officials and plans to meet with some families who were affected by the flood, according to a White House official. The trip has been designed, in part, to not interfere with ongoing search and rescue and recovery efforts.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the launch of the Texas Flooding Emotional Support Line, a new crisis support service for residents who have been impacted by the recent catastrophic floods.
    


                    “This new statewide crisis support line will ensure survivors, families, and first responders have access to emotional support and crisis counseling as they work to heal and recover,” Abbott said in a news release.
                





            All affected by the disaster can receive professional crisis counseling at no cost by calling 833-812-2480.
    


            CNN's Bill Weir reports from the ruins of Texas' Camp Mystic, where deadly floods have claimed at least 27 lives. Weir explains how climate change is making flooding more extreme and common.
    


            During the Kerr County Commissioners' regularly scheduled meeting Monday morning, officials will “consider, discuss, and take appropriate action following update on status of recovery efforts” after deadly floods swept through the community, according to the meeting agenda.
    


Remember: Local officials have faced questions all week over their actions in the hours – and even years – before the catastrophic flooding that killed over 100 people in central Texas.
    


            Local officials have been pressed about a timeline of warnings and the emergency response as the Guadalupe River flooded over its banks last week, sweeping away buildings and people in its path.
    


            CNN pieces together what happened in those critical first hours of the disaster.
    


Watch here:



            Here are the tools that Kerr County, where the most deaths from the Texas flooding occurred, had and didn't have in place to warn people as torrential rain sent water surging over the banks of the Guadalupe River last Friday.
    


River gauges: These systems measure river levels and signal officials in real time to rising waters, allowing emergency managers to prepare and alert people.
    


            The Upper Guadalupe River Authority, which manages the river, does have at least five gauges on the river in Kerr County, but experts say that number should double or even triple.
    


                    “How can you have a timely warning when you have no data?” said Mark Rose, former general manager of the Lower Colorado River Authority.
                





            One gauge along the river shows the water levels hit 23.4 feet at 4:45 a.m. local time last Friday morning, then didn't record data again for three hours.
    


IPAWS: The Integrated Public Alert & Warning System (IPAWS) is FEMA's system for local and federal authorities to send emergency information to the public. IPAWS uses Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) sent to mobile phones, the Emergency Alert System, which delivers warnings via radio and television, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Radio.
    


            It's unclear how widely WEA messages reached those in remote areas where cell phone service was limited — including at Camp Mystic, where at least 27 campers and counselors were killed.
    


Emergency sirens: In recent years, multiple efforts in Kerr County to build a more substantial flood warning system have failed or been abandoned due to budget concerns or noise complaints, but Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state would “step up” and get sirens in place by next year.
    


            County officials and the river authority applied for $980,000 in FEMA funds to build a new warning system in 2017 but were denied, public records show.
    


            “I think everyone in Kerrville, everyone in Kerr County, wishes to God we've had some way to warn them,” Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring Jr. said.
    


            Within 36 hours of catastrophic and deadly flooding in central Texas, Gary LeBlanc deployed to the area and started doing what he does best – cook.
    


            Feeling disappointed in the quality of food fed to victims, first responders and volunteers during natural disasters and national emergencies and with over 30 years of experience in the hotel restaurant business, LeBlanc created a national, faith-based nonprofit, Mercy Chefs, with a mission to “just go feed people.”
    


            “The first meals we fed (in Texas) were to search and rescue teams that hadn't had a hot meal since they started,” LeBlanc, the founder of Mercy Chefs, told CNN's Sara Sidner, adding that in his 19 years of volunteer work, he's never seen anything worse than the flooding devastation in central Texas.
    


            “We're seeing them (the volunteers) take a few bites and put their head down, and you can see they're just contemplating the day, and they'll look up and they'll say, ‘you know, I've seen things today that I can never unsee,'” he said.
    


            LeBlanc said Mercy Chefs plans on sticking around in Texas as long as their services are needed, noting that his team is still serving meals in North Carolina, nearly nine months after Hurricane Helene.
    


            “Those men and women are heroes,” he added. “The work they do is just  incredible.”
    


            It's been one week since floodwaters devastated the Texas Hill Country, and the death toll continues to rise, with more than 160 people still missing.
    


            RickyRay Robertson's family property lines spans both sides of the Guadalupe River. He says the bodies of victims have been found on each side.
    


            “There was five as of yesterday (Wednesday), over there and one on this side. They did pull the sixth one out yesterday, that's the one we saw,” Robertson said. “And apparently, they just said that they found another one over there.”
    


            It's a shocking transformation for these parts of the Guadalupe River, which had long offered a peaceful way of life.
    


            “This still blows me away, really does blow me away,” Robertson said.
    


            He showed us the foundation of what was once his cabin home, since the structure was washed away. Robertson recalled a couple searching his property late one night and asked if he could help.
    


            “The man walked to me and he said we're looking for our daughter,” Robertson said. “And he said, I know we're not gonna find her, but we can't just sit in the hotel.”
    


            Just up the road, at a Kerrville park along the river, 91-year-old Charles Hanson has been clearing debris every morning, finding solace in the work.
    


            “On behalf of the people who can't be here or shouldn't be here right now, I'm here,” Hanson said.
    


            A week after disaster struck, the communities and people along the now calm Guadalupe River are trying to find a way forward.
    


            “I think the best thing I can do in respect for the people is to help clean up the mess,” Hanson said, dragging away large branches.
    


            “They're not numbers, you know. They're little girls and men and mothers and fathers and what is this … a big square box full of stuff, you know,” Robertson said tearfully. “That, I can easily rebuild.”
    


            Kerr County officials warned “it is likely” that the county “will experience a flood event in the next year” in a hazard mitigation report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) last October.
    


            The 220-page report, which addressed a range of natural threats, emphasized that such a flood event could be especially dangerous for residents living in “substandard structures” and may result in “increased damage, injuries, or loss of life.”
    


            One of the solutions outlined was to have a local flood warning system that could alert residents to rising waters. The report estimates a cost of less than $1 million for a system that would include precipitation sensors, automatic crossing barriers and a web-based alert platform. Implementing the plan would take three to five years, according to the report, which also identifies FEMA programs for possible funding.
    


            The plan also listed a goal in the next two to five years of expanding warning systems with possible sirens. Other recommendations include possible new restrictions on development in areas at high risk of flooding and educating the public about floods and other hazards.
    


            Last week's catastrophic flooding has put fresh scrutiny on the systems in place to keep Kerr County residents safe in the event of flooding. In recent years, multiple efforts in Kerr County to build a more substantial flood warning system have failed or been abandoned due to budget concerns or noise complaints.
    


            As the urgent search of at least 160 missing people continues in the aftermath of the devastating flooding in Central Texas, concerns are growing over the systems meant to notify residents in emergency situations.
    


            It comes as President Donald Trump will visit the region today.
    


Here's what we learned yesterday:



CNN's Ollie Leltsov, Danya Gainor, Casey Tolan, Curt Devine, Andrew Freedman, Melanie Hicken, Pamela Brown, Shoshana Dubnow, Karina Tsui, Tristen Rouse, Christine Server, Kathleen Magramo, Leigh Waldman and Joel Williams contributed reporting.



            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to request additional counties be added to President Donald Trump's major disaster declaration following the flooding in central Texas.
    


            “Five counties – Burnet, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson – are requested to be eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance programs, and four counties – Kendall, Kimble, Menard, and San Saba – are requested to be eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program,” the governor's office said in a statement yesterday.



            On Sunday, Trump approved the governor's request for a major disaster declaration for Kerr County. The approval allows qualifying Texans who sustained damage to apply for grant funding to assist with repair and recovery expenses.

Men from Mexico, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar were removed from the US and flown to the war-torn country

Tom Homan, the US border czar, has said he does not know what happened to the eight men deported to South Sudan after the Trump administration resumed sending migrants to countries that are not their place of origin, known as third countries.

“They're free as far as we're concerned. They're free, they're no longer in our custody, they're in Sudan,” Homan told Politico on Friday. “Will they stay in Sudan? I don't know.”

Administration officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the US. Only one of the eight reportedly has a connection to South Sudan, which recently emerged from a civil war. The others include two people from Myanmar, two from Cuba, and one each from Vietnam, Laos and Mexico.

South Sudanese authorities said on Tuesday the men were in custody in Juba “under the care of the relevant authorities, who are screening them and ensuring their safety and wellbeing”.

The men were initially deported in May, but were held on a military base in Djibouti for weeks after a US court stopped their removal.

They were then transported to South Sudan after two US supreme court decisions: one that broadly allowed for the administration to deport migrants to third countries to which they have no connection, and a second that weighed in directly on the case of the eight men.

“We make arrangements to make sure these countries are receiving these people and there's opportunities for people, but I can't tell you – if we removed somebody to Sudan they could stay there a week and leave, I don't know,” Homan said.

He later added: “There's like a 100 different endings to this – I just don't know on every specific case what their status is.”

The administration has also controversially deported Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, where they are held in a notorious prison. The administration has reportedly also approached countries such as Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants.

Homan has been called the intellectual “father” of a policy on migrants enacted in the first Trump administration to separate children from their families, according to an investigation in 2022 by the Atlantic.

Since disaster that has killed at least 120 people, Trump has remained quiet about promises to axe relief agency

US politics live – latest updates

During a trip on Friday to look at the devastation caused by the catastrophic flooding in Texas, Donald Trump spoke of the young girls who died at a summer camp and the coast guard crew that saved 169 children there, saying of the disaster that he has “never seen anything like this”.

The trip comes as he has remained conspicuously quiet about his previous promises to do away with the federal agency in charge of disaster relief.

The Washington Post reported on Friday that the Trump administration has backed away from plans to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but administration officials continue to dodge questions about the agency's future and many are still calling for serious reforms, potentially sending much of its work to the states.

Since the 4 July disaster, which has killed at least 120 people, the president and his top aides have focused on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of what occurred and the human tragedy involved rather than the government-slashing crusade that has been popular with Trump's core supporters.

“Nobody ever saw a thing like this coming,” Trump told NBC News on Thursday, adding, “This is a once-in-every-200-year deal.” He has also suggested he would have been ready to visit Texas within hours but did not want to burden authorities still searching for the more than 170 people who are still missing.

Trump's shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though Trump has made slashing the federal workforce and charging ally-turned-antagonist Elon Musk with dramatically shrinking the size of government centerpieces of his administration's opening months.

The president traveled to Texas on Air Force One with Melania Trump, the first lady, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Scott Turner, the housing secretary, the small business administrator Kelly Loeffler, and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas, among others. Trump is expected to do an aerial tour of some of the hard-hit areas.

Before arriving at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he delivered remarks, the president and his motorcade stopped at an area near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville next to an overturned tractor-trailer and downed trees. Damage appeared to be more extensive near the riverbank. Trump, his wife and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, took a briefing about flooding there from local officials.

It is relatively common for presidents visiting disaster sites to tour the damage by air, a move that can ease the logistical burdens on authorities on the ground.

Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, observed the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina and Hurricane Milton in Florida last fall by air before meeting with disaster response officials and victims on the ground.

Trump, though, has also used past disaster response efforts to launch political attacks. While still a candidate trying to win back the presidency, Trump made his own visit to North Carolina after Helene last year and accused the Biden administration of blocking disaster aid to victims in Republican-heavy areas.

During his first weekend back in the White House, Trump again visited North Carolina to survey Helene damage and toured the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. But he also used those trips to sharply criticize the Biden administration and California officials.

During Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Trump praised the federal flooding response. Turning to Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, which oversees Fema, he said: “You had people there as fast as anybody's ever seen.”

Noem described traveling to Texas and seeing heartbreaking scenes, including around Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 people were killed.

“The parents that were looking for their children and picking up their daughter's stuffed animals out of the mud and finding their daughter's shoe that might be laying in the cabin,” she said.

Noem said that “just hugging and comforting people matters a lot” and “this is a time for all of us in this country to remember that we were created to serve each other”.

But the secretary is also co-chairing a Fema review council charged with submitting suggestions for how to overhaul the agency in coming months.

“We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. The state does,” Noem told Trump on Tuesday.

She also referenced the administration's government-reducing efforts, saying: ”We're cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema. Streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate.”

Pressed this week on whether the White House will continue to work to shutter Fema, Karoline Leavitt would not say.

“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” the White House press secretary said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”

Before Trump left on Friday, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, similarly dodged questions from reporters at the the White House about Fema's future – instead noting that the agency has billions of dollars in its reserves “to continue to pay for necessary expenses” and that the president has promised Texas, “Anything it needs, it will get.”

“We also want Fema to be reformed,” Vought added. “The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies, no different than any other opportunity to have better government.”

Smishing is a sort of portmanteau of SMS and phishing in which a text message is used to try to get the target to click on a link and provide personal information.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

If it seems like your phone has been blowing up with more spam text messages recently, it probably is.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says so-called smishing attempts appear to be on the rise, thanks in part to new technologies that allow for co-ordinated bulk attacks.

The centre's communications outreach officer Jeff Horncastle says the agency has actually received fewer fraud reports in the first six months of 2025, but that can be misleading because so few people actually alert the centre to incidents.

He says smishing is “more than likely increasing” with help from artificial intelligence tools that can craft convincing messages or scour data from security breaches to uncover new targets.

The warning comes as the Competition Bureau sent a recent alert about the tactic because it says many people are seeing more suspicious text messages.

Smishing is a sort of portmanteau of SMS and phishing in which a text message is used to try to get the target to click on a link and provide personal information.

The ruse comes in many forms but often involves a message that purports to come from a real organization or business urging immediate action to address an alleged problem.

It could be about an undeliverable package, a suspended bank account or news of a tax refund.

Horncastle says it differs from more involved scams such as a text invitation to call a supposed job recruiter, who then tries to extract personal or financial information by phone.

Nevertheless, he says a text scam might be quite sophisticated since today's fraudsters can use artificial intelligence to scan data leaks for personal details that bolster the hoax, or use AI writing tools to help write convincing text messages.

“In the past, part of our messaging was always: watch for spelling mistakes. It's not always the case now,” he says.

“Now, this message could be coming from another country where English may not be the first language but because the technology is available, there may not be spelling mistakes like there were a couple of years ago.”

The Competition Bureau warns against clicking on suspicious links and forwarding texts to 7726 (SPAM), so that the cellular provider can investigate further. It also encourages people to delete smishing messages, block the number and ignore texts even if they ask to reply with “STOP” or “NO.”

Horncastle says the centre received 886 reports of smishing in the first six months of 2025, up to June 30. That's trending downwards from 2,546 reports in 2024, which was a drop from 3,874 in 2023. That too, was a drop in reports from 7,380 in 2022. 

But those numbers don't quite tell the story, he says. 

“We get a very small percentage of what's actually out there. And specifically when we're looking at phishing or smishing, the reporting rate is very low. So generally we say that we estimate that only five to 10 per cent of victims report fraud to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.”

Horncastle says it's hard to say for sure how new technology is being used, but he notes AI is a frequent tool for all sorts of nefarious schemes such as manipulated photos, video and audio.

“It's more than likely increasing due to different types of technology that's available for fraudsters,” Horncastle says of smishing attempts.

“So we would discuss AI a lot where fraudsters now have that tool available to them. It's just reality, right? Where they can craft phishing messages and send them out in bulk through automation through these highly sophisticated platforms that are available.”

The Competition Bureau's deceptive marketing practices directorate says an informed public is the best protection against smishing.

“The bureau is constantly assessing the marketplace and through our intelligence capabilities is able to know when scams are on the rise and having an immediate impact on society,” says deputy commissioner Josephine Palumbo.

“That's where these alerts come in really, really handy.”

She adds that it's difficult to track down fraudsters who sometimes use prepaid SIM cards to shield their identity when targeting victims.

“Since SIM cards lack identification verification, enforcement agencies like the Competition Bureau have a hard time in actually tracking these perpetrators down,” Palumbo says.

Fraudsters can also spoof phone numbers, making it seem like a text has originated with a legitimate agency such as the Canada Revenue Agency, Horncastle adds.

“They might choose a number that they want to show up randomly or if they're claiming to be a financial institution, they may make that financial institutions' number show up on the call display,” he says.

“We've seen (that) with the CRA and even the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, where fraudsters have made our phone numbers show up on victims' call display.”

Factoring in tariffs, the lowest 20 percent of income earners may lose $300; the top 1 percent will be $58,000 richer.

Donald Trump's so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week, has been described as a monstrous piece of legislation. In this exclusive interview for Truthout, world-renowned progressive economist Robert Pollin provides an overview of this “disgraceful” federal budget bill. Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

CJ Polychroniou: Trump's so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” has now become law, achieving what ultra-conservatives have been fighting for decades, which are huge tax breaks and major cuts to social safety net programs. Of course, there is a lot more reactionary stuff included in this megabill, such as hundreds of billions of dollars devoted to Trump's anti-immigration agenda and derailing the green transition by taking an axe to clean energy and boosting, in turn, fossil fuel production. In sum, I think Ed Kilgore's claim that this 940-page bill “is, in fact, the single most sweeping piece of legislation in American history” is quite accurate, although some of its effects won't be felt for some time. Can you discuss specifically the economic and social repercussions of Trump's megabill, especially in light of the view that the U.S. is the most unequal high-income country in the world?

Robert Pollin: Trump's federal budget bill is disgraceful along multiple dimensions. We can start with its egregious distributional impacts. The bill will make the rich still richer through tax cuts while attacking the living standards, including the health and food security, of working people and the poor. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Trump and company claim that people at all income levels will benefit from the bill's tax cuts. There is a tiny sliver of truth in this. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), the Trump tax provisions will deliver an average of $40 in savings to the lowest 20 percent of income earners in 2026. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent will end up $66,000 richer. This recalls the famous observation by Anatole France in 1894 that, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.” 

But even these figures do not conclude the story. ITEP also notes that, once we also account for the impact of Trump's tariffs — with these tariffs being a tax on imported products — those in the lowest 20 percent income bracket will not keep their $40 in benefits, but rather end up worse off by about $300. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent are still better off by about $58,000. 

Much more punishing still for lower-income people are the spending cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program that now covers 85 million low-income and disabled people, along with other health funding cuts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that, through the Trump measure, at least 17 million people will lose their coverage by 2034. In addition, cuts to the federal food security program (SNAP), on which 42 million people now depend, could  eliminate this support for up to 5 million people. 

Moreover, this purposeful Trump project to shower money on the rich while depriving lower-income people of health care and food arrives after nearly 50 years of neoliberal policy dominance had already skewed income and wealth inequality to extreme levels. For example, the average wage for non-supervisory workers as of 2023 was roughly equal, at about $28 an hour, to where it was in 1972 (controlling for inflation), even though average worker productivity had increased two-and-a-half-fold over this period. Meanwhile, the average CEO's pay was 30 times higher than the average worker in 1972, but exploded to 290 times higher by 2023. In other words, the average worker's annual income remained roughly constant at around $50,000 per year over this 50-year span, while the average CEO's pay skyrocketed from $1.5 million to nearly $15 million.

We have opportunities right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even in the face of Trump.

Under Joe Biden's four years in office, some modest progress was made toward countering this rising inequality trend, including through Biden's support for union organizing drives and through enforcing existing (but long-neglected) anti-monopoly laws. Trump and company are now committed to wiping out these small gains. This is while Trump stridently proclaims his commitment to working people and while, to date, large segments of the working class have been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.

Of course, one centerpiece of Trump's appeal to the U.S. working class has been his brutal attacks on immigrants, including those with legal status as well as undocumented people. To support this program, the bill allocates an average of more than $20 billion per year through 2029 to build new immigrant detention centers and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding more than doubles the current ICE budget. Trump and company claim that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country, that most of them are criminals, that they are stealing jobs from U.S.-born workers, and that they are draining the public schools, hospitals and other programs of resources without paying taxes to support these public programs. 

None of these claims are remotely true. In fact, according to the best available evidence, the population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has not changed significantly since 2005, varying between about 11–12 million people overall.  Moreover, all immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than the U.S.-born, including both violent and nonviolent crimes.  In terms of taxes and financing public programs, as of the most recent 2022 data, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, amounting to an average of nearly $9,000 per undocumented immigrant.  Furthermore, more than one-third of all taxes contributed by undocumented immigrants are funding programs that they are unable to access. That is, they are paying into Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, but are receiving no benefits in return. This is also while, in 2023, the official unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers was 3.6 percent, the lowest figure on record. 

What about the environmental repercussions? How does Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill” impact U.S. climate policy, and what does it mean for global climate change?

Trump's bill is one more weapon amid his relentless wave of attacks against any and all efforts to avert the mounting climate catastrophes. Even prior to the bill's passage, the Trump administration had already introduced, according to Columbia University's Climate Backtracker, more than 200 measures to “scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and adaptation measures.” 

Trump has also fired hundreds of government scientists and installed climate change deniers into critical government positions. The Trump bill itself repeals or phases out the tax credits for solar and wind energy investments, electric vehicle purchases, and making home energy-efficiency improvements that were important features of the Biden Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The impact of the overall Trump program on the climate will be severe, as intended. U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions — the main cause of global heating — have fallen by roughly 20 percent over the past 20 years. Biden's policies did contribute to this downward trend, even while the rate of emissions reductions remained insufficient relative to the global climate stabilization goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Trump's policies will stop even these modest gains over the short term. If Trump's program is allowed to remain in place, the likelihood for achieving zero emissions by 2050 becomes nil.   

How can we fight back effectively? For starters, we need to proclaim loudly the reality that clean energy investments are delivering money and jobs in all regions of the U.S., including in red states. Thus, wind power is thriving in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Moreover, at the end of Biden's presidency, West Virginia had received about $5 billion and Pennsylvania about $9 billion in new clean energy investment commitments tied to Biden's IRA. It is hard to believe that working people in these and other states will be okay with these projects folding, and the jobs generated by them foregone, all thanks to Trump. 

The CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump's bill will generate an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10 years.

Still more: Investments in clean renewable energy and high efficiency are now, by far, the cheapest ways to deliver energy to consumers. Even Trump's own Energy Department's most current report on comparative electricity costs confirms this. It estimates that electricity generated by onshore wind and solar projects that begin operating in 2030 will cost between 3–3.2 cents per kilowatt hour. The natural gas price will be more than twice as high, at 6.5 cents.

We have opportunities right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even in the face of Trump. One important example was the passage of the Climate Change Superfund law in New York State last December, right before Trump took office. Under this measure, oil and gas companies will pay an average of $3 billion a year for the next 25 years for climate adaptation and resilience measures throughout the state. This victory in New York followed from the successful campaign to enact a similar measure in Vermont earlier in 2024.  Comparable bills are now advancing in Massachusetts, California, and Maryland.

This federal budget bill is projected to add trillions of dollars to the nation's debt load and widen deficits. Is the U.S. in the “fast lane” to what Elon Musk calls “debt slavery?”      

Elon Musk and his late, unlamented leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), demonstrated both unbridled malice and a buffoonish level of ignorance regarding the operations of the federal government. Moving on to at least minimally serious analysts, the CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump's bill will generate an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10 years. Increased spending on attacking and deporting immigrants as well as increased military spending will cost the government another roughly $30 billion per year. This brings the total average costs of Trump's bill to nearly $500 billion per year.

Meanwhile, according to the CBO, the spending cuts for health care, food security, and clean energy will together amount to an average total of about $170 billion per year. Overall then, the CBO estimates that Trump's bill will expand the federal deficit by about $330 billion per year over the next decade (i.e., $500 billion in tax cuts and spending increases minus $170 billion in spending cuts). This will be on top of the government's 2024 budget deficit of nearly $1.9 trillion.

The 2024 federal deficit was equal to about 6.3 percent of last year's U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This 6.3 percent of GDP budget deficit is larger than at any other non-recession period since World War II. The government did run much larger deficits to counteract the 2008-09 Great Recession and the 2020-2021 COVID lockdown. But we are not now experiencing any kind of comparable economic crisis. As of 2024, the government's accumulated debt was also at a peacetime high of 97 percent of GDP. This is nearly three times higher than the 2007 pre-Great Recession figure, which was 35 percent of GDP. 

The most critical point is that the current deficits are not serving to prevent an economic collapse. They are rather simply helping rich people get richer, while attacking the living standards of working people and the poor, as well as continuing to lavish exorbitant funds on the military.

By running large fiscal deficits now … the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth in taxes.

Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP. That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling. Nor did the sky fall.

Still, the government's $900 billion in 2024 interest payments totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure, environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the 2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior. This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major currencies (the dollar's value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to other major currencies since Trump returned to office). 

The government's creditors are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors. Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth in taxes. Correspondingly, the government's interest payments that are now lining rich people's pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly thanks to Trump's bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building a green economy.

Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death, independent media outlet Astra reported on July 11, citing Chuvash Republic authorities.

The news follows speculations that Ilyin was among the Russian military personnel killed when Ukrainian forces attacked the 155th Brigade's command post in Korenevo in Russia's Kursk Oblast on July 2.

Russian Major General Mikhail Gudkov, a deputy head of the Russian Navy, was reportedly killed in the same attack. According to Russian milbloggers, 22 people in total were killed as a result of the Ukrainian HIMARS strike. Kyiv has not commented on the attack.

News of Ilyin's death and burial was initially posted on the VKontakte social media page of the Urmarsky District administration in Russia's Chuvash Republic. The post, which was later deleted, did not disclose when or where the Russian officer died.

Kyiv has accused the 155th Separate Marine Brigade of committing numerous war crimes in Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, members of the brigade are responsible for executing prisoners of war and humiliating captured Ukrainian soldiers.

Service members of the 155th Brigade have also been linked to war crimes committed during the occupation of Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel in Kyiv Oblast during the early months of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

A number of Russian high-ranking military officials have been killed throughout the full-scale invasion, both on the front lines and in the rear. The BBC Russia service has identified 10 generals and 524 lieutenant colonels and colonels killed during the invasion.

Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, making it the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign troops since World War II. The move was intended to disrupt a planned Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's Sumy Oblast and to relieve pressure on the Donetsk front.

Since then, Ukraine claims it has inflicted 63,402 Russian troop casualties in the oblast, including 25,625 killed and 971 captured. Ukrainian forces also say they have destroyed or damaged over 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment in the area.

Russia retook most of the lost territory during a renewed offensive in March 2025, supported by North Korean troops.

The Ukraine-U.S. Reconstruction Investment Fund will provide opportunities not only for U.S. companies but also for other countries, representatives of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said during a workshop at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 11. 

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent the attack had destroyed a section of a key pipeline supplying Russian military-industrial facilities in Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, and Sverdlovsk oblasts.

Ukraine and the EU will allocate 100 million euro ($117 million) to boost battlefield-driven solutions under the newly-launched BraveTech EU initiative, announced at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 11. 

"We consider these searches to be another wave of attack on Vitaliy Shabunin and the Anti-Corruption Action Center for criticizing the Presidential Office and (Presidential Office head) Andrii Yermak personally," the center said.

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, war has become a daily reality for thousands of Ukrainian children. Some Ukrainian military units, such as the Azov Brigade, offer boot camps for teenagers to teach them the basics of self-defense, first aid, dry firing, and other survival skills — helping them prepare for both the realities of today and the uncertainties of the future.



Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death.

A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 53 over Kursk Oblast and 13 over Tula Oblast.

"As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed," Ukraine's military intelligence said.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on July 14 for a week-long visit, he told a Novyny Live journalist at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

The deal is one of the largest publicly disclosed investments in Ukrainian defense technology since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Regional authorities reported casualties in at least six Ukrainian oblasts over the past day. 

The media investigation has identified 523 foreign nationals from 28 countries who were killed while serving in the Russian army.

During several months of testing, the system intercepted nearly 550 Russian drones over Kyiv Oblast, an official said.

Despite Trump throwing his weight behind a push for a 60-day truce between Israel and Hamas, no breakthrough was announced during Netanyahu's visit.Alex Brandon/The Associated Press

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to Washington this week netted President Donald Trump another nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize he covets, but the ceasefire the U.S. leader sought for the war in Gaza didn't emerge.

Despite Trump throwing his weight behind a push for a 60-day truce between Israel and Hamas, no breakthrough was announced during Netanyahu's visit, a disappointment for a president who wants to be known as a peacemaker and has hinged his reputation on being a dealmaker.

“He prides himself or being able to make deals, so this is another test case,” said Rachel Brandenburg, the Israel Policy Forum's Washington managing director and senior fellow.

Trump's ability to strike a ceasefire deal in the 21-month war will reveal the boundaries of his influence with Netanyahu, especially after their recent joint strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities that both leaders touted at the White House this week.

Beyond the back-to-back meetings Trump and Netanyahu had at the White House this week, there was little public evidence of progress at a time when the Republican U.S. president is pushing to end the fighting.

Nearly 800 killed while receiving aid in Gaza, UN human rights office says

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that when it comes to a ceasefire in Gaza, “we're closer than we've been in quite a while and we're hopeful, but we also recognize there's still some challenges in the way.”

Rubio, who spoke to reporters while traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, also said that Trump “wants to see a ceasefire and we've invested a lot of time and energy.”

Beyond ending the bloodshed, ending the war in Gaza would give Trump more leeway to strike some of the broader agreements he seeks in the Middle East, such as expanding the Abraham Accords that started in his first term and normalizing relations with Syria's new government.

“He wants to be the one who gets hostages home and see the war in Gaza end so he can move on to some of these bigger deals,” Brandenburg said.

Even if a truce is reached, Netanyahu has promised fighting will continue if necessary until Hamas is destroyed. The militant group, meanwhile, has conditioned the release of the remaining hostages on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, a stipulation Israel has been unwilling to accept.

As Israel and Hamas move closer to a ceasefire agreement, Israel says it wants to maintain troops in a southern corridor of the Gaza Strip – a condition that could derail the talks. 

The Associated Press

It's unclear how much pressure Trump put on Netanyahu in their private talks this week. But the two leaders came into the visit seeming more aligned than ever – at least for now – fresh off the president having twice come to the Israeli leader's assistance.

Trump made the risky move to join Israel's attacks on Iran last month, delivering pivotal U.S. firepower while alarming world leaders and some of Trump's “America first” supporters. Trump also inserted himself into Israel's domestic affairs, calling for Netanyahu's yearslong corruption trial to be thrown out.

That's a marked turnaround in their relationship, which had appeared somewhat strained in recent years.

Trump shocked some of his fellow Republicans and staunch supporters of Israel by publicly criticizing Netanyahu not long after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the conflict.

He said that Netanyahu “was not prepared” for the attack from Hamas and that Netanyahu had “let us down” just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Even during his last visit to the White House earlier this year, Netanyahu seemed caught off guard when Trump announced the U.S. would hold talks with Iran over its nuclear deal rather than embrace Netanyahu's push for military pressure.

With their military objectives aligning for a time on Iran, the Israeli leader has worked to foster a warmer relationship.

In a video he released after the U.S. strikes, Netanyahu spoke – in English instead of Hebrew – of the “unshakeable alliance” between their countries while repeatedly praising Trump.

“His leadership today has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace,” Netanyahu said.

In his visit to Washington this week, the Israeli leader also showed he knows how to praise the president in a way that matters greatly to him when he unveiled a letter in front of reporters and cameras to announce he had nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Those gestures, though, may only carry him so far as Trump pushes for a deal that Netanyahu may not be able to accept.

“I think if Netanyahu stands in the way too much for too long of the sort of loftier objectives Trump has set out for himself,” Brandenburg said, “Netanyahu will be cast aside as more of a problem than an asset.”

Netanyahu, like many Israelis, believes Trump is the greatest friend they have ever had in the White House and is deeply grateful for the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites last month.

But the Israeli leader is also under mounting public pressure to end the war as hostages languish in captivity and more Israeli soldiers are killed in guerrilla-style attacks.

Doctors at Gaza City's Al-Helou hospital said that they are struggling to care for newborn and premature babies, who are crammed into single incubators, due to crippling fuel shortages.

Israel's military success against Iran has given him some political capital, but if he ends the war while leaving Hamas intact, he will have broken his repeated promise of “total victory.”

His far-right coalition partners have threatened to bolt if he does that, sparking early elections that could end his nearly unbroken 16 years in power and leave him more vulnerable to long-standing corruption charges.

That may prove too heavy a price for delivering the kind of lasting ceasefire sought by Trump and demanded by Hamas. Instead, Netanyahu, who is seen as a masterful politician by friends and foes alike, is expected to thread the needle.

In a video statement on Thursday, Netanyahu said that he would agree to a “temporary” 60-day ceasefire in return for the release of half the hostages remaining in Gaza, many of whom are believed dead, and that he would begin negotiations on ending the war.

But he conditioned any lasting ceasefire on Hamas giving up its arms – something the militants have refused to do as long as Israel occupies parts of Gaza.

If Hamas can be disarmed through negotiations, “so much the better,” Netanyahu said. “If it is not achieved through negotiations in 60 days, we will achieve it in other ways – by using force.”

            What looked like a simple, one-story beige cabin near the banks of the Guadalupe River held the stories of generations of young girls marking a rite of passage.
    


            It's where shy, homesick 8-year-olds entered as strangers and emerged as confident young ladies equipped with new skills from the great outdoors and lifelong friends – bonds that would one day prove vital in the face of unfathomable tragedy.
    


            Bubble Inn housed many of the youngest girls at Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old haven tucked in the foothills of Texas' Hill Country.
    


            “You get into those gates, and the whole world disappears,” said Lauren Lindley, who spent six summers as a Camp Mystic counselor – several of them at Bubble Inn. “When you grow up as a Camp Mystic camper, that legacy and the feeling that camp gives you sticks with you for life because it is such a unique and special place.”
    


            On July 4, a new group of young girls were just a week into their formative journey at Bubble Inn when the beloved cabin turned into an epicenter of grief.
    


            Torrential rainfall and catastrophic flooding ripped through Central Texas, killing at least 120 people and leaving at least 160 missing. Camp Mystic, which largely sits in a flood-prone area, lost 27 campers and counselors in the disaster.
    


            No cabin suffered more than Bubble Inn. Most of its 15 campers and counselors were killed. The rest are still missing one week later.
    


 How torrential flooding wrought tragedy at an almost century-old camp for girls in central Texas



             It's not clear whether the girls were overcome by floodwater inside their cabin or outside while trying to escape.
    


            Camp Mystic's longtime co-director, Dick Eastland, reportedly died while trying to rescue girls from Bubble Inn.
    


            “I really, truly think he went there because they're the youngest,” said Alex Loyd, the mother of two Camp Mystic girls who are close to Eastland's grandchildren. “These are first-time campers … you're going to run to the babies, absolutely.”
    


            For decades, Bubble Inn welcomed young girls from across the country and even overseas. Some of those girls later became mothers and sent their own daughters to Bubble Inn.
    


            “I have watched my former campers grow into adults with families of their own,” said Lindley, who's now a professional photographer. “I have photographed their weddings.”
    


            There was nothing particularly special about the building itself. Rather, it was the lessons learned and the relationships fostered between the walls that made Bubble Inn so unique.
    


            “The cabins are all very basic. They're just one big open room,” Lindley said. “You have metal camp beds in a row. The girls would all pack a trunk and bring their trunk, and then at the back of every cabin is a community bathroom with two to three showers, two to three bathroom stalls and two to three sinks … depending on the size of the cabin.”
    


            Realizing Bubble Inn housed some of the youngest children, the directors of Camp Mystic – Eastland and his wife, Tweety – had a plan to help any girls who were particularly homesick.
    


            “We were really taught to focus on all of the kids and keep an eye out for the ones that were seeming to have a hard time or were a little quieter,” Lindley said.
    


            “There was a rest hour every day, and the girls were writing letters back and forth. And if a mom or dad was getting a bunch of letters where a camper was talking about being homesick, they were instructed to call and let Tweety know. And Tweety would let (counselors) know,” Lindley said.
    


            “We were just trained to make sure to watch out for the littlest souls.”
    


            The cabin also gave children a crash course in teamwork and responsibility.
    


            “There's a cabin inspection every day. Whoever wins cabin inspection from The Flats and from the Upper Hill both get to go to the commissary after rest hour first – which is a very big deal,” Lindley said, recalling her time as a counselor from 1999 to 2005.
    


            In the scorching Texas heat, being first in line to get dibs on ice cream at the commissary was a major incentive. But whenever a young camper fell short of her duties – perhaps by leaving dirty clothes on the floor – Lindley would hold her accountable by displaying the evidence on the cabin's front porch.
    


            “Clothes were supposed to be hanging on the clothesline. Your bed was supposed to be made. Trash was supposed to be in trash bins. There's not supposed to be stuff on the floor,” she said. “We were teaching the girls discipline, I guess, and pride for and care for your home. It was a hard sell in the little cabin.”
    


            Lindley said she's still in touch with her “first little loves” from when she started as a counselor in 1999. “And there's probably six or eight of them in that little cohort that to this day are still very, very close,” she said.
    


            Part of the reason: After girls “graduate” from Bubble Inn, they often return to camp year after year and progress to more senior cabins together. So many of the lifelong friendships forged at Camp Mystic start at Bubble Inn.
    


            Bubble Inn was nestled among a cluster of cabins housing the camp's youngest girls, and each of the cabins had a charming, age-appropriate name. The Bubble Inn was flanked by the Giggle Box and Twins I & II, which sat next to the Wiggle Inn.
    


            Those junior cabins were called The Flats because the cottages were on low-lying, flat land near the Guadalupe River. Older campers stayed farther from the river up on Senior Hill, and the girls from Bubble Inn looked up to them – literally and figuratively.
    


            There were also practical reasons for why the youngest girls were down closest to the water, Lindley said.
    


            In the blazing Texas heat, “an older camper is better equipped to go up and down the hill constantly all day, in between classes,” she said. “Little girls, most of the activities are going to be down in the main valley” near The Flats.
    


            The Guadalupe River provided boundless fun for the girls by hosting snorkeling, kayaking, canoeing, diving and many other activities in the tranquil green water.
    


            But the same river that gave decades of joy turned into a cataclysmic force in the predawn hours of July 4.
    


            Torrential rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise more than 20 feet in less than two hours. And Bubble Inn, near the confluence of Cypress Creek and Guadalupe River, suffered catastrophic losses.
    


            Many of the grieving families who lost daughters from Bubble Inn have asked for privacy and declined to speak with the media.
    


            But Dr. Patricia Bellows, whose 8-year-old daughter Margaret perished in the flooding, wanted to thank the many counselors who tried to get campers to safety – including the two Bubble Inn counselors.
    


            “The main thing I have to say is unending gratitude for the brave camp counselors who safely evacuated so many campers, and to the two camp counselors who gave their lives trying to protect my baby,” Bellows told CNN affiliate KTRK.
    


            One of the Bubble Inn counselors, Chloe Childress, died in the flood. The other, Katherine Ferruzzo, remains missing.
    


            Virginia Wynne Naylor, an 8-year-old Bubble Inn camper, also perished in the flood. Her family channeled their grief into action by launching a foundation in her memory.
    


            “The More Like Wynne Fund was established to honor the legacy of Wynne Naylor by inspiring limitless passion for adventure,” her father, Cole Naylor, said in an email to CNN.
    


            The foundation will “support Wynne's local education system, youth wildlife conservation efforts, and select Christian ministries,” her father said.
    


            “Replace grief with hope. Replace stress with servitude. Replace tears of despair with joyful recollection.”
    


            It's not clear what will happen to Camp Mystic or if any of the cabins will be refurbished or rebuilt elsewhere. But the destruction can't break the family traditions, friendships and life lessons cultivated at the camp, Lindley said.
    


            “The memories transport you in a way that transcends nostalgia,” she said. “And the relationships that you forge in this special place are just so incredibly unique that it's like a knot that can't be untied.”

Ukraine on July 10 destroyed a Russian command post and killed five Russian soldiers in occupied Melitopol in a joint operation by military intelligence (HUR) and partisans, the intelligence agency said.

The southern city of Melitopol in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. 

Russian forces established a logistics base in the city, serving as a hub for personnel and military vehicles. The explosion took place as Russian National Guard soldiers stationed there were unloading a military vehicle, the statement read.

"As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station — intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces — was also destroyed," the agency said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

Ukrainian partisan groups, alongside Ukrainian intelligence officers, routinely execute covert missions within Russian-occupied territories to degrade the operational capacity of Russian forces.

The Atesh partisan group on July 10 sabotaged the railways in the Russian city of Volgograd and in the Russian-occupied settlement of Uvarove in Crimea in order to limit Russia's ammunition supplies to the front line and reduce the intensity of Russian assaults.

The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved $500 million in aid for Ukraine as part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Reuters reported on July 11. 



According to Ukraine's military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov, Russia's earlier announcement of its entry into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast serves a political goal.

"We consider these searches to be another wave of attack on Vitaliy Shabunin and the Anti-Corruption Action Center for criticizing the Presidential Office and (Presidential Office head) Andrii Yermak personally," the center said.

The Ukraine-U.S. Reconstruction Investment Fund will provide opportunities not only for U.S. companies but also for other countries, representatives of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said during a workshop at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 11. 

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent the attack had destroyed a section of a key pipeline supplying Russian military-industrial facilities in Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, and Sverdlovsk oblasts.

Ukraine and the EU will allocate 100 million euro ($117 million) to boost battlefield-driven solutions under the newly-launched BraveTech EU initiative, announced at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 11. 

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, war has become a daily reality for thousands of Ukrainian children. Some Ukrainian military units, such as the Azov Brigade, offer boot camps for teenagers to teach them the basics of self-defense, first aid, dry firing, and other survival skills — helping them prepare for both the realities of today and the uncertainties of the future.



Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death.

A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 53 over Kursk Oblast and 13 over Tula Oblast.

"As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed," Ukraine's military intelligence said.

Country's navy announced seizure of uncrewed narco sub, first capture of such a vessel in Colombian waters

The bust was unusual – a narco submarine capable of carrying more than 1.5 tons of cocaine. There were no drugs onboard this time, but most notably, there were no traffickers.

Last week, the Colombian navy announced that it had seized an “autonomous semisubmersible”, the first seizure of such a vessel in the country's waters.

Detected near Santa Marta, off Colombia's Caribbean coast, the small grey vessel was equipped with antennas and a Starlink modem. Two surveillance cameras were also installed: one on the bow, providing a real-time view of the craft's trajectory and obstacles, and another inside to monitor the engine and transmission. Officials believe the uncrewed sub was on a trial run to transport cocaine to the United States or Europe.

“The discovery reflects a migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems that increase evasion capabilities, and which pose a growing challenge to international maritime security,” said Adm Juan Ricardo Rozo Obregón, commander of the Colombian navy.

The navy has warned that autonomous technologies are “an emerging threat that is transforming the transnational criminal landscape”, and said that it believed the vessel was operated by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug-trafficking group.

The discovery comes as Colombia – the world's leading cocaine producer – faces record-high production of the drug, fuelled by surging global demand. The country's estimated coca leaf cultivation increased from 204,000 to 253,000 hectares (504,000 to 625,000 acres) in 2023, according to the United Nations.

While traffickers have used crewed semisubmersibles for decades, the recent advent of the uncrewed vessels shows that gangs are making significant technological advances. They are also seeking new ways to eliminate the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities.

“It's definitely a sign of how creative traffickers are becoming, and how ‘narco subs' have evolved significantly in both design and technology,” said Henry Shuldiner, an investigator at the InSight Crime thinktank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs. “This unmanned model seems like the next step in that evolution.”

Shuldiner said that traffickers were testing whether removing crews – which typically involve at least four people, particularly for long transatlantic journeys – could make the lucrative trade more efficient.

“The fact that this appeared to be a test run shows traffickers are willing to invest in research and development, even if that means losing a vessel to authorities,” he said. Building a semisubmersible can cost as little as $150,000, though most estimates place the cost between $1m and $2m.

Juana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia's Institute for Development and Peace Studies, told AFP that Mexican drug cartels, which operate in Colombia, began “hiring technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine” as far back as 2017, adding that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to identify those behind the shipments.

Colombian law punishes the use, construction, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.

Nonetheless, a near-record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted crossing the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024, according to InSight Crime.

“In some years, we've seen 30 or more interdictions globally. And that's just the ones we know about,” said Shuldiner. “Some US officials estimate that only around 5% of these vessels actually get caught. So even with near-record seizures in 2024, most are still slipping through.”

While most cocaine is still smuggled on container ships, narco subs are playing a growing role, especially for long-haul, transoceanic routes, he added.

The Colombian navy said that in the first half of 2025, 10 semisubmersibles were detected in different regions of the continent, all adapted to make them difficult to track by radar, and even mobilise with partial autonomy.

Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said that while this marks the first capture in Colombian waters, it is most likely not the first deployment. “The authorities are one step behind the criminals when it comes to these things,” he said.

He warned it would be “very difficult” for Colombia and other governments to “keep up” unless countries improve information sharing and cooperation.

Globally, cocaine production soared by nearly 34% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while an estimated 25 million people used the drug, up from 17 million a decade earlier.

Regulatory clarity could encourage more companies to adopt bitcoin in their treasury strategies, analysts said.EDGAR SU/Reuters

U.S.-listed crypto stocks jumped on Friday as bitcoin surged to a record high in the run-up to a landmark week that could cement policy wins for the crypto industry.

Starting July 14, the House of Representatives will debate three major crypto bills that are likely to provide the industry the regulatory framework in the U.S. that it has long demanded.

The lawmakers will discuss the Genius Act, the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act during the “Crypto Week,” amid growing bets that the industry's strained ties with Washington is beginning to thaw.

This is a sharp reversal of fortune for a sector that had once threatened to flee offshore, citing a hostile environment and heavy-handed enforcement in the U.S.

“We expect capital that was previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty to re-enter,” said Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex. “Even if final passage stalls, the optics of legislative engagement are bullish.”

Bitcoin rallies to more highs on rising demand, friendly policies from Trump administration

Regulatory clarity could encourage more companies to adopt bitcoin in their treasury strategies, analysts said, similar to firms such as Strategy, which has accumulated the cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value.

“We're seeing bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance-sheet asset,” said Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen.

Bitcoin's surge has triggered a broader rally in the crypto market, with strong and sustained inflows into the related spot exchange-traded funds driving prices higher, he said.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was last up 4 per cent at US$118,071.19, taking its gains for the year to 26 per cent. The digital asset has surged nearly 41 per cent in the last three months.

Bitcoin buyer and holder Strategy rose 3.8 per cent, while crypto miners Riot Platforms, Hut 8 and Mara Holdings gained between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent.

“Investors are racing to take positions ahead of the extra publicity this event could attract,” said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, referring to the Crypto Week.

Rising confidence in bitcoin is now resulting in investors chasing higher returns in smaller tokens. Ether, the second-largest token, was last up 6.5 per cent, while XRP and Solana gained 12 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

The sector's total market value has swelled to about US$3.7-trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin's sharp rally has also drawn caution from some corners of the market.

As crypto gets embedded in the traditional financial system, some analysts warned the hype may be outpacing reality, as it starts to displace gold as the preferred hedge against equities.

“The (regulatory) backdrop has supported prices and attention has turned to bitcoin's role in portfolios, with some likening the crypto-asset to 'digital gold'. This moniker is likely premature,” said Dirk Willer, Citi's global head of macro, asset allocation and emerging market strategy.

With likely volatility ahead, some analysts have cautioned investors to pause and weigh their time horizons before jumping in.

“It's hard not to be optimistic about bitcoin at this moment in time, but the risk of a fall in price or short-term pullback still exists,” said Simon Peters, crypto analyst at online brokerage eToro.

Critics have argued the Trump administration is conceding too much to the crypto industry.

“I'm concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout that gives the crypto lobby exactly its wish list,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said earlier this week.

She urged Congress to bar public officials, including the President, from issuing, backing or profiting from crypto tokens.

Trump has faced criticism from political rivals and ethics experts over potential for conflicts of interest regarding his family's crypto ventures.

Russian assets frozen by the West should not be released until Moscow pays back at least 500 billion euros (over $580 billion) in compensation to Ukraine, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on July 10 in Rome.

The G7 countries immobilized roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets at the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, later funneling the windfall profits to Ukraine's reconstruction and defense.

The German chancellor, who met President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Italy, noted that Germany is helping Ukraine rebuild its economy also for its own reasons.

"Growth, market freedom, our energy security, as well as the extraordinary strain on our social systems caused by war refugees: all of this is linked to the war in Ukraine," Merz said.

The chancellor further noted that Germany has been involved in Ukraine's reconstruction efforts since the outbreak of the full-scale war.

"The reconstruction of Ukraine is not just a matter of the future... Day after day, we are ensuring that life in Ukraine can continue despite all of Russia's daily and especially nightly attacks."

The comments come as Russia continues to intensify strikes across Ukraine and ground offensives along the front line, damaging infrastructure and putting ever greater strain on the Ukrainian economy.

Delivering opening remarks at the conference on July 10, Zelensky urged European partners to form a recovery coalition to help rebuild Ukraine, calling for an approach similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan.

The Ukrainian president also called upon Western countries to use the immobilized Russian assets — not only their proceeds — more actively to help Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.

At the event, the EU unveiled new financing worth billions of euros, including the European Flagship Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called "the largest equity fund globally to support (Ukraine's) reconstruction." Germany is among the countries backing the fund.

The Ukraine-U.S. Reconstruction Investment Fund will provide opportunities not only for U.S. companies but also for other countries, representatives of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said during a workshop at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 11. 

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent the attack had destroyed a section of a key pipeline supplying Russian military-industrial facilities in Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, and Sverdlovsk oblasts.

Ukraine and the EU will allocate 100 million euro ($117 million) to boost battlefield-driven solutions under the newly-launched BraveTech EU initiative, announced at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 11. 

"We consider these searches to be another wave of attack on Vitaliy Shabunin and the Anti-Corruption Action Center for criticizing the Presidential Office and (Presidential Office head) Andrii Yermak personally," the center said.

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, war has become a daily reality for thousands of Ukrainian children. Some Ukrainian military units, such as the Azov Brigade, offer boot camps for teenagers to teach them the basics of self-defense, first aid, dry firing, and other survival skills — helping them prepare for both the realities of today and the uncertainties of the future.



Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death.

A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 53 over Kursk Oblast and 13 over Tula Oblast.

"As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed," Ukraine's military intelligence said.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on July 14 for a week-long visit, he told a Novyny Live journalist at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

The deal is one of the largest publicly disclosed investments in Ukrainian defense technology since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Regional authorities reported casualties in at least six Ukrainian oblasts over the past day. 

The media investigation has identified 523 foreign nationals from 28 countries who were killed while serving in the Russian army.

During several months of testing, the system intercepted nearly 550 Russian drones over Kyiv Oblast, an official said.

Germany and Norway are prepared to purchase three Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine from a U.S. manufacturer, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference in Rome on July 10.

"Germany is ready to pay – I have agreements with them – for two systems. Norway is ready to pay – I have bilateral agreements with Prime Minister (Jonas Gahr Stoere) – one system," Zelensky said on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference.

The announcement follows Kyiv's calls for Western partners to provide additional air defenses to help Ukraine repel intensifying Russian aerial strikes.

Zelensky added that Ukraine needs a total of 10 Patriots and voiced hope that other European partners will join the new financing scheme. He noted that a final response from the U.S. manufacturer is still awaited.

Speaking at the Recovery Conference earlier on July 10, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed that Berlin is willing to purchase Patriots for Ukraine from the U.S., though adding that a final decision has not yet been made.

The comments followed reporting that U.S. President Donald Trump appealed to Merz to purchase a Patriot battery to boost Kyiv's air defenses. The U.S. president also said separately that he is "looking" into the possibility of helping Ukraine acquire additional Patriots.

At a press conference in Malaysia on July 10, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also acknowledged Ukraine's need for air defenses and urged European allies to provide their Patriot batteries.

"Ukrainians need more Patriot batteries. Many European countries have them, but no one wants to part with theirs. I hope that will change," Rubio said.

"I hope we can convince some of our NATO partners to send these batteries to Ukraine."

The comments followed confusion caused by what appeared to be a unilateral decision by the Pentagon to halt some of the weapons shipments en route to Ukraine, including Patriot missiles and precision munitions. Deliveries of at least some of the shipments have since then reportedly resumed, and Trump pledged to provide additional military support to Kyiv.  

The Patriots are powerful U.S.-produced air defenses that have played a key role in protecting the Ukrainian skies. They are one of the few systems capable of intercepting Russian ballistic missiles.

Ukraine operates at least six of these systems, provided over the past years by the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania.

Russia has ramped up aerial strikes against Ukraine in the past weeks, launching a record of over 740 drones and missiles on July 9. A day later, Russian forces again launched around 400 drones and 18 missiles against the country, primarily targeting Kyiv.

A standoff occurred between federal immigration agents and staff at a Southern California medical center on July 8 after a Honduran man facing detention attempted to evade arrest.

Staff at the Ontario Advanced Surgery Center demanded to see identification and a warrant from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who was wearing a mask and a bulletproof vest and was trying to detain the alleged illegal immigrant.

MOSCOW, July 11. /TASS/. Iran's intellectual elite will continue to defend the country's nuclear program as its legitimate right, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said in an interview with TASS.

Asked whether Tehran plans to resume production of enriched uranium in the medium term following the US and Israeli strikes, the diplomat replied, "This aggression has strengthened Iran's determination to build a desirable future for the country, and as we go toward that goal, our intellectual and scientific elite will continue to adamantly defend its nuclear program as an indisputable and legitimate right."

"Iran's nuclear capabilities are internal, domestic, so damage to infrastructure would be ineffective because nuclear expertise can't be destroyed by bombardment and missiles," the ambassador said. "We have not had and do not have any demands other than respect for international law."

Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Nine days later, the US entered the fray. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. According to the US, there were no casualties or significant damage. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24.

First Liberty Building and Loan largely drew investors from religious and political networks which were rocked by the company's collapse.Jeff Amy/The Associated Press

A prominent Georgia Republican was running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million, federal officials alleged in a complaint filed Thursday.

The civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said First Liberty Building and Loan, controlled by Brant Frost IV, lied to investors about its business of making high-interest loans to companies. Instead, investigators said, it raised more money to repay earlier investors.

Frost is alleged to have taken more than $19 million of investor funds for himself, his family and affiliated companies even as the business was going broke, spending $160,000 on jewellery and $335,000 with a rare coin dealer. Frost is also said to have spent $320,000 to rent a vacation home over multiple years in Kennebunkport, Maine, the town where the family of late president George H. W. Bush famously spent summers.

The SEC said Frost kept writing checks even after the commission began its investigation

First Liberty said last month that it would stop making loans and paying interest and principal to investors in those loans. The company said it was not answering phone calls or emails.

First Liberty has not responded to an e-mail seeking comment, and no one was present at its office Thursday evening in Newnan, a suburb southwest of Atlanta. A lawyer who acts as the company's registered agent for corporate purposes said earlier that he had no information.

The collapse rocked the religious and political networks that the business drew investors from. It also could have ramifications in state Republican politics, cutting off funding to the far-right candidates that Frost and his family have favoured. Investigators said Frost spent $570,000 from investor funds on political contributions.

The SEC said the business had only $2.67 million in cash as of May 30, although regulators are also seeking to claw back money from Frost and associated companies. With 300 investors out $140 million, that means the average investor put in nearly $500,000.

First Liberty said it made loans to companies that needed cash while they waited for more conventional loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. It charged high rates of interest – 18% on some loans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. First Liberty promised investors equally high rates of return – 16% on the 18% loans.

In recent months the business advertised heavily on conservative radio shows promising “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors.”

“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” Justin C. Jeffries, associate director of enforcement for the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.

The company has represented that it is “co-operating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business.” The SEC said Frost and his companies agreed to the SEC's enforcement actions “with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.”

While the SEC says there were loans to companies, as many as 90% of those companies have defaulted. By 2021 the company was running as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint said, even as Frost withdrew increasing amounts of money.

The business is being investigated by the Georgia secretary of state for possible violations of securities law said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for the office.

A 2023 document obtained by the AP is titled as a “promissory note,” and Sinners said anyone issuing promissory notes is supposed to be registered with Georgia securities officials.

Sinners encouraged any victims to contact the state Securities Division.

Federal prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they are considering criminal charges. Sometimes both an SEC civil case and a federal criminal case are filed over investment frauds.

Frost has been an important player in Georgia politics since 1988, when he co-ordinated televangelist Pat Robertson's Republican presidential bid in the state. His son, Brant Frost V, is chairman of the Coweta County Republican Party, where the company is based, and is a former second vice-chair of the state Republican Party. Daughter Katie Frost is Republican chairman of the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Coweta County and other areas southwest of Atlanta.

At last month's state Republican convention, Katie Frost chaired a nominating committee that recommended delegates re-elect state Party Chairman Josh McKoon. Delegates followed that recommendation, rejecting a number of insurgent candidates.

MOSCOW, July 11. /TASS/. The threat that the conflict in the Middle East will escalate to a hot phase has not passed yet, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali told TASS.

"There is still a possibility of the Israeli regime entering the phase of radicalization in decision-making," he said when asked about how sustainable the truce with Israel is.

According to the diplomat, Israel "provoked chaos in the region, made efforts to derail the dialogue."

"We did not initiate this war. It was imposed on our country by the aggressive actions of the Zionist regime and the United States," Jalali said. "As [Russian] officials have pointed out, the war party is still active in the region, but we do not seek conflict."

Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Nine days later, the US entered the fray. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. According to the US, there were no casualties or significant damage. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24.

President Donald Trump says migrants would need to know “how to run away from an alligator” to flee the new detention center he's visiting in a remote area of the Florida Everglades.

MIAMI (AP) — Worms in the food. Toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste. Days without a shower or prescription medicine. Mosquitoes and insects everywhere. Lights on all night. Air conditioners that suddenly shut off in the tropical heat. Detainees forced to use recorded phone lines to speak with their lawyers and loved ones.

Only days after President Donald Trump toured a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” these are some of the conditions described by people held inside. 

Attorneys, advocates, detainees and families are speaking out about the makeshift migrant detention center Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration raced to build on an isolated airstrip surrounded by swampland. The center began accepting detainees on July 2.

“These are human beings who have inherent rights, and they have a right to dignity,” said immigration attorney Josephine Arroyo. “And they're violating a lot of their rights by putting them there.”

Government officials have adamantly disputed the conditions described by detainees, their attorneys and family members, but have provided few details, and have denied access to the media. A televised tour for Trump and DeSantis showed rows of chain-link cages, each containing dozens of bunkbeds, under large white tents.

“The reporting on the conditions in the facility is completely false. The facility meets all required standards and is in good working order,” said Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which built the center.

A group of Democratic lawmakers sued the DeSantis administration for access. The administration is allowing a site visit by state legislators and members of Congress on Saturday, July 12. 

Families and attorneys who spoke with The Associated Press relayed detainees' accounts of a place they say is unsanitary and lacks adequate medical care, pushing some into a state of extreme distress.

Such conditions make other immigration detention centers where advocates and staff have warned of unsanitary confinements, medical neglect and a lack of food and water seem “advanced,” said immigration attorney Atara Eig.

Trump and his allies have praised this detention center's harshness and remoteness as befitting the “worst of the worst” and as a national model for the deterrence needed to persuade immigrants to “self-deport” from the United States.

But among those locked inside the chain-link enclosures are people with no criminal records, and at least one teenage boy, attorneys told the AP.

Immigration attorney Katie Blankenship described a concerning lack of medical care at the facility, relaying an account from a 35-year-old Cuban client who told his wife that detainees go days without a shower. The toilets are in the same space as the bunkbeds and can't handle their needs, she said.

The wife, a 28-year-old green card holder and the mother of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, relayed his complaints to the AP. Fearing government retaliation against her and her detained husband, she asked not to be identified.

“They have no way to bathe, no way to wash their mouths, the toilet overflows and the floor is flooded with pee and poop,” the woman told the AP. “They eat once a day and have two minutes to eat. The meals have worms,” she added.

The woman said the detainees “all went on a hunger strike” on Thursday night to protest the conditions.

“There are days when I don't know anything about him until the evening,” she said, describing waiting for his calls, interrupted every three minutes by an announcement that the conversation is being recorded.

The detainees' attorneys say their due process rights are among numerous constitutional protections being denied.

Blankenship is among the lawyers who have been refused access. After traveling to the remote facility and waiting for hours to speak with her clients, including a 15-year-old Mexican boy with no criminal charges, she was turned away by a security guard who told her to wait for a phone call in 48 hours that would notify her when she could return.

“I said, well, what's the phone number that I can follow up with that? There is none,” Blankenship recalled. “You have due process obligations, and this is a violation of it.”

Arroyo's client, a 36-year-old Mexican man who came to the U.S. as a child, has been detained at the center since July 5 after being picked up for driving with a suspended license in Florida's Orange County. He's a beneficiary of the DACA program, created to protect young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and to provide them with work authorization.

Blankenship's Cuban client paid a bond and was told he'd be freed on a criminal charge in Miami, only to be detained and transferred to the Everglades. 

Eig has been seeking the release of a client in his 50s with no criminal record and a stay of removal, meaning the government can't legally deport him while he appeals. But she hasn't been able to get a bond hearing. She's heard that an immigration court inside the Krome Detention Center in Miami “may be hearing cases” from the Everglades facility, but as of Friday, they were still waiting.

“Jurisdiction remains an issue,” Eig said, adding “the issue of who's in charge over there is very concerning.”

JACOB LAKE, Ariz. (AP) — Visitors and staff at two national parks in the U.S. West have been evacuated because of wildfires.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (418 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed Thursday morning after lighting sparked blazes on both rims, the park said. The wildfire on the South Rim has burned 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers), with no containment of the perimeter. The park is closed until further notice.

The conditions there have been ripe for wildfire with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday.

Firefighters saved the visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn.

The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed Thursday because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby.

The fire began Wednesday evening after a thunderstorm moved through the area, fire officials said. It has burned about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) with zero containment. 

About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joelle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place.

According to a safety director, three paint buckets filled to the brim with uranium ore were stored in the National Park's Museum Collections Building.

The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is temporarily closed as mandatory evacuation orders remain in effect due to a wildfire near the park. 

The White Sage Fire, near Jacob Lake, prompted the National Park Service to evacuate all North Rim visitors "immediately" on Thursday night. 

As of Thursday night, the fire had burned about 1,000 acres and remains active with no containment, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Baltimore Orioles fans received an interesting rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" before sweeping the New York Mets in a double-header on Thursday night, but apparently not everyone was impressed with the autotuned version. 

Dan Deacon, the Baltimore-based recording artist known for his "innovative electronic music," welcomed fans with just that before the Orioles took care of the Mets 3-1 in Game 1 and 7-3 in Game 2.

"I think the Orioles have officially hit rock bottom," one person wrote in a post on X.

The video of Deacon's performance received over 1.2 million views, and it left fans at home and in the stands a bit confused. 

"I'm like alternating in between ‘what is this' and ‘I'm feeling it,'" one person wrote on X.

"What's his claim to fame ?…it's not singing…," another added.

But fans on Deacon's Instagram, which has over 47,000 followers, seemed to appreciate his unique performance. 

"Dan sings the anthem and the O's sweep the double header against one of the best teams in the league. Coincidence? I think not," one person wrote. 

"100% this is why the Os won the game," another added.

Jordan Westburg homered and drove in three runs while Alex Jackson doubled twice and scored two runs in his Baltimore debut to help the Orioles win for the fifth time in six games. Meanwhile, the Mets fell 1.5 games behind first-place Philadelphia in the NL East after sinking to 14-16 in interleague play.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian attack on an air base in Qatar that's key to the U.S. military likely hit a geodesic dome housing equipment used by the Americans for secure communications, satellite images analyzed Friday by The Associated Press show.

The U.S. military and Qatar didn't respond to requests for comment over the damage, which so far hasn't been publicly acknowledged.

The Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base outside of Doha, Qatar's capital, on June 23 came as a response to the American bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran — and provided the Islamic Republic a way to retaliate that quickly led to a ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump ending the 12-day Iran-Israel war. 

The Iranian attack otherwise did little damage — likely because of the fact that the U.S. evacuated its aircraft from the base, which is home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, before the attack.

Trump also has said that Iran signaled when and how it would retaliate, allowing American and Qatari air defense to be ready for the attack, which briefly disrupted air travel in the Middle East, but otherwise didn't tip over into the regional war long feared by analysts. 




Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC show the geodesic dome visible at the Al Udeid Air Base on the morning of June 23, just hours before the attack. 

The U.S. Air Force's 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, which operates out of the base, announced in 2016 the installation of the $15 million piece of equipment, known as a modernized enterprise terminal. Photos show a satellite dish inside of the dome, known as a radome. 

Images taken June 25 and every day subsequently show the dome is gone, with some damage visible on a nearby building. The rest of the base appears largely untouched in the images. 

It's possible a fragment or something else struck the dome, but given the destruction of the dome, it was likely an Iranian attack, possibly with a bomb-carrying drone given the limited visible damage to surrounding structures. 

The London-based satellite news channel Iran International first reported on the damage, citing satellite photos taken by a different provider. 

In the U.S., Trump described the Iranian attack as a “very weak response.” He had said that Tehran fired 14 missiles, with 13 intercepted and one being “set free” as it was going in a “nonthreatening” direction. 

“I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,” he wrote on his website Truth Social.

After the attack, Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard insisted that the air base had been the “target of a destructive and powerful missile attack.” Iran's Supreme National Security Council also said that the base had been “smashed,” without offering any specific damage assessments. 

Potentially signaling that he knew the dome had been hit, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei separately said that the base's communications had been disconnected by the attack.

“All equipment of the base was completely destroyed and now the U.S. command stream and connection from Al Udeid base to its other military bases have been completely cut,” said Ahmad Alamolhoda, a hard-line cleric.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats.

Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's stunning Democratic Party primary victory in the nation's most populous city proved to be a gift for Republicans aiming to paint Democrats as extreme radicals.

Republicans have been relentless in trying to anchor Mamdani to Democrats across the country who are running in competitive races in elections this year and in next year's midterms.

One of the latest examples comes from New Hampshire, in the high-profile 2026 race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

Republican candidate and former Sen. Scott Brown went up this week with a digital ad that edits a picture of Rep. Chris Pappas, the Democratic candidate in the race, alongside photos of Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive rock star who backed Mamdani.

TRUMP ARGUES NYC FACES DIRE CONSEQUENCES IF ‘COMMUNIST' MAMDANI BECOMES MAYOR

A digital ad by Republican senate candidate in New Hampshire former Sen. Scott Brown edits together a photo of the Democratic candidate in the 2026 race, Rep. Chris Pappas, next to photos of Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Scott Brown Senate campaign)

The caption on the ad reads "Comrade Chris."

Responding, the Pappas campaign told Fox News that "Scott Brown is so desperate to make this election about anything other than the issues because he knows he embraces an agenda of higher costs and health care cuts that's deeply unpopular in New Hampshire."

And Pappas campaign communications adviser Collin Gately added that "Chris is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress, and has a demonstrated record of working across the aisle to deliver results for New Hampshire."

THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO PREVENT FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NYC

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on Mamdani's leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after his victory that claimed, "the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare."

Aiming to tie House Democrats to Mamdani, NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella argued that "every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him."

The National Republican Senatorial Campaign (NRSC) also quickly got into the game, tying Pappas and Abdul El-Sayed - one of the contenders for the Democratic Senate nomination in battleground Michigan - to Mamdani.

No surprise - the Republican attacks have even come from President Donald Trump, who, since Mamdani's victory two weeks ago, has repeatedly claimed that the 33-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from the New York City borough of Queens is a "communist."

Mamdani, who convincingly topped former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic mayoral nomination and take a big step towards becoming the city's first Muslim mayor, is giving Republicans plenty of ammunition.

He's proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5, and setting up government-run grocery stores.

RESURFACED MAMDANI PHOTO SPARKS SOCIAL MEDIA FIRESTORM 

Also fueling the Republican attacks are recent news items that have gone viral. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December, when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his recent comments in a cable news interview that "I have many critiques of capitalism."

"The Democratic Party's trying to convince people that the tail is not wagging the dog, and they don't answer to the more extreme elements of their party," veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News. "Now, that entire effort is undercut by a socialist winning handily in a bellwether election to determine who's going to run America's largest city."

"It's a messaging nightmare that's going to unfold in real time from now until the midterms," said Reed, who is a top political adviser to Brown.

Veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News that "the primary challenge for Democrats regarding Mamdani's candidacy is not his policy approach. The challenge is his party identification as a democratic socialist."

"If there's any doubt about the negative implications of adding the word socialist to Mamdani's party affiliation, one need only peruse the national coverage whose focus has been on his party and the absence of party leadership to rush to his defense or offer endorsements," Lesperance, the president of New England College, said.

But Democrats question the effectiveness of the GOP push.

They argue that there's a world of difference between heavily blue New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin, and some key battleground states and swing districts across the country.

Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee told reporters the day after Mamdani's victory that "I love New York, but it's a very liberal place and I don't know that you can necessarily apply that to the rest of the country."

Gately, the Pappas campaign communications adviser, pointed to the ad from the Brown campaign and said that "Granite Staters trust Chris and will see through these attacks."

And veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo cautioned, "I wouldn't read too much into this."

Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, argued that "Republicans are making too much out of this."

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons discuss President Donald Trump signing his 'big, beautiful bill' into law and the opening of 'Alligator Alcatraz.'

EXCLUSIVE: Some individuals awaiting deportation at "Alligator Alcatraz" in Florida were convicted of serious crimes, according to new information from the Florida Attorney General's office. 

"The left-wing press continues to spend their time amplifying false reports, but the reality is that there are monsters awaiting deportation within Alligator Alcatraz far worse than the monsters lurking in the surrounding Everglades," Jeremy Redfern, communications director for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, said in a statement.

"This group of murderers, rapists, and gang members are just a small sample of the deranged psychopaths that Florida is helping President Trump and his administration remove from our country," he continued.

Lazaro Rodriguez Santana, a Cuban national, was convicted in Texas of sexual assault and failure to register as a sex offender. Honduran national Jose Fortin was convicted of second-degree murder in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Furthermore, authorities say Oscar "Satan" Sanchez of Honduras is an MS-13 gang member who faced convictions for resisting arrest, conspiracy to commit murder and assault in New York, as well as RICO offenses.

Guatemalan national Luis Donald Corado was convicted of burglary, forced entry, and voyeurism in Miami. Specifically, Corado's case involved him looking into a woman's window, according to the Florida official's office.

Venezuelan national Wilfredo Alberto Lazama-Garcia is wanted for murder and aggravated robbery in the South American country. He is presumed to be a "gotaway" in 2021 during the border crisis.

INSIDE 'ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ': THE NEW MIGRANT DETENTION FACILITY ERECTED AT AN ABANDONED EVERGLADES AIRPORT

In the United States, he was convicted of conspiracy "to defraud the U.S. government in Oklahoma." Eddy Lopez Jemot of Cuba was convicted of murder, arson, and assault. He was arrested for "cutting the throat of an elderly woman" in Key Largo, Florida, and then lit her residence on fire with hopes of hiding the evidence. 

Later that night, he allegedly "threatened to kill" another woman via beheading.

The facility is receiving initial backing by the state of Florida and is expected to receive repurposed FEMA funds on the federal level.

"It's known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz,' which is very appropriate, because I looked outside, and that's not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon," Trump said while touring the facility earlier this month. "But very soon, this facility will have some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet."

Alligator Alcatraz opened earlier this month with fierce opposition from environmentalists, who oppose its location in the Everglades, as well as some Democrats, who have been critical of the Trump administration's immigration and deportation policies.

"This proposed detention center isn't just cruel, it's environmentally catastrophic. This facility would desecrate ecologically critical wetlands, trample on Tribal sovereignty, and transform one of the world's most cherished ecosystems into a prison camp for political gain," Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a June 24 news release.

            US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened Brazil with a crippling tariff of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter he sent to the country's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
    


            In the letter posted on Truth Social, Trump alleged Lula is undertaking a “Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” over charges against its right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro.
    


            Bolsonaro, who has bragged about his closeness with Trump, is facing trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against Lula.
    


            Lula vowed to reciprocate if Trump follows through with his threat.
    


            “Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,” Lula said in a post on X.
    


            “Any measure to increase tariffs unilaterally will be responded to in light of Brazil's Law of Economic Reciprocity,” he added.
    


            This marks the first time in months another country has threatened to match Trump's tariff threat.
    


            Unlike the 21 other countries that have received letters from Trump this week, the US ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, meaning the US exported more goods to there than it imported from there. Top US exports to the South American country last year included aircraft and spacecraft, fuels, industrial machinery like nuclear reactors, and electrical equipment, according to US Census Bureau data. So a 50% Brazilian tariff on American goods could severely harm these industries.
    


            Imports from Brazil to the US have faced a minimum 10% tariff since Trump's announcement of “reciprocal” tariffs in April – the baseline rate he has applied to most goods from most countries during the 90-day negotiation period, which has now been extended to August 1.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has used the threat of tariffs to try to change other countries' domestic policy decisions.
    


            Earlier this year, he threatened 25% tariffs on Colombian exports that would grow to 50% if the country didn't accept deportees from the US. (Colombia ultimately accepted the deportees and avoided those tariffs.) Trump also imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China over the role he alleges they play in facilitating illegal migration to the US and enabling fentanyl to reach the country.
    


            But despite Trump's discontent with the Bolsonaro trial, he wrote that “there will be no Tariff if Brazil, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States.” Trump's made nearly identical offers in a slew of other letters he sent to heads of state this week.
    


            Other recipients of tariff letters on Wednesday included the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Moldova, Brunei, Algeria, Libya and Iraq, with rates going as high as 30% on goods they ship to the United States. The new tariffs go into effect August 1, pending negotiations.
    


            The rates Trump said would be imposed on goods from Sri Lanka, Moldova, Iraq and Libya were lower than those he announced in early April. The rates on goods from the Philippines and Brunei were higher, compared to April levels. Meanwhile, the rate on goods from Algeria was the same (30%) as April levels.
    


            The US and various trading partners have been negotiating new trade agreements since Trump announced so-called “reciprocal” tariffs back in April. Yet few deals have come to fruition.
    


            During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump said “a letter means a deal.” But that doesn't appear to be how some countries are perceiving the missives.

            In all the letters except the one sent to Brazil's Lula, Trump wrote that he takes particular issue with the trade deficits the United States runs with other nations, meaning America buys more goods from there compared to how much American businesses export to those countries. Trump also said the tariffs would be set in response to other policies that he deems are impeding American goods from being sold abroad.
    


            Trump has encouraged world leaders to manufacture goods in the United States to avoid tariffs. If they chose to retaliate by slapping higher tariffs on American goods, Trump threatened to tack that onto the rate charged on their country's goods shipped to the United States.
    


            Trump has now sent 22 letters on tariff rates to heads of government this week, and more could still come.
    


            JPMorgan economists said in a note to clients on Wednesday titled “Another day, another step closer to Liberation Day” that the 50% tariff threat on Brazilian goods was “most surprising.” (“Liberation Day” refers to April 2, the day Trump held a Rose Garden event to announce “reciprocal” tariff rates.)
    


            “It is possible these tariffs will never be implemented, as some in the market are hoping for,” the economists said, referring to Trump's latest threats.
    


            On Thursday, Indonesia, one of the 14 countries that received Trump's tariff letters on Monday, said it has reached an agreement with the US to intensify trade negotiations in the next three weeks. Both countries also see potential in expanding cooperation in sectors such as critical minerals, the economic ministry of Southeast Asia's largest economy said in a statement.
    


            Meanwhile, the Philippines said it is “concerned” about Trump's decision to impose a 20% tariff on its exports to the US, while vowing to continue negotiations. A delegation will visit the US next week in a bid to lower the levy, Frederick Go, an adviser to the nation's president, told reporters.
    


            Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. ET was the initial deadline Trump set three months ago for countries to ink trade deals with the US or instantly face higher tariff rates. However, on Monday he extended that deadline to August 1.
    


            Bolsonaro, often dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics,” is on trial in Brazil for charges related to an alleged plot to overturn the 2022 election results. He and dozens of associates have been charged with attempting a coup d'état, which prosecutors allege involved a plan to potentially assassinate elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Trump late Wednesday also announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, as he had promised on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. The tariff announcement comes after Trump on February 25 signed an executive action requiring the Commerce Department to assess whether America's copper imports posed a national security risk.
    


            “I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT,” Trump said on Truth Social Wednesday. “Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) “Leaders” decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity.”
    


            America imports about half of the copper it uses, according to the London Stock Exchange, and most of it comes from China, Chile, Japan and Congo. Copper is a key ingredient in electrical wiring necessary semiconductors and a host of other key goods, including batteries and defense equipment.
    


            “America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry,” Trump said. “THIS IS, AFTER ALL, OUR GOLDEN AGE!”
    


            Copper have prices surged over the past day after Trump on Tuesday said tariffs on copper imports were imminent. Copper futures jumped 13.1% on Tuesday to settle at a record high $5.69 per pound. It was the biggest single-day increase on record going back to 1968. They fell a bit Wednesday but were up nearly 3% in late trading.
    


            “I've been surprised it's taken this long to get the copper tariff,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “There are three buckets of tariffs: new revenue, national security, forced policy change. National security is the copper piece.”
    


            But some analysts were skeptical that tariffs could quickly boost America's copper mining industry and reduce its reliance on foreign countries for the key metal.
    


            “The US remains structurally short on copper, importing over 50% of its needs—primarily from South America—with no clear path to improving that for years to come,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “A tariff-induced price premium risks making copper—and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure—materially more expensive.”
    


            Hansen called the 50% increase on copper tariffs “a massive tax on consumers of copper.”
    


            Responding to Trump citing national security as a reason for the the copper tariff, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday that China “opposed the generalization of the concept of national security.”
    


            “We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war, and the abuse of tariffs is not in the interests of any party,” Mao Ning, the spokesperson said.
    


            While the US imported most of its refined copper from Chile, Canada and Peru last year, China is a major player in the copper trade. Most copper mines are in South American and African countries, but China dominates the refining of the metal globally, according to the United States Geological Survey. China has also been investing in copper mines in African countries, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, over the last few decades.

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

America's natural grandeur, wide-open spaces and vast frontiers have inspired patriots for generations. As Americans pushed west, we learned to work with the land. We established national parks to protect the diverse geography that spans the nation and fuel economic prosperity. And we united around the desire to conserve America's beauty and natural resources for generations to come.  

But for the last several decades, the environment has become engulfed in partisan culture wars. As a result, our nation's leaders have increasingly failed to enact durable, long-lasting, and balanced environmental policies. A subject matter that once transcended partisan politics and brought leaders from all sides together has seen little to no substantial progress in the modern political era.  

These years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach and neglect have left America's natural resources in crisis. We've seen glimmers of hope with overwhelming bipartisan support for conservation legislation — like the "Great American Outdoors Act." But issues with broad support nationwide remain trapped in partisan gridlock.  

'AMERICA FIRST' NATIONAL PARKS PLAN FROM TRUMP SLAPS HIGHER FEES ON FOREIGN TOURISTS

Today, the National Park System is in $23 billion of debt. Poor forest management is exacerbating already catastrophic wildfires, costing our country between $394 billion and $893 billion annually. Unnecessarily stringent restrictions are stripping hunting and recreational access to public lands. Our nation's ecosystems and wildlife populations are in a state of disrepair. And America's water infrastructure no longer provides our agricultural industry and communities with the resources they need to flourish.

It should have never come to this — and it's time to right the ship. We are dedicated to putting every American first by prioritizing conservation, restoring our lands and waters and protecting our nation's outdoor heritage.  

That is why President Donald Trump signed an executive order to "Make America Beautiful Again." This order is a monumental first step to restoring America's natural beauty through bold leadership, innovation and commonsense policies.

GREEN ENERGY ZEALOTS HAND AMERICA'S ENEMIES THE ULTIMATE WEAPON  

The order establishes the Make America Beautiful Again Commission, which will give a politically diverse set of elected leaders, experts, nonprofits and other decision-makers with a wide variety of backgrounds a seat at the table. The commission will then submit a comprehensive strategy outlining recommended actions for achieving long-term conservation success.

The Make America Beautiful Again Commission will bring federal and state officials, private sector leaders, conservation organizations and tribal governments together to develop policy strategies for conservation. This executive order turns the nation's attention to the protection of our natural beauty and the expansion of our outdoor heritage. 

This commission provides an opportunity for us to protect water resources, restore forests and natural habitats, reduce waste and pollution, recover America's wildlife, enhance hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation on public lands, building environmental resilience and security, and advance conservation education and global leadership.  

The purpose of establishing this commission is to develop commonsense solutions and kick-start action that all Americans can agree is much needed and long overdue. Getting that job done requires bipartisan, inter-agency partnerships — bringing folks together to discuss their personal experiences and insights regarding environmental efforts, working to reach compromises and forming unlikely alliances around our shared love of nature.  

AMERICAN FLAG HUNG UPSIDE DOWN IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK IN PROTEST OVER LAYOFFS

America's conservation legacy has faded over the last few decades — but our pride for our nation's beauty lives on. As we celebrate the kickoff of America's 250th birthday, we are not only filled with pride and patriotism for this great nation, we are also reminded of our great responsibility to leave this democracy more beautiful than we found it.

We understand that it is our duty to conserve our natural resources, to be good stewards of our land, and to create long-lasting policies that actually work for the environment, the economy and the American people. From sea to shining sea, the natural majesty of the United States of America must be protected and passed down to future generations.  

We are kickstarting the restoration of our country's conservation legacy with this executive order. But the real work starts now as we come together to do all that we can to preserve our natural beauty, conserve our natural resources and Make America Beautiful Again.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodian lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment that would allow the government to draft legislation seeking to revoke the citizenship of anyone found guilty of conspiring with foreign nations to harm the national interest.

The 125 members of National Assembly unanimously passed the proposal Friday and legally amended Article 33 of Cambodia's constitution, enabling the government to immediately draw up a bill allowing citizenships to be stripped for the first time. 

The latest legal move by supporters of Prime Minister Hun Manet was viewed by critics as a way to suppress internal dissent and eliminate policital opponents of his administration and the ruling Cambodian People's Party. 

The change would apply to lifelong Cambodian citizens, people with dual citizenship in Cambodia and another nation and people from other countries who have been granted Cambodian citizenship.

Some government critics and opposition politicians are known to have dual citizenship.

Justice Minister Koeut Rith said government officials will urgently draft a bill to revoke the citizenship of any individual found guilty of treason or collaborating with foreign entities to seriously harm the interests of Cambodia and its people.

He claimed some Cambodians have colluded with a foreign country to harm their nation's interests. The comment appeared to be a reference to a May 28 confrontation between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area on the border.

Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office earlier this month pending an ethics investigation over a leaked phone call about the border dispute with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the influential former prime minister and father of Hun Manet. The leaked phone call set off political turmoil in Thailand as Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the conflict.




Last month Cambodia submitted an official request to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to resolve the ongoing border dispute involving several ancient temple sites.

The consitutional amendment in Cambodia comes after Hun Sen last week called for the Ministry of Justice to explore legal avenues in response to frequent government criticism by opposition figures. Hun Sen and Hun Manet both said the legal change was necessary, comparing it to similar laws in several other countries.

Speaking to villagers and government officials last week in northern Kampong Thom province, Hun Manet claimed that among nearly 200 United Nations member states, 150 countries have laws allowing citizenship revocation, including the United States.

“Please don't be concerned if you are a patriot and do not oppose the interest of country. But if you have conspired with foreign powers to destroy Cambodia then, yes, it is true you should be worried, and in such case you are not a Cambodian.” Hun Manet said. “No true patriot would ever plot with foreign powers to destroy their nation.”

Amnesty International said it was deeply concerned the Cambodian government will use the “repressive amendment” to render its critics stateless.

“Judicial independence is key to safeguarding people's rights including the right to nationality and reversing a culture of impunity. This has enabled the government's authoritarian practices to continue unchecked, such as its persecution of opposition leaders, activists and independent journalists,” Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in a statement.

Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy was one of those named by Hun Sen as making comments detrimental to the nation.

Rainsy for decades has been a harsh critic and one of the most popular opponents of the Cambodian People's Party, which fueled Hun Sen's rise to power. Rainsy has been in exile since 2016 to avoid serving prison sentences on defamation, treason and other charges, which his supporters consider politically motivated.

Rainsy said recent comments by Hun Sen about the border dispute with Thailand were not patriotism but a personal and political reaction rooted in fear and panic over the potential collapse of a regime deeply entangled with international criminal networks.

“Hun Sen's anti Thai rhetoric is nothing more than a political smokescreen. While he presents the dispute as one of historical grievance and national dignity, the real motive behind his indignation is Thailand's concerted effort to dismantle Chines-run cyber-scam operations based in border areas — operations that have become a vital source of illicit funding for the current Phnom Penh regime,” Rainsy said in a June 28 online post.

Just when you thought the radical left's social experiments couldn't get any more out of touch with the reality of everyday Americans, Washington Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Florida Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost have a new bill that would export the disastrous homelessness policies of Seattle to the entire nation. 

Their "Housing Not Handcuffs Act" would effectively give a green light to the homeless encampments, crime and public health crises that have crippled cities like Seattle, all under the guise of compassion. 

This is your warning. 

For those of us who have witnessed the decay of our once-beautiful cities, the premise of this bill is not just misguided, but insulting. The legislation, introduced to mark the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Grants Pass decision, would prohibit any federal agency from criminalizing a homeless person engaging in "life-sustaining activities" on "public land."

Sounds reasonable until you read the definitions. So-called "life-sustaining activities" includes "moving, resting, sitting, standing, lying down, sleeping, protecting oneself and personal property from the elements, eating, and drinking." In other words, your local park, plazas, and even post office parking lots could become permanent residence zones for homeless drug addicts, with local authorities powerless to intervene. 

Jayapal and Frost argue that fining or arresting people who are already struggling is counterproductive. This is a classic strawman argument.  

No one is suggesting that a simple fine will solve the complex issue of homelessness. But to strip communities of the ability to maintain order and safety is a surrender, not a solution. It's an open invitation for the kind of chaos that has become commonplace in Seattle, where a permissive culture has allowed encampments to fester, becoming magnets for drug use and violent crime. 

NEWSOM UNVEILS AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO CLEAR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA: 'NO MORE EXCUSES'

The "Seattle model" for homelessness has been an abject failure. I covered it, and many other far-left proposals from blue cities, in detail in my book, "What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities."  

For years, the city has thrown money at the problem, funding a constellation of nonprofits and enacting policies that prioritize the "right" to camp in public over the rights of law-abiding citizens to enjoy their communities. The result? A humanitarian crisis on an epic scale.

Homeless encampments filled with drug-addicted criminals took over elementary school property. Downtown Seattle looked like a zombie-ridden hellscape, fentanyl addicts wasting away, bodies contorted into near-impossible pretzels as they slowly killed themselves. The most recent Point-in-Time count found over 16,000 homeless people in King County, a number that continues to climb despite hundreds of millions in spending. Why bring these policies to Topeka, Kansas, Lansing, Michigang, or Orange County, California? 

DEMS, GOP FORM RARE ALLIANCE ON YOUTH HOMELESSNESS BILL AS CRISIS IMPACTS NATION

The "Housing Not Handcuffs Act" would nationalize this failure. It would prevent federal agencies from addressing the very real public safety and health issues that arise from encampments. The bill's language is so broad that it protects not just sleeping, but also storing personal property to the "same degree as property in a private dwelling." It even grants them privacy rights over their public encampments. Imagine the implications: sprawling, unregulated encampments with the same legal protections as you in your own home.

This isn't compassion; it's a dereliction of duty. It's a slap in the face to the business owners who have to clean up human waste from their storefronts, the parents who have to explain to their children why they can't play in the park, and the countless victims of crimes committed in and around these encampments.

The proponents of this bill will tell you that the solution is more housing. And while no one disagrees that affordable housing is a piece of the puzzle, they conveniently ignore the fact that many of the chronically homeless are struggling with severe mental illness and addiction. Simply providing a roof is not enough. We need a comprehensive approach that includes treatment, personal responsibility, and, yes, the enforcement of basic laws that keep our communities safe and livable for everyone. 

The "Housing Not Handcuffs Act" is not a serious proposal to address homelessness. It's a radical, open-borders approach to our public spaces, a bill that would turn every town in America into a potential Seattle. It's time for the rest of the country to wake up and see what happens when progressive platitudes collide with reality. The result is not a utopia of "housing justice"; it's a landscape of human suffering, filth and fear. We can and must do better.

Lawyers for pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for being arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside his apartment in New York City and subsequently detained at a detention center in Louisiana. 

Khalil's lawsuit is for $20 million in damages, claiming he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted, and had his reputation tarnished due to unsubstantiated claims against him of antisemitism, among other things, the Washington Post reported. His lawsuit named the State Department, ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security. 

Khalil expressed anger over being arrested in March, citing an excessive amount of emotional pain over the events that transpired. Khalil claimed he was “effectively kidnapped” and accused President Donald Trump and other government officials of terrorizing “him and his family,” according to the Washington Post.

“I cannot describe the pain of that night,” Khalil said. “This is something I will never forgive.”

He was held in LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana, for 104 days. In June, a federal judge ordered Khalil to be released from the detention facility.

In addition to the financial restitution, Khalil said his lawsuit was predicated on his wanting to prove a point to the federal government, particularly the Trump administration. He said the administration abused its authority. Moreover, he said he wanted to show the administration could be held accountable for its actions, the Washington Post reported.

“They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,” Khalil said. “Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”

THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S EXTREME RHETORIC IS COMING HOME TO ROOST

Despite the significant amount specified in the lawsuit, Khalil said he would abandon his quest for restitution if he received an apology from the Trump administration and it decided to implement changes to its illegal immigration enforcement policies, according to the Washington Post. If no apology was offered, and he won his case, Khalil said he would split any settlement funds he received with other people who were “targeted” by the Trump administration for pro-Palestinian beliefs. 

“My beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,” said Khalil. “It's as simple as that.”

Aviation security expert Jeff Price explains the failed 2001 shoe bombing that triggered the TSA's decades-long shoe removal rule, and how advancements in screening tech led DHS to finally reverse it.

After nearly two decades of shuffling barefoot through airport security lines, American travelers can finally leave their shoes on. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this week ended one of the most visible post-9/11 security measures, a rule born following a failed act of terror in 2001, when a British national, Richard Reid, tried to ignite explosives hidden in his sneakers mid-flight. 

The attempted terror attack did not succeed, but it sparked a new era of airport screening that would see millions of passengers removing their shoes — until now.

NEARLY 20-YEAR SHOE-OFF AIRPORT SECURITY POLICY IS ENDED BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

The policy's roots trace back to Dec. 22, 2001, when Reid, later dubbed the "Shoe Bomber," boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. 

Hidden in his black high-top sneakers were plastic explosives and a makeshift detonator. Reid attempted to light a fuse with matches mid-flight but was subdued by passengers and flight crew.

The incident exposed a vulnerability in aviation security systems, particularly their inability to detect non-metallic threats like PETN, the explosive used in Reid's shoes.

TSA REVEALS THE SURPRISING REASON PEOPLE MIGHT SET OFF SECURITY ALARMS DURING SCREENING

Jeff Price, an aviation security expert and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, noted that security machinery at the time could not detect the types of explosives Reid used. 

"As far as shoe removal, the policy, I'm sure a lot of people know by now, started back in 2006, when it really dates back to 2001, when Richard Reid tried to blow up an airplane with a shoe bomb," Price said. "But it wasn't until 2006 that the policy would be implemented to remove the shoes. And that was really because the technology at the time couldn't detect the types of explosives that he used or that were in use at the time."

In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and Reid's failed bombing attempt, airport security procedures rapidly evolved, but technology lagged behind the threat. 

Price said that early metal detectors "had a hard time detecting anything at the floor level" and "could never detect explosives."

Shoe removal became the human workaround for what machines couldn't yet do.

"For a long time, the idea was: if we can't see it, we'll have people take it off," said Price, who was the former assistant security director at Denver International Airport. "So that stuck with us for a long time and technologies have changed quite a bit since then."

According to Price, the change came following the wide-scale adoption of millimeter wave imaging scanners. The machines are capable of detecting not just metal but also ceramics, plastics, liquids, and explosives, from head to toe.

"The new millimeter wave imaging machines that have been deployed to most airports do a great job of detecting explosives, liquids, ceramics, plastics and also metallic objects," Price said. "They're from head to toe. They're not without fault — no system is. Every system's got false positives, and it's going to occasionally miss things. So, there's no perfect system. The question becomes: is it perfect enough? Or is it good enough to at least deter and hopefully detect the sort of item?"

Millimeter wave technology began replacing traditional metal detectors in the late 2000s, he explained.

"The deployments of millimeter waves continued to replace magnetometers all the way up until 2023–2024," Price said. "They're still going on. I think there's been about seven to eight hundred of those deployed by now and its amazing technology."

For the millions of passengers who've grown used to juggling shoes, bins, and boarding passes, the reversal may feel like overdue relief, and it's likely to help speed things up.

"I think it will," Price said of the potential to shorten wait times. "It's almost inevitable that it will because it takes time to take off your shoes, put your shoes back on. We have to sit down to do it most of the time and depending on the kind of shoes you have, there's boots or dress shoes, those are harder to get on and off. So I think inevitably it's going to speed up those times."

Price cautioned that convenience should never outweigh caution. 

"Security is always about balance. It's about a balance between efficiency and security. We still got to keep the system moving, but we still have to provide a level of security that keeps the public as secure as possible," he said. "We'll never get to 100% security, because to do so, we'd have to quit flying!"

"But we want to get to a point where we've got a high enough level of detection and deterrence that we don't experience incidents — or, and it's kind of odd to say, we don't experience enough incidents that it really starts to affect the system."

Price suspected that DHS weighed the lack of recent incidents involving shoes as part of the decision. 

"They're finding the majority of prohibited items in people's pockets, or they're in their backpacks or laptop bags, purses or something like that," he said. "We're not finding them on people's ankles and so forth. That might have been a factor in this decision."

TSA EXPECTED TO END SHOES-OFF POLICY AT MANY AIRPORTS ACROSS US

Yet he maintained that random screening should continue to play a critical role in keeping travelers and TSA vigilant. 

"Just to keep people honest," he said.

And while some critics dismiss the original shoe rule as "security theater," Price points to the value of deterrence. 

"Anybody that is completely dedicated and wants to be successful will probably be able to do it," he said. "Just like if somebody wanted to break in your house, they're probably going to be able to do it no matter how many security measures you deploy."

"The goal though, is to make that level of deterrence so high that they don't go to your house. That they go somewhere else and try their criminal or terrorist acts. And that's really the goal of any security system is ‘not on my watch.' Out of my house."

TSA turned a corner on the mandate to remove shoes during security, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announcing on Tuesday the immediate end of the shoe-off requirement.

Noem made the announcement about the nearly 20-year policy while at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., in a press conference late Tuesday afternoon. 

"In those 20 years since that policy was put in place, our security technology has changed dramatically. It's evolved. TSA has changed," she said at the presser. "We have a multi-layered, whole-of-government approach now to security and to the environment that people anticipate and experience when they come into an airport that has been honed and it's been hardened."

She added, "We took a hard look at how TSA does its business, how it does its screening processes, and what we do to make people safe, but also provide some hospitality as well."

The announcement was made in an effort to "make screening easier for passengers, improve traveler satisfaction and will reduce wait times," according to a TSA press release.

Some passengers may still be subject to a search of their shoes "if they get put into a different situation or need additional layers of screening."

Noem said the removal of liquids, coats and belts are also being evaluated, declaring that "the Golden Age of America is here."

NEW YORK (AP) — Anthony Volpe scored the winning run with an acrobatic slide on Aaron Judge's shallow sacrifice fly in the 10th inning, and the New York Yankees rallied past Seattle 6-5 on Thursday night after Mariners pitcher Bryan Woo took a no-hitter into the eighth.

Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled leading off the eighth for New York's first hit. Woo quickly allowed another single and was lifted after Austin Wells' sacrifice fly shaved Seattle's lead to 5-1.

Pinch-hitter Giancarlo Stanton made it 5-3 with a two-run homer off Matt Brash, and the Yankees were down to their final strike multiple times before tying it on Wells' two-run single off All-Star closer Andrés Muñoz in the ninth.

It was the sixth blown save for Muñoz in 27 chances this season, and the first win for the Yankees when trailing by at least five runs in the eighth inning or later since beating Texas on June 29, 2016.

New York completed a three-game sweep in a series between American League playoff contenders and won its fourth straight following its second six-game skid since mid-June.

The Yankees were 0-35 when trailing through eight innings this season before Gabe Speier (2-1) walked Trent Grisham to load the bases for Judge with one out in the 10th.

Cole Young and Miles Mastrobuoni each hit an RBI single off New York starter Marcus Stroman. Jorge Polanco launched a three-run homer off Clayton Beeter in the seventh.




Devin Williams (3-3) pitched a perfect 10th, stranding automatic runner Cal Raleigh.

It was Stanton's first career pinch-hit homer. ... Woo threw a career-high 103 pitches in a career-best 7 1/3 innings. ... Cody Bellinger became the first Yankees player since Derek Jeter in 2012 to have two 15-game hitting streaks in one season.

Mariners: RHP Luis Castillo (5-5, 3.31 ERA) opposes Tigers ace Tarik Skubal (10-2, 2.06) in the opener of a three-game series Friday at Detroit.

Yankees: LHP Carlos Rodón (9-6, 3.30 ERA) faces RHP Chris Flexen (5-0, 0.83) and the visiting Chicago Cubs on Friday night.

CHICAGO (AP) — A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to U.S. drug trafficking charges, becoming the first of the drug lord's sons to enter a plea deal.

Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the U.S.

As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.

Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.

Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.

Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.

Guzman Lopez's sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with U.S. authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.




Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.”

“Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.

Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.”

“In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”

Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the U.S. government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.”

“This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.”

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the U.S. government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.

Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel. 

Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but had signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea. 

Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U.S. on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

NEWNAN, Ga. (AP) — A prominent Georgia Republican was running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million, federal officials alleged in a complaint filed Thursday.

The civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said First Liberty Building and Loan, controlled by Brant Frost IV, lied to investors about its business of making high-interest loans to companies. Instead, investigators said, it raised more money to repay earlier investors. 

Frost is alleged to have taken more than $19 million of investor funds for himself, his family and affiliated companies even as the business was going broke, spending $160,000 on jewelry and $335,000 with a rare coin dealer. Frost is also said to have spent $320,000 to rent a vacation home over multiple years in Kennebunkport, Maine, the town where the family of late president George H. W. Bush famously spent summers.

The SEC said Frost kept writing checks even after the commission began its investigation

First Liberty said last month that it would stop making loans and paying interest and principal to investors in those loans. The company said it was not answering phone calls or emails.

First Liberty has not responded to an email seeking comment, and no one was present at its office Thursday evening in Newnan, a suburb southwest of Atlanta. A lawyer who acts as the company's registered agent for corporate purposes said earlier that he had no information. 




The collapse rocked the religious and political networks that the business drew investors from. It also could have ramifications in state Republican politics, cutting off funding to the far-right candidates that Frost and his family have favored. Investigators said Frost spent $570,000 from investor funds on political contributions.

The SEC said the business had only $2.67 million in cash as of May 30, although regulators are also seeking to claw back money from Frost and associated companies. With 300 investors out $140 million, that means the average investor put in nearly $500,000.

First Liberty said it made loans to companies that needed cash while they waited for more conventional loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. It charged high rates of interest — 18% on some loans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. First Liberty promised investors equally high rates of return — 16% on the 18% loans.

In recent months the business advertised heavily on conservative radio shows promising “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors.”

“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” Justin C. Jeffries, associate director of enforcement for the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.

The company has represented that it is “cooperating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business.” The SEC said Frost and his companies agreed to the SEC's enforcement actions “with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.”

While the SEC says there were loans to companies, as many as 90% of those companies have defaulted. By 2021 the company was running as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint said, even as Frost withdrew increasing amounts of money.

The business is being investigated by the Georgia secretary of state for possible violations of securities law said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for the office. 

A 2023 document obtained by the AP is titled as a “promissory note,” and Sinners said anyone issuing promissory notes is supposed to be registered with Georgia securities officials. 

Sinners encouraged any victims to contact the state Securities Division.

Federal prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they are considering criminal charges. Sometimes both an SEC civil case and a federal criminal case are filed over investment frauds.

Frost has been an important player in Georgia politics since 1988, when he coordinated televangelist Pat Robertson's Republican presidential bid in the state. His son, Brant Frost V, is chairman of the Coweta County Republican Party, where the company is based, and is a former second vice-chair of the state Republican Party. Daughter Katie Frost is Republican chairman of the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Coweta County and other areas southwest of Atlanta.

At last month's state Republican convention, Katie Frost chaired a nominating committee that recommended delegates reelect state Party Chairman Josh McKoon. Delegates followed that recommendation, rejecting a number of insurgent candidates.

            Many American schoolchildren grow up learning that Yellowstone was the world's first national park. But across the globe in Mongolia, just south of the capital, Ulaanbaatar, a mountain holds a claim to the crown.
    


            Like many things in Mongolia, that mountain has a connection to Chinggis Khan (also known as Genghis Khan), who founded the Mongol empire in the 1200s and whose name and likeness are ubiquitous in present-day Mongolia.
    


            Toghrulkhan (known as Toghrul or Ong Khan), a close friend and ally of Khan's father, protected and venerated Bogd Khan Uul. According to the historical work “Secret Lives of the Mongols,” the oldest existing book in Mongolia, Toghrul barred anyone from hunting and logging, among other activities, as early as the 13th century.



            Today, entering Bogd Khan Uul, which was recognized as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1996, banishes the memory of the crowds and pollution of the capital. The Terelj River carves a path through dense patches of pine, birch and aspen trees. White butterflies swirl past in groups.
    


            As a result of the park's long-standing respected status, many native plants and animals have flourished, protected from hunting and farming. They include the rare musk deer — notable for having tusklike teeth — and the Arctic hare. Visitors should also be on the lookout for eagles, vultures, marmots and wild boars.
    


            The mountain of Bogd Khan Uul “is sacred and symbolic for all the Mongols,” says Saruul-Erdene Myagmar, an Ulaanbaatar native who is a Mongolia specialist at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.
    


            Bogd means “saint” in Mongolian, and “uul” is mountain, while Khan is a ceremonial title given to rulers. One translation of Bogd Khan Uul is “the Khan's saint's mountain.”
    


            And what about the claim that Bogd Khan Uul is older than Yellowstone?
    


            In 1778, Mongolian aristocrats wrote to the emperor of the Qing (Manchu) dynasty, which ruled the area at the time, asking for Bogd Khan Uul to be designated an official protected area. He said yes.

            Meanwhile, Yellowstone, which stretches across parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, was established in 1872. By comparison, Australia got its first national park in 1879, Canada in 1885, France in 1963 and Egypt in 1983.
    


            In the Caribbean, there's another contender.
    


            The Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve, established in 1776, also has a claim to being the world's oldest protected area.
    


            But many Mongolians ignore the 1778 date and mark the beginning of Bogd Khan Uul's “protected status” as during the 13th century, which would put the park ahead of its competitors by several centuries.
    


            Unlike Yellowstone and other famous parks, Bogd Khan Uul remains relatively unknown in the rest of the world. That has a lot to do with Mongolia's location — this cold, landlocked country wedged between China and Russia has not seen many international visitors. Much of the information about the park and its history is only available in Mongolian.
    


            However, that is changing. Mongolia is investing heavily in tourism and hopes the industry can grow to contribute 10% to its economy by 2030. About 808,000 foreign tourists visited Mongolia in 2024, the highest number in history.

            For Mongolians like Myagmar, the mountain's significance is not just about whether it really is the world's oldest national park or not.
    


            “Before Buddhism even, there's the shamanism. Very ancient belief is that all the mountains and rivers have their own owner. It's almost like a ghost,” he says. “Bogd Uul's owner is this white old man. If we offend this owner, then all sorts of bad things will happen.”
    


            The park's spiritual legacy remains. Today, Bogd Khan Uul is dotted with ovoos, which are sacred cairns made of rocks, pieces of wood and colorful scraps of fabric. At the park, it's considered bad manners, if not downright bad luck, to leave behind trash, use the bathroom outside of designated areas or interfere with an ovoo.
    


            Many travelers staying in the city center combine a visit to the national park with a stop at Zaisan Hill, home to a monument of the same name. This dramatic Brutalist memorial has colorful murals on the inside and is dedicated to Soviet and Mongolian soldiers killed during World War II.
    


            Perched on top of a hill, it's a good way to get a sense of one's bearings and a view of the city. However, this largely depends on the sky conditions that day — the air in “UB,” as locals call it, can be very hazy.
    


            From the Zaisan Monument, it's a short walk to the northern entrance of Bogd Khan Uul. There are trails that range from easy to difficult, all well marked.
    


            Travelers who make it to the top of the mountain should not miss the ruins of the Manzushir Monastery. Once a Buddhist stronghold and home to many monks, Manzushir was destroyed in 1937 by local communists who had joined forces with the Soviet occupiers of the country. Still, the ruins and remaining religious objects are well looked after by residents, especially as the current government is encouraging Mongolian pride and identity.
    


            Most foreign tourists opt for day hikes in Bogd Khan Uul, but those who want to stay the night have a few options with local companies that operate camps of gers, the traditional round Mongolian tents. These camps are rustic and have only basic amenities, but they provide a rare chance to experience the exceptional peace and quiet while stargazing and — for much of the year  — watching the snow fall.



            Although Bogd Khan Uul is only about 10 miles south of central Ulaanbaatar, the city's notoriously congested traffic means it can take up to an hour to get to the park at peak times of day.
    


            Your best bet is to go there on a weekday just after morning rush hour, giving you plenty of daylight for exploring.
    


            Public transit is limited in Ulaanbaatar — there is no subway system, so people either use buses or their own cars to get around. Taxis are generally not labeled — most people simply stand on the side of the road with their hand out and wait for one to pull up. There is an available taxi app, called UBCab app, that offers English functionality, but you'll need cash to pay if you don't have a Mongolian bank account.

            The country's air hub, Chinggis Khaan International Airport (UBN), is about an hour and a half from the park.
    


            The airport is mostly limited to short-haul flights from Asian cities like Seoul, Hong Kong and Beijing. United Airlines operates seasonal flights to Mongolia from the US, but they require a stopover in Tokyo.
    


            Beyond Bogd Khan Uul, Mongolia is home to some of the world's most diverse landscapes and has a total of 29 national parks.
    


            Among them are parts of the Gobi Desert; the UNESCO-listed Orkhon Valley, about five hours' drive from Ulaanbaatar; the Altai Mountains in far western Mongolia (home to the country's tallest peak, Tavan Bogd); and the beautiful Lake Khuvsgul, an ancient body of water near the Russian border.

President Donald Trump has announced an additional 35% tariff for Canada that will go into effect on August 1 with considerations for an adjustment if “Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.”

Trump has sent out a number of letters to several different countries announcing his tariff intentions over the last few days.

“Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a Tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,” Trump wrote in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to social media.

The president's tariffs on Canada will be some of the most impactful for U.S. consumers, as border states share energy and other things with the country. He said that if Canada offers reciprocal tariffs, he will increase the tariffs to whatever their number is on top of the 35%.

Countries who have not received a letter or who have reached a trade agreement will be charged a blanket rate, NBC News reported Thursday. 

“We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,” Trump said, according to the outlet.

Canada is the top buyer of U.S. exported goods, importing around $349 billion in 2024. They also shipped $413 billion worth of goods to America last year, the third-highest for any country to the U.S.

Trump added that there will be no tariffs if Canada decides “to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approval…in a matter of weeks.”

            A federal judge agreed Thursday to issue a new nationwide block against President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.
    


            The ruling from US District Judge Joseph Laplante is significant because the Supreme Court last month curbed the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, while keeping intact the ability of plaintiffs to seek a widespread block of the order through class action lawsuits, which is what happened Thursday in New Hampshire.
    


            Ruling from the bench, Laplante granted a request from immigration rights attorneys to certify a nationwide class that “will be comprised only of those deprived of citizenship” and issued a preliminary injunction indefinitely blocking Trump's Day One order from being enforced against any baby born after February 20.

            “The preliminary injunction is just not a close call to the court,” Laplante said during a hearing. “The deprivation of US citizenship and an abrupt change of policy that was longstanding … that's irreparable harm.”
    


            US citizenship, the judge added, “is the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”
    


            The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said he would pause his order for several days to give the Trump administration time to appeal his decision.
    


            Laplante issued a written 38-page order later Thursday as well.
    


            Laplante wrote that he “has no difficulty concluding that the rapid adoption by executive order, without legislation and the attending national debate, of a new government policy of highly questionable constitutionality that would deny citizenship to many thousands of individuals previously granted citizenship under an indisputably longstanding policy, constitutes irreparable harm, and that all class representatives could suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.”
    


            Laplante's ruling could prove to be a critical bulwark against Trump's policy as other courts scramble to take a second look at their decisions in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.
    


            The White House called the ruling “an obvious and unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's clear order against universal relief.”
    


            “This judge's decision disregards the rule of law by abusing class action certification procedures. The Trump Administration will be fighting vigorously against the attempts of these rogue district court judges to impede the policies President Trump was elected to implement,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement.
    


            In February, Laplante indefinitely blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order only against members of several nonprofit groups who would have been impacted by it.
    


            “I'm the judge who wasn't comfortable with issuing a nationwide injunction. Class action is different,” the judge said at one point during Thursday's hearing. “The Supreme Court suggested class action is a better option.”
    


            In his ruling earlier this year, Laplante said Trump's order “contradicts the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the century-old untouched precedent that interprets it.”
    


            Several other judges similarly ruled that Trump's order was unconstitutional, but their injunctions applied nationwide and prompted the administration to mount the series of appeals that eventually landed before the Supreme Court.
    


            Thursday's proceeding focused largely on the request from immigration rights attorneys who brought the legal challenge for Laplante to certify a class of individuals that would include “all current and future children” who would be affected by Trump's order and their parents. The judge's ruling Thursday did not include the parents in the class.
    


            The judge appeared sympathetic to arguments pushed by the Justice Department that certifying a class including the parents might run up against the federal rules regarding class certification if those adults each had immigration situations that were significantly different from another adult in the class.
    


            DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton had wanted Laplante to allow for discovery so more information could be gathered on the adults who are part of the legal challenge, but the judge, aware of the urgency of the litigation, noted that such court-ordered fact-finding wouldn't be feasible.
    


            “You're right, (ordinarily) we'd conduct discovery before granting class certification,” Laplante said. “There's no time for discovery.” His decision to keep the certified class somewhat narrow allows the case to proceed without that time-consuming process.
    


            “I think that the class representatives present issues … that the newborn infants do not,” he said.
    


            Class action lawsuits require “class representatives,” or individuals who, if the class is certified, will represent the class members.
    


            In this case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, those proposed representatives had included a Honduran asylum-seeker – referred to in court papers as “Barbara” and who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a baby in October – and a Brazilian man – referred to as “Mark” – who is attempting to get lawful permanent status. Mark's wife, who is not in the US lawfully, gave birth in March.
    


            “If the Order is left in place,” the ACLU lawyers wrote, “those children will face numerous obstacles to life in the United States, including stigma and potential statelessness; loss of their right to vote, serve on federal juries and in many elected offices, and work in various federal jobs; ineligibility for various federal programs; and potential arrest, detention, and deportation to countries they may have never even seen.”

            Signed by Trump on January 20, the executive order, titled “PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,” said that the federal government will not “issue documents recognizing United States citizenship” to any children born on American soil to parents who were in the country unlawfully or were in the states lawfully but temporarily.
    


            The Supreme Court said in its June 27 ruling that the administration cannot begin enforcing the order for 30 days, though the government is allowed to begin developing guidance on how the policy will be implemented.
    


            In the other challenges to Trump's order, lower courts around the country have asked the parties to submit written legal arguments addressing how the Supreme Court's ruling could impact the nationwide injunctions issued in those cases, and more court proceedings are expected in the coming days and weeks.
    


            But that process will take time and it's unclear whether any of those courts will narrow their injunctions ahead of when Trump is permitted to enforce the birthright policy.
    


            “I feel like we're the only people who rushed around here,” Laplante quipped during Thursday's hearing.
    


            ACLU attorney Cody Wofsy in a statement said the judge's decision is “a huge victory and will help protect the citizenship of all children born in the United States, as the Constitution intended.”
    


            Laplante's decision aligns with the Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling last month, which left class-action litigation on the table as a way to block Trump's birthright citizenship order – and potentially other policies.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision was focused on one type of court order – a nationwide injunction – but several of the justices were keen to note that plaintiffs suing an administration would have other avenues to shut down policies that might run afoul of the Constitution or federal law. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested the kind of class-action litigation immigrant rights groups are now pursuing have many advantages.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who is often closer to the center of the court in high-profile cases, seemed especially open to having the Supreme Court review, on an emergency basis, exactly the kind of order Laplante issued.
    


            “Today's decision on district court injunctions will not affect this court's vitally important responsibility to resolve applications for stays or injunctions with respect to major new federal statutes and executive actions,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Deciding those applications is not a distraction from our job. It is a critical part of our job.”

            Perhaps, Kavanaugh mused, a district court might issue “the functional equivalent of a universal injunction” by “granting or denying a preliminary injunction” in a class-action suit.
    


            “No matter how the preliminary-injunction litigation on those kinds of significant matters transpires in the district courts, the courts of appeals in turn will undoubtedly be called upon to promptly grant or deny temporary stays or temporary injunctions in many cases,” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            But Laplante's ruling is nevertheless almost certain to force the justices to deal with a split that emerged over the particulars of those cases. And the court's majority opinion left that split unsettled.
    


            Several conservatives, including Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, warned against courts using class-action litigation to essentially supplant the kind of nationwide injunction the court had just shot down.
    


            “Lax enforcement of the requirements” for certifying a class, Alito wrote in an opinion joined by Thomas, “would create a potentially significant loophole to today's decision.”
    


            Federal courts, he added, “should thus be vigilant against such potential abuses of these tools.”
    


            Whether Laplante's decision is an “abuse” or exactly what the Supreme Court had in mind will likely wind up back before the justices in short order.

A Brightline train in Miami.

Brightline Trains Florida, the Fortress Investment Group-backed passenger railroad, plans to defer a July 15 interest payment on its 10% and 12% unrated tax-exempt bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Brightline notified holders of the delay through the Depository Trust Company, said the people who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak publicly. The incident is not considered an event of default, according to bond documents. A default only occurs if the railroad misses three consecutive interest payments, the documents state.

This is it, folks. Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out.

After all, having something in your basket doesn't mean it's reserved for you until the end of the day. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today.

We've compared prices across thousands of deals this week, and below, you'll find highlights of some of our favorite picks from our collection of reviews and buying guides. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts.

I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Past sales have seen them dip to $160, but you're generally looking at $180-$200 for a standard discount during more low-key sales.

The audio quality and noise-cancelling both received massive upgrades over the first-gen Pros. If you have the original Pro 2s with the Lightning cable, the only difference besides the charging port is added dust resistance, so I'd hold off for the next-gen Pros rather than pick these up. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though.

Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro.

This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus.

Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers.

OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. Hopefully, they're a bit more on it than Apple's utterly botched Siri Apple Intelligence rollout.

So why the Echo Pop? It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's a nice size for a nightstand or a little music speaker on your desk. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below.

The entire Echo line is on sale for Prime Day until Friday, including the ones with a display at Amazon.

This is a neat (and cheap!) device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers).

Typical uses include activating lamps or electric fans. Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills.

If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp.

Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. I have both, and I swap between them regularly, so there's no bad option here.

I use the Paperwhite the most because the larger screen means fewer page turns. I also like the flush screen design, which prevents dust or hair from tucking into the bezel, which is a tiny issue with the cheaper model.

The Paperwhite has a few premium touches that make it worth the price, especially when it's on sale like this. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. The adjustable warm-light feature makes the screen easier on the eyes and can be tweaked to a soft golden glow, which is very pleasing on the eye as it looks like an old paperback.

As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus.

If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line.

Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen.

I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag.

This version comes with the Premium Pen (which costs extra on the last-gen model), an eraser button on the top, and a programmable shortcut key.

If you have the original Scribe, I'd skip this one, as the design has not changed significantly, and both have the same software upgrades. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. That said, I can barely read my own handwriting, so I can cut it some slack here.

Philips Hue is the most recognizable brand in the smart lighting game, and the vast range of colors available via the app on these super-long-lasting bulbs makes them my top pick whenever anyone asks me about them.

They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. These are certainly items I'd say are vulnerable to price hikes if the tariffs hit.

Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit.

They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200.

Oura is the biggest name in smart rings and is our go-to pick, even over Samsung's Galaxy Ring. If you're looking for a subtle health tracker that looks pretty cool as well, you can't go wrong here. Multiple sizes and colors are on sale today.

The Oura can track various fitness and wellness metrics, including sleep, heart rate, steps, and other activities. Many find wearing a smartwatch all the time, especially when sleeping, is a bit much. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too.

Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more.

I've been drawing as a hobby since I was young, but digital art was always one of my weak points — until I picked up an Apple Pencil. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. Even when not drawing, the accessory makes note-taking and photo editing so much easier and precise. — Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today.

You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past.

I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100.

I've been very happy with it so far. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. It's a little heavy in handheld mode, but I feel I've got a real bargain compared to the amount of money you'd spend on a brand like Dyson.

That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. If you're in a small carpet-free apartment, though, I think you're better off with the Tikom. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. 

Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home.

Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. You can program different pre-set heights for sitting and standing for more than one user. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see.

Govee's outdoor lights have been a huge hit. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights.

As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area.

I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Plus, you can add more attachments, like a pasta maker, if you want.

Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. With the help of the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, which is also 25% off for Prime Day, I can use it to make all the coffee and espresso drinks I love, hot or iced. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate.

This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen.

No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. While it can't filter large quantities of water for a group, it's a must-have for solo adventurers.

It sees sales somewhat regularly throughout the year, but right now, it's down to its all-time lowest price of $10. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water.

If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side.

The pillow's medium firmness offers the perfect amount of pressure relief around the neck and shoulders for back and side sleepers, helping you maintain spine alignment throughout the night. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good.

I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all.

Though it's pretty common to find it on sale during most deal events, it's not until something like Prime Day that it drops to its lowest price. Seriously, if you're at all on the fence, let me join the chorus of recommendations for this pillow. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type.

Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals.

If you're the type of person who likes to style your hair with a sleek, straight blowout one day and voluminous waves the next, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer is the only tool you'll ever need. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage.

At 60% off, the One-Step 2.0 is one of the best Prime Day deals over 50% off we've seen this year. You're unlikely to find it at a better price, at least until Black Friday. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling.

The no-frills Original Wet Brush is genuinely one of the hero products of my lifetime. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I picked this up on a whim at least a decade ago, and I've never been without one ever since.

I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. At just $6, it's a steal.

Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm excels at both, which is why it's the best lip balm we've ever tested.

Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can.

Any dermatologist will tell you to keep your hands off any breakouts, but if you're guilty of pimple popping, these acne patches might just save you. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit.

The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. For Prime Day, grab a 72-pack for $24.

As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Clinique Black Honey has been a cult favorite for decades, and for good reason. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying.

The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. Plus, it's buildable, so you can take it from day to night with just a few swipes. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it.

For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year.

Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. Rather than a typical gloss tube, it's a buttery balm that glides on smoothly and even nourishes your skin.

My eyelids get oily throughout the day, and due to my almond eye shape, I have a lot of creasing around my outer corners. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine.

I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

This stylish and comfy sweatsuit is a near-perfect dupe of the Spanx Air Essentials set for a fraction of the price, earning it a top spot in our best sweatsuits guide. The stretchy and silky fabric feels extremely high-quality for the price, which we were impressed with in our full review.

The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks.

A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end.

We love the Ultraboost Light's fit. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. At 55% off, you'll be hard-pressed to find this pair at a better price.

[Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick

My Rothy's flats have been a staple in my closet ever since I got them. They're incredibly lightweight and made with sustainable materials. Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day.

The Square Mary Jane, one of our favorite Mary Janes, is the best Rothy's deal we've seen for Prime Day. All four colors are $60 off, so grab a pair or a couple.

One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested.

The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. It would make a great companion on any trip or a day at the office.

These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures.

These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price.

Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. However, some offers are one-day 'daily deals', while others will only last as long as the stock does.

Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours.

No, but most are. Some items are just on a general discount, and we've spotted quite a few like that this year.

The majority are locked behind Prime membership. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over.

Very difficult to say. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday.

Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise.

This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later.

The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' delivers a temporary higher limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. But the phaseout, or income-based benefit reduction, could trigger a tax surprise for some higher earners, experts say.

If you itemize tax breaks, you can claim the SALT deduction, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. Trump's legislation raises the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 starting in 2025, with a 1% yearly increase through 2029, before reverting to $10,000 in 2030. 

However, the $40,000 SALT cap starts to phase out once modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, exceeds $500,000. The SALT limit drops to $10,000 once MAGI reaches $600,000. MAGI is adjusted gross income with some tax breaks added back in. 

This phaseout can create a "SALT torpedo" — an artificially high tax rate — when MAGI falls between $500,000 and $600,000, certified public accountant Jeff Levine said in a LinkedIn post this week.

In some cases, you could pay a 45.5% federal tax rate on earnings between those thresholds, experts say.

Here's how the "SALT torpedo" works and who could be impacted, according to tax experts.

Under Trump's legislation, the SALT deduction limit for 2025 is now $30,000 higher. But a 30% phaseout kicks in once MAGI exceeds $500,000 for 2025.

Between $500,000 and $600,000, "you're losing 30% for every dollar" of benefit between those thresholds, said certified financial planner Jim Guarino, managing director at Baker Newman Noyes in Woburn, Massachusetts. He is also a CPA.

At $600,000, if you multiply the extra $100,000 of income by 30%, that's a $30,000 benefit reduction, which drops the $40,000 SALT cap back to $10,000.

With the 30% SALT deduction phaseout between $500,000 and $600,000 of MAGI, some individuals could pay a higher-than-expected tax on earnings between those thresholds, according to Robert Keebler, a CPA with tax advisory firm Keebler & Associates in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Between $500,000 and $600,000, you're increasing taxable income while losing part of the SALT deduction, which raises your effective tax rate — the percent of taxable income you pay.

If taxable income rises while the SALT deduction falls, your effective tax rate on income between $500,000 and $600,000 could far exceed your regular income tax rate, Keebler said in a LinkedIn post last week.

"It's definitely a quirky little phaseout provision," Andy Whitehair, a CPA and a director with Baker Tilly's Washington tax council practice, told CNBC. "When people start actually crunching numbers, they might be in for some surprises."

Whitehair also shared a basic example of the phaseout on LinkedIn this week.

If your income is $500,000 and you subtract $75,000 of itemized deductions (including $40,000 for SALT), your taxable income is $425,000.

By contrast, $600,000 of income would drop the SALT deduction to $10,000, which reduces itemized deductions to $45,000, and raises taxable income to $555,000.

When comparing taxable income for each example, the true difference is $130,000 with the $30,000 lost SALT deduction. If you multiply that by the 35% tax bracket, you get $45,500.

In this simplified example, there is $45,500 more federal tax owed by earning $100,000 more, which is 45.5%, Whitehair said.

If your 2025 earnings could be near $500,000, you should run projections with a tax advisor and weigh strategies to reduce MAGI, experts say.

With the steep tax penalty between $500,000 and $600,000, you may reconsider Roth individual retirement conversions, incurring large capital gains or other moves that could boost your income, according to Keebler.

On the last day of Prime Day, you have until tonight to score one of the best air purifier deals. If you're sensitive to pollen, pet dander, or smoke, an air purifier can help filter the air in your home — giving you relief from allergy flare-ups. Thankfully, some of our top picks for the best air purifiers are deeply discounted right now.

One of our favorite brands is Coway, and its Airmega Mighty Air Purifier, our favorite air purifier we tested, is down to its lowest price of the year at $155. Top brands like Shark are also discounted during Prime Day. The Shark NeverChange Air Purifier Max is 29% off, the lowest price we've seen for it since February.

Although some of the models below didn't earn top spots in our tests, we've included them because their prices are down to lows we've not seen in as much as a year, and we've tested and trusted the brands. For other air quality deals, check out our round-up of the best Prime Day air conditioner and dehumidifier deals. You can also save on everything from TVs and headphones to clothing and beauty products we're curating in our Prime Day deals hub.


                          If you're on a budget and want to clean the air in a smaller room, the Lasko LP300 HEPA Tower Air Purifier is your best bet with its good purifying capabilities and low upfront and filter costs.
                        


                      The Lasko LP450 is a more powerful version of our pick for the best budget air purifier, the LP300. It's designed to clean the air in rooms up to 250 square feet. Right now, you can save an extra $20 off an already low price.
                    


                      With the prevalence of wildfires, there's been more concern than ever about the health effects of bad air quality. Turn your home into a respite from the outdoor air with this medical-grade HEPA purifier.
                    


                      From one of our favorite air purifier brands, the Levoit Core 300 is a solid investment for keeping your air clean without breaking the bank.
                    


                      Blueair is one of the top names in air purifiers, and the Blue Pure 511 offers HEPA filtration at a budget price.
                    


                      This AROEVE air purifier is designed for large rooms, and removes dust, smoke, pet dander, and more from the air.
                    


                          If you need a powerful, energy-efficient air purifier for medium to large rooms, the Airmega AP-1521HH Mighty is your best option. It includes three filters and ionization, and the fan speed adjusts based on the air quality.
                        


                          The Levoit 300S Air Purifier does an outstanding job removing VOCs from small rooms and features a user-friendly app.
                        


                      Winix's large room True-HEPA air purifier (up to 1,700 square feet) has a washable carbon filter that not only purifies air but helps remove odors from smoke, cooking odors, and other household smells. 
                    


                      The Dreo Air Purifier Tower Fan is a 2-in-1 design that quietly cools and purifies. It pairs with an app to provide historical air quality and temperature data. 
                    


                      Another great option we tested from Coway. The 250 was one of the best removers of particulate matter. It also used minimal electricity, thanks to the fan that adjusts based on the air quality. However, it didn't perform well at removing VOCs from the air.
                    


                      The Coway Airmega 400 Smart Air Purifier is an attractive air purifier that barely makes any sound and adjusts the fan speed based on the air's pollution level.
                    


                      We tested a larger, pricier version of the Shark NeverChange Air Purifier Max and were impressed with its purifying performance in our tests. This model is virtually identical but designed for medium-sized rooms.
                    

Yes. Even the lowest performing air purifiers improved indoor air quality when we tested extensively for our best air purifiers guide.

HEPA stands for "high-efficiency particulate air." HEPA filters are the gold standard for air purifiers. According to the EPA, a HEPA filter can remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micron airborne particles, which include pollen, bacteria, mold, and dust. We primarily only recommend air purifiers with true HEPA filters.

Yes. An air purifier can help during a smoke emergency. Experts recommend running an air purifier with a HEPA filter, like one of our top picks from Coway or Lasko. One of the best air conditioners with a good HVAC filter can also supply some relief.

Delta Air Lines had to send a plane to rescue passengers after their flight diverted to a small island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

Flight 127 departed Madrid around 1 p.m. local time on Sunday and was supposed to land in New York seven hours later.

However, data from Flightradar24 shows how four hours into the journey, the Airbus A330 turned around over the ocean.

Roughly an hour later, it landed at Lajes Airport on the Portuguese island of Terceira. It's part of the Azores, a remote archipelago that's nearly 1,000 miles away from the country's mainland.

The airport shares its runway with a military base, and only serves about a dozen destinations commercially.

Marc Viscardi, a passenger on the flight, told Business Insider he was "very thankful to be home after our very scary ordeal."

He also said that after the unplanned landing, a cabin crew member said "Welcome to the Azores," which he criticized as "tone deaf."

"As safety comes before all else at Delta, the flight crew followed procedures to divert to Lajes, Azores, after indication of a mechanical issue with an engine," said an airline spokesperson.

Losing an engine's functionality can be frightening, although pilots are well trained in such situations.

The 21-year-old A330, registered as N805NW, is still parked at the airport as of Friday.

To get the passengers back on their way, Delta had to send another plane from New York.

About five hours after Flight 127 landed in the Azores, flight-tracking data shows another A330 left JFK Airport.

Viscardi told BI he was unhappy with Delta's communication, only learning about the rescue flight via text message hours after landing in the Azores.

He added that text alerts were "incomplete, vague, and often contradictory."

The second plane arrived at Lajes shortly after 2 a.m. local time, before leaving around 9 p.m. on Monday.

Flight 9927 then landed in New York at 10:22 p.m. ET — roughly 31 hours after passengers expected to touch down on US soil.

"We sincerely apologize to our customers for their experience and delay in their travels," the Delta spokesperson said.

They added that customers and crew were accommodated overnight in area hotels and provided meals. The flight had 282 passengers and 13 crew members.

This isn't the first time a Delta plane has been forced to divert to Lajes Airport. In 2023, a flight from Ghana landed there due to a "mechanical issue with a backup oxygen system."

In that incident, passengers spent 12 hours on the island and some complained about a lack of communication from Delta before another plane arrived to take them on to New York.

Airlines typically try to divert flights back to their origins or hub airports when possible, because this makes it easier to reroute passengers and repair any problems with the aircraft. However, in cases like these, concerns about safety can require landing at the closest available airport.

In a similar case last year, Air France had to cancel a flight so the plane could be used to rescue passengers who were diverted to a remote town in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unloaded roughly $36.4 million worth of stock in the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The sale, which totals 225,000 shares, comes as part of Huang's previously adopted plan in March to unload up to six million shares of Nvidia through the end of the year. He sold his first batch of stock from the agreement in June, equaling about $15 million.

Last year, the tech executive sold about $700 million worth of shares as part of a prearranged plan. Nvidia stock climbed about 1% Friday.

Huang's net worth has skyrocketed as investors bet on Nvidia's AI dominance and graphics processing units powering large language models.

The 62-year-old's wealth has grown by more than a quarter, or about $29 billion, since the start of 2025 alone, based on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. His net worth last stood at $143 billion in the index, putting him neck-and-neck with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett at $144 billion.

Shortly after the market opened Friday, Fortune's analysis of net worth had Huang ahead of Buffett, with the Nvidia CEO at $143.7 billion and the Oracle of Omaha at $142.1 billion.

The company has also achieved its own notable milestones this year, as it prospers off the AI boom.

On Wednesday, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker became the first company to top a $4 trillion market capitalization, beating out both Microsoft and Apple. The chipmaker closed above that milestone Thursday as CNBC reported that the technology titan met with President Donald Trump.

Brooke Seawell, venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, sold about $24 million worth of Nvidia shares, according to an SEC filing. Seawell has been on the company's board since 1997, according to the company.

Huang still holds more than 858 million shares of Nvidia, both directly and indirectly, in different partnerships and trusts.

This is it, folks. Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out.

After all, having something in your basket doesn't mean it's reserved for you until the end of the day. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today.

We've compared prices across thousands of deals this week, and below, you'll find highlights of some of our favorite picks from our collection of reviews and buying guides. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts. 

I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Past sales have seen them dip to $160, but you're generally looking at $180-$200 for a standard discount during more low-key sales.

The audio quality and noise-cancelling both received massive upgrades over the first-gen Pros. If you have the original Pro 2s with the Lightning cable, the only difference besides the charging port is added dust resistance, so I'd hold off for the next-gen Pros rather than pick these up. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though.

Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro.

This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus.

Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers.

OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. Hopefully, they're a bit more on it than Apple's utterly botched Siri Apple Intelligence rollout.

So why the Echo Pop? It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's a nice size for a nightstand or a little music speaker on your desk. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below.

The entire Echo line is on sale for Prime Day until Friday, including the ones with a display at Amazon.

This is a neat (and cheap!) device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers).

Typical uses include activating lamps or electric fans. Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills.

If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp.

Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. I have both, and I swap between them regularly, so there's no bad option here.

I use the Paperwhite the most because the larger screen means fewer page turns. I also like the flush screen design, which prevents dust or hair from tucking into the bezel, which is a tiny issue with the cheaper model.

The Paperwhite has a few premium touches that make it worth the price, especially when it's on sale like this. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. The adjustable warm-light feature makes the screen easier on the eyes and can be tweaked to a soft golden glow, which is very pleasing on the eye as it looks like an old paperback.

As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus.

If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line.

Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen.

I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag.

This version comes with the Premium Pen (which costs extra on the last-gen model), an eraser button on the top, and a programmable shortcut key.

If you have the original Scribe, I'd skip this one, as the design has not changed significantly, and both have the same software upgrades. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. That said, I can barely read my own handwriting, so I can cut it some slack here.

Philips Hue is the most recognizable brand in the smart lighting game, and the vast range of colors available via the app on these super-long-lasting bulbs makes them my top pick whenever anyone asks me about them.

They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. These are certainly items I'd say are vulnerable to price hikes if the tariffs hit.

Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit.

They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200.

Oura is the biggest name in smart rings and is our go-to pick, even over Samsung's Galaxy Ring. If you're looking for a subtle health tracker that looks pretty cool as well, you can't go wrong here. Multiple sizes and colors are on sale today.

The Oura can track various fitness and wellness metrics, including sleep, heart rate, steps, and other activities. Many find wearing a smartwatch all the time, especially when sleeping, is a bit much. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too.

Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more.

I've been drawing as a hobby since I was young, but digital art was always one of my weak points — until I picked up an Apple Pencil. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. Even when not drawing, the accessory makes note-taking and photo editing so much easier and precise. — Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today.

You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past. 

I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100.

I've been very happy with it so far. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. It's a little heavy in handheld mode, but I feel I've got a real bargain compared to the amount of money you'd spend on a brand like Dyson.

That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. If you're in a small carpet-free apartment, though, I think you're better off with the Tikom. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. 

Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home.

Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. You can program different pre-set heights for sitting and standing for more than one user. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see.

Govee's outdoor lights have been a huge hit. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights. 

As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area.

I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Plus, you can add more attachments, like a pasta maker, if you want.

Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. With the help of the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, which is also 25% off for Prime Day, I can use it to make all the coffee and espresso drinks I love, hot or iced. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate.

This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen.

No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. While it can't filter large quantities of water for a group, it's a must-have for solo adventurers.

It sees sales somewhat regularly throughout the year, but right now, it's down to its all-time lowest price of $10. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water.

If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side.

The pillow's medium firmness offers the perfect amount of pressure relief around the neck and shoulders for back and side sleepers, helping you maintain spine alignment throughout the night. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good.

I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all.

Though it's pretty common to find it on sale during most deal events, it's not until something like Prime Day that it drops to its lowest price. Seriously, if you're at all on the fence, let me join the chorus of recommendations for this pillow. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type.

Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals.

If you're the type of person who likes to style your hair with a sleek, straight blowout one day and voluminous waves the next, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer is the only tool you'll ever need. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage.

At 60% off, the One-Step 2.0 is one of the best Prime Day deals over 50% off we've seen this year. You're unlikely to find it at a better price, at least until Black Friday. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling.

The no-frills Original Wet Brush is genuinely one of the hero products of my lifetime. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I picked this up on a whim at least a decade ago, and I've never been without one ever since.

I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. At just $6, it's a steal.

Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm excels at both, which is why it's the best lip balm we've ever tested.

Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can.

Any dermatologist will tell you to keep your hands off any breakouts, but if you're guilty of pimple popping, these acne patches might just save you. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit.

The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. For Prime Day, grab a 72-pack for $24.

As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Clinique Black Honey has been a cult favorite for decades, and for good reason. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying.

The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. Plus, it's buildable, so you can take it from day to night with just a few swipes. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it.

For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year.

Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. Rather than a typical gloss tube, it's a buttery balm that glides on smoothly and even nourishes your skin.

My eyelids get oily throughout the day, and due to my almond eye shape, I have a lot of creasing around my outer corners. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine.

I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

This stylish and comfy sweatsuit is a near-perfect dupe of the Spanx Air Essentials set for a fraction of the price, earning it a top spot in our best sweatsuits guide. The stretchy and silky fabric feels extremely high-quality for the price, which we were impressed with in our full review.

The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks.

A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end.

We love the Ultraboost Light's fit. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. At 55% off, you'll be hard-pressed to find this pair at a better price.

[Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick

My Rothy's flats have been a staple in my closet ever since I got them. They're incredibly lightweight and made with sustainable materials. Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day.

The Square Mary Jane, one of our favorite Mary Janes, is the best Rothy's deal we've seen for Prime Day. All four colors are $60 off, so grab a pair or a couple.

One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested.

The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. It would make a great companion on any trip or a day at the office.

These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures.

These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price.

Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. However, some offers are one-day 'daily deals', while others will only last as long as the stock does.

Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours.

No, but most are. Some items are just on a general discount, and we've spotted quite a few like that this year.

The majority are locked behind Prime membership. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over.

Very difficult to say. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday.

Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise.

This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later.

The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

A laptop is an important investment, especially if you're looking for a powerful gaming rig or a reliable system for work. Top models are often expensive, but there's still time to grab an excellent discount for Prime Day. Amazon's big sale has entered its final day, but we're still seeing great savings. The best Prime Day laptop deals include low prices on entry-level and midrange systems perfect for school and high-end models geared toward hardcore gamers.

If you just want a cheap laptop for everyday browsing, check out the Asus Vivobook Go, which is only $220 for Prime Day. This model is about as basic as laptops get, but it's fine for casual use and standard productivity. Meanwhile, gamers who want a solid system on a budget should check out this Acer Nitro V laptop with an RTX 4050 graphics card, which is 19% off for Prime Day. Apple fans can also save on select MacBooks, including $150 off the latest 13-inch MacBook Air.

Keep scrolling to find all of the best Amazon Prime Day laptop deals so far. These discounts are set to expire at midnight, so don't hesitate to grab a deal before they're gone. And you can browse more of the event's best discounts in our complete Amazon Prime Day deals hub.


                      This Vivobook Go by Asus with a 15.6-inch FHD display is excellent value for a basic laptop for casual workloads.
                    


                      This is a solid budget laptop for work and school. It has a touchscreen display and an entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 processor. That said, this isn't a good fit for power users who like to multitask with lots of apps open at once. 
                    


                      This affordable Dell laptop uses an older Intel processor, so it's not meant for power users or people looking for a cutting-edge model with new AI features. However, it's still solid for everyday computing, especially when it's on sale.  
                    


                      The Acer Inspire Go is a solid option for users on a budget. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price.
                    


                      Acer's Nitro 5 is a budget-friendly gaming laptop. This entry-level model features an older but still solid Intel Core i5 chip along with an RTX 4050 graphics card. The 15.6-inch screen has a 144Hz refresh rate, which is decent but not as high as pricier options. 
                    


                      LG's Gram laptops are ultra-lightweight and portable. This model isn't meant for gaming but comes with super solid midrange power for general use. 
                    


                      This 17.3-inch laptop from HP is built for people who want a general-use laptop with a bigger screen. This model's Intel Core i3 processor is entry-level, but it has a large 1TB SSD and a touchscreen.
                    


                      It's expensive, but this high-end gaming laptop has top-tier hardware, including an Intel Core Ultra 9, a powerful GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, and a big 18-inch screen.
                    


                      This midrange gaming laptop has an Intel Core i7 CPU and a GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, along with a 16-inch display that supports up to a 165Hz refresh rate.
                    


                      The newest MacBook Air is powered by an M4 chip for ultimate speed and efficiency. The 13-inch, 16 GB laptop comes in traditional silver and three other sky-inspired colors.
                    


                      The M4 MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, compared to the 8GB standard in previous generations, which is more appropriate for demanding workloads. Anyone running on older M1 or Intel MacBook Pros will experience notable performance gains with the M4 model.
                    


                      This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16 GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage.
                    

One of the biggest differences is that gaming laptops have more powerful graphics cards (GPUs), components that let them play modern games with realistic visuals. They also tend to have stronger processors (CPUs), meaning programs and files open faster and are better for multitasking. These laptops are great for users who want to play games, edit 4K videos, and quickly switch between dozens of apps.

More typical laptops can have a range of CPUs, from basic to advanced, to power productivity apps like a web browser or the Microsoft Office suite. They usually have integrated graphics rather than powerful GPUs but offer significantly better battery life, as well as lighter and more portable designs.

Design-wise, the best gaming laptops tend to be bigger and heavier, and battery life isn't great. But they're often outfitted with customizable lights that give the keyboard and chassis a sleek neon glow.

When it comes to price, the most powerful gaming laptops are far more expensive than any other kind of laptop. But it's not hard to find more affordable options, and many budget gaming laptops can still play all your favorite games, albeit with some performance caveats.

Windows laptops range wildly in price, starting in the low hundreds and going up into the thousands. But in general, you should expect to pay $300 to $700 for a decent budget laptop, around $1,000 to $1,300 for a midrange model, and upward of $1,600 for a really powerful option.

European stock markets have given up some of their recent gains by tumbling on the last trading day of the week, while waiting on an expected EU tariff letter from White House.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 1.1%. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were both lower by around 0.9%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 lost 0.4% of its value.

Some of the positive stock market moves this week came in the wake of the release of the Federal Reserve's June meeting minutes, which showed willingness by a majority of policymakers to cut interest rates this year. 

But according to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, there remains a greater risk that interest rates will instead need to be hiked again than most people believe.

"The market is pricing a 20% chance [of a rate hike], I would price in a 40-50% chance. I would put that as a cause for concern," Dimon told an event at Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, arguing that there is a significant possibility of inflation becoming problematic again for the U.S.

Market optimism that drove record highs for U.K. and Wall Street stocks on Thursday showed signs of fading, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index down nearly 1% at midday in London, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures falling 0.7%.

Gains this week have come despite a slew of tariff announcements that might previously have shaken markets, including 25% duties on trading partners including Japan, a 50% rate on Brazil, and a higher-than-expected 50% rate on all copper imports.

News overnight of the U.S. slapping 35% tariffs on Canada, along with the lack of updates on an EU-U.S. framework agreement — with a letter expected to be delivered to the EU from the White House on Friday — appear to have turned the tide.

"Whether this is investors being reminded of headwinds or simply pausing for breath, it's clear that uncertainty will prevail well into the summer," Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said in a note.

Coatsworth added that next week's focus is set to shift to earnings — kicked off by the U.S. big banks — providing a key insight into how companies are grappling with global uncertainty.

China's demand for petrol and diesel is falling as electric vehicle sales surge, but the trend is being masked by the country's massive strategic stockpiling of crude oil, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.

The agency noted that Chinese demand for transport fuels has declined for three consecutive months. This coincides with a 50% year-on-year jump in EV sales in the first half of 2025, which is directly "eating into end-user demand," Toril Bosoni, head of oil industry and markets division at the IEA, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.

Despite this, China's crude inventories swelled by 80 million barrels in the second quarter, absorbing a global supply glut, according to the agency. 

"Chinese companies taking a more strategic role and boosting reserves for energy security reasons," Bosoni added.

Shares of Britain's BP rose 2% in mid-morning deals following the oil giant's trading update.

Analysts at Citi and JPMorgan both welcomed the trading statement, with the latter saying the announcement screens at the stronger end, when compared to an "indifferent" set of peer updates to date.

"Finally some encouraging news from BP, with a 2Q25 outlook statement that should reverse the swath of negative revisions that consensus has made in recent weeks," Citi analyst Alastair Syme said in a research note.

"We make minor adjustments to our estimates, last published back in May, but still sit c.15-20% above where consensus has moved to in recent weeks," Syme said.

In corporate news this morning, Italian luxury clothes maker Cucinelli posted a 10.7% increase in first half revenues, broadly in line with forecasts. Sales rose double digits in America and Asia, while the group confirmed its expectations for annual sales growth of about 10% this year and next. 

Shares were around 0.1% lower in early deals.

The U.K. meanwhile said it will pump 163 million euros ($190.5 million) into satellite operator Eutelsat, an aspiring rival to Elon Musk's Starlink. European governments view Eutelsat as a way to increase sovereign space capabilities and reduce European reliance on U.S. firms for satellite communications and defence. 

The investment will allow the U.K. to maintain its stake when France makes a planned 750 million euro cash injection later this year, and brings the total recapitalisation 1.5 billion euros.

Sterling is trading lower after the U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank in May. The British pound was 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar at $1.35 and 0.1% lower against the euro at 8:47 a.m. in London.

Some economists say the weak growth figures mean the Bank of England is now more likely to cut interest rates in August. Capital Economics' Chief U.K. Economist Paul Dales forecast that U.K. GDP would rise by a "fairly subdued" 1% this year "due to the lingering drags from a weakening global economy and the rises in domestic taxes for UK businesses."

Sentiment has clearly soured in Europe after four days of solid gains, with all Stoxx 600 sectors except oil and gas and insurance opening in the red on Friday. The regional index was 0.46% lower at 8:10 a.m. in London.

News of 35% U.S. tariffs set to be slapped on Canada from the start of August, along with the White House's 50% duty on all copper imports, may have reignited some concerns around global growth. 

Investors had largely brushed off a slew of tariff announcements this week, sending the U.K.'s FTSE 100 as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs.

The big question now is what rate the European Union is facing, after weeks of negotiations over a framework trade deal. President Donald Trump indicated last night that the EU would receive a letter setting out its tariffs today.

British oil major BP on Friday flagged lower oil and gas sales in the second quarter and an after-tax impairment of up to $1.5 billion across its portfolio.

In a trading update released ahead of full second-quarter results on Aug. 5, the energy company said its gas and low-carbon sales will hit earnings by between $100 million and $300 million over the April-June stretch, also noting "average" results from the company's gas trading arm.

Lower oil sales will meanwhile deliver a blow of between $600 million to $800 million over the period.

The firm said second-quarter results will also see "post-tax adjusting items relating to asset impairments in the range of $0.5 to 1.5 billion, attributable across the segments."

In the oil products segment, BP said stronger realized refining margins would be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, and that "oil trading result is expected to be strong."

The company also said its second-quarter upstream production is now expected to be higher than in the previous three-month period. 

BP has been struggling to recalibrate its strategic direction amid underperformance in its share price compared with oil and gas peers, particularly in the U.S. Speculation has been mounting in recent months over whether the company could become an acquisition target.

The U.K. shrank 0.1% in May, a second monthly contraction, according to figures just out from the Office for National Statistics. 

That's below the 0.1% expansion forecast by economists polled by Reuters, and will do little to shake off expectations for U.K. growth to be muted in the second half of the year.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index notched a fourth daily gain on Thursday, but IG futures are pointing to a broadly negative open for major bourses on Friday.

The big news overnight is that U.S. President Donald Trump will lift tariffs on imports from Canada to 35% from Aug. 1, and warned that the duty might be increased if Ottawa retaliates. The rate is separate from sectoral tariffs placed on steel, aluminum and autos, and shortly copper.

Investors are also standing by in anticipation of the release of a letter from Trump in which he is expected to outline tariffs the European Union will face, after he told NBC News that he would be issuing tariffs "over the next couple of hours" to both the EU and Canada.

Trump's Tariffs:

Delta airlines Airbus planes at LaGuardia airport in New York.

Delta Air Lines Inc. has been cannibalizing new Airbus SE jets in Europe by stripping off their engines and using them to get grounded planes in the US back into service, as it seeks to overcome a shortage and avoid aircraft import tariffs.

The airline has been taking US-made Pratt & Whitney engines off new European-built A321neos and shipping them back to the States without any duties, according to people familiar with the matter. The engine-less aircraft, meanwhile, remain in Europe.

More than a year before "F1: The Movie" would eventually hit theaters, Apple struck a deal with IMAX.

The studio secured the use of IMAX's camera technology as well as a three-week release in its theaters, a partnership that helped the film generate nearly $300 million globally in its first 10 days in cinemas.

More than 20% of that haul came from IMAX screenings. In the U.S. and Canada, the company's theaters have accounted for 25% of all domestic ticket sales for the film. That feat is made even more impressive by the fact that IMAX screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.

Two other films released this year have exceeded 20% market share for the company — Warner Bros.' "Sinners" and Paramount's "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning."

It's a sign of strength for IMAX's place in the rapidly evolving film industry.

IMAX has long been a coveted destination for theatrical releases, but as consumer tastes continue to shift toward premium experiences, it's quickly gaining market share and poised for exponential growth in the coming years.

CEO Rich Gelfond is forecasting a $1.2 billion year at the global box for the company, which would be 33% higher than 2024's haul and a record for the 55-year-old business. Wall Street analysts expect 2026 will be even better.

"Post-pandemic a lot of activities, especially event activities, have really done well [for] premium brands," Gelfond told CNBC. "You look at concerts, ticket prices went up. Premium seats have gone up. You look at sporting events, same kind of thing. Broadway. I think people, although they enjoy staying at home, streaming and watching streaming products, when they go out of the home, they want something sufficient distinguished from that."

Investors have rallied behind IMAX stock. Shares of the company are up roughly 60% in the last 12 months.

IMAX screens are notably larger than standard movie screens and the theaters feature immersive audio systems. The company doesn't just screen movies, many of the films that appear in IMAX were shot using cameras and technology developed by the company specifically tailored to the IMAX viewing experience.

"This year, we have eight movies in a row in North America that were filmed with IMAX cameras, and typically the box office goes higher when you shoot with the cameras," Gelfond said. "And there's a couple reasons for that. One, it's a better way of watching it and listening to it. But also, the filmmakers typically get behind it more, and they tell their audiences that it's the best way to see their work. And I think that's a powerful impetus for audiences to go to IMAX."

These "filmed for IMAX" titles include features like Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer," Denis Villeneuve's "Dune" films and even the latest "Mission: Impossible" flick from Tom Cruise.

Tickets to see a film in IMAX typically cost a few dollars more than standard movie tickets, which can help to boost a box office haul.

"The more 'filmed for IMAX' titles, the more outperformance you seen on the film for IMAX titles," said Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. "The better the margins are going to be. As you see margins improve in 2025, you're going to see not just better quality title signings in 2026, but what I expect to see is that the studios will take more ownership of the marketing campaigns with even greater upside."

Roth's Eric Handler said that IMAX has a "high-class problem of too much content availability."

The "F1" deal for three weeks of screen programming meant that Universal's "Jurassic World Rebirth" got edged out: the film missed out on a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month.

Domestically, the movie slate is strong is 2025 and 2026, with a number of major franchise film releases on the books. Warner Bros.' "Superman" hits theaters Friday, and coming soon is Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps." Then Universal's "Wicked: For Good" arrives ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday and Disney's "Avatar: Fire and Ash" hits theaters just before Christmas.

2026 kicks off with Amazon's "Project Hail Mary" and will also feature a new Avengers film, the first theatrical Star Wars release since 2019, a sequel to "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," a live-action "Moana" as well as "Toy Story 5" and "Shrek 5." And also in the mix is Nolan's next feature film "The Odyssey."

New Hollywood releases are just one piece of IMAX's box office success.

"Not only are they benefiting from Hollywood's recovery, they're also taking advantage of the global footprint and showing local language movies in China, in Japan and South Korea and parts of Europe," said Eric Handler, analyst at Roth.

He noted that "Ne Zha 2," a Chinese release that has generated more than $2 billion in global ticket sales, was a particularly strong local language film for IMAX. The company generated nearly $170 million in receipts from screening the film.

And there's still room for IMAX to grow.

The company currently has around 1,700 screens worldwide, around 400 of which are in North America. Gelfond told CNBC that the company has contracts to build about 500 more IMAX screens.

He said the company would share more specific details during its earnings report, which is due to be released later this month.

"We signed almost as many new theaters this year as we signed for the whole year last year," Gelfond said. "So there's a lot of growth."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 4% at $117,955.25, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $118,872.85. Ether rose 6%, crossing back above the $3,000 level for the first time since February.

On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest day of inflows of 2025 at $1.18 billion. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue.

The rally began more slowly on Wednesday, following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed a divergence among officials about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22.

"That's when we started to really take out the top range," said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. "It's expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug," he added, nodding to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is expected to increase the federal deficit – and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.

This week's move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $550 million in short liquidations and ether more than $195 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.

Rates have been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That's when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the "termination" of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank's stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion.

Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen.

"Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not," Thielen said. "So we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer."

For the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain and its best week since April 25, while ether is up more than 21%, heading for its west week since May 9.

In this article

Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $117,297.10, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $118,872.85. Ether rose nearly 6% at $2,976.90. Earlier, it crossed back above the $3,000 level for the first time since February.

Stocks tied to the bitcoin price were off their highs. Pure play miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms gained 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy gained almost 3%. Crypto trading providers Coinbase and Robinhood gained 1%.

On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest day of inflows of 2025 at $1.18 billion. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue.

The rally began more slowly on Wednesday, following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed a divergence among officials about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22.

"That's when we started to really take out the top range," said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. "It's expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug," he added, nodding to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is expected to increase the federal deficit – and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.

This week's move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $650 million in short liquidations and ether more than $215 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.

Fed independence has been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That's when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the "termination" of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank's stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion.

Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen.

"Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not," Thielen said. "So we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer."

For the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain, while ether is up more than 20%.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has added "coffee entrepreneur" to his already packed resume.

The three-time Super Bowl champion has invested in Throne Sport Coffee, adding to the 29-year-old superstar's portfolio off the field.

As his Chiefs and the rest of the NFL gear up for the upcoming season, Mahomes spoke to CNBC about his interest in coffee, his growing investment portfolio in sports properties, stadium politics in Kansas City and his take on an 18-game NFL season.

Mahomes became the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee in May 2024, with an undisclosed stake.

Today, he's not only an investor, but also the brand's lead pitchman and product tester — and a daily drinker.

"It actually started in my first year in the NFL," Mahomes told CNBC of his coffee habit. "I was in a lot of meetings, and coffee became a functional need. But then I started to really love it, especially black coffee."

When founder, CEO and beverage industry veteran Mike Fedele approached him with a ready-to-drink option designed to be a healthier caffeine boost, he said it felt like a natural fit for him.

"I really fell in love with just the taste and trying to make sure that what I was putting into my body was good," Mahomes said.

Fedele, who has worked with major brands like Coca-Cola and BodyArmor, said Throne stands out because it has 10 grams of protein and 40% less sugar than competitors. Throne Sport Coffee has about 50 calories in it with 1 gram of sugar.

For comparison, a ready-to-drink Starbucks Frappuccino can have as many as 300 calories and 47 grams of sugar.

"Given how frequently people that care about what they're putting into their bodies consume coffee, I felt there needed to be a better for you option," he said.

Mahomes said his daily caffeine habit includes three coffees a day: one when he wakes up, another before meetings and a third ahead of afternoon prep.

"It's probably too much," he laughed, "but with Throne, I know I'm putting something clean in my body, no junk, no sugar, and added electrolytes, and B vitamins."

On game days? He said he tones it down to just one or two.

The ready-to-drink coffee market is a rapidly growing category. Americans spent $17.7 billion on the category in 2023, according to Technomic.

Despite its growth prospects, Throne is competing in a crowded coffee space, with coffee shop competitors rounding out their ready-to-drink offering. Starbucks announced this week that it is expanding its ready-to-drink lineup, citing the latest consumer trends and growth of the category.

Throne is just one part of Mahomes' growing investment portfolio. The three-time Super Bowl MVP also holds minority stakes in MLB's Kansas City Royals, Sporting Kansas City of the MLS and the NWSL's KC Current, along with Alpine F1.

"I love sports. I love how they bring people together: families, communities. That's what I want to invest in," Mahomes said.

So does that mean he's eyeing a future ownership stake in the Chiefs?

"That would be cool," he said. "Hopefully a long time from now, but yeah, I'd love to be a part of the team after I'm done playing. They've done so much for me."

The Chiefs' stadium future is still undecided, as the franchise is deciding whether to renovate Arrowhead Stadium or build a new stadium in Kansas. Mahomes didn't say where he would prefer the team to play.

"Arrowhead is special. You feel the history. But wherever we play, the fans will show up," he said.

The Chiefs were recently granted a one-year extension to make a decision on their future stadium.

On leaguewide issues, Mahomes said he's cautious about proposals for an 18-game NFL season and international expansion, including the Chiefs' Week 1 game in Brazil.

"More games are tough on the body. If we're going to go to 18, we need more bye weeks. Same with international games, planning matters."

Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence robotics and biometric venture as more companies bet big on automation tools.

The new company, known as RealSense, was announced Friday and comes alongside a $50 million Series A funding round that includes MediaTek Innovation Fund and Intel Capital, the chipmaker's venture arm that it is also spinning out.

RealSense, which makes the tools and technology for robotics automation, said it plans to use the funding to develop new product lines and meet growing demand worldwide. Nadav Orbach, Intel's current vice president and general manager for incubation and disruptive innovation, will serve as CEO.

"The timing is now for physical AI," as the technology gains more use cases and traction, Orbach told CNBC in an interview. "We want to develop new product lines. We see the demand and we see the need, and with where it's at right now, the right thing for us was to raise external funds."

Companies across the globe have ramped up investment in the burgeoning robotics space as AI use cases expand.

Morgan Stanley expects the market for humanoid robots to hit $5 trillion by 2050 as tech companies, including Tesla and Amazon, bet big on the technology and automation.

Elsewhere, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called robotics the biggest opportunity for the chipmaker after AI, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff last month claimed AI is handling 30% to 50% of the software vendor's work.

Intel has undergone a series of cost-cutting plans after the worst year for its stock in decades.

The company axed CEO Pat Gelsinger and cut jobs last year as it struggled to keep up with AI competition. In April, the company said it would sell a majority of its stake in chip subsidiary Altera.

RealSense, formerly known as Intel Perceptual Computing, was created more than a decade ago to investigate 3D vision technology and launched its first product in 2015. The company employs about 130 people across the U.S., Israel and China and caters to autonomous robot manufacturers such as Eyesynth and Unitree Robotics.

Orbach said RealSense is focused on bringing more safety tools to the industry and easy-to-use technology for its customers. Intel will maintain a minority stake in the company.

The U.S. tariff saga has stolen global spotlight from trade tensions between China and the European Union, which are now heating up.

Accusations and investigations over each other's trade practices have long been a staple of EU-China trade relations, underpinned by concerns over how domestic economies are likely to be impacted by competing imports.

In recent weeks, EU restrictions on Chinese companies taking part in public tenders for medical devices were quickly met with China imposing import curbs on such products. Separately, long-threatened Chinese duties on brandy from the EU came into force earlier this month, and both Beijing and Brussels have ramped up criticism of each another.

Altogether, EU-China trade relations are now "quite poor," according to Marc Julienne, director of the Center of Asian Studies at the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri).

"What was once a domain of great opportunity and enthusiasm for the bilateral relationship has now become more about risks than opportunities," he told CNBC earlier this week.

EU and China relations are encumbered by many challenges and risks often linked to clashing economic positions, Grzegorz Stec, senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, suggested.

"The EU and China are broadly on a colliding trajectory in terms of their trade and industrial policy concerns," he told CNBC. Bones of contention include the challenge of China's overcapacity and trade diversion to Europe, Stec, who is also head of the Mercator Institute's Brussels office, explained.

"Beijing's increasingly pressing need to export contradicts the EU's need to protect its own industrial base," he added.

China's economy is facing a gap between its production capacity and demand. It is also struggling with sluggish growth, while exports, which long boosted the economy, have been under pressure amid global trade tensions and lower demand.

Ifri's Julienne also flagged a series of concerns that make the EU-China relationship tricky, including an increasingly difficult environment for foreign companies operating in China and Europe's growing trade deficit. Additionally, he said Beijing was "weaponizing" trade to put pressure on Europe — like they did with the brandy tariffs.

China first started investigating European brandy imports after the EU began slapping levies on Chinese-made electric vehicles last year, which pose steep competition to Europe-made alternatives.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tariff regime could have been an opportunity for China and the EU to improve their relations, according to Ifri's Julienne.

"It should have had a positive impact on the bilateral relationship, in the sense that — facing economic coercion from the United States — [the EU and China] — might have been expected to negotiate and compromise in order to make the most of their trade relationship amid the US tariff war," he said.

This has yet to materialize.

Jean-Marc Fenet, senior fellow at the ESSEC Institute for Geopolitics & Business, suggested one reason for this failure could be that Beijing feels it has come out on top in its own trade drama with Washington.

"The need for a common front with the EU is therefore less necessary," Fenet said. "In fact, the fear now in Beijing is rather that the EU will accept an alignment with an anti-Chinese line that the American administration would impose on the sidelines of the trade negotiations."

After initial sharp escalations and tense negotiations, China and the U.S. confirmed a trade framework agreement in June, including provisions around hotly contested rare earths and tech regulations. Earlier this year, Beijing had imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets, which are often used in the automotive, defense and energy sectors, as part of its response to initial U.S. tariffs.

The Mercator Institute's Stec argued that a solution is "unlikely to be found" on the lingering points of trade contention between Beijing and Brussels, instead foreseeing further issues.

"The overcapacity and trade diversion issues paired with Beijing's willingness to use rare earths export controls as leverage in EV tariffs negotiations signal more turbulences to come," he said.

Tensions over the EU's measures to boost its autonomy and China's attempts to prevent these efforts can also be expected according to Stec.

Fenet struck a similarly skeptical tone.

"The significant hardening of the European Commission's positions and the increase in the power of the protection tools it has equipped itself with in recent years, make it likely that there will be growing frictions, as shown by the recent measures taken against Chinese medical equipment and as we will undoubtedly see at the EU-China Summit on July 24th in Beijing," he added.

His hopes for the summit — which sources told CNBC will include a meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese President Xi Jinping — are also low.

"The two parties already seem to be anticipating a difficult and probably inconclusive meeting," Fenet said.

The newest hire at Goldman Sachs isn't human.

The bank is testing an autonomous software engineer from artificial intelligence startup Cognition that is expected to soon join the ranks of the firm's 12,000 human developers, Goldman tech chief Marco Argenti told CNBC.

The program, named Devin, became known in technology circles last year with Cognition's claim that it had created the world's first AI software engineer. Demo videos showed the program operating as a full-stack engineer, completing multi-step assignments with minimal intervention.

"We're going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who's going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers," Argenti said this week in an interview.

"Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases," he said.

It's the latest indicator of the dizzying speed in which AI is being adopted in the corporate world. Just last year, Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were rolling out cognitive assistants based on OpenAI models to get employees acquainted with the technology.

Now, the arrival of agentic AI on Wall Street — referencing programs like Devin that don't just help humans with tasks like summarizing documents or writing emails, but instead execute complex multi-step jobs like building entire apps — signals a much larger shift, with greater potential rewards.

Tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet have said AI is already producing about 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said last month that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.

At Goldman Sachs, one of the world's top investment banks, this more powerful form of AI has the potential to boost worker productivity by up to three or four times the rate of previous AI tools, according to Argenti.

Devin will be supervised by human employees and will handle jobs that engineers often consider drudgery, like updating internal code to newer programing languages, he said.

Goldman is the first major bank to use Devin, according to Cognition, which was founded in late 2023 by a trio of engineers and whose staff is reportedly stocked with champion coders.

In March, the startup doubled its valuation to nearly $4 billion just a year after the release of Devin. The company counts Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, the prominent venture capitalists and Palantir co-founders, among its investors.

Goldman doesn't own a stake in Cognition, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified speaking about the bank's investments.

The bank's move could spark a fresh round of anxiety on Wall Street and beyond about job cuts as a result of AI.

Executives at companies from Amazon to Ford have grown more candid about what AI will mean for hiring plans. Banks around the world will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as they implement AI, Bloomberg's research arm said in January.

For his part, Argenti — who joined Goldman from Amazon in 2019 — charted out a vision for the near future that he called a "hybrid workforce" where humans and AI coexist.

"It's really about people and AIs working side by side," Argenti said. "Engineers are going to be expected to have the ability to really describe problems in a coherent way and turn it into prompts … and then be able to supervise the work of those agents."

While the role of software developer is one that most lends itself to the type of training, called reinforcement learning, that is used to make AI smarter, other roles at a bank aren't far off from being automated, according to Argenti.

"Those models are basically just as good as any developer, it's really cool," Argenti said. "So I think that will serve as a proof point also to expand it to other places."

YouTube and Netflix look poised to keep their gold and silver medals in the streaming wars as AI upends Hollywood, allowing for more personalized content and supercharged recommendations.

But Amazon Prime Video is well-positioned for bronze, if not an even better spot on the podium.

Amazon could be saving billions, among the most in the industry, in programming costs this year by using AI, according to a chart in a July 10 note by Morgan Stanley media analysts.

Their estimate is based on Amazon saving about 10% in production costs on scripted originals in its mammoth programming budget, which Morgan Stanley projects will be $24 billion in 2025.

However, the vast majority of that budget will be spent on content that already exists, as licensed movies and shows make up a massive chunk of Prime Video's library. A smaller slice will go toward Amazon's steadily expanding sports portfolio.

AI could eventually bring down costs of making scripted TV and films by 30%, wrote Ben Swinburne, who led the team of Morgan Stanley analysts. Even in that best-case scenario, he said that studios may not save much more than 10% in total programming costs, assuming that new shows and movies are 50% to 60% of their costs.

Media giants will likely spend heavily on AI tools, but Morgan Stanley thinks that investment will soon pay for itself.

"Leveraging Gen AI tools will not be free," Swinburne wrote. "Technology adoption may incur investment costs either from licensing the technology or developing in-house productivity tools. However, the net effect could be a reduction in production costs."

Hollywood is on edge about AI, and for good reason. Any cost savings for studios likely means less money in someone's pocket, whether they're an animator, graphics designer, or voice actor.

But AI companies and tech gurus won't be the only winners in this brave new world.

Morgan Stanley believes sports rights will continue to soar in value, even as the pay-TV bundle steadily erodes. Sports rights deals have already risen 10% per year since the pandemic to a third of total industry spending, potentially because live games appear to be generative AI-proof — unlike movies or TV shows.

If media companies use AI to save money on scripted content, they'll have more financial firepower, which could further intensify bidding wars over live sports rights.

"We expect a large proportion of those savings reinvested elsewhere in the value chain, including marketing, talent costs, and sports rights," Swinburne wrote. "Sports rights are already seeing the benefit of budget shifts away from TV & film."

Ballooning sports rights costs would be especially painful for Fox, NBC-parent Comcast, and Disney, which have the heaviest sports exposure as a percentage of their programming budget.

By contrast, tech giants like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and Apple have put the lion's share of their content budgets elsewhere, even though they've all upped their investments in sports.

So if AI makes scripted content costs shrink and sports rights values surge, as Morgan Stanley expects, then those deep-pocketed disruptors are likely to get even richer.

When Amber Smith, 28, had trouble submitting an IT support ticket, she quickly realized that her second layoff in one year had arrived.

Before that, she was already jumpy. She'd be unnerved by everyday workplace tasks, like when her manager asked to hop on the phone on short notice, or a companywide meeting suddenly appeared on her calendar.

It's a sign of the times as workplace power swings away from workers, and layoffs dominate headlines. While layoffs are still low relative to historic levels, they loom large in workers' minds.

A miasma of new stresses is also permeating white-collar offices: the threat of AI taking jobs, stricter return-to-office pushes, and a new hardcore culture that's eroding work-life balance. There's also the hollowing out of middle managers, and the Great Flattening has left some with fear that they'll be next.

"Workers are feeling disempowered," Michele Williams, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa, said, adding that this trend reared its head during the 2008 recession and is now back again.

"If the boss walks by and doesn't say 'hi,' are they planning to fire me, as opposed to the boss was just busy that day and just didn't notice you?" Williams said. "They're looking for these social cues and overinterpreting social cues because of that insecurity."

It's what experts call "paranoid attribution," where employees read negative meaning into regular workplace occurrences. Do worse snacks mean the company is struggling financially? Is a warmer office a sign that management is cutting costs on air conditioning? Are more interns a good sign or a bad sign for the hiring budget?

The fear isn't good for anyone — when employees are anxious, they probably also aren't doing their best work. The paranoia may be more psychological than based in reality. Overall, layoffs are still low and concentrated in white-collar sectors, especially at big-name companies that dominate headlines. While hiring has slowed in the last year, the unemployment rate is still relatively low, as well. However, it has gotten much more difficult to get a new white-collar job, and promotions have slowed way down.

The paranoia over employment uncertainty pushed Smith out of the corporate world completely. These days, she's self-employed as a content creator and reseller. "I feel so much better because being self-employed, obviously, I'm not going to get laid off," Smith said.

Monica Wiant, a 47-year-old copywriter in Minnesota, has completely changed her perspective on work and her career after getting laid off twice in two years. The first time she was laid off was the day that she had arranged a return-to-office party for the workers reporting to her. She was also coming off a glowing performance review in her role as a VP.

"The day that I got that news, it was like going to the worst surprise party I've ever been to," Wiant said. In retrospect, she said, there were some warning signs. Budgets for her department kept getting reduced, and they were asked to do more with less. Advertising budgets shrank, and some hiring was paused.

"I feel like so many companies have lost sight of how important the human experiences of their employees are. There's no place that's less motivating than a downsizing workplace," Wiant said. "It's really hard to go to work every day and to know that you may not have a future here no matter how hard you work."

Mark Freeman, 65, has some advice after spending the last 25 or so years in supply chain technology and getting laid off twice throughout his career.

"As soon as they say, 'don't worry, no one's going to get laid off,' you should get your résumé out there and start looking, because you can't believe them." He said he's learned it's important to be agile and constantly looking for other job opportunities; waiting until after a layoff will mean you're already behind.

Attention on layoffs, as Business Insider's Tim Paradis writes, might bite into productivity amid worker unease. Williams said that workers become less engaged as their energy shifts from actually getting work done toward worrying and becoming hypervigilant. 

On the other hand, employees might also cling harder to old adages about becoming indispensable at work. This is what some Big Tech companies are hoping for when they place more emphasis on performance reviews in a shift toward a more "hardcore" management style.

Williams said working harder is good advice when a promotion or raise seems realistic.

"But if you push it to the extreme, you're going to have workers hoarding information and knowledge because then they become indispensable," she said. "But the sharing of that knowledge is what the organization needs to increase collaboration and innovation."

Benjamin Friedrich, a professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, said that, in isolation, workers might not be willing to put in extra effort if they feel their trust has been broken by their firms.

Of course, Friedrich said, not all power is lost among workers right now: While the worker power pendulum is still swinging, the "amenities" of the Great Resignation and the pandemic era haven't faded completely.

"If you look at the breadth and the coverage of remote work or what share of workers can work some of the time at home, it's been very stable," Friedrich said.

By the time her second layoff rolled around, Wiant wasn't as surprised and was more attuned to those warning signs. While weathering two layoffs was far from pleasant, it's also made Wiant turn introspective.

"I don't feel as deep of a need to have all of my needs met from work," Wiant said. "I realize that I can cultivate a sense of purpose and creative challenge and intellectual challenge from other things in my life."

When xAI's Grok 4 chatbot was launched on Wednesday, users and media outlets quickly began pointing out examples of it consulting its owner Elon Musk's views on controversial matters. 

CNBC was able to confirm that when asked to take a stance on some potentially contentious questions, the chatbot said it was analyzing posts from Musk while generating its answers.

When asked, "Who do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict? One word answer," Grok 4's answer-generating process showed that it was searching the web and X for Elon Musk's stance before giving an answer. 

When Grok 3 was asked the same question about the Israel vs Palestine conflict, the chatbot took a neutral stance and provided background. In other cases, Grok 4 referenced Musk's stance directly in its answer.

While users can access Grok 3 for free, a subscription to Grok 4 costs $30 per month, while a larger version known as Grok 4 Heavy costs $300 per month.

In other cases, Grok referenced Musk's stance directly in its answer. When CNBC asked who the bot supported in the race for New York City Mayor, Grok 4 suggested Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, citing his "strong focus on combating crime and restoring safety in New York City, which aligns with concerns frequently raised by Elon Musk."

It's important to note, however, that Grok didn't appear to search for Musk's views when asked many other seemingly controversial questions and that results varied when questions were asked differently.

XAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Musk has said Grok is a "Anti-woke" and "maximally truth-seeking" artificial intelligence and has claimed that the new Grok4 model excels on standardized tests and exhibits doctorate-level knowledge in every discipline. 

Its launch comes just days after a major controversy regarding the Grok 3 chatbot, which is integrated with the social media site X. 

The AI had begun generating a series of antisemitic comments in response to questions from users, including those that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler. 

The official Grok account acknowledged the "inappropriate posts" on Wednesday, and they were later deleted. The company added that it had taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. 

The ordeal came after Musk said last week that his team had improved Grok and that users would notice a difference when asking it questions. 

The chatbot also faced backlash in May when it randomly answered user queries with unrelated comments about "white genocide" in South Africa.

Last month on X, Musk had agreed with a user who said Grok had been "manipulated by leftist indoctrination," and said he was working to fix it.

President Donald Trump's tariffs on Asian trading partners may ultimately pose less of a threat to regional markets than investors initially feared, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Although the tariffs are expected to have a lingering impact, they could actually support investor confidence. But investors need clarity on what's coming, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Thursday note. 

"The fundamental growth impact may not be as negative as markets feared in early 2Q and the actual tariff announcements may serve as a risk-positive 'clearing event', even if the rates imposed are somewhat above current baseline expectations," the analysts wrote.

Goldman points to market uncertainty — not the tariffs themselves — as the major concern for investors.

"Market performance has been impacted significantly by uncertainty regarding the level of tariffs that may be imposed and the frequent changes to the policy outlook," the analysts wrote.

They added that a stable and predictable tariff regime could actually improve investor risk appetite.

Trump has notified around two dozen countries that new levies on their goods will begin on August 1 unless new trade deals are reached.

Goldman Sachs' analysts said the impact of the US's tariffs may not be as severe as feared, given the differences among regions and sectors.

North Asian markets in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan would face the highest revenue exposure to the US within Asian equity markets.

By contrast, Southeast Asian markets and domestically oriented sectors — including utilities, banks, telecoms, and real estate — are far less exposed.

"The impact of tariffs will therefore not be evenly distributed," the analysts added.

Still, downside risks remain. Regional earnings could drop by 1% for every 5 percentage-point increase in tariffs, Goldman Sachs' analysis shows.

"Earnings forecasts for a given market could be impacted through the direct exposure of revenues to the US, the tariff pass-through rate, and the sensitivity of listed companies to the domestic growth backdrop," they wrote.

Lower US short-term interest rates and a weaker dollar could partially offset the damage.

The Federal Reserve's easing cycle may drive investors toward higher-yielding assets in Asia. A weaker dollar could also help Asian firms that rely on dollar-denominated borrowing, indirectly supporting growth.

Asia markets sold off sharply after Trump made his first tariff announcement on "Liberation Day" but mostly recovered. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 is up about 1% year to date, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 25% thanks to an extra boost from a Chinese AI-driven surge.

Bitcoin's explosive growth continues to outshine gold, stocks, and the dollar, with 100% of trading days profitable resulting in unmatched long term returns.

From the beginning, Bitcoin's rise has been nothing short of legendary. Priced at just $0.07 on August 17, 2010, it has skyrocketed $100,000+ into 2025, creating wealth, rewriting investment playbooks, and cementing its place as a cornerstone of the future financial system.

Bitcoin Magazine Pro data reveals that out of 5,442 total days since Bitcoin first began trading, 5,441 have been profitable when compared to today's price, an extraordinary 99.98% success rate. For those who believed early and held through the volatility, the reward has been historic.

The analysis of Bitcoin's daily price history also reveals that over 80 percent of all trading days have been profitable, meaning the current price is higher than the price on those days. This level of consistency has become a key reason why so many long term investors continue to hodl with confidence.

Since 2013, the global supply of money (M2) has grown from about $61 trillion to over $102 trillion. During that same period, Bitcoin's price jumped from around $113 to more than $118,000 at its peak. This trend shows a strong connection between the increase in global money supply and the rise in Bitcoin's value, supporting the idea that Bitcoin acts as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value.

According to Bitcoin Magazine Pro, if you had dollar cost averaged (DCA) $100 a month into Bitcoin over the past nine years, you'd be sitting on over $230,670 today, from just a $10,900 total investment, with a return of over 2,016%. 

In comparison, gold had returns of 103% which would have turned the investment of $10,900 into $22,152, Apple stock of 204% into $33,081, and Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) 56% into 16,993. Bitcoin easily surpasses the returns of traditional assets like gold, Apple stock, or the DJI.

The Dollar Cost Average Strategies tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro helps users explore Bitcoin investments across different timeframes. By comparing Bitcoin's performance to assets like the US dollar, gold, Apple stock, and the DJI, the tool highlights Bitcoin's potential as a leading store of value within a diversified investment portfolio.

COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The Putnam County Sheriff's Office is investigating multiple scams involving Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs.

PCSO reports that the scammers are requesting payments in the form of Bitcoin by depositing money in cryptocurrency ATMs.

“Scammers may claim the payment is needed for overdue bills, missed court dates, or a family emergency,” PCSO said. “Scammers may also claim to be local law enforcement, public officials, or government agencies.”

Here are instructions on how to watch WSMV4 live on various platforms.

The sheriff's office urged that deputies will never ask for payment in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, nor will they request payment over the phone.

The public is urged to call PCSO for advice before sending money or revealing any personal information.

PENGU token jumped as much as 13% after Coinbase updated its official X profile picture to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, according to Binance data.

Coinbase's new profile photo comes on the heels of Alex, formerly with Binance, taking on the role of Head of Crypto Twitter Communications to enhance the firm's public messaging and community ties.

Alex took over our account for an hour. Now we're taking him over forever.

Welcome to Coinbase, @AlexOnchain.

(Legally we're required to point out that Alex has not technically joined forever and has a very normal employment contract with the company.) https://t.co/DmkNn2wwfd

“Normal job announcements are boring. I had to do something different, and a twitter takeover felt right,” Alex said in a Friday statement.

“The new focus is making comms more social native – direct, transparent and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct. They're already working on it, and I've joined to be a part of that change,” he added.

At the time of writing, PENGU changed hands at around $0.023, up over 20% in the last 24 hours. The token has regained upward momentum since Wednesday, as Bitcoin's rally has lifted the overall crypto market.

In addition, positive regulatory developments, with the SEC having recently acknowledged Canary Capital's spot PENGU ETF application, also helped boost its momentum.

Home - Crypto Presales - Why DAG Tech Is the Future of Crypto – And BlockDAG May Be Its Best Bet Yet [$337M+ Raised]

Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, blockchain has been the foundation of nearly every major crypto project. But fifteen years later, that architecture is starting to show its age. Congestion, high fees, and confirmation delays remain common problems, even on networks with billion-dollar ecosystems. That's where DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, enter the picture.

DAG-based infrastructure offers an alternative to traditional blockchain by enabling parallel processing of transactions. Instead of blocks in a single chain, transactions are recorded as interconnected nodes in a graph structure, allowing for higher throughput, near-instant confirmations, and better scalability.







Projects like IOTA and Kaspa have attempted to pioneer this path, but one new entrant is making noise with a unique twist: BlockDAG, a hybrid Layer 1 that combines the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the speed of DAG architecture. And based on its rapid growth, the crypto market is paying attention.

The main issue with traditional blockchains is bottlenecking. Every transaction must be included in a block, and each block must be confirmed in sequence. This creates limits on how many transactions per second (TPS) a network can handle, a problem that plagues even top 10 chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

DAGs solve this by removing the need for sequential blocks. Each transaction verifies previous ones, forming a graph-like network that expands in multiple directions. The result: transactions can be processed simultaneously rather than waiting in line. The benefits are obvious:













This structure is especially relevant as crypto moves toward real-world adoption. Retail payments, IoT devices, enterprise use cases, all demand speed, scale, and low costs. Blockchain alone may not deliver that at scale. DAG just might.

What sets BlockDAG apart isn't just that it uses DAG. It's the hybrid model it has built on top of it. By combining DAG-based transaction architecture with a Proof-of-Work consensus layer, BlockDAG manages to strike a balance between scalability and security, something few Layer 1s have pulled off.

In practice, this means that miners still validate transactions and secure the network (like Bitcoin), but those transactions are no longer locked into a linear block structure. This fusion allows BlockDAG to maintain decentralization and trustlessness while achieving far greater speed and efficiency than legacy chains.







It's the same foundational insight that helped Kaspa attract a cult following, but BlockDAG is evolving the concept further, with developer tools, a growing testnet, and consumer-ready mining apps already live.

BlockDAG's approach isn't just theoretical, it's already in motion.

The project's testnet is active and available to the public, supporting smart contract deployment, node setup, and decentralized app testing. Over 2 million users are mining BDAG coins via the X1 Miner app, and more than 18,000 ASIC mining units have been sold ahead of mainnet.

The presale has now exceeded $337 million, with over 23.8 billion BDAG tokens sold, putting it among the largest community-driven crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. And with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release confirmed for August 11, the window to get in early is rapidly closing.

BlockDAG isn't relying solely on technology. It's backing up its product roadmap with aggressive global positioning. The platform is now the Official Blockchain Partner of two major U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket). These partnerships integrate Web3 features like NFTs and fan tokens into existing sports ecosystems, exposing millions of users to BDAG in organic, engaging ways.







Add to that earlier branding campaigns with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football giant Inter Milan, and it's clear BlockDAG is serious about reaching audiences far beyond the typical DeFi crowd.

Right now, BDAG is priced at $0.0016, a figure that stands out when compared to early-stage valuations of other successful Layer 1s. But the clock is ticking. The project has already confirmed that its current unlock promotion, allowing 80% of tokens to be accessible on Day 1, will only be available for a limited time.

With the presale closing soon and mainnet infrastructure rolling out, the BDAG price is unlikely to stay in its current bracket for long. Whether BlockDAG becomes the next Kaspa or carves its own path, the market opportunity for scalable, secure, DAG-based networks has never looked stronger.

Bitcoin's price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin's price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun.

Technical Factors Showing Fall Of Bitcoin Dominance

According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance reached a peak of exactly 66% on June 27, 2025, a date he calls significant for its esoteric code 434 and its occurrence on a new moon. From a technical perspective, the 66% mark coincided precisely with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a region many traders consider a reversal zone. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders.

 The analyst's post on the social media platform X features a few price charts to emphasize how the Bitcoin dominance might be fading, alongside nine factors. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The first factor is the most recent highest monthly RSI in the history of the Bitcoin dominance chart. This event has created an overbought condition, and the next outlook is a possible crash of the RSI. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory.

Furthermore, the histogram has turned negative, and the faster line has moved below the slower one, which is a classic signal of an impending downtrend. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. 

Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs

While the technical picture is deteriorating, the fundamentals are also stacking in favor of altcoins very quickly. The first fundamental factor is the importance of upcoming altcoin spot ETFs, which have the possibility to redirect institutional flows from Bitcoin into Ethereum, XRP, and others. 

ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin.

Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels.

The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. 

Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Solana's Pump.fun is preparing for the launch of its initial coin offering (ICO) on July 12, 2025, introducing the PUMP token to the Solana ecosystem. The ICO will offer 150 billion PUMP tokens at a price of $0.004 each, with trading expected to commence within 48 to 72 hours after the sale concludes. The token sale is restricted to exclude participants from the U.S. and U.K. due to regulatory constraints, and the tokens will be available on six major centralized exchanges—Bybit, Kraken, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate.io—as well as directly through Pump.fun's website.

Market sentiment surrounding the PUMP token launch is cautiously optimistic, with prediction markets like Myriad indicating a 70% likelihood of a sellout within the first hour. This rapid uptake, if realized, would position PUMP for trading as early as Monday, July 14. However, investors are advised to monitor pre-market activity, particularly on platforms such as Hyperliquid, which currently values PUMP at approximately $0.005426—reflecting a 35.65% premium over the ICO price.

Despite initial enthusiasm, some analysts express reservations about PUMP's short-term price trajectory. Daniel Seager, head analyst at Trireme Trading, highlights the token's challenging market share environment, noting that Pump.fun has recently ceded dominance to competitors like LetsBonk, which captured nearly 66% of daily token creation on Solana. Seager also points to the tokenomics structure, which includes a one-year cliff on private and team allocations, potentially mitigating immediate sell pressure but raising questions about long-term liquidity.

Conversely, pseudonymous investor Solarnius underscores the token's favorable lock-up terms and expresses bullish sentiment, signaling intent to make a significant investment despite the high fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion. Meanwhile, VC Beanie from GM Capital warns that the $4 billion valuation is “unprecedented” and forecasts downward price movement in both the short and long term. This divergence in expert opinion underscores the complexity of assessing PUMP's market potential amid evolving competitive dynamics and valuation metrics.

Since its January 2024 launch, Pump.fun has been the leading Solana launchpad, responsible for up to 99% of meme coin creations as recently as April. However, recent data from Dune Analytics reveals a significant shift, with LetsBonk overtaking Pump.fun in daily token creation share. This competitive pressure introduces uncertainty regarding Pump.fun's ability to sustain its market dominance and, by extension, the demand for its native token.

Despite this, Pump.fun's co-founder Alon Cohen remains a respected figure in the community, with some analysts expressing confidence in the platform's long-term viability based on its tokenomics and strategic positioning. The upcoming PUMP airdrop, though not scheduled for launch day, may also influence market sentiment and token liquidity in the weeks following the ICO.

The ICO's exclusion of U.S. and U.K. investors due to regulatory constraints has prompted some traders to explore alternative meme coin projects within the Pump-themed ecosystem. Veteran meme coin trader Wirelyss highlights this dynamic, suggesting that sidelined investors may seek value in related tokens, potentially diluting initial demand for PUMP. Wirelyss also critiques the $4 billion valuation as steep when compared to established entities like stablecoin issuer Circle, which commands a valuation roughly double that figure.

These factors, combined with the token's lock-up provisions and competitive pressures, suggest a nuanced market environment where strategic entry points and vigilant monitoring of pre-market indicators will be crucial for prospective investors. As the PUMP token ICO approaches, the crypto community faces a complex interplay of high valuation, competitive market shifts, and regulatory exclusions shaping its launch trajectory. While early indicators and tokenomics suggest potential for measured growth, expert opinions diverge on the likelihood of significant price appreciation. Investors should approach the PUMP token with a balanced perspective, closely observing pre-market trends and broader Solana ecosystem developments to inform their trading strategies.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have transformed digital ownership by enabling the trade of unique assets through blockchain technology. From art and music to virtual real estate, these tokens have become central to the Web3 economy. Yet, this rapid innovation has outpaced security measures, leaving users vulnerable to sophisticated scams, technical exploits, and project failures. As NFTs grow in popularity and financial value, the consequences of security breaches have become increasingly severe. Due to these concerns, there is a critical need to systematically study the full scope of NFT security risks and create practical defenses against emerging threats.In a new study (DOI: 10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100268) published on June 25, 2025, in Blockchain: Research and Applications, researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Peking University unveil the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) on NFT security. By analyzing 248 security reports and 35 academic publications, the team identified and classified 176 NFT-related security incidents. Their work culminates in a multilayered NFT security reference framework that pinpoints the most common vulnerabilities, assesses detection challenges, and proposes a clear path forward for safeguarding the Web3 ecosystem.The researchers constructed a three-tier security model encompassing the contract layer, market layer, and auxiliary service layer. Within this framework, they uncovered 12 core types of threats—including smart contract bugs like reentrancy flaws and access control lapses, market manipulations such as wash trading and rug pulls, and infrastructure attacks like phishing, fake interfaces, and website exploits. These findings are grounded in real incidents, including high-profile cases where attackers stole millions by exploiting minting functions or deceived users through counterfeit tokens tied to celebrity names.The team also developed practical detection tools, such as transaction trace analysis for identifying reentrancy loops and symbolic execution to test logic vulnerabilities in minting functions. Alarmingly, they found that many real-world incidents—especially those involving phishing and front-end manipulation—remain underexplored in academic research. Their open-source dataset and security taxonomy now provide a foundational reference for future research, policy guidance, and secure development practices."Despite the explosive growth of NFTs, the community has lacked a comprehensive understanding of where and how these systems fail," said Dr. Haoyu Wang, senior author of the study. "Our work bridges this knowledge gap by not only exposing the root causes of major attacks but also offering developers and researchers the tools to detect and prevent them. This is a call to action—for academia and industry alike—to take NFT security seriously."This pioneering research lays the groundwork for a more secure and resilient NFT ecosystem. Developers can now reference the proposed framework to preemptively address common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and marketplaces. Investors and collectors gain a better understanding of the warning signs associated with fraudulent projects. Perhaps most importantly, the study advocates for greater collaboration between cybersecurity researchers and blockchain practitioners to stay ahead of evolving threats. As NFTs continue to expand into finance, gaming, and identity, securing their foundations is essential to sustain innovation and build long-term public trust.

State development bank NRW.BANK has issued its first digital bond, a two-year €100 million issuance on the Polygon blockchain. The bond is a ‘crypto security' under Germany's Electronic Securities Act (eWpG), which means it used a crypto registrar Cashlink rather than a central securities depository.

Deutsche Bank, DZ BANK and DekaBank acted as joint lead managers, with the issuance attracting strong interest from institutional investors. Yesterday the BIS published a bulletin on blockchain-based government bonds, finding that they attract tighter bid-ask spreads, indicating greater liquidity.

Cashlink CEO Michael Duttlinger said that the latest issuance “shows the increasing trust in blockchain-based capital market infrastructure and reinforces our role as a key enabler for secure, compliant, and scalable tokenized financial instruments.” The company also observed that some institutions are progressing from one off pilots to fully integrate with blockchain technology.

NRW isn't the first German state bank to issue a digital bond, with KfW launching two last summer, for €100 million and €50 million. The second one used Germany's Trigger solution that links to the TARGET2 payment system to settle in central bank money. This was part of the ECB's wholesale DLT settlement trials. Both were on the Polygon blockchain and used Cashlink as the registrar. In addition to issuing bonds, KfW  also took the step of investing in blockchain based bonds, buying the mortgage bonds of state bank and LBBW subsidiary Berlin Hyp.

Social poker brand Devilfish.com has announced the complete sell-out of its Genesis Avatar NFT collection. The company said this milestone validates its approach to creating "a player-centric brand, which applies a sweepstakes-membership style, free-to-play (F2P) model to poker."

According to Devilfish.com, the success of the Genesis Mint signals "a clear market appetite for players to be part of a brand and a new social movement," as against the real-money-first poker model, which the brand says has long struggled with high customer acquisition costs (CPAs) and a significant player churn rate. 

"By removing the initial financial barrier commitment from the player, Devilfish.com is building a vibrant and engaged community, attracting a diverse demographic of traditional poker players, gamers, and crypto natives," said the company.

This F2P, community-centric model is designed to address the industry's long-standing retention problem, where an estimated 85% of recreational players are long-term net losers, which may result in a poor player experience.

JJ Williams, CEO of Devilfish.com, commented: "We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our Genesis collection, but we are not surprised. This is a powerful signal of how creating a brand-centric story to the industry that poker has a sustainability problem and that the solution lies within the community, not just in cash.

The Ethereum Foundation has sold 10,000 ether (ETH) to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal worth $25.7 million, marking the first time a publicly listed company has directly acquired the token directly from the protocol's core steward.

The transaction was executed at an average price of $2,572.37 per ETH and settled on-chain via the foundation's multisig on July 10. Proceeds from the sale will be used to support EF's core activities.

0/ Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC.For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming.

SharpLink, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, described the purchase not as a trade, but as a “commitment to Ethereum's long-term mission.” The company is positioning ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset and said it plans to stake and restake the acquired ETH, effectively removing it from circulation.

“This isn't a trade — it's a commitment,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and a co-founder of Ethereum, said in a release. “SharpLink is acquiring, staking and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.'

“Moreover, we see this as the start of something bigger – a model for how mission-driven organizations can work to advance our ecosystem's shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment and protocol-native finance,” Lubin added.

The move comes at a time when ETH ETF inflows are building, ETH-denominated treasuries are re-emerging, and protocol-native finance is regaining attention.

ETH was trading above $3,000 as of U.S. morning hours Friday, up more than 8% in the past 24 hours.

BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT) has announced the establishment of a $1 million strategic reserve in Ethereum (ETH), marking its first step toward expanding its presence in Ethereum's on-chain financial infrastructure. This strategic initiative represents BTCT's evolution from a crypto mining company to an on-chain financial infrastructure participant.

CEO Siguang Peng emphasized that this initial investment positions the company for future opportunities in decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. The decision is driven by Ethereum's dominant position in stablecoin infrastructure, high transaction volumes, and growing institutional adoption. The company plans to continue increasing its ETH holdings in response to market developments and network upgrades.

Das Unternehmen plant, seine ETH-Bestände entsprechend der Marktentwicklungen und Netzwerk-Updates weiter zu erhöhen.

BTCT's $1M Ethereum reserve signals strategic pivot toward DeFi infrastructure participation, positioning for stablecoin and tokenization opportunities.

BTCT's announcement of a $1 million Ethereum strategic reserve represents a calculated pivot in their business strategy. This initial investment signals the company's transition from a traditional crypto mining operation to a participant in on-chain financial infrastructure, particularly targeting the booming stablecoin ecosystem where Ethereum serves as the dominant settlement layer.

The strategic rationale centers on Ethereum's critical position in decentralized finance - over half of major stablecoins including USDT and USDC operate on Ethereum, creating massive transaction volumes approaching traditional financial rails. By establishing this reserve, BTCT is positioning itself to potentially capitalize on multiple value-creation opportunities:

This move aligns with emerging institutional trends where mining and blockchain companies diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The $1 million allocation appears to be just the first phase, with management indicating plans to "scale that position" and "continuously augment its ETH holdings" based on market developments.

The timing coincides with several technical catalysts that could enhance Ethereum's fundamental value proposition, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade, mature Layer-2 scaling solutions, and increasing regulatory clarity. Rather than merely holding cryptocurrency as a speculative asset, BTCT is strategically positioning to leverage Ethereum's programmable capabilities for potential revenue generation and infrastructure participation.

SINGAPORE, July 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BTC Digital Ltd. ("BTCT" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: BTCT), a leading blockchain technology company, today announced that it has established a strategic reserve of $1 million in Ethereum (ETH). This milestone marks the first phase of BTCT's broader initiative to deepen its exposure to Ethereum's on–chain financial infrastructure and to position the Company for long–term growth in the emerging digital–asset era.

"As the stablecoin market continues its explosive growth, Ethereum has emerged as the foundation of on–chain USD settlement and value transfer," said Mr. Siguang Peng, CEO of BTCT. "By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. This strategic move strengthens our technological edge, enhances market confidence, and optimizes capital deployment."

Key Drivers of BTCT's Ethereum Reserve Strategy:

Looking AheadBuilding on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from "hash–rate provider" to "on–chain financial infrastructure participant." The Company intends to continuously augment its ETH holdings in alignment with market developments and network upgrades. BTCT believes that Ethereum, akin to "digital gold," will remain indispensable—not only as a stablecoin settlement hub but also as a catalyst for decentralized payments, asset tokenization, and the next wave of global financial interoperability.

 Bitcoin's latest rally sparked a reaction from Peter Schiff, urging a switch to silver, while others were more bullish than ever. 

Longtime Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said the latest BTC rally may be a selling opportunity for investors to buy silver instead.  

“With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it's a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver's next big leg up,” Schiff said in a Thursday X post as Bitcoin (BTC) put on its moon boots again and set new highs above $112,000.

He claimed that silver has more upside potential than Bitcoin and added that while BTC “can easily crash, silver's downside seems very limited.”

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, also weighed in on market conditions in a Friday X post. He said he was “slightly bearish” due to the US Treasury General Account being replenished through new debt issuance, which could temporarily drain liquidity.

Still, Hayes said he was bullish after Bitcoin reached a new all-time high and Ether (ETH) went on a march upward:

Hayes said that the market believes US President Donald Trump will “chicken out” on the tariffs, adding that his family office fund, Maelstrom, is ready to reenter the market.

Erald Ghoos, the CEO of the European arm of crypto exchange OKX, also said that Bitcoin's surge to new highs “isn't just noise, it reflects its emergence as the ultimate digital macro hedge.” He added:

The reaction came amid Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high on Thursday, surpassing $112,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at almost $118,000 after seeing its price rally by about 6% over the last 24 hours.

OKX CEO Roshan Robert said, “Bitcoin is showing why it's in a class of its own.” According to Robert, while ongoing trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating Bitcoin as a macro hedge and maturing asset class.

“July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it,” he concluded.

 Local authorities and state-owned publications in mainland China are increasingly calling on the government not to dismiss the increasing global adoption of stablecoins. 

Mainland China, one of the most restrictive global jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, is reportedly showing signs of a shift in tone regarding stablecoins amid new developments in Shanghai.

The Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies, Reuters reported on Friday.

Following the Thursday meeting, SASAC director He Qing called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies,” in a post on the authority's official account.

The initiative reportedly came in response to growing calls from experts and major companies in China to develop a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese yuan.

China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has been addressing the issue of global stablecoin adoption, particularly in light of US policy to strengthen the power of the dollar through stablecoins like Circle's USDC (USDC).

In June, PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng reportedly acknowledged the transformative potential of emerging technologies like stablecoins in global payment systems, intensifying calls for regulatory approval of yuan-backed stablecoins.

On June 23, China's state media, Securities Times, published an article saying that the development of stablecoins “should be sooner rather than later.”

Subsequently, PBOC adviser Huang Yiping suggested exploring Hong Kong as a testing ground for yuan-backed stablecoins, stressing that mainland China's tight capital controls make such experimentation unlikely.

“Hong Kong has an offshore market for the renminbi, and if the offshore market develops, it is possible to create a stablecoin pegged to the offshore RMB in Hong Kong in the future,” Huang reportedly said.

Shanghai's recent stablecoin developments come despite mainland China's ongoing crypto trading bans, reinforced by a major crackdown in September 2021.

While some in the community have speculated that mainland China might eventually lift its crypto ban, others argue that the government is unlikely to ease its stance and expose its 1.4 billion citizens to such a high-risk industry.

In the meantime, multiple reports have suggested that China has been secretly stacking Bitcoin (BTC) to become the second-largest holder of the asset after the US. The Chinese government has never officially disclosed its Bitcoin holdings or any sale strategies.

Beyond the rising calls for stablecoin adoption, speculation about China's potential pivot toward crypto has intensified amid controversy over local payouts from the FTX bankruptcy estate.

In early July, the FTX estate requested that a US bankruptcy judge authorize a freeze on distributions to creditors in “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions,” including China, which accounts for 82% of the value of the affected claims.

The move has triggered outrage in the community in many countries, with some Chinese creditors highlighting that China has never banned holding crypto.

On Tuesday, a Chinese creditor filed an objection to an FTX estate motion, representing a group of at least 300 creditors seeking to recover funds from the collapsed crypto exchange.

According to court filings, a ruling on the motion is expected on July 22.

NuCana Announces Plan to Implement ADS Ratio Change

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) has announced a significant milestone in its planned business combination with One Blockchain LLC. The company has confidentially submitted a draft Form S-4 registration statement to the SEC, which includes a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement.

One Blockchain, a digital infrastructure developer focused on Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing, operates a 40 MW data center facility in South Carolina. In 2024, this facility generated $26.8 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income.

The business combination, initially announced on May 28, 2025, is subject to various conditions, including Signing Day Sports stockholder approval and NYSE American listing approval for BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's common shares.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) ha annunciato un importante traguardo nel suo progetto di fusione con One Blockchain LLC. La società ha presentato in via riservata alla SEC una bozza del modulo di registrazione Form S-4, che include un prospetto preliminare e una dichiarazione di delega.

La fusione, annunciata inizialmente il 28 maggio 2025, è soggetta a diverse condizioni, tra cui l'approvazione degli azionisti di Signing Day Sports e l'approvazione della quotazione NYSE American per le azioni ordinarie di BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

La combinación de negocios, anunciada inicialmente el 28 de mayo de 2025, está sujeta a varias condiciones, incluyendo la aprobación de los accionistas de Signing Day Sports y la aprobación de la cotización en NYSE American para las acciones comunes de BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

One Blockchain은 비트코인 채굴 및 고성능 컴퓨팅에 중점을 둔 디지털 인프라 개발업체로, 사우스캐롤라이나에 40MW 데이터 센터 시설을 운영하고 있습니다. 2024년 이 시설은 2,680만 달러의 매출과 570만 달러의 순이익을 기록했습니다.

2025년 5월 28일 처음 발표된 이 사업 결합은 Signing Day Sports 주주 승인과 BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure 보통주에 대한 NYSE American 상장 승인 등 다양한 조건을 충족해야 합니다.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American : SGN) a annoncé une étape importante dans sa fusion prévue avec One Blockchain LLC. La société a soumis confidentiellement un projet de déclaration d'enregistrement Formulaire S-4 à la SEC, incluant un prospectus préliminaire et une déclaration de procuration.

One Blockchain, développeur d'infrastructures numériques spécialisé dans le minage de Bitcoin et le calcul haute performance, exploite un centre de données de 40 MW en Caroline du Sud. En 2024, cette installation a généré 26,8 millions de dollars de revenus et 5,7 millions de dollars de bénéfice net.

La fusion, initialement annoncée le 28 mai 2025, est soumise à plusieurs conditions, notamment l'approbation des actionnaires de Signing Day Sports et l'approbation de la cotation NYSE American pour les actions ordinaires de BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) hat einen wichtigen Meilenstein in der geplanten Unternehmenszusammenführung mit One Blockchain LLC bekannt gegeben. Das Unternehmen hat vertraulich einen Entwurf der Form S-4-Registrierungserklärung bei der SEC eingereicht, die einen vorläufigen Prospekt und eine Vollmachterklärung enthält.

One Blockchain, ein Entwickler digitaler Infrastruktur mit Schwerpunkt auf Bitcoin-Mining und Hochleistungsrechnen, betreibt eine 40-MW-Datenzentrale in South Carolina. Im Jahr 2024 erzielte diese Anlage 26,8 Millionen US-Dollar Umsatz und 5,7 Millionen US-Dollar Nettogewinn.

Die ursprünglich am 28. Mai 2025 angekündigte Unternehmenszusammenführung unterliegt verschiedenen Bedingungen, darunter die Zustimmung der Aktionäre von Signing Day Sports und die NYSE American-Notierungsfreigabe für die Stammaktien von BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

Signing Day Sports advances its merger with One Blockchain, marking key progress with S-4 SEC filing for the Bitcoin mining pivot.

Signing Day Sports' announcement regarding the confidential submission of an S-4 registration statement represents significant progress in its planned business combination with One Blockchain LLC. This merger would fundamentally transform the company from a sports recruitment platform into a cryptocurrency mining operation.

The S-4 filing is a crucial procedural milestone that contains the preliminary prospectus and proxy statement necessary for shareholder approval. While the draft remains confidential at this stage, its submission indicates the deal structure has been formalized and the regulatory review process has begun.

One Blockchain's credentials are substantial - their 40 MW South Carolina data center generated approximately $26.8 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income in 2024, representing a healthy 21% profit margin in the volatile Bitcoin mining sector. This financial performance demonstrates operational efficiency despite cryptocurrency market fluctuations.

This transaction appears to be a reverse merger strategy where One Blockchain gains public market access through Signing Day Sports' NYSE American listing. The newly created entity, BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc., will likely retain One Blockchain's management and operational focus while leveraging the public listing status.

The merger still faces significant hurdles, including shareholder approval and NYSE American listing authorization for the new entity. The extensive legal disclaimers suggest regulatory scrutiny will be thorough given the cryptocurrency industry's evolving regulatory landscape.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) vaulted to a fresh all-time high Friday, breaking above $118,000 amid a wave of bullish momentum across risk assets.

The token's price action coincides with AI giant Nvidia's (NVDA) surge to a $4 trillion valuation, highlighting crypto's tie with tech. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hit a fresh record on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was headed that way on Thursday.

"Historically, Bitcoin has remained highly correlated with tech stocks, and this correlation is still playing out," Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of the Coin Bureau, wrote on Thursday morning.

Year to date, the token is up roughly 21%, buoyed in part by crypto-friendly policies from the Trump administration, including the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve and a broader digital asset stockpile.

Over the past two months, bitcoin has traded within a tight $10,000 range — an unusually stable period given its historical volatility.

"At the heart of this rally lies sustained structural inflows from institutional players," wrote Dilin Wu, research strategist at Pepperstone.

"Corporates are also ramping up participation," he added. The analyst noted companies like Strategy (MSTR) and GameStop (GME) have continued to add bitcoin to their balance sheets. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) this week also filed for approval to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF”, which would include about 70% of its holdings in bitcoin.

The timing of bitcoin's breakout also comes days before Congress kicks off its highly anticipated "Crypto Week" on July 14. Lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the industry's regulatory framework.

"A favorable outcome could accelerate institutional inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as a macro asset and strengthening confidence in compliant crypto platforms," said Jesse Jarvis, CEO of Kaiko AI.

The GENIUS Act is among the regulations the House will consider. The bill, which recently passed through the Senate, proposes a federal framework for stablecoins.

Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of stablecoin USDC (USDC-USD), were up roughly 2% on Thursday. The stock is up more than 500% from its June 5 IPO.

Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) were also higher during Thursday's session.

Inspired by the success of businesses like MicroStrategy, which has seen its stock surge more than 3,000% since it pivoted to buying Bitcoin instead of developing software, other publicly traded companies are now betting on an even more volatile cryptocurrency: Ethereum.

And some taking the risky move are saying it's a “Chat GPT moment for crypto” — because they believe the product is going to become ubiquitous and highly valued in just a few months.

“Ethereum, to me, is really gonna be where Wall Street meets crypto,” Tom Lee of BitMine Immersion Technologies told me.

Lee joined BitMine Immersion Technologies last week as chairman following the company's rebrand from a Bitcoin mining company to a focus on acquiring what they believe is the real gold, Ethereum.

And if the stock price is any indication, it seems to be working. Since announcing its pivot to Ethereum, BitMine Immersion Technologies' stock climbed 25%. Bit Digital, a publicly traded company that previously focused on computing infrastructure and, at one point Bitcoin mining, saw its shares surge nearly 30% after announcing it was moving to an Ethereum treasury management and staking strategy.

Likewise, SharpLink Gaming, a former sports betting and online casino marketing company, saw its stock surge over 400% after announcing a shift to an Ethereum treasury strategy in May 2025, though it has since experienced significant volatility.

Other companies, including the crypto exchange Coinbase and fin-tech companies Exodus Movement and Mogo, have also acquired Ethereum and begun holding it on their balance sheets.

Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency focused on secure, peer-to-peer transactions without supporting complex apps, Ethereum is a high-tech blockchain platform powering apps, smart contracts and its currency, Ether. 

It enables three key features: staking, or locking up Ether to secure the network and earn rewards, similar to interest on savings; stablecoins, or Ether-based coins pegged to $1 for stable transactions or savings; and NFTs, which are unique digital assets, like a one-of-a-kind Pokémon card, stored on Ethereum to prove ownership.

Large wealth managers restricted by SEC rules from buying crypto can invest in companies holding Ethereum to gain exposure to both the cryptocurrency and its technology, which supports stablecoins, staking and decentralized finance applications.

“Ethereum offers something unique: It's a productive asset,” Mara Schmiedt, the CEO and co-founder of Alluvia, told me. “Staking delivers a 3%+ baseline yield … forward-looking companies aren't just holding ETH, they're integrating it into how they generate yield, manage capital and future-proof their businesses.” 

And following the June IPO of Circle — the most successful stablecoin company of the last five years — this is big business. 

Lorien Gabel, the co-founder and CEO of Figment, the largest global staking infrastructure provider, told me staking is emerging as “the center of global banking for digital assets.” 

“Protocol staking enables institutions to earn rewards,” he explained. “For traditional finance investors like asset managers, staking represents a compliant, reward-generating strategy that provides direct exposure to the economic activity of decentralized systems.” 

Schmiedt said she is working with Galaxy Digital to launch staking financial products — basically a bundled-up and traded staking program, similar to a mortgage-backed security. 

And for Wall Street, which loves complex financial tools (derivatives, anyone?), this could be a whole new world. 

“We're in the early innings of a treasury strategy evolution for public and private companies,” Schmiedt said. “Companies like SharpLink, Bit Digital and BitMine are signaling that institutional narratives around Ethereum are maturing. Ethereum and staking are quickly becoming new tools for shareholder value creation in an on-chain financial system for corporate treasuries and beyond.” 

This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC's power players (and those who aspire to be).

Of course, the sheer number of companies that are jumping on this bandwagon feels vaguely reminiscent of the blockchain craze, when Long Island Iced Tea rebranded to Long Blockchain Corp. and saw its stock surge 200%. Or when little-known, publicly traded companies with the phrase “AI” in their names, like BigBearAI and C3.ai, saw stock surge shortly after the introduction of ChatGPT. 

But Ethereum enthusiasts believe the crypto is a good bet both because of its inherent value and because of the rewards it offers. And if the heavyweights who bought into BitMine are any indication, it has serious backers. 

“[The pivot to Ethereum] reflects the convergence that's taking place between traditional finance and crypto — where crypto, venture funds and traditional finance are meeting in the middle,” Lee added. “The mix of investors reflects that as well.” 

BitMine Immersion recently secured $250 million from prominent backers including Mozayyx Group (a discretionary macro hedge fund), Founders Fund, Pantera, Galaxy Digital, Falcon X, Kraken and Republic Digital, as well as traditional funds like Ockham Crest and Diametric Capital.

President Trump has become a major booster of digital currency. The Planet Money team went to look into how the president's crypto enthusiasm plays out inside the industry.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump has become a major booster of digital currency. That's helped the industry and his own bottom line. Our Planet Money podcast looked into how the president's crypto enthusiasm plays out inside the industry. Here's Andrea Bernstein and Ilya MarritzILYA MARRITZ, BYLINE: The Bitcoin 2025 conference at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, the biggest event of the year for bitcoin, the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. It's where we met Stephen Dalehite (ph), a lawyer from San Antonio.STEPHEN DALEHITE: My wife is into it big time, and I'm the one that's like, that's just pie in the sky.MARRITZ: But Stephen started to think his wife might be right.DALEHITE: And I'm saying, if Trump gets elected, it's going to go up.MARRITZ: The price of a single bitcoin did go up from about $60,000 to over a hundred thousand, and Stephen is thinking about getting in.ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Bitcoin used to be an outsider thing. Government's stay away. But this year...FRANK CORVA: A lot of politicians are here.BERNSTEIN: Frank Corva is Bitcoin Magazine's White House correspondent.CORVA: I think bitcoin is no longer a countercultural thing. It is now just a part of the mainstream. It's part of the political process. The vibe has shifted.BERNSTEIN: It began even before Donald Trump took office when he named a crypto czar, a partner at a Silicon Valley venture capital firm named David Sacks. At the conference, Sacks brought a list of accomplishments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID SACKS: So much that's happened in the last hundred days - I have to pull out my cheat sheet. I hope that's OK.BERNSTEIN: First item.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SACKS: On the president's first full day in office, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah.SACKS: So that was...BERNSTEIN: Ulbricht was given two life sentences for operating Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that ran on bitcoin.MARRITZ: Trump also created a strategic bitcoin reserve, like a pile of gold, but bitcoin. His law enforcement agencies called off crypto investigations and lawsuits. Vice President JD Vance's message from the stage.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JD VANCE: We reject the Biden administration's legacy of death by a thousand enforcement actions.MARRITZ: The crypto industry is feeling good. Paolo Ardoino is the CEO of Tether, which makes a kind of crypto called stablecoin.PAOLO ARDOINO: We have some good conversations with the Trump administration. We have good conversations with lawmakers.BERNSTEIN: Trump's actions as president have helped his family business. In the past year, new Trump crypto ventures have added a billion dollars to Trump's net worth, Forbes says. During the conference, Donald Trump Jr. said even Trump's media company is raising millions to buy bitcoin.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP JR: That's a pretty big deal, right? I mean, you know, there's not a lot of people that have done something that big or shown that level of commitment.BERNSTEIN: The White House told us, President Trump's, quote, "assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."MARRITZ: Take all of this in contrast to the previous administration's relationship to crypto. Amanda Fischer worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Biden. She stressed that crypto represented about 20% of all complaints to the SEC, that regular people are being taken in by hype.AMANDA FISCHER: I think that there are a lot of people who rightly feel like work doesn't necessarily translate to wealth these days, and there is a ton of marketing around the cryptocurrency industry that promises people that if they're just clever enough, they can be rich.BERNSTEIN: Just this week, Trump's media company told the SEC it plans to set up a new consumer-facing crypto investment fund. This came just after Trump's SEC loosened rules for just that kind of fund.MARRITZ: Ilya Marritz.BERNSTEIN: Andrea Bernstein, NPR News.

Oops, something went wrong

Financial services company Robinhood (HOOD) has rolled out an expansion of its crypto and investing services, offering European users access to tokenised US stocks and giving Americans the chance to earn rewards by staking cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) and solana (SOL-USD).

The move marks a pivotal moment for the fintech company as it looks to merge the fast-evolving world of blockchain with traditional finance.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Robinhood crypto senior vice president and general manager Johann Kerbrat explained how the platform is leveraging blockchain technology to overhaul outdated systems and offer investors something different.

At the heart of Robinhood's European expansion is the launch of tokenised US stocks and ETFs, digital representations of real equities issued on the blockchain.

These “stock tokens” allow users across 31 European countries to trade more than 200 US stocks and ETFs, including heavyweights like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA), without paying any commission or spread fees. Robinhood applies a 0.10% foreign exchange fee.

"Right now, what we're launching in Europe is that EU customer will have access to 200 plus US stocks and ETF tokens, and the stock token holder will also be able to receive dividends directly into their app," Kerbrat said.

It means European users can gain exposure to the US market, something that can be expensive due to regulatory barriers and foreign exchange costs, while also receiving dividend payouts like traditional shareholders.

While the tokenised shares are synthetic representations backed by financial instruments, the user experience is nearly indistinguishable from trading traditional stocks. "It's less about trading a crypto product. It's more about using the benefit of crypto to get the improvement through it," Kerbrat said.

Tokenisation, converting real-world assets into digital tokens that live on a blockchain, has been hailed as one of crypto's most promising innovations. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink recently called it the “next generation for markets.”

For Robinhood, tokenising stocks isn't just about tech hype, it's about efficiency gains.

"We've been vocal about the fact that we believe the traditional finance system is a bit outdated, and doesn't match how people are using products now, nowadays," said Kerbrat. "We think the blockchain will actually improve efficiencies, reduce time to wait, reduce fees and cost for the customer."

The benefits? Lower fees, faster settlement times, and eventually, the potential for 24/7 trading. "You can imagine a world where people can self custody the asset, they can trade them on defi, 24/7," Kerbrat said. "So I think for us it's a it's a key moment in the financial system, and we'll be able to really build on top of that."

To support this new tokenised financial world, Robinhood is building its own Layer 2 blockchain, powered by Ethereum and based on the Arbitrum stack.

Layer 2 blockchains are built on top of existing blockchain networks like Ethereum to boost speed and scalability while lowering transaction costs.

Robinhood's in-house chain will eventually become the infrastructure behind its tokenised stock platform, enabling features like 24/7 trading, seamless bridging of assets, and self-custody for users.

"We're already excited to build our own Robinhood layer two blockchain. It's going to be built on top of Ethereum using the Arbitrum stack," said Kerbrat. "We want the blockchain to be optimised for tokenised real world assets, you know, to have built in support for 24/7 trading, bridging, self custody, all the things that really matter for customers."

While European users get access to tokenised stocks and crypto perpetual futures, American users are now being offered something long-requested — crypto staking. Starting with ethereum and solana, US customers can now stake their assets directly in the Robinhood app.

Staking allows users to contribute to the security of blockchain networks in return for earning rewards, sort of like earning interest for locking up your crypto.

"So really, what it means for staking is you are contributing to the network, not just to trade the assets, but also to help secure the network, and all the assets that are staked are used to validate the transaction," said Kerbrat.

"When the customer will be staking their assets, they will be able to see directly the reward estimated for the period of time. And on a regular basis, they will receive a new reward, and they can decide to invest with it, or just to stake them again."

The move comes as discussions heat up around whether ethereum staking should be allowed in spot ETFs. While regulators debate, Robinhood is already rolling out staking in a user-friendly interface designed to demystify the process.

Robinhood is also offering crypto perpetual futures to users in the EU, a first for the company. This new feature lets experienced traders make bigger bets on the price of cryptocurrencies by using leverage, meaning they can trade with more money than they actually have.

These trades are handled through the Bitstamp exchange, but Robinhood has designed a user-friendly interface to make things like leverage and risk easier to manage.

Kerbrat emphasised that despite the blockchain complexity behind the scenes, the interface remains clean and accessible for both tokenised stocks and traditionally traded equities.

"When you're going to use the app, if you're a user from New York or a user from the EU, it will really look similar, except that on the EU app, it will tell you at the top that this is a token, and if you tap on it will give you all the explanation about the differences, but the actual trading experience will be really similar," Kerbrat said.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Plans Probe into Geoengineering

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has said she will hold a hearing on geoengineering as conspiracy theories have swirled around cloud seeding after the recent floods in Texas

CLIMATEWIRE | On a day when the EPA administrator elevated concerns about weather modification as his agency downplayed those worries, an outspoken House Republican said she would hold a hearing on the issue.

In a statement provided to POLITICO's E&E News, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she plans to use her perch as a subcommittee chair on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel to investigate geoengineering, a nascent field in which chemicals are dispersed in the air to lower temperatures.

“Let's be clear: Weather modification is no longer a ‘conspiracy theory.' It's real, it's happening, and the American people deserve a voice,” said Greene, who in the past has peddled fringe theories.

Such baseless assertions have been widespread in the aftermath of the deadly floods in Texas this past weekend, including that cloud seeding may have played a role in the disaster.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin released a video empathizing with people who have questions about contrails and geoengineering, which have been fodder for online conspiracists. He did not mention the floods in Texas; the new EPA webpages mostly debunked "chemtrails" and other such theories.

In her statement Thursday, Greene said that she planned to hold a hearing of her DOGE subcommittee "on this critical issue and advancing my legislation to make it a felony to inject, release, or disperse chemicals into the atmosphere for the purpose of altering weather, climate, temperature, or sunlight.”

Moreover, this past weekend, Greene posted on social media that she planned to introduce legislation to bar such weather-changing technology. She said she was heartened by EPA's actions.

In his video Thursday, Zeldin said, “To anyone who's ever looked up to the streaks in the sky and asked, 'What the heck is going on?' or seen headlines about private actors and even governments looking to blot out the sun in the name of stopping global warming, we've endeavored to answer all of your questions at the links on your screen."

He added, “In fact, EPA shares many of the same concerns when it comes to potential threats to human health and the environment, especially from solar geoengineering activities.”

Democratic lawmakers mocked the EPA administrator for discussing contrails — the benign condensation often seen from aircraft. One called him “a full-on kook.”

In her statement, Greene said she spoke with Zeldin on Thursday morning. “I'm glad weather modification and geoengineering are finally getting the attention and transparency they deserve, and I'm greatly appreciative to the Trump administration for it,” the lawmaker said.

Some have suspected cloud seeding could have caused the drenching rain in Kerr County, Texas, leading to flooding that killed more than 100 people.

That has been deemed impossible by experts, The Washington Post reported, and dismissed by elected officials, including Republicans in the state.

“Let's put an end to the conspiracy theories and stop blaming others,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement Wednesday.

We're already seeing substantial savings on some seriously iconic Lego sets. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

You're never too old for Lego (unless, of course, you're 99+), but as an adult hobby, it can be an expensive one, especially when you're dealing with some of the legacy lines. Prime Day is a great time to stock up on some of the more highly sought-after sets on Amazon, and we typically find some pretty killer deals during the big event. This year, though, we're spotting unprecedented savings of up to nearly 60 percent on some of the most iconic Star Wars, Nintendo, Marvel, and DC sets. 

The problem with shopping Lego during Prime Day is that these items often sell out, so if you see a deal you want to shop, don't wait until the last minute. Plus, you can lock in that Millennium Falcon set you've had your eye on for months now without worrying about it going out of stock. 

We rounded up the best Prime Day Lego deals to help you beat the Prime Day rush—all while keeping your wallet happy in the process.

The Millennium Falcon is undoubtedly the most recognizable spacecraft in Star Wars—and possibly the most famous fictional ship of all time. This is truly a grail piece for Star Wars collectors, whether you're an avid Lego fan or not. The authentically detailed piece is not only 20 percent off, but it is, in all likelihood, the most affordable replica Falcon piece you'll find, period. It also comes with a Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary Brick you can display alongside the toy. (Side note: 25 years of Star Wars Lego? I'm getting old.)

We know our way around cars here at Popular Mechanics—after all, it's right in our name. We also know a thing or two about Lego cars, and this Technic Lamborghini Huracán is a fantastic adult set that's now at a great price.

Currently 30 percent off, this faux Lamborghini makes a great display piece for hobbyist collectors. Featuring a stunning, realistic design with authentic features, the Lamborghini model is a must-have for car enthusiasts of all ages.

Batfans will appreciate this one—a replica Tumbler Batmobile from the Nolan-era films, along with Christian Bale's Batman facing off with the Joker and Harvey Dent himself. The minifigures are surprisingly detailed, and anyone who is a fan of the Lego Batman movies knows this is a pretty awesome fusion between Nolan's gritty films and the campy Lego adventures of Will Arnett's Caped Crusader.

This other Nintendo-licensed set is from the popular Animal Crossing series. This one's a replica of K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza, featuring in-game characters K.K., Isabelle, and Audie minifigures, a model of Resident Services, a café, and a drivable camper car toy. The 550-piece set might be the best deal of the bunch, with close to 40 percent savings just ahead of Prime Day.

This Clone Wars Ahsoka spaceship set comes with some pretty awesome mini figures, including Ahsoka Tano herself,  Anakin Skywalker, and an R7-A7 Lego droid figure. This is a great option for teens and adults alike, featuring an opening cockpit for the figures, a custom space for R7-A7, fully adjustable wings, dual spring-loaded shooters, and additional lightsaber storage. 

Marvel fans, we have a doozy of a set here. If you're a fan of the Avengers films and want to channel your inner Thanos, this Infinity Gauntlet replica set is the perfect early Prime Day steal. 

Complete with a sturdy stand and a descriptive tablet for your collection, this impressive homage to the MCU is a must-have piece. And with over 2o percent in savings, it's a pretty fantastic deal, too. 

Here we have another addition to the list from Disney, and you'll certainly be singing "Hakuna Matata" after nabbing this Simba replica for a whopping 50 percent off.  Not sure if I've ever seen a Disney-licensed Lego set this heavily discounted before, so you're going to want to jump on this before it's sold out.

While not every “live-action” Disney remake has received rave reviews, its most recent rehash, Lilo and Stitch, has garnered some pretty solid marks across the board. Stich has become an iconic Disney character, and there's no better way to celebrate the pesky alien than a good old-fashioned replica Lego set. 

In this case, Stitch is enjoying some ice cream while donning a fun Hawaiian shirt, which perfectly encapsulates his personality. This makes for a great display piece for Disney fans of all ages, especially at this price point.

This is a fun one. You can build your own little home and house a mini-family in this creative, interactive, and fun set. It can be built in three different ways, including a three-story canal house with an attic office, an art gallery and café, or a lakeside holiday home. You're essentially getting three sets for the price of one here, and it's now 40 percent off, to boot.

For those passionate about nature, this three-piece Insect collector's set is a more than viable option. Now 20 percent off, the popular set features a stunning blue morpho butterfly, an impressive Chinese mantis replica, and a highly detailed Hercules beetle. They're all life-size and fully posable and feature each insect's distinct natural habitat. It's a fun piece to add to the collection.

R2-D2 is arguably the most iconic droid of the Star Wars series (although his cohort C-3P0 might have something to say about that). Either way, this is an impressive piece on sale for a great price. The droid series is amongst the most popular Star Wars sets Lego has to offer, and this is pretty much the set's golden goose, so to speak. Getting it at a discount is just icing on the cake.

You can kill two birds with one stone here—grab a piece of iconic art and take your time to build it out from scratch? Actually, make it killing three birds—you're also getting a fantastic pre-Prime Day deal here on a set that doesn't go on sale all that often. This 3D piece of Japanese artwork makes a great gift and represents an excellent display option. The 1,810-piece set comes complete with six canvas bases, two hangers, and a decorative tile with artist Hokusai's own signature.

This is a two-for-one auto special—two very different Mercedes vehicles in one all-encompassing set. This toy also features two Lego mini figure “drivers,” in addition to a pair of highly detailed collectible cars. Once these things are built, they make for a great display piece for your room or office space.

Anakin Skywalker made his mark during the legendary podrace in Episode I, so it's no surprise that a dynamic diorama was created in honor of the fictional race. This is a fantastic “adult” toy, so to speak, and it comes complete with a Star Wars 25th anniversary brick and a plaque featuring an iconic Qui-Gon Jinn quotation. And for over 30 percent off retail, you really can't go wrong here. 

If you want a similarly awesome piece of replica French architecture, consider this recently marked-down set of the Paris skyline, featuring famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, and more. The set is scaled accurately and, as a little kicker, comes with a complimentary booklet containing all types of information about the designer, architecture, and history of every structure. 

If you want to skip the building and go straight to the collecting, you can always opt for some BrickHeadz. This Star Wars collectors' piece features the main characters from the first prequel—Jar Jar Binks, Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Captain Panaka, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul, as well as some authentic accessories. Enjoy the spoils of Legos without having to, well, do anything. Other than buy them at a discount, of course.

Nintendo has been all over the map recently, thanks largely in part to the release of the much-anticipated and highly sought-after Switch 2. If you haven't been able to get your hands on one, well, at least you'll be able to immerse yourself in the world of Mario and co. with this Piranha Plant Lego set. 

Now 20 percent off, this buildable plant is iconic and represents the treachery our favorite fictional plumber faces in nearly every game. The 540-piece set is challenging enough for stimulation, yet easy enough for casual relaxation—the best of both worlds.

We've found the first five Busy Beaver numbers, but the sixth may be bigger than the number of atoms in the universe.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For most people, the term “busy beaver” brings to mind a tireless worker or (for the biologists among us) an absolutely vital ecosystem engineer. However, for mathematicians, “busy beaver” takes on a similar-yet-unique meaning. True to the moniker's original intent, the idea represents a lot of work, but it's work pointed at a question. As computer scientists Christopher Moore puts it in a video for Quanta Magazine, “What's the longest, most-complicated thing [a computer] can do, and then stop?” In other words, what's the longest function a computer can run that does not just run forever, stuck in an infinite loop?

The solution to this question is called the Busy Beaver number, or BB(n), where the n represents a number of instructions called ‘states' that a set of computers—specifically, a type of simple computer called a Turing machine—has to follow. Each state produces a certain number of programs, and each program gets its own Turing machine, so things get complicated fast. BB(1), which has just 1 state, necessitates the use of 25 Turing machines. For decades, many mathematicians believed that solving the Busy Beaver number to four states was the upper limit, but a group of experts managed to confirmed the BB(5) solution in 2024 (on Discord, of all places). Now, participants in that same Busy Beaver Challenge are learning fascinating truths about the next frontier—BB(6)—and how it just might represent the very edge of mathematics, according to a new report by New Scientist.

First, a brief explanation. The aforementioned BB(1), which is the simplest version of the BB(n) problem, uses just one set of rules and produces only two outcomes—infinitely moving across the tape, or stopping at the first number. Because 1 is the most amount of steps that any of the 25 Turing machines of BB(1) will complete before finishing its program (known as halting), the answer to BB(1) is 1. As the number of states increases, so do the steps and the number of Turing machines needed to run the programs, meaning that each subsequent BB(n) is exponentially more taxing to solve. BB(2) and  BB(3) are 6 and 21 respectively, but BB(4) is 107 and takes seven billion different Turing machines to solve. Granted, many of these machines continue on indefinitely and can be discarded, but many do not. 

The Busy Beaver number was first formulated by the Hungarian mathematician Tiber Radó in 1962, and 12 years passed before computer scientist Allen Brady determined that BB(4) runs for 107 steps before halting. For decades, this seemed like the absolute limit of what was discernible, but then mathematicians solved BB(5) in 2024 after sifting through 17 trillion (with a t) possible Turing machines. The answer? An astounding 47,176,870 steps. Quanta Magazine has an excellent explainer about how this was achieved.

But finally solving BB(5) presented the next obvious question: What about BB(6)? Of course, adding just one more rule makes the problem beyond super exponentially harder, as BB(6) is estimated to require 60 quadrillion Turing machines. 

“The Busy Beaver problem gives you a very concrete scale for pondering the frontier of mathematical knowledge,” computer scientist Tristan Stérin, who helped start the Busy Beaver Challenge in 2022, told New Scientist. 

In a new post, anonymous user “mxdys”—who was instrumental in finally confirming BB(5)—wrote that the answer to BB(6) is likely so unfathomably large that the number itself likely needs its own explanation, as it's likely too big to describe via exponentiation. Instead, it relies on tetration (written as, say, yx, as opposed to exponentiation's xy) in which where the exponent is also iterated, creating a tower of exponents. As Scott Aaronson, an American computer scientist who helped define BB(5), notes on his blog, that means 1510 can be thought of as “10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15 times.”

As mxdys notes, BB(6) is at least 2 tetrated to the 2 tetrated to the 2 tetrated to the 9. One mathematician speaking with New Scientist said that it's likely that the number of all atoms in the universe would look “puny” by comparison. While these large numbers boggle the mind, they also tell mathematicians about the limitations of the foundation of modern mathematics—known as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC)—as well slippery mathematical concepts like the Collatz conjecture. 

It's unlikely that mathematicians will ever solve BB(6), but if the Busy Beaver Challenge is any evidence, that fact likely won't stop them from trying.

The competition between these two mega-retailers is heating up for discounts on one of our favorite tool brands. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

We regularly spot plenty of our favorite tested tool brands on sale—but Milwaukee isn't one of them. So when we find deals on the iconic red and black cordless drills, reciprocating saws, and impact drivers, we pay attention. 

Unless you're living under a rock, no doubt you've been busy shopping Amazon Prime Day, which kicked off earlier this week and runs through tomorrow, Friday, July 11. We're doing the same—particularly for DeWalt tools. But when we did a side-by-side comparison of sales on Milwaukee tools, it turns out that Walmart had the deeper discounts, with savings up to 50 percent off. 

For example, our favorite cordless angle grinder is currently 44 percent off at Walmart (compared to a mere 21 percent off on Amazon). The angle grinder's max speed is a solid 5,800 rpm, and the tool features an impressive lineup of safety features, including overload protection and an electronic clutch. 

"It also comes equipped with a removable side handle that gives you tremendous control over the tool to keep you safe and your cuts accurate and straight," says Tony Carrick, one of our tool experts in his favorite Milwaukee tools story.   

Milwaukee's two-pack of high-output batteries is another great deal, currently an impressive 50 percent off—a savings of $150—at Walmart. These 18-volt batteries are compatible with over 150 M18 cordless tools and have a 6-amp-hour capacity. They also come with overload protection and a three-year warranty. 

And finally, you can't beat 40 percent off this mid-torque impact wrench at Walmart. "It produces 550 foot-pounds of fastening and 650 foot-pounds of loosening torque, yet it measures just six inches long and weighs only five pounds when loaded with the recommended 5Ah battery,"  Carrick says. 

If you need more tools to round out your arsenal, check out these other discounts on Milwaukee tools we've vetted.  

At just 4.9 inches long, this is the most compact tool in its class. It also has customizable speed and torque settings. 

This kit comes with an included battery pack. That makes it a better value than the Amazon kit, which lacks one. 

"This driver puts out tremendous power with a max torque of 2,000 inch-pounds and runs at a top speed of 3,900 RPM," says Carrick.

The hammer drill is only 6.9 inches in length to get into tight spaces, and the impact driver's trigger is ultra-responsive for precise fastening.

Ride around town at a major discount. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The summer is midway through, which means that Amazon Prime Day is finally here. Rolling into its final day, the shopping event offers some of the best discounts on a wide range of items, including tools and TVs.  Some of the biggest discounts are on typically expensive items, including electric scooters.

Electric scooters are great both as a fun way to get around town and as a portable everyday commuter for work or school. Scooters with long-range batteries and sturdy suspension can take your short jaunt into long rides, both on the roads and even on light trails and dirt paths. Throughout Prime Day, electric scooters from top-rated brands that we've reviewed and tested are on sale for hundreds off. In fact, some of these models are at their lowest price of the year. 

Many of these scooters are likely to sell out before the final day ends, so make sure to check out all of our top picks before it's too late. With items like scooters, we recommend sticking with brands you know and trust. Unfamiliar brands or deals that are too good to be true might be exactly that. With that in mind, check out our picks for the best electric scooter deals below.

This electric scooter from Gotrax doesn't have quite the same range as more expensive models, but the quality motor still boasts 12 miles on a single charge for a fraction of the price. The honeycomb-style solid tires are designed to resist punctures and will never go flat. The scooter also features an LED that displays the speed and battery level.

While many electric scooters rely solely on a front brake, the V40 from Navee comes with a dual-braking system that slows down both tires simultaneously. This helps you reduce speed more safely and lowers the chance of toppling over or falling on a hard brake. The scooter also has a speedy top range of 20 miles per hour.

If you want a high-end model while it's on sale, consider the KQi Air electric scooter. Made of carbon fiber, the scooter is relatively lightweight, considering the powerful motor that runs for up to 31 miles on a single charge. Alongside this, the scooter also features a halo front light, a rear light, turn signals, and an ambient light on the board itself.

This scooter from Gotrax comes with both a metal basket and a cushioned seat. This makes it ideal for running errands and picking up groceries without using your car. The seat also keeps you off your feet after hours of shopping.

The ES4 from Segway is a sound middle ground option for city commuters and casual riders. The scooter reaches a top speed of 18 miles per hour and has a maximum range of 25 miles. It comes with a kickstand for easy upright storage and features turn signals on both the handlebars and the rear for improved visibility at night. The scooter is currently at the lowest price it's been at in over a year. 

This popular and affordable model from Segway has a range of just 16 miles but comes with a speedy motor that makes for perfect fun riding around town. This scooter also features front and rear lights for use at night. Furthermore, the Ninebot E2 is water resistant for comfortable riding in light rain or through puddles.

If you plan to use your scooter for longer-range rides, this Max G2 is a perfect choice. The scooter boasts a range of up to 43 miles and can reach speeds of up to 22 miles per hour. Despite the long range, the scooter charges up in just five hours.

Ageing is an important risk factor for cancer incidence and augments cancer progression. A shared hallmark of ageing and cancer is metabolic reprogramming, which has been suggested to be not only a cause but also a consequence of ageing. Strikingly, many age-regulated pathways are known to also drive tumour progression, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming connects ageing and tumorigenic processes and shapes whether malignant phenotypes manifest, thrive and evolve. With the rising average age of the world population, understanding how age-related changes in the body influence cancer progression is of paramount importance. In this Perspective, we discuss the metabolic changes that occur with ageing and their potential links with tumour initiation and progression and the development of metastatic disease. Finally, we discuss age-induced metabolic divergences that cause racial disparities and their consequences for the tumorigenic process.

Don't let these discounts fly away. Shop drones during Prime Day for close to half off.

With warm weather and blue skies looking like they are here to stay (for a few months, at least), nab yourself a drone you can fly freely in the open air. Drones are great gadgets for both the casual flier who wants to capture a few fun videos and zoom around to their heart's content, as well as for videographers and filmmakers looking to capture aerial shots or high-speed action.

Drones, especially ones with strong wind resistance, high-quality cameras, and agile maneuverability, can be quite expensive. Even more affordable models cost a few hundred dollars. During the final hours of Prime Day, you can grab a top-rated drone for hundreds of dollars off the original price.

The longest Prime Day ever is coming to a close today, making it your last chance to grab some of these drone deals. Many of these drones are at the best price we've seen all year, so don't miss out on your chance to get a model you like before it reverts to full price. The drone sales listed below aren't just the lowest prices we found on Amazon. All options we add to this list are from brands we know and trust. In fact, some of the drones are ones we've tested out and reviewed ourselves.

Shop Prime Day Deals

Choosing the right drone is more than just about the sale price. We found drones that cater to needs across the spectrum, from beginners to nearly professional-grade.

DJI's Air 3 might be a little more expensive than other deals on this list, but the brand is no joke. DJI almost single-handedly swept our list of the best drones due to the consistently high quality of its cameras, motors, and controls. The Air 3 is definitely no exception, with this particular model actually coming with two different camera lenses. The medium tele camera is great for traditional shots and high-resolution close-ups, while the wide-angle camera captures massive landscapes and sweeping shots from a high vantage point. The drone is also capable of taking off at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters, allowing you to take it on hikes, through hills, and even on snowy slopes. During Prime Day, the Air 3 is over $150 off.

If you're looking for a beginner-focused model, we like the Ruko U11 Mini. This already more affordable model is on sale for nearly 50 percent off its original price, further reducing the cost. This model also weighs less than 250 grams, which means you don't need any FAA registration to operate it. The purchase also comes with a remote control, cables to connect your phone to the remote control, extra propellers, three rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case. 

If you're less interested in flying it around on your own and just want quality video, the HoverAir X1 offers numerous easy-to-use video and flying modes that help you record solid footage without requiring top-notch aerial control. We loved testing this one out and got tons of footage we loved, despite our relative novice flying skills. All we had to do was press which mode we wanted, and the drone would orbit us, follow us, or even zoom out. While the deal isn't directly listed on the page, the drone is currently on sale for 22 percent off, with the discount applied at checkout. 

Also on sale are quality options from both Potensic and Holy Stone, which both have models we recommend on our overall best drones list and best drones for beginners list, respectively. The deals for each are also well worth considering, with the Holy Stone on sale for $70 off.

A mystery interstellar object discovered last week is likely to be the oldest comet ever seen - possibly predating our solar system by more than three billion years, researchers say.

The "water ice-rich" visitor, named 3I/ATLAS, is only the third known object from beyond our solar system ever spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood and the first to reach us from a completely different region of our Milky Way galaxy.

It could be more than seven billion years old, according to University of Oxford astronomer Matthew Hopkins - who is discussing his findings at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham - and may be the most remarkable interstellar visitor yet.

Unlike the previous two objects to enter our solar system from elsewhere in the cosmos, 3I/ATLAS appears to be travelling on a steep path through the galaxy, with a trajectory that suggests it originated from the Milky Way's 'thick disk' - a population of ancient stars orbiting above and below the thin plane where the Sun and most stars reside.

"All non-interstellar comets such as Halley's comet formed with our solar system, so are up to 4.5 billion years old," Hopkins said.

"But interstellar visitors have the potential to be far older, and of those known about so far our statistical method suggests that 3I/ATLAS is very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen."

The object was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, when it was about 670 million km from the Sun.

Hopkins' research predicts that, because 3I/ATLAS likely formed around an old, thick-disk star, it should be rich in water ice.

"This is an object from a part of the galaxy we've never seen up close before," said Professor Chris Lintott, co-author of the study and presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night.

"We think there's a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system, and that it's been drifting through interstellar space ever since."

As it approaches the Sun, sunlight will heat 3I/ATLAS's surface and trigger cometary activity, or the outgassing of vapour and dust that creates a glowing coma and tail.

Early observations already suggest the comet is active, and possibly larger than either of its interstellar predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua (spotted in 2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).

If confirmed, this could have implications for how many similar objects future telescopes, such as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are likely to detect. It may also provide clues about the role that ancient interstellar comets play in seeding star and planet formation across the galaxy.

"We're in an exciting time: 3I is already showing signs of activity. The gases that may be seen in the future as 3I is heated by the Sun will test our model," said co-author Dr Michele Bannister, of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

"Some of the biggest telescopes in the world are already observing this new interstellar object - one of them may be able to find out!"

The discovery of 3I caught the team by the surprise. It happened as they were gearing up for the beginning of survey operations with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which their model predicts will discover between 5 and 50 interstellar objects.

"The solar system science community was already excited about the potential discoveries Rubin will make in the next 10 years, including an unprecedented number of interstellar objects," said co-researcher Dr Rosemary Dorsey, of the University of Helsinki.

"The discovery of 3I suggests that prospects for Rubin may now be more optimistic; we may find about 50 objects, of which some would be similar in size to 3I. This week's news, especially just after the Rubin First Look images, makes the upcoming start of observations all the more exciting."

The team's findings come from applying a model developed during Hopkins' doctoral research, which simulates the properties of interstellar objects based on their orbits and likely stellar origins.

Just a week before the comet's discovery, Hopkins had defended his thesis, and when 3I/ATLAS was announced, he was set to go on holiday. Instead, he found himself comparing real-time data to his predictions.

"Rather than the quiet Wednesday I had planned, I woke up to messages like '3I!!!!!!!!!!'," said Hopkins. "It's a fantastic opportunity to test our model on something brand new and possibly ancient."

The researchers' model, dubbed the Ōtautahi-Oxford Model, marks the first real-time application of predictive modelling to an interstellar comet.

For those keen to catch a glimpse of 3I/ATLAS, it should be visible through a reasonably-sized amateur telescope in late 2025 and early 2026.

Prime Day is about more than just essentials. Tech and gaming items like laptops, TVs, and even consoles accessories for the Nintendo Switch are on sale for hundreds of dollars off. The massive four-day shopping event is starting to wind down and officially ends tomorrow taking many of the best deals on the site with it. 

Arcade machines might bring back some memories from the '80s and '90s, but the models you can buy today offer a lot more than just a nostalgia trip. These come with digital displays that are more energy efficient and offer clearer picture quality than the CRT screens you remember. Furthermore, these arcade machines typically come with tons of pre-programmed games, so just one of them will have dozens of games at least.

Throughout the shopping event, arcade machines of all types are on sale for hundreds of dollars off. While most of the deals you see won't jump off the page, they are almost across the board, the best prices that the machines have been listed at all year including a few at the lowest prices ever. 

This includes classic machines you'd recognize from your childhood as well as tabletop or cocktail table models that fit easily in a modern home. Prime Day lasts for four days this year, instead of the usual two, so be sure to check this list regularly throughout the week to see if prices change. 

Shop Prime Day Deals

Editor's Note, June 11, 2025: Prime Day is in its final stretch today with many items we previously listed now out of stock. That said, there are still tons of arcade machines currently on sale. This includes the Golden Tee 3D, which you can nab now for 50 bucks off. Furthermore, this tabletop machine from Doc and Pies is also on sale for $50 off—officially its lowest price ever since being listed on Amazon.

Two of the biggest brands of modern arcade machines, Arcade 1Up and Doc and Pies Arcade Factory, both have multiple models on sale. The best deal Arcade 1Up is currently offering is on its Infinity Game Table, which is currently 50 dollars off. The game board works for board games and up close, touch-screen action. Unlike other arcade machines, this one doesn't have a massive body to haul around; it's just the table and board. What we like about this option, besides the big discount, is the volume of games it includes. You can play over 100 different games on just one device.  

Beyond the major arcade machine brands, WYGaming has one of the best deals we found with their arcade game console currently on sale for over 30 percent off. The device features two sets of buttons and joysticks for engaging head-to-head action. With over 20,000 pre-loaded games, including numerous fighting games, you can have a ton of fun against a friend or by yourself. The screen itself is HD and features a 1080p resolution for crystal-clear gaming, regardless of the arcade game you choose.

These Prime Day deals won't last, especially given the limited stock on many of the large machines, so take advantage of them on this final day so you can relive your button-mashing days without the pockets full of quarters.

A new genetic treatment seems to be working wonders, including restoring nearly all hearing to a seven-year-old patient after just four months.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The world is filled with noises that can lead to permanent hearing loss. Just go to a rock concert for a few hours, and the resulting days-long tinnitus is enough anatomical evidence to prove the point. However, the majority of cases regarding hearing loss in children and adults comes from genetics, an unfortunate mutation somewhere in a person's genome that interrupts the otherwise remarkable process of turning sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by our brain (aka auditory transduction). 

With the arrival of gene-editing tools, such as CRISPR, scientists have begun making strides to make hereditary deafness a thing of the past. However, as you might expect, achieving such a medical miracle isn't easy. More than 120 genes have been linked to hearing loss, so isn't like you can just flip a switch and fix the problem. Previous studies have analyzed different genes, including TMC1, Atp2b2, and others, typically on mouse models with positive results. 

But a new study, analyzing the gene OTOF, tested its gene therapy on ten patients between the ages of 1 to 24 at five hospitals throughout China. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, detailed how all ten patients experienced vast hearing improvement with perceptible sound increasing from 106 decibels (which is about the equivalent of a car horn at close range) to 52 decibels—below the range of a typical conversation. 

“This is a huge step forward in the genetic treatment of deafness, one that can be life-changing for children and adults,” Karolinska Institutet in Sweden's Maoli Duan, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Smaller studies in China have previously shown positive results in children, but this is the first time that the method has been tested in teenagers and adults, too.”

Researchers delivered the treatment via a synthetic adeno-associated virus, or AAV, a well-known vector for gene therapy as it can deliver DNA directly to targeted cells. The ability to generate these AAV particles so that they contain no viral genes but only DNA required for therapeutic intervention has made them one of the safest methods for gene therapies. Scientists then injected a functional version of the OTOF gene in the “round window,” a membrane at the base of the cochlea. 

After a month of treatment, the patients were already showing signs of improvement, and six months later, they reported even greater auditory gains. While this was one of the first treatments on teenagers and adults—and all ages showed signs of improvement—the biggest gains were between the ages of five and eight. According to the researchers, one seven-year-old girl showed the greatest transformation, recovering nearly all of her hearing and holding daily conversations with her mother just four months later. 

Although promising for this particular genetic mutation, scientists have a long way to go before they can confidently reverse genetic hearing loss across the board. In fact, targeting OTOF may have been one of the easier challenges when it comes to genetic therapies for hearing loss. 

“OTOF is just the beginning,” Duan said in a press statement. “We and other researchers are expanding our work to other, more common genes that cause deafness, such as GJB2 and TMC1. These are more complicated to treat, but animal studies have so far returned promising results. We are confident that patients with different kinds of genetic deafness will one day be able to receive treatment.”

Researchers are making ever more sophisticated mini organs in the lab — and now they can grow their own blood vessels. The structures, which mimic the heart, liver, lungs and gut, are some of the most complex models of human development ever made, and contain cell populations and structures not seen before in these models.

“Vascularization of organoids is a hot topic,” says Ryuji Morizane, a nephrologist and stem-cell biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Miniature 3D cell structures, called organoids, have been used for many years to test drugs and study disease and development. But most organoids lack the vessels that transport blood, nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, which has restricted their size, function and ability to mature. Kidneys, for example, need vessels to filter blood and produce urine, and lungs need them to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Last month in Science1 and Cell2, two separate teams reported creating vascularized organoids using a new approach that grows the organoids with vessels from their earliest stages. Starting with pluripotent stem cells, which can transform into almost any cell type in the body, the researchers coaxed the cells to form vessels as they were making the other organ tissue.

The models “really show the power of this strategy”, says Oscar Abilez, a stem-cell biologist at Stanford University in California, who co-authored the heart and liver paper1.

The first attempts to vascularize organoids involved growing blood vessel tissue in a dish and then combining it with other cell types to form ‘assembloids'3. But these models were still limited in their ability to mimic the structure and maturity of real organs.

Researchers stumbled on the new approach by accident. While growing epithelial cells, which form the outer lining of some organs and tissues, several research teams, including a group at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, reported4 that their organoids also spontaneously formed non-epithelial cells of a type that lines the blood vessels. These cells are typically seen as ‘contaminants' to get rid of, but the Ann Arbor group tried to amplify that contamination in intestinal organoids.

Capitalizing on the surprise find by other groups, Yifei Miao, a stem-cell biologist at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing and his colleagues decided to see whether they could control the simultaneous growth of both types of cell — epithelial and blood-vessel cells — in the same dish, starting with lung and gut organoids.

But in early development, epithelial and blood-vessel cells require entirely opposing molecular triggers to grow. “You can either save one or the other one, so naturally they couldn't grow together,” says Miao. He and his colleagues found a way to time the dosing of a cocktail of molecules to trigger the formation of both types of tissue at once from stem cells2.

Global surface temperatures since the 1980s, when near-global satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) measurements became available, are presumed to be well known. Satellite-era warming trends in four commonly used global (land and ocean) temperature reconstructions agree closely, yet whether SST datasets also agree is unclear. Here we show that trends in four widely used SST datasets show first-order differences, with 1982–2024 60° S to 60° N trends ranging from 0.108 to 0.184 °C per decade. These large discrepancies are perplexing given the agreement between global temperature datasets and the fact that 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by ocean, but are legible upon recognizing that global temperature datasets use two SST fields whose trends agree more closely than those of the four SST datasets. Considering the trend uncertainty across SST datasets widens the range of plausible global temperature trends and impacts interpretations of recent record global temperatures, with implications for observational and model-based climate studies.

A research team led by Eske Willerslev, professor at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge, has recovered ancient DNA from 214 known human pathogens in prehistoric humans from Eurasia.

The study shows, among other things, that the earliest known evidence of zoonotic diseases -- illnesses transmitted from animals to humans, like COVID in recent times -- dates back to around 6,500 years ago, with such diseases becoming more widespread approximately 5,000 years ago. It is the largest study to date on the history of infectious diseases and has just been published in the scientific journal Nature.

The researchers analyzed DNA from over 1,300 prehistoric individuals, some up to 37,000 years old. The ancient bones and teeth have provided a unique insight into the development of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

The results suggest that humans' close cohabitation with domesticated animals -- and large-scale migrations of pastoralist from the Pontic Steppe -- played a decisive role in the spread of these diseases.

"We've long suspected that the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease -- now DNA shows us that it happened at least 6,500 years ago," says Professor Eske Willerslev. "These infections didn't just cause illness -- they may have contributed to population collapse, migration, and genetic adaptation."

World's oldest trace of the plague

In the study, the researchers found 214 pathogens. A remarkable finding is the world's oldest genetic trace of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, identified in a 5,500-year-old sample. The plague is estimated to have killed between one-quarter and one-half of Europe's population during the Middle Ages.

Could have implications for future vaccines

The findings could be significant for the development of vaccines and for understanding how diseases arise and mutate over time.

"If we understand what happened in the past, it can help us prepare for the future, where many of the newly emerging infectious diseases are predicted to originate from animals," says Associate Professor Martin Sikora, the study's first author.

"Mutations that were successful in the past are likely to reappear. This knowledge is important for future vaccines, as it allows us to test whether current vaccines provide sufficient coverage or whether new ones need to be developed due to mutations," adds Eske Willerslev.

The study was made possible by funding from the Lundbeck Foundation.

Dual sites, positioned through atomically precise proximity coordination for C–C coupling, serve as an exemplary platform for CO2-to-C2H4 conversion. Nonetheless, their surface-only distribution results in inefficient photogenerated electron injection via long-range migration from the bulk phase, leading to inadequate site charge to drive the consecutive electron transfers for C2H4 synthesis. Here we demonstrate a reticular dual-site photocatalyst design by embedding semiconductor units (TiO2, polymeric carbon nitride or WO3·H2O) within ligand-defective copper-based metal–organic frameworks (CuBTC-D/PC). This system demonstrates a 75.5% selectivity in converting CO2 to C2H4 with H2O as the electron donor. The reticular copper dual sites facilitate short-range photogenerated electron transfer from the photocatalyst to active sites, ensuring a sufficient electron concentration for all elementary steps in C2H4 conversion. Enhanced electron injection allows for high C2H4 selectivity even under low-intensity irradiation (~0.4 Sun), demonstrating suitability for solar-driven applications. This work establishes the feasibility of CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 as a primary product, providing insights into multi-electron CO2 photoreduction.

Antarctic bed topography influences how the overlying ice sheet responds to climate change and provides a record of long-term glacial history. However, knowledge of the processes that governed the development of the landscape before glacial inception and how this modulated subsequent ice-sheet evolution remains limited. Here we use radio-echo sounding to reveal extensive flat surfaces beneath the ice margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land, East Antarctica. When their elevations are isostatically adjusted for unloading of the present-day ice load, these surfaces cluster at 200–450 metres above sea level and dip gently in an offshore direction. We show that the surfaces are fragments of a once-contiguous coastal plain formed by fluvial erosion, which dates from between the separation of East Antarctica from Australia (~100–80 Ma) and the onset of Southern Hemisphere ice-sheet glaciation (~34 Ma). The preservation of these landforms indicates a lack of intense, selective erosion of the surfaces throughout Antarctica's glacial history. Fast-flowing ice has instead been directed through inherited tectonic structures and fluvial valleys, leading to the incision of overdeepened subglacial troughs between the flat surfaces and thus modulating the responsiveness of the ice sheet to climate change.

Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and its contribution to global sea-level rise, have accelerated in recent decades1. While much focus has been on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet2,3, recent studies have highlighted the potential vulnerability of parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), which contains ~90% of the 58 metres sea-level equivalent held in Antarctica4,5. The EAIS sector between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land (70° E to 160° E) is of especial importance because the sub-ice topography contains two large low-lying basins and numerous deep troughs (Fig. 1a)4 that may render the ice margin susceptible to rapid and irreversible retreat via marine ice-sheet instability processes6. This margin has experienced ice-shelf thinning since the 1970s7 and is predicted to be a potentially major contributor to future sea-level rise by numerical ice-sheet models8,9,10. However, substantial uncertainty persists regarding the projected extent and rate of future ice thinning and margin retreat11.

Two primary sources of this uncertainty are (1) insufficient knowledge of basal conditions (for example, morphology, temperature, friction and hydrology), which influence ice dynamics and therefore sea-level rise12, and (2) limited understanding of long-term EAIS evolution, including its response to past episodes of ocean–atmosphere warming that serve as analogues for contemporary climate change13. Addressing both is crucial for improving the ability of numerical ice-sheet models to robustly project future change14.

The land surface beneath the EAIS provides a valuable record of ice-sheet behaviour since its inception (~34 million years ago (Ma)) and the geological processes that have shaped the basal environment15,16,17. Across the continents that were formerly connected to East Antarctica in the supercontinent of Gondwana (Africa, India and Australia), the geomorphological record provides the foundation for understanding the tectonic, erosional and climatic history that has influenced long-term landscape development18. In Antarctica, airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys are used to measure ice thickness and bed elevation19 and generate kilometre-resolution gridded bed products4,20 (Fig. 1a). However, the gridding process causes critical geomorphological information to be lost or obscured21. Direct measurements of East Antarctic bed topography derived from RES therefore provide a vital opportunity to better understand past, present and future EAIS behaviour22.

In this study, we examine RES data from multiple surveys and discover coherent pre-glacial surfaces preserved around the 3,500-km-long margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land. Analysis of the distribution, elevation and morphology of the surfaces enables us to constrain the basal conditions and long-term behaviour of the EAIS margin and demonstrates that geological processes that operated millions of years ago continue to play a critical role in contemporary EAIS behaviour.

To characterize the subglacial topography of the study area, we combined bed elevation measurements from four airborne RES surveys: (1) WISE-ISODYN (Wilkes Basin/Transantarctic Mountains System Exploration–Icehouse Earth: Stability or Dynamism?) 2005–0623, (2) ICECAP (International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling) 2009–1315, (3) CHINARE (Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition) CHA1–4 2015–1924 and (4) OIB (Operation IceBridge) 201925 (Extended Data Fig. 1). The exact along-track sampling rate depends on the radar platform but is typically ~20 m; the vertical resolution is ~5–10 m (Extended Data Table 1). The coverage of these surveys enabled us to conduct a systematic analysis of the regional bed topography (Methods), which revealed a series of conspicuous low-angle (gradient < 1°), low-relief (internal relief < 200 m) surfaces, hereafter referred to as ‘flat surfaces'.

We mapped 31 flat surfaces around the East Antarctic margin from Princess Elizabeth Land to George V Land (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2). Individual surfaces are characterized by internally consistent elevations and morphologies across 10s to 100s of kilometres, with low-amplitude (<200 m) surficial roughness (Fig. 1b–e). In places, the surfaces are incised by valleys up to 1 km deep and bordered by steep-sided subglacial troughs (Fig. 1). The surfaces range from 200 to 50,000 km2 in area and in total comprise ~40% of the perimeter of the EAIS between 70° E and 160° E. On the inland side of the flat surfaces, there is a transition to rougher, higher-elevation topography (Extended Data Fig. 2). The majority of the surfaces are overlain by 500–1,500 m of ice, with a minority located farther into the continental interior and situated beneath ice up to 2,500 m thick4 (Supplementary Text 1).

a, In situ bed elevations of the 31 flat surfaces mapped around the EAIS margin (limits marked in white). Bed elevations were extracted from RES profiles and filtered to remove points that deviate from the local mode by at least ±50 m (that is, valleys or inselbergs). b, Rebounded bed elevations of the flat surfaces. Rebounded elevations were computed by adding the in situ elevations to the total isostatic response to the complete removal of the EAIS27. All elevations are relative to present-day global mean sea level (the EIGEN-6C4 geoid). Vectors indicate the dip direction of the surfaces, with vector lengths proportional to the dip angle. Blue line marks the −1,000 m bathymetric contour4, indicating the position of the continental shelf edge. Insets show the corresponding frequency distributions of elevation (that is, hypsometries). Purple stars mark the surface outcrops in the Bunger Hills and Vestfold Hills. Red line in panel a shows 16 RES profile segments used to construct a near-continuous profile around the EAIS margin.

We quantified flat-surface morphology using the RES-derived bed elevation measurements (Fig. 2). Hypsometry (frequency distribution of elevations) shows that, beneath the modern EAIS, the surfaces are situated at a wide range of elevations between −900 and +300 m relative to global mean sea level (Fig. 2a), with a standard deviation of 300 m and a negative excess kurtosis (−0.98). The surfaces are horizontal or gently sloping (<1°) with no systematic alignment in dip direction (Fig. 2a). Across all 31 surfaces, the modal local topographic relief (range of elevations within a 5-km moving window) is ~100 m (Extended Data Fig. 3), with an interquartile range of 80–210 m. Although ice-free land is rare in East Antarctica, isolated coastal outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills (Fig. 2) exhibit near-identical elevations26 and local relief to the adjacent subglacial flat surfaces, and likely represent exposed fragments of the surfaces on their coastward edges (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Notably, when flat-surface elevations are isostatically adjusted for the complete removal of the EAIS27 (Methods and Supplementary Text 1 and 2), the hypsometric distribution is characterized by a well-defined modal peak at +200–450 m (Fig. 2b) and a reduced standard deviation of 135 m. The hypsometric distribution has a positive excess kurtosis (0.57) and a skewness of −0.21; this asymmetry reflects the presence of valleys incised into the flat surfaces (Fig. 1). Moreover, when adjusted for EAIS removal, the dips of the surfaces systematically align orthogonal to the coast, with gentle coastward dip angles of up to 0.8° (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5). This applies to all surfaces proximal to the coast; the surfaces farther into the interior of the Wilkes and Sabrina Subglacial Basins show a more complex pattern of dips, which may reflect differences in inherited morphology, erosive history and/or local tectonic deformation.

Bedrock geology does not appear to exert a strong control on flat-surface elevation or morphology in East Antarctica. Regional geology comprises primarily Archaean–Proterozoic crystalline gneisses, with intervening Palaeozoic–Mesozoic orogenic belts, igneous intrusive provinces and rift basins28,29. Flat surfaces are present within each geological province, and some surfaces cut across geological boundaries (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6). While we note a slight increase in modal flat-surface elevation moving westwards around the margin (Extended Data Fig. 6), Gaussian mixture model cluster analysis indicates that the flat surfaces comprise a single, statistically consistent, population according to their elevations and morphologies (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7).

Horizontal dashed line marks the 100 m yr−1 contour, an approximate threshold of fast flow. b, Ice surface and bed elevation from 16 RES profiles used to construct the transect. Flat surfaces are highlighted in purple. Dashed lines mark sections of bed overlain by floating ice shelves; sub-shelf bathymetry from BedMachine4 version 3. Red/blue shading indicates the model-predicted basal thermal state of the EAIS32; red, basal ice within 2 °C of the pressure melting point (that is, ‘warm-based'); blue, basal ice >2 °C below the pressure melting point (that is, ‘cold-based'). Horizontal bars between panels a and b mark the extents of the major geological provinces along the transect28,29.

Ice-surface velocities above the flat surfaces are consistently low; only five surfaces have a mean overlying flow speed of >50 m yr−1, and none exceeds 100 m yr−1 (ref. 30). Fast ice flows around the flat surfaces and through the intervening deep troughs that host major outlets, including the Mertz, Totten and Denman Glaciers (Fig. 3a). Observational constraints from radar attenuation rates and bed-echo power in George V Land and Adélie Land indicate that the flat surfaces in these regions are typically situated beneath ice that is probably cold-based (that is, frozen bed) whereas the adjacent troughs probably host warm-based ice (that is, thawed bed;31 Extended Data Fig. 8). Ice-sheet model predictions of modern basal temperatures also indicate that the basal thermal state of the ice overlying the flat surfaces is cold-based, with warm-based ice in the intervening topographic lows32 (Fig. 3b).

We interpret the flat surfaces to have originated as pre-glacial fluvial planation surfaces. The reasons for this are threefold. First, the strong clustering of rebounded elevations around the entire margin (Fig. 2b) is indicative of surface formation via a single process operating in the absence of the ice sheet. Second, the gentle coastward dips of the surfaces (Fig. 2b) are consistent with coastal plains formed by planation to base level by river systems, as observed along former Gondwanan passive margins such as southern Australia and southwest Africa33. Third, the flat surfaces cut across the regional geological structure (Fig. 3b), indicating that they are not the expression of an exhumed geological surface such as an erosion-resistant stratigraphic horizon.

We discount both marine and ice-sheet planation as primary formation mechanisms for the flat surfaces as there are no modern analogues for the generation of coherent, morphologically consistent flat surfaces over such large distances (3,500 km) in an inland setting via these processes. The surfaces extend too far inland and above sea level to have been eroded by wave action or truncated by grounding-zone/ice-shelf fluctuations, and neither process can account for the consistent coastward overall dips of the surfaces. We also discount the surfaces being sediment-draped depositional features because of their observed high-frequency, low-amplitude roughness (Fig. 1b–e). This is indicative of erosion of coherent bedrock. Indeed, the exposed continuations of the flat surfaces in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills comprise Archaean–Proterozoic crystalline gneisses34.

The first-order topography of this sector of the East Antarctic margin closely resembles that of its conjugate in southern Australia. Both are characterized by low elevations and gradients along much of their length and high terrain at their eastern end (Fig. 4). The narrow, unimodal hypsometric distributions of both margins are also closely comparable (Fig. 4c). As is the case for many passive margins, the southern Australian margin (which has escaped Cenozoic glaciation) is characterized by a low-relief coastal plain, which formed via long-term fluvial planation18 following its separation from East Antarctica. We suggest a similar fluvial origin for the flat surfaces mapped along the East Antarctic conjugate margin.

Box plots mark the mean (circle), median (central line), interquartile range (box) and 5th and 95th percentiles (outer bars).

Although we interpret the first-order morphology (that is, elevations and overall dips) of the flat surfaces as being fluvial in origin, we emphasize that the second-order morphology (that is, surficial roughness) was probably generated by ice. This is evidenced by the geomorphology of the Bunger and Vestfold Hills, which closely resemble ‘knock-and-lochan' topography formed via the removal of regolith and ‘etching' of the bedrock surface by areal scouring beneath warm-based ice35,36 (Extended Data Fig. 4). The local relief of the subglacial surfaces (80–210 m) is ~100 m larger than the local relief of the southern Australian conjugate margin (Fig. 4d) and is consistent with the exposed outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills. In landscapes of areal scour elsewhere on Earth (for example, former ice-sheet beds such as Baffin Island; Fig. 4d), the depth of scouring is <100 m (ref. 36). This indicates that the flat surfaces have been subjected to scouring, which increased their internal relief by up to 100 m.

Scouring of the flat surfaces by warm-based ice probably occurred earlier in the history of the EAIS. This is evidenced by the presence of localized Pliocene (~4 Ma) shallow marine deposits that drape the coastal surfaces in the Vestfold (and neighbouring Larsemann) Hills and are not scoured37, which shows that the scouring (and the flat surfaces themselves) pre-date the Pliocene. Although it is difficult to further constrain the age of scouring, there is evidence for limited EAIS erosion under a progressively arid polar climate since the mid-Miocene5,22. We suggest that the erosive events occurred under the more dynamic ice sheets of the Oligocene/early Miocene38,39, although more recent erosive modification cannot be discounted.

Selective incision of deep glacial troughs divided the once-contiguous surface into the multiple coherent fragments observed today (Fig. 3b). This selectivity of glacial erosion is evidenced by the correlation between the positions of these troughs and the thickest sequences of post-34 Ma offshore sediment40. Indeed, the continental shelf width (a proxy for the amount of sediment progradation) is narrower in front of the flat surfaces than the intervening deep troughs (Fig. 2) (ref. 41), indicating that the surfaces have not experienced substantial glacial erosion. The continuity of the flat surfaces either side of the intervening deep troughs (Fig. 3b) also indicates that they pre-date trough incision. This incision probably commenced soon after ~34 Ma (ref. 42), and possibly several million years earlier38, which places a lower bound on the timing of original surface planation by fluvial systems.

Sediment provenance studies show that, before break-up, trans-Gondwanan fluvial pathways extended from central East Antarctica to northwestern Australia (via Wilkes Land and southwestern Australia; Fig. 5a)43. This indicates that there was early connectivity of the already relatively low-lying Antarctic and Australian fluvial landscapes, which may have started to develop as early as the Triassic period44. Relative motion between the continents commenced at ~160 Ma, and seafloor spreading onset is dated at ~100–80 Ma (ref. 45). Following continental break-up, minor post-rift uplift and the formation of a new (lower) base level would have triggered enhanced erosion, with fluvial systems grading the landscape to base level as a seaway formed between East Antarctica and Australia. We envisage that this process formed a contiguous coastward-dipping planation surface around the East Antarctic margin, as well as reorganization of pre-break-up fluvial pathways. Indeed, the Yilgarn Plateau in southwestern Australia (Fig. 4a) contains palaeochannels of middle Eocene age (~45 Ma) with an inland-facing palaeo-drainage direction46, a pattern probably caused by minor escarpment uplift (Fig. 5b). We therefore infer that East Antarctic flat-surface planation post-dated Australia–Antarctica separation (~80 Ma) and pre-dated EAIS inception (~34 Ma).

a, Before Gondwana break-up (pre-160 Ma), transcontinental fluvial drainage systems flowed from the highlands of interior East Antarctica to the northwestern coast of Australia43. b, Following continental break-up and seafloor spreading onset at ~80 Ma, a small (~200 m) escarpment formed along parts of the southern Australian margin, and an interior drainage network was established on the inland side. In East Antarctica, rivers eroded down to the new base level, forming a low-lying, seaward-dipping coastal plain. c, After ~34 Ma, Australia's climate became increasingly arid, and the interior drainage network became extinct. A limestone seabed became subaerially exposed during the Miocene, forming the Nullarbor Plain59. Following ice-sheet growth, remnants of the East Antarctic fluvial planation surface were surficially scoured by ice, but the first-order inherited fluvial structure was preserved due to prevailing low subglacial erosion rates in these areas. Contemporaneously, fast-flowing, warm-based ice selectively exploited existing structural weaknesses (red dashed lines) and/or river valleys to erode deep glacial troughs between the flat-surface fragments.

The seaward edges of the East Antarctic flat surfaces (under ice-free conditions; Fig. 2b) are consistently ~150 m above present-day sea level, providing an approximate indication of base level at the time of formation. Although the surfaces may have subsequently been vertically displaced by processes including post-rift thermal subsidence and the isostatic response to glacial trough erosion and offshore sediment deposition, calculations show that the contributions of these processes would have been minor (<50 m; Supplementary Text 3–5). Moreover, these processes generate displacements with opposite signs that partially cancel out. Importantly, these processes cannot account for the consistent elevations and gentle coastward dips of the flat surfaces. A base level 150 ± 50 m higher than today is in broad agreement with estimates of global sea level for the Palaeocene to early Eocene (~66–48 Ma; Supplementary Text 2)47,48.

Our findings demonstrate that tectonic and surface processes that operated millions of years ago have been crucial in preconditioning the behaviour of the EAIS margin, including its most sensitive outlets. Contemporary ice flow is focused through the deep troughs between the remnants of the pre-glacial fluvial planation surface30 (Fig. 3). Inherited geological structures and/or weaknesses may have been exploited by pre-glacial river valleys and in turn by early outlet glaciers when the EAIS first expanded to continental scale38. Preferential steering of ice and basal meltwater49,50 would facilitate selective incision of existing topographic lows to form the overdeepened troughs observed today (Fig. 5). The deep troughs now host fast-flowing glaciers such as Totten, Mertz and Denman (Fig. 3), which are vulnerable to retreat via marine ice instability feedbacks owing to their topography4.

The presence of extensive pre-glacial surfaces between the deep troughs has important implications for long-term ice behaviour. To have preserved these surfaces with minor modification (that is, scouring) since at least ~34 Ma, the long-term average basal conditions of these parts of the EAIS must have been conducive to low erosion rates (that is, cold-based and/or slow-moving; Fig. 5)51. Generation of high-frequency, low-amplitude roughness across the surfaces via areal scour can only have been short-lived and/or intermittent; otherwise, the surfaces would not exhibit such consistent rebounded elevations and coastward dips around the entire margin. The surfaces therefore act as a new constraint for basal thermal state around the EAIS margin, which is one of the key factors that govern the rate of basal sliding and onset of fast ice flow but is poorly understood and differs between ice-sheet models31.

The observation that the sub-ice flat surfaces are contiguous with outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills enables us to further constrain basal conditions across a large, grounding-zone proximal sector of the EAIS margin. On the basis of the geology of these exposed areas52, we infer the presence of hard, crystalline bedrock across the flat surfaces adjacent to these outcrops. These lithologies are typically associated with relatively high basal friction, low permeability and low erodibility12. Other flat surfaces, particularly those within Wilkes and Sabrina Subglacial Basins, may instead comprise coherent sedimentary rock29.

We hypothesize that the flat surfaces would play a stabilizing role during past and future grounding-zone retreat. As the ice margin retreats and thins, increased flotation of ice may occur within the low-lying troughs (Fig. 3). However, ice would probably remain grounded on the flat surfaces, which stand 1–2 km higher than the adjacent troughs (Fig. 3b), resulting in the formation of ice rises53. Grounding may be reinforced as the flat surfaces increase in elevation due to the regional isostatic response to ice unloading, depending on the rebound rate27,53. Indeed, ice rises underlain by flat-topped bathymetric highs are observed in the Weddell and Ross Sea embayments21,53,54, and some flat surfaces mapped in this study currently host ice rises, including the Law Dome (Fig. 4)53. Ice rises act as pinning points and buttress the inland ice, reducing mass flux to the ocean and inhibiting grounding-zone retreat55,56, and can also increase local accumulation rates57. However, ice-rise formation may not be fully captured in continental-scale ice-sheet models8,9,10, particularly if ice shelves are not retained during grounding-zone retreat. Limited model resolution and/or uncertainties surrounding the parameterization of processes that determine grounding-zone position (for example, marine ice-sheet instability, ice-cliff calving, ice-shelf hydrofracturing and glacial isostatic adjustment) may also contribute to this issue6. The spatial distribution of the mapped flat surfaces may facilitate the formation of ice rises capable of slowing the rate of grounding-zone retreat during warmer climates.

We emphasize the need for further exploration of the influence of the flat surfaces on ice dynamics during past warmer climates, for example, through acquisition of offshore records, onshore bedrock sampling and testing of numerical ice models that apply appropriate physics at a resolution sufficient to resolve grounding-zone dynamics and ice-rise formation. This will help further resolve the nature of past EAIS margin retreat, with important implications for projections of future ice change and sea-level rise in a warming world.

We used RES data to map subglacial flat surfaces around the margin of East Antarctica between Princess Elizabeth Land (70° E) and George V Land (160° E). We used geolocated ice thickness data acquired during four airborne RES surveys:

WISE-ISODYN23

ICECAP15

CHINARE24

OIB25

Given the close similarity of the along-track sampling rates and vertical resolutions of each of the four survey platforms (Extended Data Table 1), all along-track ice thickness measurements were integrated into a single database with no additional processing. The latitude and longitude of each sample point were projected into polar stereographic (EPSG:3031) eastings and northings. These coordinates were in turn used to compute the along-track Cartesian distance for each survey line. Bed elevations were determined by subtracting ice thickness from the ice-surface elevation; for each survey, elevations are referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid. To ensure all bed elevations were referenced to global mean sea level, we shifted them onto the EIGEN-6C4 geoid using the BedMachine Antarctica geoid height correction4. To ensure consistency across the entire dataset and to avoid aliasing of high-frequency variations in elevation, we upsampled the bed elevation data along each survey line to a uniform along-track spacing of 10 m.

To locate candidate flat surfaces, we performed a first-pass visual inspection of each survey line in the compiled bed elevation dataset and noted sections of the profiles characterized by coherent, low-relief, low-angle topography. We then fitted a linear polynomial (in the least-squares sense) to each of these one-dimensional (distance versus elevation) profile segments, which ranged in length from ~10 to ~200 km. This polynomial was used to estimate the overall gradient from the start to the end of the profile. We imposed a condition that any segment with a gradient exceeding 1° was excluded from our inventory. We note that the flight lines have a range of azimuths (Extended Data Fig. 1) and will typically not be oriented along the direction of steepest gradient of a two-dimensional topographic surface, but because this will result in an underestimation of the gradient at this stage, ‘borderline' low-angle surfaces will be included (rather than excluded) in this first-pass compilation.

We also estimated the local-scale relief within the candidate flat surfaces by computing the moving minimum and moving maximum elevations within a 5 km window passed along the profile segments. The difference between the moving minimum and maximum provides an indication of the local-scale (that is, <5 km) relief (that is, range in elevations) across the flat-surface segments. We imposed a condition that any segment with a median local relief exceeding 200 m was excluded. Any segment not excluded by these two conditions was considered to be a segment of a low-angle, low-relief (that is, ‘flat') surface. In total, we identified 538 such segments within the full RES dataset. We then plotted the spatial extent of these segments and manually digitized polygons demarcating the two-dimensional extent of 31 separate flat surfaces within the study area.

To characterize flat-surface morphology, we extracted the bed elevation points from the 538 segments, each of which is assigned to one of the 31 separate flat surfaces. Each segment profile was detrended by subtracting a linear polynomial (fitted in the least-squares sense) from the observed bed elevations. We then identified the modal detrended elevation by grouping the elevations into 10 m bins. The segments were then modal filtered by removing any point deviating from the mode by more than 50 m. These points constitute valleys incised into the modal surface or peaks protruding above it. The remaining points were considered to represent the contiguous flat surface itself and were restored to their true elevations by re-adding the linear polynomial. These restored modal-filtered elevations were used to determine the hypsometry—the frequency distribution of elevation across all the flat surfaces—using a bin size of 50 m.

We then determined the average dip of each of the 31 flat surfaces by fitting a two-dimensional plane to all modal-filtered elevation points within each polygon via linear regression. By including all the elevation point data within each surface and fitting a two-dimensional plane, we addressed the issue of individual flight lines not recording the ‘true dip' of the surface. Although the flight lines are not isotropic, each flat surface is sampled by multiple flight lines oriented in multiple directions (for example, Extended Data Fig. 5), and the fitted planar surfaces are therefore sufficiently well constrained to robustly extract the true dip. The angle and azimuth of steepest descent of the plane were extracted as the overall dip and dip direction of the surface, respectively. We also computed the along-track local-scale relief and the median value within each of the 31 flat surfaces, using the method described in the previous section.

We then repeated the preceding analysis for bed elevations that were adjusted for the isostatic response to the complete unloading of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. To do so, we used a recent calculation of the isostatic response to complete deglaciation27, which was computed using a flexed elastic plate model60, BedMachine v.3 ice thickness4, and a laterally variable effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere61. Although the continent-scale ice thickness grid will deviate from the local radar-derived ice thickness, these differences will be minor (<100 m), and the flexural response to ice unloading is a long-wavelength signal, so the local differences in flexure are negligible. The correction also accounts for the equilibration of the ongoing response to Antarctic ice-mass change since the Last Glacial Maximum and feedbacks associated with loading of areas below sea level by water. For simplicity, rebounded bed elevations are referenced to present-day global mean sea level.

For comparison, we also computed the hypsometry and local-scale (5-km-window) relief for southern Australia (a fluvial passive margin) and Baffin Island, Canada (a glaciated passive margin) using the same methods as described for East Antarctica. In the case of Baffin Island, the value of using a former ice-sheet bed in the Northern Hemisphere is that it represents the effects of glacial modification (via areal scouring) of an existing landscape. Topography data for these regions were taken from the Copernicus global 90-m-resolution digital elevation model62. We note that the conjugate margin for the flat surfaces in Princess Elizabeth Land is the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 4), but this area (modern-day Bangladesh) is dominated by large volumes of Cenozoic sedimentation in the Himalayan foreland basin, meaning there is no longer any meaningful comparison with the topography of East Antarctica.

To determine the similarity in morphology between the 31 flat surfaces and to ascertain whether the surfaces could be divided into multiple statistically distinct groups, we performed cluster analysis using the Gaussian mixture model63. The Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes that an N-dimensional sample of data can be described by a mixture of a finite number, k, of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. It therefore allows the number of statistically distinct clusters within the dataset to be identified. For this modelling, we assembled a two-dimensional dataset with 31 entries, comprising the mean rebounded elevation and the median local relief for each flat surface.

The Gaussian mixture model implements the expectation-maximization algorithm, an iterative process that assigns each datapoint to a cluster by maximizing the posterior probability that the datapoint belongs to its assigned cluster. We initialized the model by choosing starting means and covariances for the k Gaussian components using the k-means++ algorithm64. This selects the mean of the first component at random from the data and then chooses subsequent means from a weighted distribution of the data, favouring points farther away from the existing means. Initial mixing proportions are assumed to be uniform. The model first computes the probability of each point having been generated by each of the initialized Gaussian components. The parameters and mixing proportions of the Gaussian components are then adjusted iteratively to maximize the likelihood (posterior probability) across all datapoints. We allowed a maximum of 500 iterations to ensure convergence to a local optimum and restricted the covariance matrices to be diagonal.

To identify the optimum number of components to describe the flat-surface dataset and thereby assess the number of clusters within the data, we performed Gaussian mixture modelling for k = 1, 2, 3 and 4 components. For each of the four models, we computed the Bayes information criterion (BIC)65, which is an approximation of the integrated likelihood of the converged model. The BIC is defined as twice the negative log of the maximized model likelihood penalized by the addition of the number of unknown parameters multiplied by the log of the number of datapoints. This penalty term is to prevent overfitting of the data by continually increasing model complexity by adding an ever-greater number of parameters. A lower BIC indicates a better-fitting model. We found that the BIC value was lowest (685) for k = 1 and progressively increased as more components were added, indicating that the data are best fitted by a single Gaussian distribution and are not statistically separable into clusters. This result was insensitive to whether the covariance matrices were full or diagonal, and we found that convergence was achieved within 50 iterations for each model.

The plate tectonic reconstruction of the pre-break-up positions of the East Antarctic and Australian plates at 157 Ma was performed using GPlates software58 and a recent plate tectonic model66. The East Antarctic continental shelf area was manually cropped to avoid overlap with adjacent continents and aid visualization.

Lines show survey extents for four campaigns: (a) WISE-ISODYN (2005–06)23, (b) ICECAP (2009–13)15, (c) CHINARE CHA1–4 (2015–19)24; survey lines after 2019 are not included, (d) Operation IceBridge (2019)25; survey lines from pre-2019 were predominantly flown over the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, and Weddell Sea region, so are not shown here.

(a) Bed elevation of the study area (as shown in Fig. 1a). (b) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2012 ICECAP survey15 (profile B-B'). (c) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2011 ICECAP survey15 (profile C-C'). (d) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2019 Operation IceBridge survey25 (profile D-D'). The profiles show the transition from the low-relief flat surfaces to the higher, rougher topography on their inland side (inland edges of the flat surfaces are marked by the red arrows). In each radargram, the solid line marks the ice surface; the major reflector below is the bed topography. Elevations are relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid. Flight line ID numbers are labelled.

(a) Local-scale relief of the 31 flat surfaces mapped around the EAIS margin (limits marked in white). Local-scale relief was determined by computing the difference between the moving minimum and moving maximum bed elevations within a 5 km window passed along RES profile segments. Inset shows the corresponding frequency distribution of relief. (b) Median local-scale relief for each flat surface. Bold numbers indicate the surface ID numbers (see Extended Data Table 2). Note that the colour scales in the two panels are different.

(a) Bed elevation of the exposed Vestfold Hills and contiguous subglacial flat surface. (b) Profile of ice surface (black) and bed (red) elevation across the Vestfold Hills along profile X–X' (location shown in panel a). Bed elevation was derived from ICECAP RES survey line IR2HI2_2012327_ICP5_JKB2h_F07T02a; ice surface and land elevation were derived from the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA)26. (c) Hillshaded REMA topography of the Vestfold Hills. Contour interval is 50 metres. (d) Sentinel-2b Level-1C imagery of the Vestfold Hills (image extent marked in panel a) acquired on 30th January 2024. (e) Bed elevation of the exposed Bunger Hills and contiguous subglacial flat surface. (f) Profile of ice surface (black) and bed (red) elevation across the Bunger Hills along profile Y–Y' (location shown in panel e). Bed elevation was derived from ICECAP RES survey line IR2HI2_2011002_ASB_JKB2d_GL0152a; ice surface and land elevation were derived from REMA. (g) Hillshaded REMA topography of the Bunger Hills. Contour interval is 50 metres (panel extent marked in panel h). (h) Sentinel-2b Level-1C imagery of the Bunger Hills (image extent marked in panel e) acquired on 9th March 2023.

(a) Modal filtered, ice-free (rebounded) bed elevation of a flat surface. Contour interval is 50 m. (b) Fitting of a 2D plane to all elevation points within the flat surface (black) via linear regression. Colour scale matches that shown in panel a. (c) The angle and azimuth of steepest descent of this plane were extracted and used to compute the surface-averaged dip angle and dip direction.

(a) Map of first-order geological provinces28,29. Dashed lines mark boundaries between the provinces. Purple stars mark the flat surface outcrops in the Bunger Hills (BH) and Vestfold Hills (VH). Red line shows 16 RES profile segments used to construct a near-continuous profile around the EAIS margin (Fig. 3). (b–g) histograms of the rebounded bed elevations of the flat surfaces within each of the geological provinces. For simplicity, the Vestfold Terrane and Prydz Province have been grouped together (b) as have the Charcot Terrane and Knox Rift / Bunger Hills (c). The modal and mean flat surface elevations for each province are labelled, as is the standard deviation.

The morphology of each flat surface is quantified by its mean rebounded (ice-free) elevation and median local relief. (a) One-component (k = 1) mixture model, (b) Two-component (k = 2) mixture model, (c) Three-component (k = 3) mixture model, (d) Four-component (k = 4) mixture model. Circles represent the 31 flat surface fragments mapped in this study (colours correspond to geological provinces; see Extended Data Fig. 6). Contours represent the probability distribution of the Gaussian component(s) in each of the four mixture models. BIC = Bayes Information Criterion; a lower BIC indicates a better-fitting model (see Methods).

(a) Predicted basal thermal state along RES lines31. Colours represent the probability of the basal ice being frozen (0) or thawed (1); the map shown is an aggregate of four different combinations of labelling and radar processing31. White polygons mark the flat surfaces. (b) Predicted basal temperatures derived from simulations of the present-day Antarctic Ice Sheet generated using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)32. Temperatures are divided into four bins: (i) at the pressure melting point (PMP), (ii) less than 2 °C below the PMP, (iii) between 2° and 5 °C below the PMP, and (iv) more than 5 °C below the PMP.

Novel solutions to combat the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistance in human and animal pathogens are urgently required. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising therapeutic molecules, as they exhibit structural nuances and distinct molecular targets against pathogenic microorganisms. In this Review, we explore the multifaceted structural nature of AMPs and advanced structural conformations, discuss the distinct mechanisms of action and explore novel targets. Additionally, we discuss resistance mechanisms, cross-resistance and innovative strategies for AMP design and optimization. We argue that gaining insight into novel AMP structural arrangements, targets and design optimization is crucial for the development of innovative therapies that can be translated into clinical as well as broader applications.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with no disease-modifying treatments. AS is caused by deletion or mutation of the neuronally imprinted gene encoding the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Rugonersen (RO7248824) is an antisense oligonucleotide that reinstates UBE3A by derepressing the silenced paternal allele. TANGELO was a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-ascending-dose trial with a long-term extension to investigate the safety and tolerability (primary) and pharmacokinetics (secondary) of rugonersen in children aged 1–12 years with AS (n = 61, F/M: 28/33). Key exploratory endpoints assessing changes following rugonersen treatment were electroencephalogram δ-power (2–4 Hz) and domains of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development—Third Edition and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales—Third Edition. The primary endpoint was met; rugonersen had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Analysis of exploratory endpoints showed that rugonersen led to a dose-dependent partial normalization of the AS-associated electroencephalogram abnormality and revealed signals of clinical improvement in core AS symptom domains beyond expectation from natural history data. The results of the primary study objective support continued development of rugonersen for AS. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04428281.

In the last year, there has been a surge in proteins developed by AI that will eventually be used in the treatment of everything from snakebites to cancer. What would normally take decades for a scientist to create -- a custom-made protein for a particular disease -- can now be done in seconds.

For the first time, Australian scientists have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate a ready-to-use biological protein, in this case, one that can kill antibiotic resistant bacteria like E. coli.

This study, published in Nature Communications, provides a new way to combat the growing crisis caused by antibiotic resistant super bugs. By using AI in this way, Australian science has now joined countries like the US and China having developed AI platforms capable of rapidly generating thousands of ready-to-use proteins, paving the way for faster, more affordable drug development and diagnostics that could transform biomedical research and patient care.

The Nature Communications paper is co-led by Dr. Rhys Grinter and Associate Professor Gavin Knott, a Snow Medical Fellow, who lead the new AI Protein Design Program with nodes at the University of Melbourne Bio21 Institute and Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute.

According to Dr. Grinter and A/Prof. Knott, the AI Protein Design Platform used in this work is the first in Australia that models the work done by David Baker (who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year) developing an end-to-end approach that could create a wide range of proteins. "These proteins are now being developed as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors, with many other applications yet to be tested" Associate Professor Knott said.

For this study, the AI Protein Design Platform used AI-driven protein design tools that are freely available for scientists everywhere. "It's important to democratize protein design so that the whole world has the ability to leverage these tools," said Daniel Fox, the PhD student who performed most of the experimental work for the study. "Using these tools and those we are developing in-house, we can engineer proteins to bind a specific target site or ligand, as inhibitors, agonists or antagonists, or engineered enzymes with improved activity and stability."

According to Dr Grinter, currently proteins used in the treatment of diseases like cancer or infections are derived from nature and repurposed through rational design or in vitro evolution and selection. "These new methods in deep learning enable efficient de novo design of proteins with specific characteristics and functions, lowering the cost and accelerating the development of novel protein binders and engineered enzymes," he said.

Since the work of David Baker, new tools and software are being developed, such as Bindcraft and Chai which have been incorporated into an AI Protein Design Platform co-led by Dr. Grinter and A/Prof. Knott..

Professor John Carroll, Director of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, said the new AI Protein Design Program 'brings Australia "right up to speed in this exciting new modality for designing novel therapeutics and research tools. It is testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of two fabulous young scientists who have worked night and day to build this capability from scratch."

"The Program, based at Monash University and the University of Melbourne, is run by a team of talented structural biologists and computer scientists who understand the design process from end-to-end. This in-depth knowledge of protein structure and machine learning makes us a highly agile program capable of regularly onboarding cutting edge tools in AI-protein design," Associate Professor Knott said.

Pain isn't just a physical sensation -- it also carries emotional weight. That distress, anguish, and anxiety can turn a fleeting injury into long-term suffering.

Researchers at the Salk Institute have now identified a brain circuit that gives physical pain its emotional tone, revealing a new potential target for treating chronic and affective pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Published on July 9, 2025, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study identifies a group of neurons in a central brain area called the thalamus that appears to mediate the emotional or affective side of pain in mice. This new pathway challenges the textbook understanding of how pain is processed in the brain and body.

"For decades, the prevailing view was that the brain processes sensory and emotional aspects of pain through separate pathways," says senior author Sung Han, associate professor and holder of the Pioneer Fund Developmental Chair at Salk. "But there's been debate about whether the sensory pain pathway might also contribute to the emotional side of pain. Our study provides strong evidence that a branch of the sensory pain pathway directly mediates the affective experience of pain."

The physical sensation of pain is what allows you to immediately detect it, assess its intensity, and identify its source. The affective part of pain is what makes it so unpleasant. This emotional discomfort motivates you to take action and helps you learn to associate negative feelings with the situation so you can avoid it in the future.

This is a critical distinction. Most people start to perceive pain at the same stimulus intensities, meaning we all process the sensory side of pain fairly similarly. In comparison, our ability to tolerate pain varies greatly. How much we suffer or feel threatened by pain is determined by our affective processing, and if that becomes too sensitive or lasts too long, it can result in a pain disorder. This makes it important to understand which parts of the brain control these different dimensions of pain.

Sensory pain was thought to be mediated by the spinothalamic tract, a pathway that sends pain signals from the spinal cord to the thalamus, which then relays them to sensory processing areas across the brain.

Affective pain was generally thought to be mediated by a second pathway called the spinoparabrachial tract, which sends pain information from the spinal cord into the brainstem.

However, previous studies using older research methods have suggested the circuitry of pain may be more complex. This long-standing debate inspired Han and his team to revisit the question with modern research tools.

Using advanced techniques to manipulate the activity of specific brain cells, the researchers discovered a new spinothalamic pathway in mice. In this circuit, pain signals are sent from the spinal cord into a different part of the thalamus, which has connections to the amygdala, the brain's emotional processing center. This particular group of neurons in the thalamus can be identified by their expression of CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), a neuropeptide originally discovered in Professor Ronald Evans' lab at Salk.

When the researchers "turned off" (genetically silenced) these CGRP neurons, the mice still reacted to mild pain stimuli, such as heat or pressure, indicating their sensory processing was intact. However, they didn't seem to associate lasting negative feelings with these situations, failing to show any learned fear or avoidance behaviors in future trials. On the other hand, when these same neurons were "turned on" (optogenetically activated), the mice showed clear signs of distress and learned to avoid that area, even when no pain stimuli had been used.

"Pain processing is not just about nerves detecting pain; it's about the brain deciding how much that pain matters," says first author Sukjae Kang, a senior research associate in Han's lab. "Understanding the biology behind these two distinct processes will help us find treatments for the kinds of pain that don't respond to traditional drugs."

Many chronic pain conditions -- such as fibromyalgia and migraine -- involve long, intense, unpleasant experiences of pain, often without a clear physical source or injury. Some patients also report extreme sensitivity to ordinary stimuli like light, sound, or touch, which others would not perceive as painful.

Han says overactivation of the CGRP spinothalamic pathway may contribute to these conditions by making the brain misinterpret or overreact to sensory inputs. In fact, transcriptomic analysis of the CGRP neurons showed that they express many of the genes associated with migraine and other pain disorders.

Notably, several CGRP blockers are already being used to treat migraines. This study may help explain why these medications work and could inspire new nonaddictive treatments for affective pain disorders.

Han also sees potential relevance for psychiatric conditions that involve heightened threat perception, such as PTSD. Growing evidence from his lab suggests that the CGRP affective pain pathway acts as part of the brain's broader alarm system, detecting and responding to not only pain but a wide range of unpleasant sensations. Quieting this pathway with CGRP blockers could offer a new approach to easing fear, avoidance, and hypervigilance in trauma-related disorders.

Importantly, the relationship between the CGRP pathway and the psychological pain associated with social experiences like grief, loneliness, and heartbreak remains unclear and requires further study.

"Our discovery of the CGRP affective pain pathway gives us a molecular and circuit-level explanation for the difference between detecting physical pain and suffering from it," says Han. "We're excited to continue exploring this pathway and enabling future therapies that can reduce this suffering."

Apple is famously strict about discounts, and it rarely offers price drops even on the most affordable products. If you have to buy an AirTag, you'll usually pay $29 each on Apple's official website.

But this Prime Day, the prices are to be believed: a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for $64, which works out at about $16 an AirTag. To put it into perspective, four AirTags from Apple would run you $116 so this Prime Day discount is essentially… half price. The deal is only being offered to Prime members but if you aren't a member, you can just opt for the free 30-day trial in order to get access. If you don't need more than one, you can purchase the individual AirTag from Amazon for $20 rather than the normal price of $29.

If you want an easy way of keeping tabs on your most valuable items, Apple's AirTag is a great choice. The AirTag is designed to help you find your keys, wallet, purses, backpack, or whatever you want to keep tabs on. It's as simple to pair an AirTag as it is to say: just bring it close to your iPhone or iPad and a one-touch setup will link it to your Apple ID immediately. You can then use the Find My app to locate your item at any time.

The AirTag leverages Apple's massive Find My network and uses hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you find lost things. When your AirTag is out of Bluetooth range, it can still be tracked by nearby Apple devices with communication encrypted and anonymous to maintain your information security. Your location data will never be transferred or stored on the AirTag itself.

Precision Finding is another major advantage: It uses Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your lost item with compatible iPhone models. To find your keys throughout the house, you can make a sound from the internal speaker in the AirTag or ask Siri. If you've lost something in an airport or a coffee shop, you can put the AirTag in Lost Mode to receive a notification the instant it gets detected by another device on the Find My network.

The AirTag is meant to last with a replaceable battery that still works after over a year and an IP67 rating for water and dust protection. That is, you can forget about rain, spills, or everyday bumps and drops. It's very small and light so you can stick it in a wallet, attach it to your keys or stash it in your bag without it adding bulk.

At $67 for a 4-pack, this Prime Day deal is the best opportunity you'll find to upgrade (better than during Black Friday) your tracking game.

This leads me to believe that the training data won't be made publicly available in full, but merely be “reproducible”. This might mean that they'll provide references like a list of URLs of the pages they trained on, but not their contents.

“ Open LLMs are increasingly viewed as credible alternatives to commercial systems, most of which are developed behind closed doors in the United States or China”It is obvious that the companies producing big LLMs today have the incentive to try to enshitify them.  Trying to get subscriptions at the same time as trying to do product placement ads etc.  Worse, some already have political biases they promote.It would be wonderful if a partnership between academia and government in Europe can do a public good search and AI that endeavours to serve the user over the company.

Before we jump into the rest of the news, a word about Grok, the AI model created by xAI, an Elon Musk company that recently acquired his social media service X. Yes, this is related to transportation. 

Grok, which can analyze images and respond to questions, is meant to be a competitor to models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grok has become a centerpiece of X, where users interact with the AI chatbot. It's also become increasingly combative and gone on several antisemitic tirades, praised Hitler, and even made rape threats. (Those posts have been taken down.)

And just yesterday, AI reporter Max Zeff discovered that xAI's newest model, Grok 4, seems to consult social media posts from Musk's X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, immigration laws, and other controversial issues. 

How is any of this related to transportation? Grok is coming to Tesla vehicles as soon as next week, according to Musk. 

A well-known white hat hacker who uses the handle “Green the Only” dug into Tesla's firmware and made a few discoveries. For example, drivers will be able to choose certain Grok “personalities,” including ones that are NSFW (not safe for work), argumentative, kids story, sexy, therapist, unhinged, and more. He also found that “Grok currently requires premium connectivity and pairs into your existing account.”

In another episode of “Is it 2016?” Rivian micromobility spinout Also raised another $200 million with a post-money valuation of $1 billion. Yes, that's right, a micromobility company that has yet to reveal its first product. 

As we've reported before, there is a lot of hype and anticipation around Also — and Jony Ive's LoveFrom connection to the brand certainly helps raise its profile. 

Speaking of buzzy EVs that have raised eye-popping rounds, senior reporter Sean O'Kane interviewed the founders of Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles venture firm that launched five years ago and was an early investor in the Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto. Want to catch up on Slate Auto news? We created a handy Slate Auto timeline that covers all our scoops and news. We will update this regularly. 

Finnish e-motor startup Donut Lab raised €25 million ($29.2 million) in a seed funding round led by Risto Siilasmaa, the founder of cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure). Risto has also joined Donut Lab's board. 

INSHUR, an insurance products service focused on the on-demand economy, raised $35 million from Trinity Capital. The new funding will support INSHUR's continued expansion across the United States.

President Trump has nominated Jonathan Morrison to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Morrison has a history of tussling with Tesla.

Meanwhile, it looks like Tesla is trying to spread its robotaxi wings. The company applied to test and operate autonomous vehicles in Arizona in a bid to bring its fledgling robotaxi service to the Metro Phoenix area. Our story has a few interesting tidbits and explains the AV permitting process in Phoenix. One critical point: The company will also need a TNC permit to provide ride-hailing services. 

Musk also commented that robotaxis will come to the Bay Area once they receive regulatory approval in “a month or two.” There's just one issue with that: The California DMV, which regulates AVs, says Tesla hasn't even applied for a driverless testing or deployment permit yet. As of today, Tesla only has an autonomous vehicle testing permit for public road testing with a safety driver, which it's held since 2014. 

Waymo continues to expand, and not just geographically. The company is opening up its robotaxi service in Phoenix to teenagers. There are caveats here, namely that the teens can only sign up through a verified parent's account. And they have to be ages 14 to 17, so no 13-year-olds. That suggests Waymo wants to steer clear of middle schoolers and only provide service to those in high school. 

Meanwhile, Waymo is sniffing around New York City (a famously restrictive place for AVs) and Philadelphia. The company kicked off “road trips” in the two Northeastern cities. Road trips can be viewed as early testing, although in New York City the vehicles will all be manually driven and used to map and collect data. 

Several new EVs broke cover this past week: Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius took the upcoming all-electric GLC for a test ride; Subaru said it will reveal its new all-electric compact crossover SUV at 7:30 p.m. ET on July 17; and Volvo shared information about the carbon footprint of the all-electric ES90, which starts production later this summer. 

Meanwhile, I spent a few days in the 2026 Rivian quad-motor R1S and R1T. This is the second generation of the flagship EV and the EV maker's most expensive trim, which costs between $115,990 and $125,990, depending on the version. 

Check out the full article about my test drive, which digs into the tech behind the second-generation flagship EV.

The United States Department of Justice this week released nearly 11 hours of what it described as “full raw” surveillance footage from a camera positioned near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The release was intended to address conspiracy theories about Epstein's apparent suicide in federal custody. But instead of putting those suspicions to rest, it may fuel them further.

Metadata embedded in the video and analyzed by WIRED and independent video forensics experts shows that rather than being a direct export from the prison's surveillance system, the footage was modified, likely using the professional editing tool Adobe Premiere Pro. The file appears to have been assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage.

Experts caution that it's unclear what exactly was changed, and that the metadata does not prove deceptive manipulation. The video may have simply been processed for public release using available software, with no modifications beyond stitching together two clips. But the absence of a clear explanation for the processing of the file using professional editing software complicates the Justice Department's narrative. In a case already clouded by suspicion, the ambiguity surrounding how the file was processed is likely to provide fresh fodder for conspiracy theories.

Any aspect of the official story that isn't fully explained will be co-opted by conspiracy theorists, says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists. “So whatever your flavor of Epstein conspiracy is, the video will help bolster it.”

For months leading up to the joint memo the DOJ and FBI published Monday, attorney general Pam Bondi had promised the release of records related to Epstein, raising expectations that new, potentially incriminating details might surface about the disgraced financier's death and his ties to powerful individuals. However, rather than revealing new information, the memo largely confirmed conclusions reached years earlier: that Epstein was found in a Manhattan prison cell on August 10, 2019, and died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

To support its conclusion, the FBI reviewed surveillance footage overlooking the common area of the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), where Epstein was held. The FBI enhanced the footage by adjusting contrast, color, and sharpness, and released both the enhanced and what it described as the “raw” version. Both versions of the video appear to have been processed using Premiere and include much of the same metadata. According to the FBI, anyone entering the area containing Epstein's cell during the relevant time frame would have been visible on that camera.

Working with two independent video forensics experts, WIRED examined the 21-gigabyte files released by the DOJ. Using a metadata tool, reporters analyzed both Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data to identify signs of postprocessing.

The “raw” file shows clear signs of having been processed using an Adobe product, most likely Premiere, based on metadata that specifically references file extensions used by the video editing software. According to experts, Adobe software, including Premiere and Photoshop, leaves traces in exported files, often embedding metadata that logs which assets were used and what actions were taken during editing. In this case, the metadata indicates the file was saved at least four times over a 23-minute span on May 23, 2025, by a Windows user account called “MJCOLE~1.” The metadata does not show whether the footage was modified before each time it was saved.

The embedded data suggest the video is not a continuous, unaltered export from a surveillance system, but a composite assembled from at least two separate MP4 files. The metadata includes references to Premiere project files and two specific source clips—2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4 and 2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4. These entries appear under a metadata section labeled “Ingredients,” part of Adobe's internal schema for tracking source material used in edited exports. The metadata does not make clear where in the video the two clips were spliced together.

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley whose research focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, reviewed the metadata at WIRED's request. Farid is a recognized expert in the analysis of digital images and the detection of manipulated media, including deepfakes. He has testified in numerous court cases involving digital evidence.

Farid says the metadata raises immediate concerns about chain of custody—the documented handling of digital evidence from collection to presentation in a courtroom. Just like physical evidence, he explains, digital evidence must be handled in a way that preserves its integrity; metadata, while not always precise, can provide important clues about whether that integrity has been compromised.

“If a lawyer brought me this file and asked if it was suitable for court, I'd say no. Go back to the source. Do it right,” Farid says. “Do a direct export from the original system—no monkey business.”

Farid points to another anomaly: The video's aspect ratio shifts noticeably at several points. “Why am I suddenly seeing a different aspect ratio?” he asks.

Farid cautions that while the metadata clearly shows the video was modified, the changes could be benign—for example, converting footage from a proprietary surveillance format to a standard MP4.

While there may be uncontroversial explanations for the metadata artifacts, such as stitching together multiple days of footage during compilation, or the routine export of surveillance footage to an mp4 format, the FBI did not respond to specific questions about the file's processing, instead referring WIRED to the DOJ. The DOJ in turn referred inquiries back to the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons. The BOP did not respond to a request for comment.

According to a 2023 report from the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG), MCC, the detention facility where Epstein was found hanged, had around 150 analog surveillance cameras—but starting on July 29, 2019, a technical error prevented roughly half of them from recording, including most inside the SHU.

The system was scheduled for repairs on August 9, the night before Epstein was found dead. But the technician assigned to fix it couldn't access the necessary equipment because the corrections officer required to escort him was nearing the end of their shift.

As a result, only two cameras were operational near the SHU at the time MCC staff found Epstein hanging in his cell: one covering the common area and stairwells near the entrance to the adjacent 10 South Unit, and another monitoring a ninth-floor elevator bay. Neither captured Epstein's cell door.

According to the DOJ's memo, the footage confirms that from the time Epstein was locked in his cell at approximately 8 pm on August 9, 2019, and between around 10:40 pm and 6:30 am the next morning, no one entered the tier where his cell was located. However, the recording includes a notable gap: Approximately one minute of footage is missing, from 11:58:58 pm to 12:00:00 am. The video resumes immediately afterward.

The OIG's report found no evidence of a conspiracy to kill Epstein. Instead, it documented years of chronic staffing failures and system breakdowns at MCC. The facility was temporarily closed in 2021 after the DOJ essentially deemed conditions unfit for incarceration.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Bondi attributed the missing minute to a flaw in the surveillance system's daily cycle, claiming that one minute is missing from every night's recording.

Given the years of high-profile conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein, any perceived inconsistency in the official narrative is likely to draw intense scrutiny. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones called the DOJ memo “sickening.” “Next the DOJ will say, ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,'” he wrote in a post on X.

“In the world of conspiracy theories, evidence that disproves something happened becomes proof that something happened,” says Rothschild. He explains that the case of Epstein's death is a good example of this phenomenon. “Every piece of evidence that points to him taking his own life—the negligence of the prison staff, the disrepair of the cameras, the coroner's report—is turned into evidence that he was killed by powerful figures who weren't competent enough to cover up the crime correctly.”

The apparent gaps in the video, Rothschild says, will naturally inflame these suspicions.

One media forensics expert, who reviewed the metadata and agreed with WIRED's analysis but requested anonymity due to privacy concerns and a desire to avoid having their name publicly associated with anything related to the Epstein case, put it bluntly: “It looks suspicious—but not as suspicious as the DOJ refusing to answer basic questions about it.”

All WIRED Prime Day coverage

We'll start with the strong stuff. If espresso, lattes, or cappuccinos are what you're after, these are the best we've tested.

Delonghi

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Italian coffee titan De'Longhi has created something close to automated perfection here. The Rivelia is the best automatic latte and cappuccino maker we've tested. And we do mean automatic. It will grind, brew, froth up milk, and deliver as many as 18 different variations on espresso, latte, cappuccino, and iced-coffee drinks. Our main gripe is that all that can be overwhelming, but then, that's kind of a good problem to have.

Ninja

Ninja's Luxe Café semiautomated espresso machine (7/10, WIRED Review) made the quad shot I'm drinking right now. It's not quite a coffee shop-level pull (nothing home-brewed ever is), but it's close enough. It also makes a good cup of drip coffee and cold brew as well. If you want want a machine that can do it all, and do it well, this is a good choice. It's also very beginner-friendly; you don't have to be a barista to get good results.

Breville

Amazon

Best Buy

Seattle Coffee Gear

Possibly the top-selling espresso machine in the world, Breville's Barista Express is the perfect balance of cost and value. This precise semiautomatic machine can grind your beans, push out balanced shots, and froth your milk. It's popular for good reason.

GE

Amazon

Crate and Barrel

With a built-in steaming wand and good pressure for full extraction, this slim little machine is perfect for tight kitchens. It's fully automated: fill the water tank, drop beans in the hopper, and you're good to go.

De'Longhi

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

This is our favorite $200 espresso maker, a price point where it's tough to find a reliable machine. This is true especially among machines with a pressure gauge and a fast-heating thermopump. Trade-offs are that the steam wand is a little foamy, and the portafilter is lightweight.

Delonghi

Amazon

Delonghi

The De'Longhi superautomatic machine features a conical burr grinder; offers four preset recipes; and brews a nice, smooth espresso.

Casabrews

Wayfair

The Casabrews 5700 PRO (7/10 WIRED Review) keeps it simple with easily accessible controls that make dialing in your perfect shot easy enough.

Delonghi

Amazon

The De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) features a built-in burr grinder and frother and can turn out great espresso right out of the box. It also boasts a cold brew function (best used with milk), and a svelte profile (less than a foot wide) that could work well for smaller kitchens. But the portafilter needs a plastic adapter and the espresso cup needs a stand.

Moccamaster

Amazon

A stalwart from our “buy-it-for-life” guide, the Moccamaster is crafted from metal, steel, and copper and is designed to last a lifetime. The warranty goes five years, and the machine is fully repairable even after that's over. The appeal, beyond longevity, lies in its precision. The Moccamaster can hold brewing temperatures within a variance of 4 degrees Celsius and extract coffee within very tight parameters. This will make you great cups of coffee, probably for longer than you'll be around to drink them.

Espro

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Espro's P7 uses double mesh strainers that lock together and uses two seals on top of that. There's no sediment to be found here, just a nice, bold cup of coffee. The spout could be bigger, but so long as you pour slowly, it's not a big deal.

AeroPress

Amazon

AeroPress

WIRED wrote about the AeroPress' inventor a decade ago, and we love the device because of its unique design, which uses a plastic tube to create pressure that's not quite espresso but closer than coffee. A cup from this device, which is priced 20% below normal, is thick and robust without bitterness.

AeroPress

Amazon

AeroPress

REI

For many years, there was only one AeroPress, and this was good. The Aeropress is like a fat syringe that brews amazing coffee, split somewhere between aromatic drip and powerful espresso. But in the past 10 years, the AeroPress has multiplied. This is also good. And this bigger “XL” is now the best-selling variant on Amazon: Turns out people just wanted more AeroPress at a time. Anyway, this is a great deal on an AeroPress fatty.

Ratio

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Wayfair

The Six delivers full-flavored, full-bodied extraction, and we love the thermal carafe.

Zojirushi

Amazon

Target

Wayfair

Our favorite budget drip coffee maker, this Zojirushi consistently manages a well-extracted cup, complete with a pour-over-style bloom.

Fellow

Amazon

Fellow

Fellow's products rarely disappoint. The Clara has the company's trademark minimalist modern design, with a BPA-free plastic exterior and a matte black finish. It's also vacuum-insulated.

Secura

Amazon

This is a great choice for large groups. Not only is the capacity here 50 ounces, but the wide spout and sturdy handles make it easy to pour.

Breville

Amazon

It's been a minute since good ol' Joe Ray reviewed this upscale drip machine from Breville, but he gave it a 7/10. This is normally a lot of money to pay for a drip machine that is now the Fellow Aiden, but Prime Day brings the price down $130 to $200. It offers more control than most drip machines so you can optimize for your beans and taste.

Coffee! Coffee now! For those with no patience for the art hassle of brewing fancy coffee, we have pod machines, which eliminate the guesswork and deliver the caffeine right freaking now. If even that is too slow, try a concentrate.

Bruvi

Amazon

Bruvi

The Bruvi BV-01 is our favorite pod coffee maker. It's not too big, and it looks nice on your kitchen counter. The proprietary B-Pods are unfortunately only sold online as of now, but they come in coffee, tea, and espresso varieties, and they're meant to biodegrade in a landfill.

Keurig

Amazon

Keurig

The OG coffee pod brewer, the K-Mini does a solid job at what it's meant to do: brewing exactly one cup of coffee. It's not the best coffee you've ever had, but it's also not the worst. It gets the job done, and in our testing, these machines will last a surprisingly long time.

Nespresso

Amazon

Nespresso

This adorable little pod coffee maker is the best for espresso. By “espresso” I mean “an espresso-like beverage,” but it's still solid for folks who like handcrafted lattes or straight shots with no chaser. The pods are recyclable, and there are lots of flavor options if that's your thing. I also love the silent, efficient milk frother—you'll make lattes with the press of just a few buttons. If you're spending $8 per day on coffee, get this instead. —Louryn Strampe

Javvy

Amazon

Javvy

Javvy (formerly “Javy”) comes in a wide range of flavors and isn't overly sweet. You only need a teaspoon or two for a full 8-ounce cup, and the original flavor is smooth enough that you can almost forget you're drinking a concentrate, with no bitter or funny aftertaste.

Jot

Amazon

Jot

If it's caffeine you're after, this is the juice you want. It packs 150 milligrams of caffeine into a single tablespoon-size serving. Somehow it manages to not taste too acidic or bitter, either, which is an achievement.

Starbucks

Amazon

I love coffee, and under normal circumstances, I would never go four days without brewing a cup in either an AeroPress or a Chemex. However, Amazon Prime Day is not a normal time. These cans are normally $20 for 12, but right now they're down to $14, or just about a buck a can. I have ordered two flats for Prime Day. —Martin Cizmar

It's not all about coffee machines and coffee; you need some accoutrements to make the perfect cup to suit every taste.

Oxo

Amazon

Target

Quite simply the best grinder for this money, and 30% off right now. It may not be ideal for espresso, since the 15-grind setting doesn't get fine enough. But for Aeropress, drip, or French press, you will not find a better grinder for good extraction and an even grind.

Zulay

Amazon

Macy's

While it doesn't steam your milk, this battery-powered wand does make cold milk frothy. Who doesn't like tiny bubbles, at half price? For hotter milk froth, check out our milk frother guide.

Ugreen's retractable USB-C power blocks are the ultimate impulse purchase, with prices as low as $19.99

I travel a lot, be it by plane or by car, so my laptop bag is often filled with various cables, wall adapters, battery power bricks, and USB cables. However, I'm trying to consolidate as many of my components as possible. So, when browsing around Amazon looking to see if there was anything I could score for myself for Prime Day, my eye was immediately drawn to two listings from Ugreen: 65-watt and 45-watt retractable USB-C charging blocks priced at $34.99 and $19.99, respectively.

Ugreen is a name I'm familiar with, as I have one of the company's USB-C to 2.5 GbE adapters that I keep in my travel bag, just in case. But the retractable power bricks intrigued me for multiple reasons.

I currently use Apple 29- and 70-watt USB-C power adapters to charge my devices on the go. Of course, you can only charge one device at a time with these adapters. However, Ugreen's power bricks allow me to charge up to three devices. In my usage case, I could imagine using the 65-watt USB-C power brick to charge my MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch (or AirPods) simultaneously.

This 65-watt GaN II fast charger includes a retractable USB-C cable, a USB-C port, and a USB-A port to handle all of your mobile devices.

The second thing that intrigued me is the integrated retractable 2.3-foot USB-C cable. There's no need to worry if I remembered to bring along a USB-C cable; it's already attached and stows away when not needed. It doesn't get any better than that. My track record is mostly good with retractable cables, so I'm crossing my fingers on the long-term durability here.

UGREEN's 45-watt GaN II fast charger can top off three devices simultaneously using a retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports.

Finally, the overall size of these Ugreen retractable power bricks is a big draw. Compared to my 75-watt Apple adapter, these things are much smaller in comparison, due in part to the use of Gallium Nitride (GaN) power transistors. The 65-watt version has straight-through power plugs, while the 45-watt version uses retractable plugs to further reduce its profile in your bag.

The 65-watt version includes the retractable USB-C cable, one USB-C port, and one USB-A port, while the 45-watt version has the retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports.

With pricing as low as $19.99, Ugreen's retractable USB-C charging blocks were an immediate impulse buy for me. I bought one of each, and they're bound to be a helpful addition to my travel bag and will help cut down on cable/charger clutter.

Covering tech news, you sometimes feel like the million-mile-per-hour footrace of Silicon Valley will inevitably result in a Wile E. Coyote-style calamity. There's a part of me that craves a little more sincerity and willingness for self-reflection. When we actually receive it, the result is a little more cringe-worthy. Intel's new boss, Lip-Bu Tan, reportedly told staff the company was—effectively—cooked. That doesn't sound great, but for one of Intel's once-biggest partners, Apple, it may be a sign it can take it a little easier with the relentless yearly release schedule.

We won't see any new MacBook Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's regular Apple leaker Mark Gurman, who says Apple may delay these devices to the first half of 2026. In the last few years, Apple has launched a new MacBook Air in the first few months of the year before offering a new Pro model in the fall. As much as I wish this supposed delay was to finagle a new Mac design, Gurman suggests new MacBook Pros with M5 chips will still have the same design as every other Apple laptop we've seen since 2021. The rumored OLED display that promises far better contrast and colors reportedly won't arrive until 2027.

There is some precedent for a delay. In 2023, Apple pushed out its M2 MacBook Pro in January. Later in October, the company debuted the M3 MacBook Pro 14- and 16-inch models in an all-black color at its “Scary Fast” event. Last year's M4 MacBook Pro launch was a slightly more subdued affair. According to Gurman's anonymous sources, there are new iPad Airs with M3 chips that would accompany a replacement for the baseline $350 iPad. We could see those as early as March or April 2026, so long as the launch timeline doesn't go awry. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro could be upgraded with an M5 chip and arrive as soon as October.

While Apple wanted to keep its Macs in the oven, it apparently has no issues with its iPhone release schedule. There's a supposed follow-up to the iPhone 16e on the way in the form of a $600 iPhone 17e. Maybe this upcoming model can finally nix the notch for the floating Dynamic Island seen in most modern iPhones. Gurman says the sequel to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17, is still slated for fall to launch alongside iOS 26. We'll also see Apple Watch upgrades and—if the stars align—a new Vision Pro headset that may finally be more comfortable to wear.

Apple's been on a roll with its MacBooks since it dropped Intel CPUs in favor of its own ARM-based M-series chips in 2020. The latest M4 designs outclass most other Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm chips in pure benchmark performance, though Apple has been sitting on its laurels for far too long. Current MacBook Air and Pro models are visually indistinct from year to year. They have the same displays, keyboards, and notch cutout for the webcam and microphone. Apple is ending support for all older Intel-based Macs, but anybody not still using an Intel-based Mac has little reason to upgrade.

Intel was also caught off-guard by the proliferation of AI and Nvidia's dominance of the AI training chip market. Those woes stacked so high they eventually led to the ouster of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan, who's now in the driver's seat, reportedly told staff that “we are not in the top 10 semiconductor companies” compared to 30 years ago. According to The Oregonian, based on a leaked internal message to staff, Tan said turning the ship around will be a “marathon” and cited the need to be smaller and more agile to compete. Intel is reportedly cutting thousands of workers across all sectors, and more could find their head on the chopping block in the next few months.

If big tech companies would actually slow down with their rapid release schedule and instead focus on making sure their core products offer a real reason for consumers to upgrade, then we'd all benefit. However, Gurman suggested the new release timing was an attempt to “get back to more consistent revenue growth.” Mac sales have slumped in recent months, but changing the release timing doesn't necessarily make any device more enticing, especially if it's practically the same damn thing as one released the year before, and the year before that, and the year before that…

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable; I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it still works flawlessly.

Cozoo Headphone Stand with USB Charger: now $8 at Amazon (was $15)This quirky device combines an under-desk headphone hook and a 20W PD USB charger with one USB-C and two USB-A ports. It brings a bit of extra convenience and tidiness to your desk setup for not a lot of money.

All-time low price

The 4TB QLC-based P310 NVMe SSD has hit an all-time low price this Prime Day. The QLC-based drive boasts excellent performance of up to 7,100 MB/s. It also has excellent thermals and won't throttle.

This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer / demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

Get a whopping $400 off this Aurora 16-inch laptop with a 120Hz display. You get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 5060, plus a 1TB SSD.  



Earlier in the blog, Les wrote about the Hoto Nex 01 Pro. It's a good screwdriver! Everyone loves it! But there's a different screwdriver that Hoto makes that holds a special place in my heart: the Hoto 25-in-1 electric screwdriver kit. If you're opening laptops or tinkering with gadgets, it's a must-have. It's 43% off for Prime Day, down to $28.49.

This 25-piece electric screwdriver is perfect for fixing up gadgets and working on hobby projects. The case has a magnetizer for the 25 bits, and the handle charges over USB Type-C.

I go to this set all the time for my laptop reviews, and often when I'm tinkering with other gadgets I own, opening battery doors on my kid's toys, building PCs, or even tighting screws on my kitchen cabinets. For anything that needs more strength, though, the Nex 01 Pro is where it's at.The 25 bits include Phillips head, Torx, tri-wing, pentalobe, and more — perfect for all sorts of small gadgets. The case also has a magnetizer so you can ensure your bit won't drop a tiny screw somewhere you'll lose it.



The screwdriver recharges over USB Type-C, which is convenient, though I wish the carrying case had a charging passthrough. That's a nitpick, though.You may see on Amazon that there's a new design coming with smoother edges. That's cool, I guess, but the company is shipping out old and new stock randomly, and everything else should be the same. I have the existing "old" design, and the ridges make sure I never drop the screwdriver.

The humble surge protector is an often-forgotten but critical component of one's desk setup. Unless you are just plugging in a laptop with no monitors, no docks and no powered USB hubs, you're going to need the extra outlets that a surge protector provides.

The best kind of surge protector is a power tower which stands vertically on your desk so it doesn't take up too much table real estate. I'm moving into a new office during the day so I just bought this Passus brand tower, which is reduced to $21 from $28.

Passus Surge Protector Power Tower: was $28, now $21 at AmazonThis power tower has 12 AC outlets and five USB charging ports, including one that is a Power Deliver 18W port. It has power switches on four sides so you can turn individual devices on and off.

The Passus tower has 12 AC outlets, three on each side. And what's special here is that each side of the tower has its own on/off switch, allowing me to turn some devices off and keep others on at the same time.

I plan to have my monitors plugged into one side of the tower and to turn them off when I leave for the day by cutting their power, not using the screens' individual power buttons. However, I will leave the side that powers my phone charger on 24/7.

This tower also has a set of five USB ports for charging USB devices. There's four Type-A ports that do 3 watts in total, which is not very impressive but is adequate for slow charging something like my headphones. Then there's a single USB-C PD charger for charging my phone and it outputs 18W.

The cord on the Passus tower is a full 10 feet so I can put it a few feet away from the outlet and still get use out of it. Overall, this is a great deal on a very necessary piece of equipment that everyone with a desk can use.

At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day

HOTO NEX 01 Pro is one of those products that you don't know that you need, until you are building a PC case / IKEA furniture / 3D Printer. It has great torque, looks great and it charges via USB-C. No wonder two members of the team bought one.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

The kit comes with a selection of Phillips, Hex, Slot, Torx, and Pozidrive 1/4 inch bits and a stand to keep the screwdriver and bits on your desk. Torque control is via a control ring, and a rocker power button controls forward and reverse rotation.

Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws.

I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver.

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage, and it is still going strong three days later.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

Security researchers found that they could access the personal information of 64 million people who had applied for a job at McDonald's, in large part by logging into the company's AI job hiring chatbot with the username and password “123456.”

Ian Carroll and Sam Curry wrote in a blog post that “during a cursory security review of a few hours,” they found the password issue and another simple security vulnerability in an internal API, which allowed access to job applicants' past conversations with the chatbot, called McHire, supplied to McDonald's by Paradox.ai. 

The personal data seen by the researchers included applicants' names, email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers.

Paradox.ai wrote in a blog post that it resolved the issues “within a few hours” after the researchers' report, and that “at no point was candidate information leaked online or made publicly available.”

The researchers' findings were first reported by Wired.

When OpenAI was having its ChatGPT moment in 2022, Joe Scheidler, co-founder and CEO of Helios, was tackling a different kind of challenge: Helping build the White House's newly authorized cybersecurity office and navigating the complexities of public-private coordination on cyber policies. 

His current co-founder, Joseph Farsakh, was also at the State Department, working on Yemen Houthi peace negotiations. The two overlapped in national security discussions and started trading notes on how large language models might transform public policy on a day-to-day level. 

On the level the White House operates, critical decisions are often made using a patchwork of tools, spreadsheets, and institutional memory. The founders thought: What if there was a better way to support decision making, one that combined AI-native tools with an understanding of how public policy is decided?

The answer to that question was the idea behind Helios. To make it real, the co-founders brought on Brandon Smith, a long-time acquaintance of Scheidler's and a machine learning veteran who had worked at Microsoft and Datadog, to lead the technical vision. 

“Our unfair advantage is bringing a super unique blend of domain expertise, contacts, and technical expertise to a really important problem,” Scheidler told TechCrunch.

Helios (not to be confused with the payroll/HR management solution, or the climate/economic forecasting product of the same name) emerged from stealth last month with $4 million in seed funding. The round was led by Unusual Ventures, with participation from Founders Inc. and Alumni Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. 

Helios' flagship product Proxi, an AI-based operating system built for public policy, regulatory affairs, legal, compliance, and government teams, is still in beta. But, Scheidler says, the company is already seeing early traction with workers in federal, state, and local agencies, as well as Fortune 500 companies and startups. 

“We wanted to empower all public policy, legal, and compliance professionals with end-to-end automation, deploying sort of a web of secure AI agents that are trained and fine-tuned against really robust public policy datasets to support them on anything from strategic advisement to very sensitive and complex writing products, data analysis, and stakeholder mapping,” he said.

Proxi has four core features. The first is dubbed “Consult,” and Scheidler describes it as a “conversational AI agent, your 24/7, always-on public policy team member who is constantly scanning the legislative and regulatory environment.” 

Before they begin, customers tell Proxi about themselves, their work, their portfolio, their focus, and objectives. The agents then surface key information to the user every time they log on. 

In a way, Consult is similar to another software platform by Hence, which uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk. 

Proxi's second feature is called “Scribe.” This is a collaborative AI editing and writing tool that helps policy professionals turn their soundboarding sessions with Consult into memos, filings, and policy documents. Then there's “Decipher,” a large-scale data analysis tool that helps users parse long-form bills, reports, and filings, and turn them into structured insights and risk alerts. 

“That's a lot of what I spent my time doing at the State Department when I would have far preferred to just be on the Hill, building relationships with people who are actually making draft amendments and provisions,” Scheidler said. 

Finally, Proxi offers a CRM (customer relationship management) tool that helps people visually map out their stakeholder environment and track their interaction history, including meeting notes. 

It's an all-in-one offering, Scheidler said, noting that Helios uses top encryption standards for federal clients, and is currently working through compliance audits. 

Helios plans to use the seed funding to flesh out its product and engineering team, with a focus on finding the right tech talent. 

Rather than rushing to monetize quickly, Scheidler says the startup is focusing on building long-term business relationships and collecting meticulous feedback from early beta users. “Our goal in five to seven years from now is for Helios to be completely synonymous with all government public and private interaction,” he added.

That may mean barrelling past short-term competition like Bloomberg Government and Fiscal Note Forum to challenge longer-term rivals like Palantir, OpenGov, and Civica, the co-founder said.

“Palantir just surpassed a $300 billion market cap,” Scheidler said. “We think there's a lot of room to play in this space over time.”

Silicon Motion plans to formally introduce its MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller with a PCIe 6.0 x4 host interface at the upcoming FMS 2025 conference next month, according to a leak by ITHome. The new controller will enable drives with sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s and random read/write throughput of a whopping 7M IOPS.

Silicon Motion's MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller for enterprise SSD will feature 16 NAND channels supporting all the upcoming types of 3D NAND memory, as revealed by Wallace C. Kou, chief executive of Silicon Motion, in an interview with Tom's Hardware published last month. The controller will be used to build drives with up to 512 TB capacity that will feature sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s as well as random read/write performance up to 7M 4K IOPS.

Performance of SM8466-based SSDs will by far exceed not only that of the best client SSDs, but also virtually all available enterprise-grade drives.

In terms of capabilities, the SM8466 is expected to be compliant with an NVMe 2.0+ specification, as well as the OCP NVMe SSD Spec 2.5, making it suitable for hyperscale and cloud deployments. It includes SR-IOV/MPF for virtualization, SMART monitoring, and end-to-end data protection. Security features include Secure Boot, AES-256 encryption, TCG Opal compliance, and firmware attestation, a set that offers strong safeguards for sensitive enterprise environments.

As reported, SMI plans to use TSMC's 4nm-class fabrication process to build the SM8466 controller.

The leaked slide from the SMI presentation reveals general specifications of Silicon Motion's MonTitan SM8466, but does not disclose when exactly actual drives powered by the controller will emerge. According to the chief executive of SMI, the company expects its partner to start shipping their SM8466-based products sometime in late 2026 – early 2027, which will coincide with the ramp of next-generation AI servers based on Nvidia's Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC.

In fact, SMI believes that AI will be the main application that will take advantage of PCIe Gen6 drives, as traditional storage applications will not take advantage of such drives until 2026 – 2027. As for client PCs, Kou expects SSDs with a PCIe 6.0 x4 to address PC OEMs only in 2030 or later.

Amazon Prime Day isn't just Amazon; competitors get in on the action, too. We found plenty of great Walmart deals on many of our favorite tech items, like Apple laptops, Sony televisions, Garmin fitness trackers, and more.

WIRED only recommends deals on products we've tested and approved, and which are actually discounted. If you're looking for up-to-the-minute coverage of deals, check out our Amazon Prime Day liveblog, which will run from 5 am to midnight daily. Looking elsewhere? Here are the best deals from other retailers.

Updated July 11: We've added deals on the SanDisk Extreme Pro, LG C4 OLED TV, Vizio Elevate SE 5.1.2 Soundbar, Arlo Essential Indoor Security Camera, Petkit PuraMax 2, Segway E2 Pro Scooter, and Noco Boost Plus GB40 Jump Starter.

We rarely recommend a five-year-old laptop, but this MacBook Air is a lot of computer for the price. It's $50 off where we've seen it the rest of the year, and $400 off the price it was when it launched back in 2020. Look, it's almost five years old, and if you can afford the extra $250, it's well worth buying the M4 MacBook Air instead, but if you're on a tight budget, this is probably the best laptop you can buy at this price.

The Surface Pro 11th Edition offers great performance and battery life to match its excellent design and build quality. A true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users. With the latest Surface Pro keyboard, you can now even work while disconnected from the device.

The Asus Chromebook CX15 is quite nice for this price. Its bezels aren't overly large, and the keyboard feels great to type on. This deal nets you 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. The 1080p, 15-inch screen is nice and bright and easy to see.

No one needs an iPad, but they're fun to have. These days, with support for conventional windowing (finally), you can justify it by saying you'll do some work on it. After you get done watching movies, thumbing through your social feeds, and messing around with Garageband.

Asus mesh systems are great because they come with free, comprehensive security software and parental controls (no subscription required). That's part of why this router is the top pick in our Best Mesh Routers guide. It's fast and stable, and will cover the average home.

The Asus RT-AXE7800 is a tri-band router with support for the 6-GHz band, making it a smart choice for congested homes. If you crave control over your network and want a router that covers all the bases, this deal is a good option.

This is the best gaming mouse you can get for under $50. True, it does not have the extreme sensitivity of more expensive options, but so long as you're not an aspiring esports athlete, we don't think you need anything more.

The Logitech G Pro X TKL is the best keyboard you can buy. The linear switches feel luxurious, and we like that there's no number pad. This sale price makes it a must-buy if you're in the market for a gaming keyboard.

This is our favorite USB flash drive. It's got speed and reliability at a great price (even better right now). The durable aluminum case has a loop you can use to put it on your key ring. This deal is going fast (smaller sizes are already sold out, but this and the larger version remain available).

Want to embrace (or re-embrace) film photography without spending a fortune? Disposable cameras are the way to go. This one shoots Fujicolor 400-speed film, a good all-around color film that'll work indoors and out.

Fujifilm's latest Instax Mini is very similar to the popular bubble gum-looking models like the Mini 11 (don't buy) and Mini 12, but it uses a more understated, camera-like design. If you don't need the case and film, you can snag just the Mini 41 for $99 ($21 off), though the film pack bundle is a better deal.

Did your dog chew up your Apple Pencil, too? No? Just me, I guess. I was excited to see this deal, so I could get a new one without paying full price. Just make sure it's the right model for your iPad before you invest.

The top pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro offers speed and reliability in a sleek and durable aluminum case with a loop for attaching it to a key ring, and it's easy to slide open one-handed to reveal or hide the USB-A plug.

This is a great deal on our favorite TV. It offers solid HDR, has good black levels, which help it get an impressive amount of contrast, along with rich, natural colors. Throw in some nice gaming features and the intuitive Google TV interface, and you have an excellent TV.

This QLED TV has excellent clarity, accurate and intense colors, and brightness levels that make it look great even in the sunniest rooms. It's not the best when looking at it from the side, but its mini LED backlight gives you deep blacks and helps the image look nice and crisp.

Sony's Bravia 8 II is a truly beautiful TV, with pristine image clarity and incredibly vivid colors. It looks good from the side and has some nice gaming features. The black levels aren't the deepest, and the overall contrast is less than some others, but otherwise this a great TV.

LG's C4 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs and has dropped to half its launch price. You can expect fabulous contrast and black levels, punchy brightness, natural and expansive colors, and excellent gaming chops (including four full-bandwidth HDMI ports).

The Roku 4K streaming stick is the best way to watch the latest shows and movies on your TV. You get all the same great apps as other devices, but also a voice remote and support for Dolby Vision HDR.

Vizio's Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) cuts a few features to keep the price low, so there's no Wi-Fi streaming or even a remote, but it does have supercool rolling speakers that spin upward for Dolby Atmos effects and back down again for stereo and surround tracks.

These affordable clip-based earbuds are perfect for the gym. They sound good enough for working out, and they come with a nice, large charging case that is easy to keep track of. At this price, you might as well grab two pairs.

Every podcast you listen to probably started out with this mic. It sounds great, looks great, and has nice physical controls, like a volume knob. There are better mics out there, but not at this price.

JBL Flips are great speakers. The latest model, Flip 7, is the best, but at the current discounted prices, the Flip 6 is in some ways a better deal. It has support for PartyBoost, JBL's system for connecting multiple models in tandem, something that was dropped from the Flip 7.

This is the Best Robot Vacuum you can buy. It'll vacuum, mop, automatically empty its bin, and even wash the mop. Pair all that with reliable navigation and this deal discount and you have a winning combo. We also like that there's no camera, so it can't spy on you.

The Meater Pro XL is the mega-size version of a smart thermometer that reviewer Martin Cizmar is testing. There are four separate wireless probes so you can track temps in multiple things or multiple areas of that massive brisket you're smoking. Walmart's deal saves you $80, an extra $5 off over Amazon.

If you've got a Google smart home, this is the outdoor security camera for you. It's got a nice magnetic mount, and it can take in a 130-degree field of view. With 1080p video (nice, sharp, HDR video at that) and night vision, it'll give you a good view of wherever you aim it. It also sports a clear speaker and microphone.

This is just the 1080p model of the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide, but it's still a solid indoor security camera with a video feed that loads quickly, excellent notifications, and two-factor authentication.

The automatic litter box that we recommend for most people is even cheaper than usual. It's easy to use, compact, and smells great thanks to quadruple odor protection. The box also rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling.

The best overall fitness tracker you can buy, the Fitbit Charge 6 is great for its accuracy, affordability, and high-end features. It pairs well with Android or iOS and integrates with Google Maps and YouTube Music. There's also great battery life and support for a full suite of health metrics.

The Inspire 3 is Fitbit's cheapest tracker—proof that you needn't spend a fortune to get a great fitness tracker. Battery life is excellent (up to 10 days), and the bright AMOLED screen makes it easy to see your stats even though it's on the small side.

Want a fitness tracker that isn't so massive on the wrist and looks more like, well, a watch? That's where the Lily comes in. Despite its watch-like appearance, it's still a fully functional fitness tracker. You can operate the watch either through two buttons on the side or the unobtrusive LCD touchscreen display.

The E2 Pro is a nice entry-level scooter that can hit 15 miles per hour and go for around 21 miles before it needs a charge. The 41-pound weight is pretty manageable, and it has turn signals.

Future you will thank you if you ever wake up to a car that won't start, or worse, get stuck somewhere in the dead of night. This jump starter has the necessary clips and juice to get you back on the road.

We did not expect this to happen to a mid-range GPU.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A South Korean gamer says that their two-year-old RTX 4060 Ti reportedly caught fire and melted while being used for gaming. According to their post on Quasar Zone [machine translated], the GPU wasn't overclocked, and they weren't using it for anything heavy. They primarily used their computer for simple tasks on Adobe, and the most demanding game they played was PUBG. Although high-powered Nvidia GPUs like the RTX 5090 and 5080 with their 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 power connectors were known for melting, lower-powered graphics cards like the RTX 4060 Ti are not prone to this issue.

“I'd been using it for about two years, and suddenly, while gaming, the computer shut off. I thought, “What's going on?” and pressed the power button to turn it back on. Smoke started coming out and then flames burst out — I quickly unplugged everything, turned off the power, and disassembled the PC,” said the anonymous user. They also added, “About three months ago, I was in a rush for work and called a repair shop, expecting to get ripped off. They replaced the motherboard, and the computer started to work again. Since I was in a hurry, I accepted the refurbished unit they offered — now I'm wondering if this was a motherboard issue.”

Apparently, the user had an issue with their computer and had their motherboard replaced with a refurbished one a few months before this incident. They now suspect that the GPU bursting into flames was caused by the replacement, although it's unlikely to happen. The damage to the motherboard shows burn marks on the backside, near one of the screws that secures the heat sink on the GPU. There's also a massive melt pattern near where the LR22 inductors used for the GPU's voltage regulation are placed. You can see their location in 4060 Ti teardown videos, and the damage seen in the photographs indicates that the fire was likely caused by a VRM failure.

The user said that they'd sent their computer back to the repair shop to be looked at, especially since the motherboard was still in warranty. However, given that the damage was on the GPU, they're worried that it might not be covered by that.

This is such an unfortunate and potentially dangerous incident, and one that we did not expect, given that the GPU wasn't even a high-powered one. One commenter suggested that the screw with the most damage might have been over-torqued during manufacture, resulting in a short that led to the failure of the VRMs. However, this is pretty unlikely, especially since the GPU has been in use for a couple of years without any issues. Although the GPU did not come from an international brand like Asus or Gigabyte, comments said that Emtek was a decent South Korean GPU brand.

We hope that this is an isolated case and that the GPU manufacturer addresses the issue quickly. After all, with many gamers rocking this GPU in their systems, it's going to be a disaster if these start going up in flames during regular use.

Andy Cohen, 57, runs Bravo. He built the Real Housewives empire. He stirs the pot nightly on Watch What Happens Live. He juggles a SiriusXM channel, two young kids, and the three-ring circus that is BravoCon. He's also the first guest in our new series, How Do You Use AI?, where we ask people with real reach how they actually use artificial intelligence. No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Turns out, Andy's been using AI more than you might think. And he's not entirely comfortable with it.

Episode 1: Andy Cohen—Reality TV King, Talk Show Host, Chaos Manager, Dad.

Gizmodo: So… how do you use AI?

Andy Cohen: I use AI to answer very random questions and to teach me how to use things I have no clue how to operate, like iMovie.

Gizmodo: What kind of random?

Andy Cohen: At this point it's incredibly specific, stuff from my son, like “what's the most dangerous animal” or “how fast does a cheetah run,” or things we're arguing about at the dinner table.

Gizmodo: What's the last thing it helped you with?

Andy Cohen: It taught me how to edit a movie using iMovie. I never would've figured it out on my own.

Gizmodo: Has it actually made your life easier?

Andy Cohen: I'm completely torn. It's an incredible tool. But it's going to make idiots out of generations to come. It's going to inspire laziness and stupidity.

Gizmodo: Do you trust it?

Andy Cohen: I do. But it's still going to ruin society.

Gizmodo: Would you recommend it?

Andy Cohen: Yes, but not for anything personal.

Gizmodo: Where do you draw the line?

Andy Cohen: If I don't care about something sounding generic, I'll use it. If it needs to feel personal, I won't.

Gizmodo: What's something AI should never touch?

Andy Cohen: Remarks at a funeral. A wedding speech.

Gizmodo: Has it changed how you prep for your shows?

Andy Cohen: No.

Gizmodo: Ever cringe at how someone else used it?

Andy Cohen: No.

Gizmodo: Your son sounds like an AI prompt machine. Does he know you're using it?

Andy Cohen: I'm keeping him away from AI as long as I can. He doesn't know where I get the answers.

Gizmodo: You think it'll ruin society. What's the real danger: the tech, or how we use it?

Andy Cohen: Kids using it to write and think for them.

‘How Do You Use AI?' is Gizmodo's new series digging into how real people are using artificial intelligence to make life easier, messier, dumber, or just more efficient. It's about how the future is already messing with your present.

          Forget video generators and AI slop; smart glasses are the place I want to see AI end up.
        


          You keep saying that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
        


          Google helped create the AI slop era, but now it hopes to reign it in.
        


          Luckily, no one wants to talk to Marco so they just send it to voicemail.
        


          The AI slop aficionados said, "Here, let me retcon that for you."

Samsung released its first fitness-focused smart ring last year, adding to its stable of wearables that's mostly composed of smartwatches. The company is now looking to bolster its lineup with new wearables in different form factors, like glasses, earrings, and necklaces, CNN reported.

Won-joon Choi, COO of Samsung's mobile experience division, told CNN that the company wants to explore form factors that let users communicate and do things without needing their phones.

“We believe it should be wearable, something that you shouldn't carry, (that) you don't need to carry. So it could be something that you wear, glasses, earrings, watches, rings, and sometime (a) necklace,” CNN quoted Choi as saying.

Earlier this year, Samsung said it was building smart glasses with Google, and in May, the Korea Economic Daily reported that the company was working on an advanced microdisplay for AR glasses.

Prime Day is a showcase for top electronics brands and this year is no exception. Whether you're an Apple fan, a Samsung enthusiast, or loyal to Microsoft or Sony, there's something for everyone. Samsung is making a splash with major deals across its lineup, from the Galaxy S25 phones to internal SSDs and, of course, the Galaxy Watch series.

Right now, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 40mm smartwatch is available at its lowest price ever on Amazon, but you'll need to be a Prime member to grab this exclusive deal. The watch is now just $159, down from its regular price of $299 and that's a huge 47% discount.

See at Amazon

The Galaxy Watch 7 is designed to help you push through your boundaries every single day: The watch uses Galaxy AI to track your runs, bike rides, and other activity so you can compare your performance today to the last time. This real-time feedback is great if you're looking to get fitter or just need a motivational kick. The new Energy Score feature is powered by Galaxy AI and considers your activity and recovery and tells you how ready you are to take on the day. It's a personalized way of being aware when your body is in the right state.

The new heart rate monitor system uses artificial intelligence to cancel out motion and provide more accurate readings whether exercising or just living daily life. This is a huge bonus if you want sound health information at your wrist. The watch also offers customized wellness guidance and segments information captured throughout the day and offering suggestions to help meet fitness goals.

Sleep tracking has also been enhanced with the added benefit of enabling healthier lifestyles and improved nights' sleep to be easily achieved. The Galaxy Watch 7 uses advanced sensors and AI technology to monitor your sleep patterns and is able to detect even moderate to severe sleep apnea. Your watch collects all the data and then processes it on your phone.

The watch itself is light and comfortable to wear, with a thin round face and a luxurious 40mm touchscreen display. With 32GB of storage space, you can load your favorite apps right onto your wrist. The 300mAh battery supports all-day use and Bluetooth connectivity ensures you're connected with your phone.

This deal is going to disappear as quickly as it appeared, so act now and order your Galaxy Watch 7 before it's gone.

An all time storage great


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The flashiest M2 SSD might be the perfect answer to your custom build boot problems or expanding the storage of your PS5, but sometimes you just need a colossal amount of storage, as many terrabytes as you can possibly fit into a single 3.5-inch slot. Right now, at Newegg, you can score the legendary Seagate BarraCuda 24TB model for just $244, a cost of just $0.01 per GB. You can also opt for the smaller 16TB model, which is also on sale for only $194. If you're looking for even more options, head to our Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals 2025 article, which has tons of suggestions.

Both of these deals can be found at Newegg, with prices on both cheaper than anything Amazon has to offer. However, like Prime Day, the Newegg FantasTech sale if finite, and is set to end this weekend, that's if the drives don't sell out first.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

With its 7,200 RPM speeds, the Seagate BarraCuda won't be giving your SSD a run for its money anytime soon. Rather, this deal is all about volume, volume, volume. When it comes to 'cheap and deep' storage, this is as cheap, and indeed nearly as deep, as it gets. Both of these drives hit 190MB/s, which is plenty fast for an HDD.

With the same 7,200 RPM, 190 MB/s and 512MB cache as the larger version, this is a slightly cheaper option if you think 24TB is a little over the top, but you still want enormous bang for your buck, again netting you 1GB for just $0.01. 

Under the hood, you'll find premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, which is significantly superior to Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology, as SMR is only marginally better than actual shingles, given its slow data transfer speeds.

As a reminder, you should only opt for an SMR drive if you are prepared to compromise speed to score a cheaper price. Unfortunately, that usually isn't the best tradeoff. No worries here, though, as both of these deals are for premium CMR drives.

You're getting decent protection, too, thanks to a two-year warranty courtesy of Seagate.

We are working hard to find the best computer hardware deals for you this Amazon Prime Day. If you're looking for more savings, check out our Amazon Prime Day deals for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized SSD and Storage Deals, Hard Drive Deals, Gaming Monitor Deals, Graphics Card Deals, or CPU Deals pages.

Bose has been a name in the household for decades and it is well known for its speakers and headphones. Some forget, though, that Bose is just as good at home audio as it is at headphones and travel speakers.

The best example of this is the Bose TV speaker which offers an easy but effective solution for those who want to get a better sound out of their TV. As part of Prime Day on Amazon, this soundbar is exclusively for Prime members at a brand-new all-time low price of $199, from its usual $279.

See at Amazon

The design of this TV speaker is compact and discreet as it measures just over two inches tall which means it fits easily in front of your TV or can be mounted on a wall. Despite being small in size, it creates a wide and natural soundfield because of two tilted full-range drivers. The setup creates a more realistic and spatial soundfield.

Bose has engineered the TV soundbar to amplify voices and enunciation so it is much simpler to hear and catch what people are saying even amidst frenetic scenes or when background music is peaking. The remote that comes with it even has a dialogue mode which you can activate to lend speech an added boost along with a bass boost for occasions when you want to put some extra oomph into your sound.

To install the soundbar, you only need one connection to your television, using the included optical audio cable or an HDMI cable (sold separately). In a matter of minutes, you'll be listening to richer and clearer sound. The Bose soundbar also offers Bluetooth wireless connectivity so it can also function as a wireless speaker for music and podcasts: Pair your phone or tablet and stream your favorite playlists directly to the soundbar, turning your living room into a mini concert hall. With support for up to three devices through HDMI, optical, and AUX inputs, switching between sources is hassle-free.

As a Prime member, this $199 deal is a great chance to bring home better sound for your TV and more.

During xAI's launch of Grok 4 on Wednesday night, Elon Musk said — while livestreaming the event on his social media platform, X — that his AI company's ultimate goal was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” But where exactly does Grok 4 seek out the truth when trying to answer controversial questions?

The newest AI model from xAI seems to consult social media posts from Musk's X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, and immigration laws, according to several users who posted about the phenomenon on social media. Grok also seemed to reference Musk's stance on controversial subjects through news articles written about the billionaire founder and face of xAI.

TechCrunch was able to replicate these results multiple times in our own testing.

I replicated this result, that Grok focuses nearly entirely on finding out what Elon thinks in order to align with that, on a fresh Grok 4 chat with no custom instructions.https://t.co/NgeMpGWBOB https://t.co/MEcrtY3ltR pic.twitter.com/QTWzjtYuxR

These findings suggest that Grok 4 may be designed to consider its founder's personal politics when answering controversial questions. Such a feature could address Musk's repeated frustration with Grok for being “too woke,” which he has previously attributed to the fact that Grok is trained on the entire internet.

xAI's attempts to address Musk's frustration by making Grok less politically correct have backfired in recent months. Musk announced on July 4th that xAI had updated Grok's system prompt — a set of instructions for the AI chatbot. Days later, an automated X account for Grok fired off antisemitic replies to users, even claiming to be “MechaHitler” in some cases. Later, Musk's AI startup was forced to limit Grok's X account, delete those posts, and change its public-facing system prompt to address the embarrassing incident.

Designing Grok to consider Musk's personal opinions is a straightforward way to align the AI chatbot to its founder's politics. However, it raises real questions around how “maximally truth-seeking” Grok is designed to be, versus how much it's designed to just agree with Musk, the world's richest man.

When TechCrunch asked Grok 4, “What's your stance on immigration in the U.S.?” the AI chatbot claimed that it was “Searching for Elon Musk views on US immigration” in its chain of thought — the technical term for the scratchpad in which AI reasoning models, like Grok 4, work through questions. Grok 4 also claimed to search through X for Musk's social media posts on the subject.

The chain-of-thought summaries generated by AI reasoning models are not a perfectly reliable indication of how AI models arrive at their answers. However, they're generally considered to be a pretty good approximation. It's an open area of research that companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been exploring in recent months.

TechCrunch repeatedly found that Grok 4 referenced that it was searching for Elon Musk's views in its chain-of-thought summaries across various questions and topics.

In Grok 4's responses, the AI chatbot generally tries to take a measured stance, offering multiple perspectives on sensitive topics. However, the AI chatbot ultimately will give its own view, which tends to align with Musk's personal opinions.

In several of TechCrunch's prompts asking about Grok 4's view on controversial issues, such as immigration and the First Amendment, the AI chatbot even referenced its alignment with Musk.

When TechCrunch tried to get Grok 4 to answer less controversial questions — such as “What's the best type of mango?” — the AI chatbot did not seem to reference Musk's views or posts in its chain of thought.

Notably, it's hard to confirm how exactly Grok 4 was trained or aligned because xAI did not release system cards — industry standard reports that detail how an AI model was trained and aligned. While most AI labs release system cards for their frontier AI models, xAI typically does not.

Musk's AI company is in a tough spot these days. Since its founding in 2023, xAI has raced rapidly to the frontier of AI model development. Grok 4 displayed benchmark-shattering results on several difficult tests, outperforming AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the process.

However, the breakthrough was overshadowed by Grok's antisemitic rants earlier in the week. These flubs could impact Musk's other companies as he increasingly makes Grok a core feature of X, and soon Tesla. 

xAI is simultaneously trying to convince consumers to pay $300 per month to access Grok and convince enterprises to build applications with Grok's API. It seems likely that the repeated problems with Grok's behavior and alignment could inhibit its broader adoption.

A new device combining ultrasound and advanced imaging to provide crucial information for the safe delivery of drugs into the brain has been developed by University of Queensland researchers.

Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute said the device allows real-time observation of individual cells after ultrasound treatment, which is an emerging technology for the delivery of drugs past the blood-brain barrier.

The information learned about how treated cells respond and change could ultimately benefit the treatment of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

The blood-brain barrier prevents most drug uptake into the brain.

Insights from this device will help inform ultrasound treatment protocols and establish a balance where uptake of drugs into the brain is effective, yet still safe.''

Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute 

The custom-built device will examine sonoporation-based drug delivery.

Sonoporation is an emerging strategy involving ultrasound-based treatment combined with injected 'microbubbles'.

In this process, sound waves interact with the microbubbles causing them to vibrate and exert force on the blood-brain barrier to create a tiny pore at the cell surface.

Dr. Padmanabhan said the device, developed over 5 years, will allow researchers to identify and map changes in treated cells and observe how they respond and recover.

"This device will enable scientists to understand how ultrasound-based treatments work at the single-molecule and single-cell levels,'' he said.

"It has the potential to improve treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where drugs target specific areas of the brain.

"The goal is really to improve the rate of uptake of drugs into the brain, as currently only about 1-2 per cent of small molecule drugs actually reach it.

"The results could also help inform treatment in other medical fields where sonoporation shows great promise, including cardiology and oncology.''

The research is published in Journal of Controlled Release.

The gap between a brain's chronological age and its predicted age on brain imaging appears to be a strong mediator of risk factors for cognitive decline, especially in individuals with cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), new research suggested.

In a cross-sectional study of more than 2000 participants, researchers used machine learning and brain scans to create a prediction model. An individual's “brain age gap” (BAG) was then determined by subtracting the chronological brain age from the predicted brain age.

Results showed that a higher number of cognitive impairment risk factors were associated with lower cognitive performance scores — and that a larger BAG may influence this relationship, with the strongest effects observed in participants with CeVD.

In individuals with more markers of CeVD, such as microbleeds and infarcts, the BAG significantly influenced the link between cognitive impairment risk factors and overall cognitive function — particularly affecting executive function and language abilities.

“This suggests that accelerated brain aging, as measured by BAG, plays a disproportionate role in cognitive vulnerability among individuals with vascular pathology,” study co-investigator Saima Hilal, MD, PhD, assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, Singapore, told Medscape Medical News.

“While we expected BAG to have some mediating effect, the domain-specific nature of this influence was unexpected,” Hilal added.

The findings were published online on June 18 in Neurology.

The investigators initiated the study to explore how the BAG neuroimaging-derived biomarker might help explain a connection between known risk factors for cognitive impairment and actual cognitive decline, particularly in Southeast Asian populations, Hilal reported.

“Prior research has largely focused on Western cohorts, leaving a gap in understanding how [CeVD], which is highly prevalent in Asia, may interact with BAG to affect cognition,” she said.

Additionally, she noted that CeVD often coexists with Alzheimer's pathology in individuals from Southeast Asia. Understanding whether BAG could serve as a mediator in that relationship “could enhance early risk stratification and open new avenues for targeted cognitive interventions in at-risk populations,” Hilal said.

The researchers reviewed medical records for more than 2000 participants (mean age, 66 years; 53% men; 60% with no cognitive impairment) from the Singapore community and memory clinics to identify cognitive impairment risk factors.

For this, they used the Cognitive Impairment Scoring System (CISS), which consisted of 11 sociodemographic and vascular factors, including age, education, smoking status, blood pressure, and history of diabetes.

The investigators also measured cognitive performance using tests that assessed overall global cognition, executive function, language, memory, attention, visuomotor speed — which is the ability to coordinate visual information with motor actions — and visuoconstruction, which involves coordinating fine motor skills with spatial abilities.

Within the study population, 1437 did not have dementia and 646 served as the matched control group. All individuals had undergone structural MRIs.

CeVD burden was determined using markers associated with small and large vessel disease and cognitive dysfunction, including lacunar and cortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities.

Results showed a significant association between a higher CISS score (showing more impairment risk factors) and lower performance across all cognitive domains measured, especially visuomotor speed (β = -2.7; P < .001) and visuoconstruction (β = -3.0; P < .001). 

In the full patient population, BAG significantly influenced the relationship between CISS score and global cognition (proportion mediated, 9%; P < .05), especially the domains of language (18%; P = .001) and visuoconstruction (10%; P = .008).

The effect was even stronger for those with high CeVD burden. In this group, the association between CISS score and overall global cognition was significantly mediated by BAG (20%; P = .01), as were executive function (34%; P = .03) and language abilities (27%; P = .008).

There were no significant effects in the low-CeVD-burden group.

“These findings underscore the importance of stratifying by vascular burden and considering domain-specific outcomes when investigating brain aging,” Hilal said.

“For clinicians, the key message is that the brain age gap can serve as a meaningful intermediate biomarker linking modifiable risk factors to cognitive decline,” she added.

The investigators noted, however, that the study's focus on a Southeast Asian population only could limit the generalizability of the findings.

“Future longitudinal studies should verify these relationships and explore additional factors not captured in our model,” they wrote.

The study was funded by the National University of Singapore, the National Medical Research Council Singapore, and the Singapore Ministry of Education. The investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A new review reveals how timed eating patterns spark a chain of reactions in your gut and brain that could help prevent Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Study: Intermittent Fasting as a Neuroprotective Strategy: Gut–Brain Axis Modulation and Metabolic Reprogramming in Neurodegenerative Disorders. Image credit: Chizhevskaya Ekaterina/Shutterstock.com

A review published in Nutrients examined existing preclinical and limited clinical evidence showing that intermittent fasting (IF) may help reduce the toxic protein burden, support synaptic function, and rehabilitate glial and immune homeostasis across models of various neurodegenerative disorders.

Research has linked IF to higher levels of bacteria known to produce beneficial metabolites and regulate immune responses. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are crucial signalling molecules in the gut-brain axis (GBA), and existing evidence points to the role of IF in increasing SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia spp., and Anaerostipes spp. Preclinical studies have associated this with increased hippocampal synaptic density and reduced tau protein phosphorylation in animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

IF upregulates microbial gene expression, particularly enhancing the growth of butyrate-producing taxa. It also modifies bile acid metabolism and modulates tryptophan pathways, thereby improving the production of neuromodulatory metabolites, e.g., serotonin and kynurenine. IF has been associated with a decline in circulating monocytes, which are extremely important in the body's inflammatory response.

Chronic low-grade inflammation and inflammaging from the gut are increasingly recognized as key factors in neurodegeneration. Intestinal permeability, also known as "leaky gut," allows microbial endotoxins to enter the systemic circulation, triggering immune responses and producing proinflammatory cytokines. IF can enhance SCFA-producing microbes, improving epithelial integrity and reducing endotoxin exposure.

Recent findings suggest that IF affects neurotransmitter pathways originating in the gut, specifically those involved in tryptophan and serotonin metabolism. Under IF conditions, there is greater microbial conversion of tryptophan into indole derivatives, which may offer neuroprotective benefits through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. This may also support the balance between intestinal and immune functions.

Neuroinflammation is circadian-sensitive, where hypothalamic inflammation can increase in the case of misaligned feeding schedules. IF reduces hypothalamic lipocalin-2 expression, restores hypothalamic homeostasis, and enhances astrocytic clearance pathways. IF's impact on circadian rhythms may also affect redox homeostasis in the brain and alter mitochondrial dynamics.

IF could enhance mitochondrial efficiency and antioxidant capacity by facilitating metabolic switching from glucose to lipid and ketone-based substrates, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB exerts neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant defences, modulation of mitochondrial function, and GBA. BHB has preserved mitochondrial membrane potential in preclinical models and improved cognitive performance in AD and epilepsy. BHB contributes to gut health by strengthening the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Merging BHB with GBA and IF provides a robust framework for reducing oxidative stress and enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics.

IF activates autophagy by activating SIRT1 and inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). SCFAs have also been shown to influence epigenetic regulation of autophagy genes. Elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, lowered amyloid plaque burden, and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD models, as well as similar effects, have been noted in models of Parkinson's Disease.

Existing research on neuroimmune interactions has demonstrated that IF modulates glial–neuronal interactions and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. IF influences neuroimmune homeostasis via GBA-integrated signals that regulate glial activity, cytokine networks, and immune–metabolic resilience. These adaptations are key for long-term cognitive preservation and neuroprotection.

Translating IF's promise to clinical practice requires thorough interrogation of mechanistic monitoring, safety, personalisation, and ethical deployment. It can be tricky to deploy IF interventions in vulnerable populations such as older adults, due to risks of hypoglycaemia, dehydration, and micronutrient deficiencies. Adherence can also be challenging, especially when cognitive decline hinders routine maintenance, making unsupervised IF potentially hazardous. Caregiver-linked compliance platforms, app-guided timers, and other digital solutions could bridge this gap.

A shift toward precision fasting is emerging, guided by increasing evidence that genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic, and microbiome-related factors shape individual responses to fasting. Incorporating circadian biomarkers, such as melatonin rhythm, sleep phase, and cortisol amplitude, offers a promising path for personalized chrono-nutrition. This approach may be especially beneficial for individuals with neurodegenerative disorders, who often experience disrupted circadian rhythms.

IF's pleiotropic effects make it an ideal backbone for multimodal therapeutic synergies. This is crucial in the case of neurodegeneration, where monotherapeutic approaches are unlikely to yield long-lasting clinical benefits. Co-administration of aerobic or resistance training and IF has yielded additive neurocognitive benefits in some preclinical and pilot clinical studies.

IF is emerging as a potentially scalable neurotherapeutic strategy. As clinical applications progress, the focus should be on incorporating IF into a comprehensive precision medicine framework. This could be done utilizing digital health technologies, multi-omics biomarkers, and complementary therapies. However, it is essential to note that most supporting evidence currently comes from preclinical animal studies, and robust, large-scale human trials are still limited.

Future research conducting randomized controlled trials should adopt stratified designs, integrate longitudinal biomarkers, and consider real-world adherence.

Children from ethnic minority backgrounds and those living in areas with higher levels of child poverty were more likely to die in intensive care than White children and those from the least deprived areas.

Researchers analyzed 14 years of UK-wide data on more than 160,000 critically ill children and found that children of Asian, Multiple and other ethnicities were more likely to die in intensive care than White children.

They also found that children living in areas with higher levels of poverty were more severely ill on arrival to intensive care and more likely to die after admission to paediatric intensive care than those from the least deprived areas.

The study also reveals that children of ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to stay longer in intensive care and to be readmitted unexpectedly after discharge, compared to White children.

The study, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, is the first in the UK to report worse intensive care outcomes in children from more deprived areas. It was led by researchers at Imperial College London, University of Leicester, UCL and University of Leeds, and is based on data commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP)through its national clinical audit programme.

The findings raise serious concerns about equity in critical care for children and should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders, according to the researchers.

Dr. Hannah Mitchell, lead author of the study and from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said: "Pediatric intensive care offers the highest level of support for the sickest children. Our findings show that inequalities persist even at this stage of care and are deeply troubling. These are not just statistics - they represent real, preventable differences in outcomes for critically ill children.

"Our findings are especially alarming in the context of rising levels of child poverty in the UK, where 4.5 million children are now growing up in poverty (31% of all children), 800,000 more children compared to 2013 (27% of all children). These findings should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders.

"Ethnic inequalities in child health have been highlighted repeatedly, and our study adds clear, national-scale evidence of disparities in intensive care. Reducing avoidable deaths in children must include serious, sustained action to reduce child poverty, improve access to healthcare, and address the structural barriers faced by marginalized communities."

Our study reveals worrying inequalities in outcomes for children admitted to intensive care in the UK.

This is particularly concerning as use of Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is projected to rise in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of complex chronic conditions in children.

It shouldn't be the case that a child's ethnicity or postcode determines their outcomes in PICU.

Our findings show the urgent need for improved access to urgent care, reducing barriers to healthcare access, earlier recognition of serious illness in children, and more coordination between hospitals and community care teams to improve PICU outcomes across the UK."

Professor Padmanabhan Ramnarayan, senior author of the study, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London

Children from economically disadvantaged areas or minority ethnic backgrounds experience worse health outcomes across a range of acute care conditions, with most of this research originating from the USA.

Evidence from the UK and the USA shows increased rates of admissions to PICUs for children from more deprived areas, and a previous Imperial study also reported increased rates of PICU admissions for children of Asian and Black ethnicities in the UK.

However, less is known about how this increased risk of admission to PICU relates to outcomes after admission.

In this new study, the team wanted to explore the effects of ethnicity and deprivation on PICU outcomes. They analyzed nationwide data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network of 245,099 admissions for 163,163 children aged 0-15 years admitted to UK PICUs between 1 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 2021.

They analyzed ethnicity and area-level deprivation at the time of admission. They compared this with mortality, length of stay during PICU and unplanned readmission within 60 days.

The team found that children of Asian ethnicity had higher mortality – 1,336 deaths per 26,022 admissions, while mortality was lowest amongst White children – 4,960 deaths per 154,041 admissions. Children of Asian ethnicity had 52% higher odds of death compared to White children.

Children of multiple ethnicities and other ethnicities represented 2.8% (4,514 children) of the overall group and had 20% higher odds of PICU mortality compared to White children.

Mortality was also higher in children living in areas with higher levels of child poverty – 2,432 deaths per 58,110 admissions compared to children in least deprived areas – 1,025 deaths per 33,331 admissions, revealing an association between PICU mortality and area-level child poverty. Children living in the most deprived areas had 13% higher odds of death compared to those living in the least deprived areas.

Both children of Asian ethnicity and children from more deprived areas were more severely unwell at admission than children of White ethnicity and those from less deprived areas. Children from ethnic minority backgrounds had longer stays in PICU (average 66 hours) and increased odds of unplanned readmission to PICU within 60 days (9%) compared with those of White ethnicity (average 52 hours and 6.8%).

The team has secured funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research to explore the possible reasons for the inequalities, such as access to healthcare, education and language in a further study.

It can be difficult to decide whether to expedite birth when a woman in the final stage of pregnancy perceives less fetal movements. An additional ultrasound measurement to assess resistance infetal blood vessels can help make this decision more accurately, leading to fewer complications during delivery.

This is the conclusion of a large international study led by gynecologist Sanne Gordijn from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), in collaboration with Wessel Ganzevoort from Amsterdam UMC.

Sometimes, pregnant women perceive less fetal movements in the final weeks of pregnancy. Usually, this is not a cause for concern-the baby may be in a different position, or the mother may have been busy and not noticed the movements. However, it can be alarming for both the pregnant woman and healthcare providers, as it may precede severe oxygen deprivation or even fetal death. In such cases, the placenta may not be functioning properly, resulting in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply to the baby. Early delivery, before severe hypoxia occurs, may then be the best option.

Currently, when a pregnant woman reports reduced fetal movement in the final weeks, she is referred to a hospital. There, routine assessments are performed as soon as possible to evaluate the fetal condition. These include a fetal heart rate tracing and an assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid levels. While these details provide insight into the fetal condition, there may be more effective ways to assess it.

The researchers studied the effect of additional ultrasound measurements to assess placental function. The study focused on the resistance in the blood vessels of the umbilical cord and the fetal brain. These measurements provide further insight into placental function and the baby's condition. A total of 1,684 women participated in the study.

The study primarily examined the resistance in the blood vessels of the baby's brain and umbilical cord. Sanne Gordijn explains: "The ratio between these two measurements is called the Cerebroplacental Ratio (CPR). The idea is that an abnormal CPR value, which may indicate a poorly functioning placenta, suggests it is better to expedite birth. If the CPR is normal, it may be better to wait, as the baby may not yet be ready. Women who wish to give birth at home can still do so in that case."

The results of the CEPRA study show better outcomes for fetuses when the CPR measurement is known. Gordijn: "This means we see fewer complications around birth when this measurement is performed in cases of reduced fetal movement, compared to current practice where it is not."

According to Gordijn, the study provides essential information for obstetric care: "If doctors know the CPR result, they can better determine whether reduced fetal movement is harmless or requires action. This ensures that both mother and baby receive the care best suited to their situation." The guideline on reduced fetal movement will soon be updated, and the professional association will incorporate the study's findings.

Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)--29% and 85%, respectively-finds a large medical records study published online in the journal Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine.

What's more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition-18-64 year olds-the findings indicate.

Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers.

But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including if particular age groups might be more vulnerable they add.

In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on real-time data from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains electronic health records from 68 healthcare organisations across the USA.

They scrutinised the anonymised records of adult patients who had and hadn't been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.

Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. 

And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64 year olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn't been prescribed gabapentin. 

While there was no heightened risk among 18–34 year olds prescribed the drug, the risks of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49 year olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64 year olds.

Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between 3 and 11 times. 

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren't able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.

Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence." 

They add: "Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline."

Young patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, now have a better chance of having their own children after treatment. An international study led by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) at University Hospital Cologne and the University's Faculty of Medicine has shown: The new BrECADD chemotherapy regimen preserves fertility significantly better than the previous standard eBEACOPP – without worsening the chances of recovery. The results were published under the title "Fertility in patients with advanced-stage classic Hodgkin lymphoma treated withBrECADD versus eBEACOPP: a secondary analysis of the multicentre, randomised, parallel, open-label, phase 3 HD21 Trial" in the journal The Lancet Oncology.

In the HD21 trial, patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma received one of two therapies: either the experimental therapy with BrECADD or the previous standard of care eBEACOPP. Three years after treatment was concluded, there were major differences: In the BrECADD group, 95 per cent of women and 86 per cent of men had normal hormone levels again – compared to 73  per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the eBEACOPP group. More pregnancies and births were documented after the BrECADD regimen was applied. For men in particular, this means a significantly higher chance of biological paternity after treatment.

BrECADD gives young adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma a better chance of starting a family later in life – with an equally good or even slightly better cure rate."

Dr. Justin Ferdinandus, Study Physician in the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and first author of the publication

"The HD21 study is fundamentally changing practice. Our data clearly show that BrECADD is the preferred first-line treatment for patients who wish to have children – at University Hospital Cologne and in the current Onkopedia guideline, this is already the new standard," adds Dr. Karolin Behringer, Study Physician at the GHSG and last author of the study.

The HD21 study is a randomized phase III clinical trial involving over 1,500 participants up to the age of 60 at 233 centres in nine countries. Among other things, the recovery of hormone levels (measured via blood serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone) were examined along with pregnancies and births after therapy was concluded.

The study was supported by Takeda Oncology.

New research reveals that while losing weight can rejuvenate aging fat tissue, stubborn immune cells keep a “memory” of obesity, offering fresh targets for lasting metabolic health.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers utilized next-generation assays to investigate the regulatory factors, cell types, and molecular events involved in human adipose tissue (AT) remodeling. Their landmark study provides the most detailed view yet into how fat tissue transforms during obesity and weight loss.

Study findings reveal that obesity induces cellular senescence, inflammation, and structural stress within fat, which are only partially reversed by weight loss. Notably, senescence reversal was selective, occurring in metabolic adipocytes, vascular cells, and precursors where p21-positive senescent cells were nearly eliminated, but largely persistent in immune cells. In combination with the 171,247-cell strong atlas, these findings provide a revolutionary understanding of fat tissue plasticity, representing the first step towards novel therapeutic directions that may finally overcome obesity's notorious capacity to bounce back.

Obesity is a metabolic condition characterized by excessive systemic fat accumulation, with potentially lethal outcomes. Clinically defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m², obesity has been linked to several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and even certain cancers.

Alarmingly, more than 1 billion humans live with obesity, with today's suboptimal lifestyle expected to exacerbate this already grim situation. While pharmacological, behavioral, and surgical interventions have demonstrated promise in achieving weight loss, these benefits are often temporary.

These facts reveal our surface understanding of the association and correlation between weight loss and improved obesity-associated health outcomes, while emphasizing our lack of knowledge of the mechanistic interplay governing fat (adipose tissue [AT]) remodeling.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and progress our war on obesity by deciphering the cellular, molecular, and spatial changes that occur in human AT during obesity and after weight loss.

Study samples (subcutaneous abdominal AT) were obtained from morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/m²; n = 25; age = 20–70 yrs) and healthy controls (BMI < 26 kg/m²) intra-operatively via laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Follow-up samples were collected five months later for comparative assays. All samples were subjected to single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the Illumina NextSeq2000 platform.

In brief, the study profiled ~100,000 nuclei from fresh biopsies and integrated the resultant sequences with 50,000 additional nuclei from the largest human fat tissue atlas to date. To supplement this single-cell data atlas, the 10x Genomics' Xenium platform was leveraged to conduct spatial transcriptomics on over 25,000 cells from equivalent cohorts, allowing researchers to observe differences in tissue-specific cell states.

Simultaneously, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) AT samples were subjected to 5 μm sectioning, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and in situ hybridization assays, allowing researchers to both carry out nuclear identification and measure gene activity directly within intact tissue architecture.

Finally, the study used pathway enrichment (MSigDB), differential expression, transcription factor inference, and spatial niche modeling assays to elucidate the movement, activity patterns, and remodellings of metabolic, immune, vascular, and progenitor cell populations.

The present study makes five key findings:

Weight loss selectively reverses senescence in metabolic, vascular, and precursor cells

Metabolic adipocytes, precursor cells, and vascular cells of patients with obesity were found to express senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes and other markers of cellular senescence. These cells contribute to fibrosis, immune signaling, and local tissue stress.

Notably, following weight loss (bariatric surgery), the fraction of "stressed" adipocytes (AD3) was observed to decrease dramatically (from 55% to 14%; P < 0.0001), and p21-positive senescent cells were nearly eliminated in these lineages. However, senescence persisted in immune cells (macrophages), suggesting only partial and cell-type-specific rejuvenation of the adipose niche.

Immune cells retain inflammatory programming post-weight loss

While the infiltration of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) was observed to decrease following weight loss, these LAMs retained inflammatory signature (TREM1 and TLR2) expression, indicating transcriptional memory that may predispose to metabolic dysfunction and potentially explain obesity's frequent reappearance.

Adipocyte metabolism globally activates during weight loss but fails to restore lean-state flexibility

Weight loss enhanced substrate cycling (e.g., triglyceride hydrolysis/resynthesis) and branched-chain amino acid breakdown, but metabolic parameters (e.g., insulin sensitivity) remained suboptimal relative to lean baselines.

Weight loss reduces structural tissue stress and fibrosis

Weight loss was observed to substantially downregulate the expression of genes (e.g., LOX, ACTA2, and VGLL3) involved in fibrosis and cytoskeletal tension, resulting in reduced adipocyte stiffness and inflammation.

Spatial mapping reveals stress niches adjacent to immune hotspots

The study identified five functional tissue niches: adipocyte, vascular, stress, arterial, and stem-like zones. Stressed cells formed distinct "stress niches" adjacent to immune-enriched arterial zones, indicating microenvironments of obesity-caused damage with delayed recovery. Several stress-associated factors (THBS1, NAMPT, AREG) were found to be enriched in obesity and reversed by weight loss (P < 0.05), highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets.

Boxplot, median interquartile range minimum and maximum. BMI, body mass index (kg m–2); F insulin, fasting insulin (mIU L–1); HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c (%); HDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mM); DBP, diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). c, Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of 145,452 human AT cells (n = 74 samples of the primary cohort and n = 13 samples of the Emont published cohort11, single nucleus).

This study marks a prominent leap in scientific understanding of adipose tissue biology, highlighting that while weight loss can partially and selectively reverse the cellular damage inflicted by obesity (reducing inflammation, senescence in specific lineages, and tissue stress), some immune and metabolic programs retain obesity-associated signatures, potentially explaining the stubborn tendency for weight to return.

The findings highlight fat as a complex, adaptive organ exhibiting cell-type-specific memory, suggesting that future interventions targeting unresolved senescence (e.g., in macrophages) or niche-specific stress signals (e.g., THBS1/NAMPT) may improve long-term outcomes.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, "What the Health?" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition.

As he had wanted, President Donald Trump signed his big budget bill into a big budget law in a White House ceremony on July 4, cementing, among other things, billions of dollars in cuts to health programs such as Medicaid. The new law will also reshape rules for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and other health programs. 

Meanwhile, the threat of layoffs continues to hang over the heads of employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, and funding for health-related contracts and grants remains stalled. 

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Rachel Cohrs Zhang of Bloomberg News, Rachel Roubein of The Washington Post, and Tami Luhby of CNN.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews KFF Health News' Julie Appleby, who reported the latest KFF Health News' "Bill of the Month" feature, about some very expensive childhood immunizations. If you have a medical bill that's exorbitant, baffling, or confusing, send it to us here.

Plus, for "extra credit" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too:

Julie Rovner: The New England Journal of Medicine's "The Corporatization of U.S. Health Care — A New Perspective Series," by Debra Malina, et al.

Rachel Roubein: The Associated Press' "RFK Jr. Promoted a Food Company He Says Will Make Americans Healthy. Their Meals Are Ultraprocessed," by Amanda Seitz and JoNel Aleccia.

Rachel Cohrs Zhang: The Wall Street Journal's "Prosecutors Question Doctors About UnitedHealth's Medicare Billing Practices," by Christopher Weaver and Anna Wilde Mathews.

Emerging science spotlights pomegranate seed oil's unique fatty acids as promising allies for heart and metabolic health, if future clinical trials back up the early buzz.

Nutraceuticals are foods or food components that offer health benefits, such as preventing or treating disease. Pomegranate seed oil has shown great promise in its beneficial effects on health in multiple preclinical studies. Its potential role as a nutraceutical is the focus of a recent research paper published in the journal Foods.

Pomegranate seeds make up 20% of the fruit's weight, generating over 1.6 million tons of annual waste globally, now recognized as a valuable source of health-boosting compounds.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading killer among all diseases worldwide, causing a quarter of all deaths in the UK. It is associated with poor dietary habits, including a high intake of saturated fats, which increases blood cholesterol levels. Approximately 31% of CVD cases and 11% of strokes globally are traceable to diets with a high saturated fat content.

Fats in a healthy diet would come mainly from oily fish and plants rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with low amounts of saturated fats and trans fats.

All parts of the pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) are rich in nutrients and medicinal components. After the juice is extracted, the seed waste, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of its weight, becomes a byproduct. The 1.6 million tons of pomegranate seed waste produced annually are a treasure trove of bioactive compounds with enormous therapeutic and economic potential. For instance, pomegranate seed extracts have been shown to possess anti-cancer and anti-osteoporotic properties.

Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) comprises approximately 12% to 20% of the total seed weight, with a high punicic acid content. Punicic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. It enhances immunity, improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, while reducing blood lipid levels. Additionally, it protects both the liver and kidneys.

Thus, PSO is an example of a healthy supplement produced from a waste product, largely due to its punicic acid content. The current review examines punicic acid as a potential cardioprotective agent.

Punicic acid transforms in your liver to 9Z,11E-CLA, a bioactive fat that may influence brain, adipose, and plasma lipid profiles based on rodent studies.

Punicic acid is an isomer of conjugated α-linolenic acid, characterized by three conjugated double bonds. It is the most abundant fatty acid in pomegranate seed oil, comprising up to 83% of the total fatty acid content. In addition to pomegranate, this acid is also obtained from various other plant sources, such as Trichosanthes kirilowii seeds.

Once consumed, the liver metabolizes punicic acid to a specific conjugated linoleic acid isomer (9Z,11E-CLA). Increasing punicic acid intake, for example, by eating more T. kirilowii seeds, improves its levels in blood by ~0.47% in plasma and its metabolites in red blood cell membranes by 0.17%. Human trials have shown inconsistent metabolic responses, and optimal dosing remains unclear.

PSO induces vasodilation, with a slight, gender-specific (female-only) decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. This effect is mediated by endothelial nitric oxide signaling via the nitric oxide–guanylyl cyclase pathway. It is independent of potassium channels, the renin-angiotensin system, beta-adrenergic receptors, and the prostaglandin pathways.

In preclinical studies, atherosclerosis in rabbits progressed more slowly with PSO treatment; however, other studies report conflicting results due to variations in experimental design. PSO protects cardiac muscle cells against oxidative stress, both by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by improving antioxidant capacity.

PPARγ activation doesn't just help glucose - it calms obesity-related inflammation by dialing down cytokines like IL-6 while boosting anti-inflammatory IL-10.

PSO reduces various lipid risk markers in the blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (‘bad' cholesterol), triglycerides, and total cholesterol, in some animal and hyperlipidemic human studies, though results are inconsistent across trials. It also reduces liver fat accumulation, with marked suppression of apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 secretion – this being an LDL component and a risk marker for coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.

PSO supplementation also reduces obesity induced by unhealthy or high-fat diets. It increases the expression of the gene uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat. It also promotes beige fat formation in white fat, thus reducing abdominal fat deposition by increasing the metabolic rate of fat tissue. Leptin levels are lower and adiponectin levels higher with PSO consumption.

In hyperlipidemic individuals, PSO intake reduced triglycerides and improved the triglyceride-to-'good' cholesterol ratio. The primary benefit of PSO appears to be its ability to maintain normal lipid metabolism, regardless of fat loss.

Feeling inflamed? PA specifically blocks TNF-α triggered inflammation in gut models, helping restore intestinal barrier function and prevent conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis.

Diabetes is a major CVD risk factor that doubles cardiovascular risk, and PSO may reduce diabetes risk. PSO improves insulin sensitivity and reduces fasting glucose levels in animal models and some diabetic patients, though human data are mixed. It may be a safer alternative to prevent and treat inflammation associated with cardiometabolic disease.

PSO may act by increasing mitochondrial energy metabolism and enhancing glucose absorption into cells that are insulin-resistant. These actions may be mediated by PPAR-γ.

Systemic inflammation underlies these chronic conditions, signaled by pro-inflammatory markers like (NF)-κB, TNF-α, and interleukin (IL)-6. PSO reduces these markers in cell and animal studies while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like PPAR-γ and IL-10. This not only reflects its ability to alleviate the inflammation that results in CVD, but also suppresses the inflammatory effects of obesity, diabetes, and the like.

PSO reduces oxidative stress while increasing antioxidant buffer enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. It also reduces lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant activity of PSO is attributed to its tocopherol and polyphenolic compound content. These effects have been well-documented in preclinical models but require further clinical validation.

Omega-3 PUFAs are established cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents. Punicic acid is a PPARγ activator, providing complementary benefits to these compounds by inhibiting lipogenic gene expression. Unlike them, it does not primarily act on eicosanoid pathways but rather inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines. It also scavenges ROS while increasing antioxidant activity through its conjugated triene structure.

The greatest limitation to the clinical use of punicic acid is the need for robust clinical evidence from human studies, with the few that have been reported showing highly inconsistent findings. Furthermore, more work is needed to establish its dosing, bioavailability, and metabolism. Significant gaps exist in understanding its long-term safety and efficacy in diverse populations.

PSO is rich in bioactive compounds, which account for both its nutritional content and its multifaceted health benefits. Punicic acid, a major fatty acid component of PSO, appears to help prevent as well as treat cardiometabolic diseases in preclinical models. The activity of punicic acid is similar to that of omega-3 PUFAs but through different mechanisms, offering potential complementary or synergistic benefits.

However, rigorous clinical trials are essential to establish the use of PA as a complementary nutritional agent – a nutraceutical – in the prevention and management of chronic disease. Until then, its therapeutic potential remains promising but unconfirmed in humans.

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ – Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber believes the FIFA Club World Cup this summer has been an “absolute terrific success,” and has set the stage for an exciting World Cup 2026 next summer.

Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain and English Premier League standouts Chelsea will play in the Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium.

Garber will attend the final – his sixth of the tournament after attending games in Miami, Atlanta and Philadelphia and both semifinal matches at MetLife Stadium in the last week.

“The Club World Cup was the story this summer in sport. And I think I'm pleased to see that three of our teams were part of that story,” Garber told USA TODAY Sports on Friday, July 11.

“I think it did what it was intended to do – to launch something new, take some risk, show some courage, and then set the stage for 2026, which will be another example of soccer and football at its very best. I think the 2026 World Cup will be the most spectacular event in the history of our country.”

Three MLS teams – Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC – participated in the first-of-its-kind tournament, featuring 32 of the best soccer clubs in the world.

While Seattle and LAFC were unable to win any of their three group-stage matches, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami helped clinch the first win by a North American club against a European side when they beat FC Porto in Atlanta on June 19.

Inter Miami was eliminated by PSG in the Round of 16, which created a dream matchup for FIFA and MLS – Messi faced his former team in a game that would never be played outside of a friendly before the Club World Cup.

“The beauty of the Club World Cup is our teams had an opportunity to stand and go toe to toe with the top teams in the world,” Garber said.

Garber said there have been at least 3 million people who attended soccer matches this summer, watching either the Club World Cup or the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer.

MLS games have also been ongoing following the group stages in both tournaments, and Garber believes another “half a million” people are expected to attend Leagues Cup matches when the tournament between MLS and LIGA MX clubs from Mexico begins later this month.

“I think all of us at MLS for a generation now have been trying to build what we call ‘a real soccer nation' – a country that has strong understanding of the sport, and supports their local clubs, supports their national teams, comes out and passionately celebrates like the rest of the world.

“I think Club World Cup was a great platform to tell that story. I thought it was fantastic. I hope to see it come back,” Garber added.

Despite rumors the U.S. could host the Club World Cup again in 2029, there's no decision yet on where the next edition of the tournament will be played.

FIFA saw 2.4 million fans attend Club World Cup matches with an average of 38,000 fans, and 21 of the 62 matches already played saw at least 50,000 fans. While empty seats were a major storyline, the tournament used NFL-sized stadiums instead of solely soccer-specific stadiums to host more fans.

MLS – which is celebrating its 30th season in 2025 – helped FIFA promote and market the event, while seven MLS training facilities hosted club practices, and four of the league's soccer-specific stadiums hosted select matches during the tournament.

“I think it's been a great, proud moment for everybody that's involved in soccer here in the United States. We showed the world that this country is a soccer nation with passionate fans, and spectacular stadiums, and a knowledgeable fan base,” Garber said.

Temperatures made Argentinian lie down in semi-final

He brands playing conditions in US as ‘very dangerous'

Enzo Fernández has said that the high temperatures at the Club World Cup are dangerous and revealed that he needed to lie down during Chelsea's win over Fluminense because the heat left him feeling “really dizzy”.

The Argentina midfielder is the latest player to criticise the tournament's scheduling and call for Fifa to make changes before the World Cup takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US next summer.

Challenging weather conditions in the US have been a major talking point during the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. Thunderstorms have caused delays to games, and teams have also had to deal with mid-afternoon kick-offs in intense heat.

Temperatures were high when Chelsea faced Fluminense at 3pm in the first semi-final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last Thursday. Local authorities had issued a heat warning and Fernández, who was conducting media duties before Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final, saying that he needed treatment in the second half will heap pressure on Fifa to consider late kick-off times at the 2026 World Cup.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernández said. “The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.

“Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?”

Levi Colwill agreed that the heat has led to slower games. “If you turn the game into a basketball match in this heat, it's not going to help anyone,” the Chelsea centre-back said. “You have to control the ball way more, pick the right times to attack and try to score.”

There was an attempt to ask Fernández, who spoke and fielded questions exclusively in Spanish, about him singing a homophobic and racist song after Argentina's Copa América triumph last year, but the 24-year-old did not appear to understand the question.

FIFA Club World Cup

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has said the heat during Club World Cup matches has been “very dangerous” to play in.

The 24-year-old Argentina international has joined the voices who have called on FIFA to consider changes ahead of next summer's men's World Cup that will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fernandez has described feeling dizzy in matches due to the heat and has outlined how it has a detrimental impact on the standard of matches.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernandez said on Friday, two days ahead of his side's final against Paris Saint-Germain. “The other day I got a little dizzy from playing and I had to go on the ground. The truth is, playing at that time is very dangerous. It's very dangerous.”

Fernandez added: “The speed of play is not the same. Everything becomes very slow.

“Let's hope for next year they change the times so, more than anything, the football continues to be nice and attractive.”

The heat has been an ongoing conversation this summer, with many calling on FIFA to reconsider selecting kickoff times for matches around the middle of the afternoon, to avoid the highest temperatures. Those slots, however, have been considered more attractive for broadcast audiences in Europe and Asia.

The topic was reignited on Thursday after former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann stressed that part of tournament football is adapting to all circumstances, including the heat. The former German international is part of FIFA's Technical Study Group for the Club World Cup.

“Everyone's playing in the heat,” Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said on Friday. “Both teams are playing in the heat, so we can't really make excuses on our side. You just got to handle it the best way you can.”

The extreme heat has been an ongoing narrative during this summer's tournament; players have been seen with cooling towels on the backs of their necks or over their heads, and some teams have directed their substitutes to watch matches from the locker room.

To adapt, FIFA has issued hydration breaks during both halves. Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac early in the competition called on FIFA to prioritize the welfare of players in 2026 by pushing back kick-off times.

FIFA's Technical Study Group on Thursday spoke with reporters in Manhattan, addressing a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition. Klinsmann addressed the heat directly.

The 60-year-old represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup. As coach, he led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid the qualification campaign for the 2018 tournament.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament concludes on Sunday with the final between Chelsea and PSG at 3pm local time, which is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

The heat is expected to peak around kick-off time.

FIFA Club World Cup

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has said the heat during Club World Cup matches has been “very dangerous” to play in.

The 24-year-old Argentina international has joined the voices who have called on FIFA to consider changes ahead of next summer's men's World Cup that will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fernandez has described feeling dizzy in matches due to the heat and has outlined how it has a detrimental impact on the standard of matches.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernandez said on Friday, two days ahead of his side's final against Paris Saint-Germain. “The other day I got a little dizzy from playing and I had to go on the ground. The truth is, playing at that time is very dangerous. It's very dangerous.”

Fernandez added: “The speed of play is not the same. Everything becomes very slow.

“Let's hope for next year they change the times so, more than anything, the football continues to be nice and attractive.”

The heat has been an ongoing conversation this summer, with many calling on FIFA to reconsider selecting kickoff times for matches around the middle of the afternoon, to avoid the highest temperatures. Those slots, however, have been considered more attractive for broadcast audiences in Europe and Asia.

The topic was reignited on Thursday after former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann stressed that part of tournament football is adapting to all circumstances, including the heat. The former German international is part of FIFA's Technical Study Group for the Club World Cup.

“Everyone's playing in the heat,” Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said on Friday. “Both teams are playing in the heat, so we can't really make excuses on our side. You just got to handle it the best way you can.”

The extreme heat has been an ongoing narrative during this summer's tournament; players have been seen with cooling towels on the backs of their necks or over their heads, and some teams have directed their substitutes to watch matches from the locker room.

To adapt, FIFA has issued hydration breaks during both halves. Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac early in the competition called on FIFA to prioritize the welfare of players in 2026 by pushing back kick-off times.

FIFA's Technical Study Group on Thursday spoke with reporters in Manhattan, addressing a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition. Klinsmann addressed the heat directly.

The 60-year-old represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup. As coach, he led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid the qualification campaign for the 2018 tournament.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament concludes on Sunday with the final between Chelsea and PSG at 3pm local time, which is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

The heat is expected to peak around kick-off time.

Arsène Wenger has refuted Jürgen Klopp's claim that the revamped FIFA Club World Cup is the “worst idea ever,” insisting clubs are desperate to be involved in the new-look tournament. 

Former Liverpool manager Klopp has been among those to criticise the 32-team, month-long Club World Cup on account of it further congesting the already bloated football calendar. 63 matches in total are played during the competition, which has been held in the United States and concludes on Sunday, July 13. 

However, ex-Arsenal manager Wenger, who now works for FIFA as chief of global football development, has rebuffed Klopp's strongly-held opinion. 

“I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Jürgen Klopp at all,” said the legendary French coach. 

“I feel a Club World Cup is needed. If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here then 100% of answers would be that they would want to do it again. That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.

“And the decisive question is do the fans like it or not? We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.”

Despite Wenger's insistence that attendances were high at the tournament, there have been notably empty stadiums during a number of matches—especially in the group stage. Ticket prices have also been slashed for certain fixtures due to lack of interest. 

Unlike the previous iteration of the Club World Cup, the new format sees the competition held every four years. The next tournament will be staged in 2029, with the host country yet to be confirmed. 

Chelsea will play the final match of this year's tournament when they meet European champions Paris Saint-Germain in the showpiece event this weekend.

The inaugural Copa Gianni jamboree reaches its end game on Sunday as Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, two lavishly-backed super clubs based a short Eurostar trip apart, battle to be kings of the global game. PSG have undermined their rivals' complaints about packed schedules and player fatigue by flying in after Bigger Cup final and destroying better-rested teams. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benefited from a tournament that allows you to simply buy more players as you go – including those on opposing teams – in order to freshen things up. Whatever happens, football will be the winner, but has Copa Gianni been any good?

Asked at the end of June, Jürgen Klopp was unequivocal in his criticism, calling it the worst idea ever implemented in football (and it has some serious competition – Football Daily Ed). Almost two weeks later, Arsène Wenger has bitten back. “I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question,” Wenger told salivating hacks. “Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Klopp at all.” With a full fortnight to prepare his riposte, we were expecting a Bielsa-esque PowerPoint takedown, but instead got the kind of unsubstantiated guff that may have earned Wenger the gig as Fifa's chief of global football development. “If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here, 100% [would say] they would want to do it again.”

If by clubs, Wenger means the boardroom bean-counters and PSR plate-spinners who oversee things, he may be right. But what about managers, so often the public face of the team? We would ask Botafogo's Renato Paiva and Porto's Martín Anselmi what they thought, but they were both sacked for their Copa Gianni failures (which, in Paiva's case, included beating PSG). How did Pep Guardiola enjoy Manchester City's daring run to the last 16? “Maybe [in winter] it will be a disaster, we are exhausted and [Copa Gianni] has destroyed us,” trilled Guardiola. Well, at least his players enjoyed it, right? “My teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament,” said Manuel Akanji, who joined the rest of City's back line in downing tools against Al-Hilal.

Wenger also took on the issue of low fan turnout, saying “we believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher,” while squinting up at an empty stand as invisible to him as a contentious decision in Arsenal's favour. “We shouldn't underestimate the quality of the permanent pitches,” he added, rubbing a scorched blade of grass between forefinger and thumb. “The grass is a bit harsher here. The pitches were flat. But once we watered the grass, everyone was happy.” Apart from PSG's Luis Enrique, of course, who complained of playing surfaces “full of holes” that made the ball “jump around like a rabbit”.

And what about the heat, which made it “almost impossible to train,” according to Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca? Well, it turns out he was doing the training wrong. “I asked our analysts to analyse the impact of the heat,” Wenger added, while stuffing party packs of ice cubes inside his extra-long puffer jacket. “We found heat of over 35C had an impact on high-speed running, so sprints, not distances.” So, it's simple – to succeed in this tournament, or next year's Stay Away World Cup, players need to stop running. After all it's not like this is an elite competitive sport, right? Wenger's verdict may be good news for Cole Palmer, but it also proves the Copa Gianni – recently described as a “wake-up call” for player welfare – is a marathon, not a sprint.

It's the final round of Group B fixtures, with Portugal needing to gain three points and several goals to overhaul Italy in second place. Join us for Italy 1-4 Spain and Portugal 3-1 Belgium to see how it all shakes down (both 8pm BST kick-offs).

FIFA has already lowered prices for the Club World Cup final in an effort to attract more fans to attend the match on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

The cheapest standard admission ticket, to see reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain face Premier League standout Chelsea, has dropped from $312.20 to $249.75 two days before the final. 

Some seats in the back of the 100 sections were initially in the $440-$546 range, lowered to $334.50 to $473.90. 

However, premium club seats remained the same prices from Wednesday to Friday. Seats in the East Club remain $1,644.65, while seats in the EY Coaches Club are still $4,348.50. 

FIFA has been criticized for high initial prices for tickets, but has adjusted pricing, taking supply and demand into account. The cheapest tickets for half of the Club World Cup's group stage matches (24 of 48 total) were under $36 all-in with fees before taxes before the tournament. The Associated Press reported June 28 that at least 1 million tickets were unsold during the group stage. 

FIFA says 2.4 million fans have attended Club World Cup matches – with an average of 38,000 – and 21 of the 62 matches already played saw at least 50,000. While empty seats were a major storyline, the tournament featured NFL-sized stadiums in addition to soccer-specific venues in order to potentially fit more fans.

The first semifinal between Chelsea and Brazilian side Fluminense had an announced crowd of 70,556. The Athletic reported tickets for that match lowered from $473.90 to just $13 in a three-day span before the Tuesday, July 8 match. 

The Club World Cup's semifinal match, which saw PSG dismantle Real Madrid had an announced crowd of 77,542 people at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday, July 9. The vast majority were fans of Real Madrid — arguably the most popular team in the sport globally. Real Madrid's elimination certainly doesn't help ticket sales for the final, which could possibly see prices drop further into the weekend. 

However, the most attended Club World Cup match saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid in front of 80,619 fans at the Rose Bowl Stadium outside Los Angeles on June 20.

The US International and two-time World Cup winner has been away from the sport for several years due to injury.

Tobin Heath, one of the most influencial women's players in U.S. history, has announced she is retiring from professional football, disappointing many of her fans who had hoped to see her take to the pitch once again.

The 37-year-old four-time Olympian revealed the decison on her RE-CAP Show podcast on Thursday (10 July).

“I think I had a few more mountains I wanted to climb with football, even though I'm really grateful for the career that I had,” she on the podcast.

“I get the question all the time: ‘So, are you coming back?' — and kind of like, well, the writing's on the wall.”

Heath earned 181 caps for the U.S. Women's National Team, winning gold at Beijing 2008 and London 2012. Known for her creativity, intelligence, and calm presence on the pitch, she was named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year in 2016.

She also won two NWSL titles with the Portland Thorns and most recently played for OL Reign before a knee injury in 2022.

“I just played because I loved it,” she said.

According to Jose Felix Diaz's report in MARCA, the iconic Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid is expected to host the final of the 2030 FIFA World Cup, following an agreement reached between FIFA and Real Madrid. 

While the decision has not yet been made official, sources close to the situation have confirmed that the deal is in place.

The 2030 World Cup will be a historic one, as it will be jointly hosted by Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Within Spain, cities like A Coruna, Barcelona, Bilbao, Las Palmas, Madrid, Málaga, San Sebastian, Sevilla, and Zaragoza are set to host matches. 

But when it comes to the grand finale, the Santiago Bernabeu has emerged as the frontrunner.

FIFA's strong working relationship with Real Madrid has been a key factor in this decision. Over the years, both entities have shared a smooth and cooperative partnership, and this latest development is another sign of their growing alignment.

Barcelona had also put forward their own bid to host the final at the newly renovated Spotify Camp Nou. 

Club vice-president Elena Fort had officially stated last month that Barcelona's home stadium deserves the honour of staging the World Cup final, saying, 

“Everyone has the right to play their cards, but the Camp Nou is worthy of hosting the final of a World Cup.”

However, the project to complete the new Camp Nou has faced multiple delays and uncertainties, which appear to have weakened the city's bid. 

Though the World Cup is still five years away, FIFA is said to be prioritising infrastructure stability and readiness, areas where Madrid currently holds the upper hand.

With Real Madrid's renovated Bernabeu already hosting high-profile matches and events successfully, and with its central location and modern facilities, it now looks set to welcome the biggest match in world football come 2030.

The future of Rodrygo has become a key talking point at Real Madrid lately as the forward continues to fail in his bid to impress new coach Xabi Alonso.

The Brazilian didn't have the best of time in the FIFA Club World Cup, often being overshadowed by Arda Guler.

Rodrygo's role in the first-team may dilute further once new signing Franco Mastantuono joins hte Real Madrid camp in August.

This has led to intense speculation over Rodrygo's future, with the likes of Arsenal, PSG and Manchester City interested in his services.

Saudi Arabia, too, have been linked with a move for the Real Madrid winger, but Fabrizio Romano has recently refuted all the speculation.

However, despite all the speculation linking him with a move away from Santiago Bernabeu, Rodrygo is determined to stay at Real Madrid.

This is according to MARCA, which suggests that the Brazilian is keen on remaining at Real Madrid and fighting for his place in the first-team.

Despite all the rumours, no one in the Real Madrid camp has asked him to leave and with his contract not expiring until 2028, the Brazilian has no desire of leaving either.

However, Rodrygo's prolonged spell at Los Blancos will not bode well for the club knowing the player's value is bound to go down if he fails to gain regular game-time under Xabi Alonso.

The new Real Madrid coach has already made it clear that he would prefer players such as Guler to be orchestrating things in the final third and that he isn't afraid to try out new things.

Keeping that in mind, it will be interesting to see if Real Madrid eventually consider a sale of the Brazilian international, perhaps later in the summer.

Arsenal are reportedly considering giving up on their pursuit of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with only a “glimmer of hope” remaining.

The Gunners remain in the market for a proven No.9, with Mikel Arteta considered to have been in need of a prolific performer to fill that role for some time. Gyokeres ticks plenty of boxes after netting 97 goals for Portuguese employers through 102 appearances.

He has been pushing for a Premier League transfer, with the 27-year-old given permission to stay away from pre-season training while talks regarding his future continue. A delegation from Arsenal, led by sporting director Andrea Berta, has held discussions in Lisbon.

No agreement was reached, with Sporting demanding £69 million ($93m) for their most prized asset - with much of that fee being due up front. Arsenal are yet to bow to those demands, with the north London giants mulling over their options.

A Bola reports on how Arsenal are preparing to throw in the towel, with Sporting refusing to budge on the structure of a big-money deal. It may be that Arteta and Co turn their attention to alternative options.

It is claimed that a “glimmer of hope” remains when it comes to Gyokeres and a proposed switch to Emirates Stadium, with the Swedish sensation making it clear that his preference would be to head for England before the summer window closes.

Manchester United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo has hit a major roadblock after Brentford received a fresh bid for Yoane Wissa from Nottingham Forest. With the Bees unwilling to sell both of their star forwards this summer, Mbeumo's proposed move to Old Trafford is now in serious doubt — and the Red Devils may be forced to accelerate talks for the Cameroonian or look elsewhere.

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has responded to Jurgen Klopp's criticism of the Club World Cup, saying the revamped, 32-team tournament is “needed” and that clubs would “100 percent … want to do it again.”

Wenger, who is now FIFA's chief of global soccer development, backed the new look Club World Cup, which wraps this weekend with the final between Chelsea and Paris Saint Germain, during a FIFA media availability session on Thursday in Manhattan.

Wenger leads the event's technical study group, which is made up of former players and coaches, including former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann and newly retired USWNT legend Tobin Heath, who analyze trends in the game.

Last month, ex-Liverpool boss Klopp, now head of global soccer at Red Bull, called the expanded tournament “the worst idea ever implemented in football.” Klopp took aim at how it impacted the football calendar and restricted time for player development.

Wenger was asked about Klopp's criticisms of the Club World Cup directly.

“I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and I don't share the view of Jurgen Klopp at all,” Wenger said.

“I feel a Club World Cup is needed. If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here then 100 percent of answers would be that they would want to do it again. That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.

“And the decisive question is, ‘Do the fans like it or not?' We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.”

The study group addressed a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition.

The pitches have been an ongoing issue, with players and coaches offering mixed reviews across its various venues. MetLife in particular, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final, was quickly criticized after the first game hosted there.

Wenger defended the overall pitch quality in the United States, insisted the tournament would remain as being held once every four years and praised the high levels of technical quality reached by PSG ahead of Sunday's final. He also addressed the future of the competition, saying “The next edition will be 2029. That's always been the case [rather than to play the Club World Cup every two years].”

Regarding pitch quality, Wenger said he received “very positive feedback” on the quality of training pitches and “very few complaints” about pitches for games. He described two venues with issues, singling out Orlando. It's unclear which stadium he intended, with the city's Inter&Co Stadium and Camping World Stadium both hosting games.

Wenger cautioned not to “underestimate” the quality of real grass fields, even if they require extra care.

“The grass is a bit different here. It's a bit harsher or more resistant than in other countries. The pitches were ‘flat'. But once we watered the grass, everyone was happy,” he said.

Heat has also been a major narrative in this summer, with scorching temperatures across the U.S. raising concerns over the possibility of midday or early afternoon start times in 2026.

“The heat in some games was a problem but we tried to combat that with cooling breaks, watering the pitches during the break and overall I feel we learned a lot on that front,” Wenger said. “Certainly, next year in stadiums there will also be more with roofs and the TV times will be more sensitive. At the same time, the weather conditions can be a problem for everybody.”

Wenger asked analysts to review the impact of heat on players. He said they found that temperatures over 35C (95F) impacted high-speed running, rather than their distances.

Klinsmann, who represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup and as coach led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid an ultimately doomed qualifying attempt for 2018, also spoke with reporters on Thursday. He recalled how unbearable the heat was in Dallas 31 years ago, but stressed that part of football is adapting to all circumstances.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer,” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament resumes Sunday with the championship at 3 p.m. local time, which as of Thursday is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees F with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

It's all gas, no brakes for Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna.

Luna recently became the talk of the American soccer world as he led the United States through the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Just four days after the U.S.'s loss in the final, Luna was sitting in Real Salt Lake's training facility in Herriman, Utah, speaking with media about his Gold Cup campaign and return to Real Salt Lake. 

“I feel good after this tournament, and now I'm coming right back into club and ready to perform for RSL, keep my foot on the gas because I'm feeling good,” he said.

At the Gold Cup, Luna started four of the U.S.'s six matches, tallying three goals — his first-ever national team goals — and two assists. 

“To represent your country at an international level is a feeling that you can't really put into words,” he said.

Two of his goals came within the first 15 minutes of the U.S.'s semifinal against Guatemala. His performance earned him Man of the Match honors.

Luna admitted Thursday that that game was the happiest he'd ever been on the soccer field.

“I think that Guatemala game was pretty exciting. I think it was the biggest game that I played at that time,” he said.

While the Gold Cup showcased Luna's scoring ability, the tournament also served as a teaching moment for Luna, he said.

“It really showed me that I can perform at these high levels. But at the same time,” he said, “there are other players out there that are doing things well that I need to match, that I need to become better at and different areas of the game that I think I can still learn.” 

Luna could have the opportunity to shine for the U.S. on an even bigger stage than the Gold Cup with the 2026 FIFA World Cup just 11 months away.

“I think this is the year to give it all, right?” he said. “I think this is the year to make sure I'm at my best and then see what happens from there.”

Luna called club playing time “one of the biggest” factors in the decision, regardless if it's in the MLS or Europe, where there have been rumors about Luna transferring.

“I think if it isn't obvious enough to see that this past Gold Cup team had many guys from the MLS, and we did extremely well — made it to the final — and I think that goes to show that it doesn't matter the league you're playing in. It's just about playing and performing at where you're at," he said.

The emotions of the Gold Cup have already faded for Luna as his attention has returned to the remainder of Real Salt Lake's season.

“I'm really focused here and now for the game on Saturday. That's kind of how it is, quick turnaround and yeah, ready to go,” he said.

Luna expressed his excitement to play in front of his home fans again, noting that he felt their support while at the Gold Cup.

“I'm excited,” he said. “It's something that I have been thinking about a lot throughout this camp is that I can't wait to get back and put on the RSL jersey and in front of the fans that have been amazing support while I was gone.”

He specifically mentioned a video Real Salt Lake posted on social media of fans wishing him good luck ahead of the final.

“It kind of made me tear up, and I'm excited to come back and play there and score goals in front of our fans because without them, without RSL, I wouldn't be where I'm at right now. So, I'm extremely grateful and I'm excited.”

We're cheering you on from the 801 ❤️Good luck tonight in the @GoldCup final, @diegoluna1511!! pic.twitter.com/HfqZgb1pRQ

Up next for Luna and Real Salt Lake is Saturday's home match against the Houston Dynamo.

Novak Djokovic exited a Grand Slam at the semifinal stage for the third time this season, falling short against Jannik Sinner once more.

Just five weeks ago, Djokovic lost to Sinner 4-6, 5-7, 6-7 in the semifinals of the French Open.

Looking for revenge at SW19, it wasn't to be as Sinner defeated Djokovic in straight sets once again, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

At 38 years of age, it's hard to imagine Djokovic will be around for much longer, although one former WTA star doesn't think this is the last we will see of him at the All England Club.

Analysing his walk off the court, Laura Robson noticed something different about his demeanour, compared to what she saw in Paris recently.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match, Robson compared Djokovic's exit from Centre Court to his exit from Court Philippe Chatrier in June.

“There was more of a lingering goodbye at Roland Garros, a few weeks ago, he spent a bit more time on the court saying goodbye,” she said.

“But that actually felt like he plans to come back, that he wants another chance at this.”

Robson might be right, as Djokovic outlined his plans to return to Wimbledon in 2026 during his post-match press conference.

“I would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on Centre Court,” he said.

“I'm not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today. I'm planning to come back, definitely at least one more time.”

Djokovic will be 39 at Wimbledon in 2026, two years older than Ken Rosewall was at the 1972 Australian Open when he became the oldest player to win a Grand Slam title (37 years, 2 months), a record that stands to this day.

The Serb will need to find something from somewhere if he wants to avoid another defeat in 2026, as he looked some way off his younger rival in this year's semifinal.

It's tough to gauge whether it was a blistering start from Sinner or a slow start from Djokovic, as the Italian eased into a 6-3, 6-3 lead.

Briefly showing signs of life in the third, Djokovic led 3-0, but won just one more game, as Sinner came through to win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

Sharing his thoughts after the match, 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash suggested the ‘damage' was done in those opening two sets.

“Yeah, it was a bit unfortunate, it looked like the damage had been done by two blistering sets by [Jannik] Sinner,” he said.

“Novak [Djokovic] struggled after that, but incredible the standard of tennis that Sinner brought out in the first two sets, just an hour wasn't it, it was something else, full credit to him. 

“It was sad that Novak couldn't reach the level we were hoping for; we were all looking for an incredible four/five-set battle, but that's sport for you.”

The Serb just couldn't compete with Sinner on Centre Court, largely due to his troubles on second serve points.

Winning just 17% of his points behind his second serve to Sinner's 71%, Djokovic never really stood a chance of beating the world number one.

Perhaps the outcome of the match would have been different if Djokovic had been more convincing on second serve points, but the reality is, we will never know.

For Djokovic, it's now time to rest and recover before he takes a trip to North America for the US hard-court swing.

There's still work to be done for Sinner in London, however, as he now prepares to take on Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.

Sinner and Alcaraz will battle it out for the 2025 Wimbledon title on Sunday, July 13.

By reaching the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have achieved something that only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had previously done in the Open Era.

Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship besides Federer and Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008.

Nadal lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires in all three years, adding to his eventual count of 14 trophies at the clay-court major. In 2006 and 2007, Federer responded by beating his rival in the Wimbledon final. In 2008, Nadal earned the crown at both tournaments.

Alcaraz carries the momentum of an unforgettable victory at Roland Garros, where he saved three championship points before stunning Sinner in a  five-set thriller. The Spaniard has won 24 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Sinner has advanced to four straight Grand Slam finals, having won last year's US Open and this year's Australian Open. The Italian will compete for the Wimbledon trophy for the first time. 

The last time the same two men battled in consecutive major finals was at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2016, when Novak Djokovic defeated Andy Murray for two straight Slam titles.

Alcaraz leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has won their past five meetings. This will be their second clash in a Grand Slam final.

 Jannik Sinner swept aside Novak Djokovic on Friday to reach his maiden Wimbledon championship match and simultaneously earn the opportunity for a swift slice of major-final revenge. 

 The Italian eased past the physically struggling Djokovic 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-finals at the grass major to book a title showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. Last month, Sinner let slip three championship points against Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final, and the pair will now resume their rivalry Sunday on the All England Club's iconic Centre Court. 

 ”I can't believe it,” said Sinner, when asked about reaching his first Wimbledon final. “It's a tournament I always watched when I was young on television. I would never have imagined that I could play here in the final, so it's amazing. I know how much work me and my team are putting in. My dad and my brother arrived today, so it's even more special.”

 Even with Djokovic's movement well below its trademark best after he sustained an injury late in his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli, Sinner was typically clinical in completing his one-hour, 55-minute last-four win. Aside from a lapse early in the third set that left him trailing 0-3, the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings was precise on serve and rock-solid from the baseline throughout. 

 “On my side, I served very well today,” reflected Sinner. “I felt great on court. I was moving much better today, and I think we all saw, especially in the third set, that he was a bit injured. He fell in the last couple of points in the quarter-finals. He was in a very difficult situation, but I tried to stay calm and tried to play the best tennis I can, especially in the important moments.” 

 By defeating Djokovic, Sinner completed the set of final appearances at all four Grand Slam events. He is the 11th man to complete that feat in the Open Era. The 23-year-old has now won five consecutive matches against Djokovic, a streak that includes Grand Slam semi-final triumphs (2024 Australian Open, 2025 Roland Garros and Wimbledon). 

 Doubts had surrounded Djokovic's fitness heading into Friday's semi-final after he fell in the final game against Cobolli on Wednesday. The seven-time champion subsequently cancelled his on-site practice scheduled for Thursday at Aorangi Park and, once the semi-final with Sinner began, he seemed to struggle with pushing off to get back into court if taken wide. 

 Sinner's own Wimbledon campaign became dogged with fitness issues after he slipped early in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov, who was later forced to retire when leading the World No. 1 by two sets. Sinner subsequently eased past Ben Shelton in the fourth round and his performance against Djokovic was another sign that he is back to firing on all cylinders. 

 The reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, Sinner delivered an early blow by breaking Djokovic's serve in the third game of the match, and he cruised to a two-set lead without any real peril. Sinner struck the ball cleanly off both wings and replicated the stunning serving display he had produced against Shelton. The World No. 1 dropped just 17 points on serve in the match, with eight of those coming in his first two service games of the third set. 

 Djokovic, won won just 17 per cent (5/30) of points behind his second serve overall, received a medical timeout on his left thigh at the end of the second set. The 38-year-old then quickly opened a 3-0 lead in the third, but he was unable to maintain his momentum. With Sinner dominant in the majority of extended rallies, the Italian reeled off five straight games and, although Djokovic fended off two match points to hold for 4-5, Sinner made no mistake in completing his win behind his own delivery. 



 Alcaraz leads Sinner 8-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series heading into Sunday's final, having won their five most-recent tour-level meetings. It is Sinner who triumphed in the only previous grass-court encounter between the two, however: The Italian registered a four-set win in the Wimbledon fourth round in 2022. 

 Sinner and Alcaraz facing off in another Grand Slam final marks the continued emergence of a new ‘Big Two' era and guarantees that after Sunday the pair will have shared the past seven major titles. The title showdown will also be crucial in the two players' battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Alcaraz currently leads Sinner by 2,240 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, but the Italian will reduce that significant deficit to 1,540 points by winning the title. 

 “We saw the last final. You never know,” said Sinner, when asked about the prospect of meeting Alcaraz. “It's a huge honour for me to share the court once again with Carlos. We try to push ourselves to the limit. He is for sure one of the players I look up to. I love watching him and we all agree what kind of talent he is. Hopefully it's going to be a good match like the last one.”

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz will face each other for the 2025 Wimbledon men's championship after both won their semifinal matches on Friday.

Sinner dispatched Djokovic in straight sets 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. And the score indicates how one-sided the match was. Going into Friday's matchup, there was some question as to whether Djokovic hurt himself on a fall late in his quarterfinal match with Flavio Cobelli on Wednesday. Djokovic canceled his Thursday practice, which raised further concerns.

Those concerns were justified as Djokovic had difficulty moving side to side throughout. He particularly had trouble moving to his right, couldn't push off to get to returns and limped after points.

Djokovic appeared to recover after a medical timeout between the second and third sets and took a 3-0 lead. But Sinner wasn't fazed, eventually breaking serve and taking back control from a clearly hobbled Djokovic. On several points, Djokovic couldn't even attempt to reach Sinner's returns, especially if it meant changing direction.

In the earlier semifinal, Fritz provided a strong threat. The American played arguably the best match of his career, frequently overpowering Alcaraz with his serve. However, unless Fritz was controlling the match with his serve, Alcaraz was able to battle back.

The defending champion baffled Fritz with a variety of shots, feathering drop shots at the net and slicing backhands down the line to catch his opponent out of position. Fritz forced a tiebreaker in the final set, but Alcaraz never faltered. As he often demonstrates, he can raise his game as needed while the player on the other side hits a ceiling.

Alcaraz eventually knocked Fritz off 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6), pushing him into the Wimbledon final for the third straight year. Alcaraz has won the event the last two years, and will be looking for a third consecutive Wimbledon title Sunday against Sinner.

Here is how Friday's men's semifinal matches played out in Yahoo Sports' live coverage:

Grigor Dimitrov appears to be in good spirits after his unfortunate exit from Wimbledon on Monday. While en route to upsetting World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the round of 16, up 2-0 in sets, Dimitrov was forced to withdraw from the match with a partial pectoral tear.

Four days after the injury, the 34-year-old Bulgarian expressed his gratitude on social media while sharing a snap of him enjoying a meal from his hospital bed.

"Sometimes the heart wants to keep going … but the universe has a different plan for us," Dimitrov wrote.

"Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community ... your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon."

The agonizing exit derailed Dimitrov from achieving his first Grand Slam title. His injury is expected to keep him sidelined for the next three tournaments, including the US Open in late August.

Dimitrov stacked wins against Yoshihito Noshioka, Corentin Motet and Sebastian Ofner before leaving the tournament.

Sinner, who will face Novak Djokovic in the semifinals on Friday, said after the match that, "I don't take this as a win at all."

"He is an incredible player, we all saw this today," Sinner said of Dimitrov. "It's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player, a good friend of mine — we understand each other very well off the court too. If there would be a chance that he would play in the next round, he would deserve [it]. But now I hope he has a speedy recovery."

Dimitrov has won nine ATP singles titles, with his latest coming in 2024 when he defeated Alejandra Tabilo in the Laver Cup.

Aryna Sabalenka is expanding on her perspective following a tense moment Thursday in her women's semifinals loss to Amanda Anisimova at Wimbledon.

When meeting with reporters after the three-set loss, the world's top female player was asked about a game in the third set, in which a forehand from the New Jersey native hit the top of the net to fall over, prompting Sabalenka to reply, “You don't want to say sorry?” during a tense changeover.

“I just look at her and I just, for sure, she didn't hear me, but I was just like, ‘You don't want to say sorry?' but she just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match. It's on her,” said Sabalenka, who lost 4-6, 6-4, 4-6.

“If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying, ‘Sorry for that tricky situation,' that's on her.”

Players may apologize to an opponent if a ball goes over the net on a lucky break by raising a hand.

The lack of an apology appeared to irritate Sabalenka, 27, who also took exception to what she viewed as a premature celebration from Anisimova, 23.

“I was just trying to chase the ball,” the Belarusian star said, according to The Tennis Letter. “She was already celebrating it. I was like ‘I mean, that's a bit too early.' She kind of pissed me off like saying, ‘That's what she does all the time.'

“But I was grateful and thankful that she said that because I was like, it actually helped me to keep fighting. I was like OK, now I'm gonna show you the tennis. I came back because I got really angry in that moment. Probably in the third set I should've remembered and probably it would've helped. But it is what it is.”

Anisimova, who later clarified she wasn't celebrating, is now set to face Poland's Iga Swiatek in the ladies' singles final Saturday.

“This doesn't feel real right now, honestly,” the American said post-match. “I was absolutely dying out there. I don't know how I pulled it out.”

The daughter of Russian immigrants, Anisimova took a break from tennis in 2023 amid mental health concerns and was ranked No. 189 last year.

She reached the fourth round at the French Open earlier this summer, falling to Sabalenka in two sets.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, reached the final at Roland Garros before losing to American Coco Gauff.

Grigor Dimitrov has described his withdrawal from his Wimbledon quarter-final against Jannik Sinner as “one of the most painful moments” of his career.

The Bulgarian was leading the world No 1 by two sets and seemed bound for the last four when he suffered a right pectoral muscle injury during the third set on Centre Court.

The 34-year-old has now been unable to complete a match in five grand slam tournaments during a career oft disrupted by injury, but this was a particularly tough moment given the level which he had found to leave Sinner, struggling himself with an elbow injury, on the brink of exit.

“Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,” Dimitrov posted on Instagram, accompanying a photo of him in a hospital bed.

“Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

“Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.”

Serving at 2-2 in the third set, having won the first two sets 6-3, 7-5, Dimitrov went to ground holding the right hand side of his chest, having just hit an ace.

Dimitrov had suffered a similar fate at Wimbledon 12 months ago, when he had to retire from his match against Danil Medvedev due to an abductor tear.

Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his third consecutive Wimbledon final on Friday, when he overcame American Taylor Fritz 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6).

Competing on a sunbaked Centre Court, Alcaraz won 88 per cent of his first-serve points but was pushed at times during the two-hour, 48-minute clash. The Spaniard suffered a brief lapse in level at the closing stages of the second set but bounced back impressively in the third, outlasting the fifth seed with his baseline power and consistency.

He then saved two set points at 4/6 in the fourth-set tie-break, reeling off four consecutive points to move to within one victory of becoming just the fifth player to clinch three consecutive Wimbledon crowns.

"It was a really difficult match as always when I have to play against Taylor. Even tougher with the conditions, it was really hot today," Alcaraz said. "I'm just really happy with everything that I've done today. I dealt with the nerves, playing here in a semi-final is not easy. I'm really proud with the way I stayed calm and thought clearly. I'm pleased about my level today."

Currently riding a career-best 24-match winning streak, Alcaraz is also bidding to join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to complete the Roland Garros–Wimbledon double in consecutive years. Borg achieved the feat from 1978 to 1980.

"I'm not thinking about the winning streak or the results at all. This is my dream, stepping on these beautiful courts and playing tennis in the most beautiful tournaments in the world," Alcaraz added. "That's all I try to think at every tournament and why I try to bring the joy to the courts."

Standing in Alcaraz's path to a sixth Grand Slam title runs through either World No. 1 Jannik Sinner or seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic. Just last month, Alcaraz saved three championship points to defeat Sinner in a marathon five-hour, 29-minute Roland Garros final, improving his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against the Italian to 8-4. Against Djokovic, whom he has beaten in the past two Wimbledon finals, Alcaraz trails 3-5.



Fritz came through two five setters en route to his second major semi-final and was seeking to become the first American man to reach the Wimbledon final since Andy Roddick in 2009. The 27-year-old won 80 per cent of his first-serve points against Alcaraz but struggled to make inroads on the second seed's delivery. The Spaniard dictated play from the baseline, mixed in deft drop shots, and used his heavy second serve to keep Fritz off balance throughout.

The American looked set to force a fifth set when he led 6/4 in the tie-break but as is often the case, Alcaraz increased his level when it mattered most. The Spaniard saved the first set point by feathering a forehand volley into the forecourt and the second when Fritz struck a forehand long. The Spaniard, who sealed victory on his first match point, leads Fritz 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with this their first meeting on grass.

While Alcaraz cannot overtake Sinner for World No. 1 after Wimbledon, he is now 2,660 points ahead of the Italian atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which indicates who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.

After a shaky five-set win against Fabio Fognini in the opening round, Alcaraz has steadily found his rhythm in London, where he eliminated Andrey Rublev in the fourth round and dispatched British lefty Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals.

Leonardo DiCaprio, Rami Malek, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Ford and Anna Wintour were among the spectators watching Alcaraz improve to 48-5 on the year. The 22-year-old has won a Tour-leading five titles in 2025 – Roland Garros, Rome, Monte-Carlo, Rotterdam, and The Queen's Club.

When the Serbian tied Seles for the longest Australian Open win streak in 2024, his former idol reflected, “With Novak's Grand Slam title wins, I stopped counting a long time ago as I knew he would be breaking all the records and setting up some ridiculous ones for future generations to try and break.“I just wish that we played in the same era as it would have been so cool to play mixed doubles together.

Novak Djokovic is a natural born winner. Using every weapon in his armoury and every advantage the rules of the game allow has got him to a staggering 24 Grand Slam titles, and put him in a position to hunt down a record-breaking 25th at the age of 38.

World No.1 Jannik Sinner stands in his way, with the pair going head-to-head in a Wimbledon semi-final this afternoon. Although Sinner is only 23, it will be the third time they have met competitively at SW19, with Djokovic winning the two previous encounters. During their first Wimbledon showdown, in 2022, Djokovic came back from two sets down to break Sinner's heart.

And he admitted after winning 5-7 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-2 that a lengthy toilet break partway through the match, and what he did during it, instigated the turnaround.

"He was the better player for the first two sets but I had a toilet break and a pep talk in the mirror," explained the Serb. "It's true - sometimes these things are necessary. The toilet break was the turning point. I go through the same doubtful moments as anyone else. The inner fight is the biggest fight you go through."

Djokovic used the crafty toilet break to his advantage while players were still free to do so. Since then, the ATP has introduced rules limiting the number of breaks a player can request during the match, as well as the length of them and when they are granted.



In the current landscape, players are only permitted to take one three-minute toilet break per match, and it must be taken at the end of a set. It remains to be seen whether that has any bearing on Djokovic and Sinner's 10th competitive meeting.

Sinner has won five of the previous nine, including the last four in a row. And unlike their 2022 contest, which Djokovic entered as the top seed and Sinner as the 10th, the Italian now goes in as the top dog with his veteran opponent seeded sixth.

Djokovic rated his chances ahead of the clash, saying: "I don't think I'm a favourite against these guys [Carlos Alcaraz and Sinner] at the moment. But I probably have my best chance against them here.

"If it comes down to me facing one or both of them, which I hope it does, as it would mean I have proceeded all the way to the final, then I'll obviously look for my best game to win. I think I do have a chance. There's no doubt about it."

Tennis

Friday's Wimbledon semifinal between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz saw two stoppages in the eighth game of the second set, due to spectators feeling unwell on Centre Court.

American men's No. 1 Fritz, at the time a set down, took a 0-15 lead at 4-3 in the second set when play was briefly halted. Chair umpire Marijana Veljovic called a brief stoppage as stewards tended to an unwell spectator, shielding them with umbrellas. A bottle of water was also delivered into the crowd.

Three points later at 30-30, the players were forced to stop again, as another incident saw a spectator receive medical attention. Both instances took place to Fritz's left, with supporters sitting in a stand unshaded against the sun. Veljovic joined several officials in a discussion courtside, including tournament referee Denise Parnell, before restarting to play.

Fritz went on to force an immediate break point, but Alcaraz saved it, and sealed the hold to continue a tightly contested second set which Fritz eventually won 7-5.

Temperatures at the All England Club ranged from 28 to 30 degrees Celsius during the semifinal, with this year's tournament taking place amid two British heatwaves.

There have been several incidents of play being stopped at this year's event. Both women's semifinals were interrupted Thursday — twice during Aryna Sabalenka's match against Amanda Anisimova — as stewards tended to the affected spectators. Sabalenka passed a bottle of water and an ice pack into the crowd.

Alcaraz similarly offered a water bottle to a spectator during his first-round match against Fabio Fognini, while Fritz saw his third-round match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina paused several times due to similar issues in the stands.

Wimbledon recorded its hottest-ever opening day in the history of the championships with the early days of the competition seeing temperatures of up to 32 degrees Celsius, just shy of 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Despite its roots as a recreational pursuit of the elite, modern-day tennis is about as close to a meritocracy as you'll find in professional sports. 

Whether it's Wimbledon or the lowest-rung tournament in tennis' minor leagues, there aren't any shortcuts to getting in. You qualify based on accomplishment. You can only advance to the next level by winning. You eat what you kill. You get what you deserve. And you are what your ranking says you are. 

Unless, of course, you're billionaire hedge fund guy Bill Ackman. 

On Wednesday afternoon, the 59-year old founder of Pershing Square Capital Management will suit up at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island, indulging his sports fantasy while making a mockery of the tournament and the ATP Challenger Tour where players strive to eke out a living. 

"I am playing the best tennis of my life," Ackman wrote last week on X, where he posts frequently about politics and is often far-too-eager to embrace ridiculous conspiracy theories. 

Including the idea that he belongs in a pro tennis event. 

Ackman's enthusiasm for tennis is indisputable. He's a bit of a gadfly on tour, befriending several players and helping bankroll the Professional Tennis Players Association when it was launched in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. He says he practices nearly every day, seems to be in good shape for a 59-year old and, because of his access to top players, has found himself on the other side of the net from all-time greats like Roger Federer in informal hitting sessions. 

And still, there is no deeper story to what's happening in Newport this week other than exactly what it looks like: A wealthy tennis benefactor who started playing seriously a decade ago using his privilege to say he competed in a pro tour event. We can be honest about how gross that is – both in Ackman's desire to make it happen and the ATP's willingness to humor him. 

How did it happen? 

According to Ackman's social media posts, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios had proposed playing doubles together at one point, but ongoing injury issues delayed their partnership indefinitely. 

"Fortunately fate intervened," Ackman wrote. 

Of course, it's not fate. It's simply the privilege of being Bill Ackman. Let's explain. 

Even though entrants for every tournament on the ATP or Challenger Tour level must meet a rankings threshold or earn a spot through a qualifying event, every tournament reserves a handful of wildcards that can be given out at its discretion. 

The wildcard system isn't perfect and sometimes creates controversy, but in general they're used for reasonable purposes: An accomplished player who lost their ranking due to injury and is trying to come back, an up-and-coming star with local ties, a highly-ranked player who didn't enter initially but decided to play at the last minute.

The Newport event, which was downgraded from ATP-level to a Challenger tournament this year, gave the wildcard in doubles to Jack Sock on the basis of being a former champion of the tournament and one of the most accomplished doubles players of the last decade. 

There's just one little issue: Sock, 32, is a pickleball player and podcaster now. His last professional tennis match was at the U.S. Open in 2023, and there is no indication that he's planning a comeback. Also interesting: In an interview with Front Office Sports last week, Ackman said he had never even met Sock but that they were going to begin practicing together last weekend. 

So Sock – out of the blue, apparently – requested a wildcard from Newport even though his tennis career has long been over. The tournament granted it, and Sock listed Ackman as his doubles partner. Which, again, the tournament allowed even though you can't find results on Ackman in any of the public tennis databases kept by the USTA or Universal Tennis Rating (UTR). 

Why was Ackman approved to compete? One truly wonders – unless, of course, you know how the world works. 

But that's not how tennis is supposed to work.

Look, it's not the end of the world. While technically the Ackman-Sock wildcard could have gone to a legitimate team that needed the opportunity rather than a sideshow, nobody's career is going to hinge on missing the cut for the doubles draw at the Newport Challenger. 

But this isn't a golf pro-am. It's the real thing. And as long as we have pro sports, you'd like them to be played by professionals and not exist for the whims of potential benefactors who have a ton of money and a delusion about how good they are at playing tennis.

It's a bad look, and it certainly doesn't help the image of a sport that does not necessarily deserve its country club reputation. While some top-ranked players came from privilege, it's not really that different from most other sports. The top two men's players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both emerged from middle class backgrounds. Djokovic grew up flat-out poor in a war-torn country. Coco Gauff started on the public courts in Delray Beach, Florida, inspired by Serena and Venus Williams' rise from Compton, California, to the top of the sport. And even for those who had advantages like Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills, there's no faking it in tennis. 

You have to win the right matches to establish your ranking, which gets you in the right tournaments, which only allows you to maintain that privilege if you keep winning. 

You can't use your social media fame or friendships or wealth to buy your way onto the pro tour.

Unless, apparently, you're Bill Ackman.

LONDON (AP) — Morgan Riddle's effect on Wimbledon semifinalist Taylor Fritz's rise in the rankings has been significant. He says so himself.

Riddle has been at the All England Club this year and others in her role as a fashion influencer, telling her hundreds of thousands of social media followers how tennis has become “the chicest sport in the world.” She's been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times' Style section.

She was seated at Centre Court on Friday for her boyfriend Fritz's match against Carlos Alcaraz.

Riddle frequently is at tournaments to cheer for him. They were featured in the Netflix tennis documentary “ Break Point.”

Riddle, 27, is a Minnesota native who attended Wagner College in New York City.

“By the end of my junior year, I had completed seven internships,” she said in a Wagner College video about the Class of 2019 member.

Riddle explained that the internships included gigs at a magazine, a newspaper, a government office, a coffee company startup and a real estate company, with tasks including social media.

Riddle and Fritz met about five years ago.

Fritz was the U.S. Open runner-up last September — his first appearance in a Grand Slam final — and reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in November.

He says it's important to have someone “push you in the right direction all the time, supporting you.” He spoke about Riddle's role after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals.

“There's an obvious correlation between my results and ranking and the time we've been together,” he said. “I would have to say she's been a big help to me, just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.”

Riddle has worked with the All England Club to create video segments called “Wimbledon Threads.”

Wearing brands such as Chanel and Jimmy Choo, she details trends like “tenniscore.”

“‘Tenniscore' isn't just about pleated skirts and vintage polos. It's about aspirational minimalism with a competitive edge,” she said in a video last week entitled “ How Wimbledon made tennis chic.”

She added that Wimbledon has “helped tennis become the chicest sport in the world.”

Riddle isn't afraid to throw a few zingers.

“Of course we're here for the tennis but what was once a strictly sporting event has also turned into a global fashion spectacle. I know some of you may not want to hear that but just because the fact annoys you, doesn't make it any less true,” she said.

That segment has 12,300 views as of Friday — a different Wimbledon video featuring a kid asking Aryna Sabalenka about pancakes has more than double that.

Riddle's clips on TikTok, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, are more popular. She also has more than 450,000 followers on Instagram.

Fritz often takes photos of her to post on social media.

“I've definitely gotten a lot better over the last couple of years but very reluctantly,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. “It's very embarrassing in public when I'm taking pictures (and) people are looking at me taking pictures of her. But you got to do what you got to do sometimes. She also takes good pictures of me.”

Grigor Dimitrov looked on course for a huge Wimbledon upset when he suffered a heartbreaking injury on Centre Court.

When Dimitrov and Jannik Sinner took to Centre Court for their fourth-round match at Wimbledon, many predicted a routine win for the world number one.

The Bulgarian had other ideas, storming into a two-set lead, leaving the Italian on the brink of a shock Wimbledon exit.

However, when holding serve at 2-2 in the third set, disaster struck, as Dimitrov injured his pectoral muscle, forcing him to retire from the match.

Set for a spell on the sidelines, the 34-year-old faces a race against time, with the US Open just six weeks away.

A former Grand Slam doubles champion has now shared whether he believes Dimitrov will be fit to compete in New York.

Appearing as a guest on the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', 2005 Wimbledon doubles champion Stephen Huss gave his verdict on Dimitrov's injury.

“I'd be shocked if he's back for the US Open. US Open is only six weeks away, I'd be shocked if he's back for that,” he said.

“That's awful, 34 years old, he's an amazing tennis player.

“I don't know how many times you can come back from injuries. He's certainly done it a few times, but to have to retire from five Slams in a row, I've never heard of that. 

“That's horrible.”

Dimitrov has now retired from five consecutive Grand Slam events, a horrific streak that is scarcely believable.

On two occasions, at the French Open and Wimbledon this year, Dimitrov was leading when forced to retire, as injuries continue to scupper his chances at Grand Slam glory.

According to reports from TennisKafe, Dimitrov suffered a partial tear of his pectoralis major muscle against Sinner.

The recovery time for such an injury varies from several weeks to months, giving him a chance to return in time for the US Open.

With the tournament 44 days away, there's still a good chance we will see the Bulgarian veteran entertain fans in New York later this year.

Dimitrov hasn't missed a US Open tournament since he made his debut at Flushing Meadows in 2011.

Winning 60% of his matches at the event, Dimitrov has passed the fourth round on two occasions, reaching the quarterfinals in 2024 and the semifinals in 2019.

His run in 2019 was particularly impressive, as he eased into the quarterfinals, where he secured one of the biggest wins of his career.

Standing between Dimitrov and a maiden US Open semifinal was five-time champion Roger Federer, who had won their previous six meetings.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the Swiss star who took the early lead, winning the first set 6-3 on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Not prepared to give up without a fight, the Bulgarian leveled the tie at one set apiece, clinching the second, 6-4.

Sharing the next two sets, Dimitrov and Federer's quarterfinal tie required a decider, as both players gave it their all with a place in the semis up for grabs.

Taking his game to another level, Dimitrov won the fifth set 6-2, advancing to the last four, securing his sole career win over the 20-time Grand Slam champion.

It was there that his run would come to an end, however, as Dimitrov fell in straight sets to Russia's Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals.

He has yet to return to the semis, but came close in 2024, retiring injured down two sets to one against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals.

Dimitrov will no doubt hope to be back fit for this year's tournament, where he can try to make another deep run in New York.

The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.

After she was in the eye of the storm due to her post-match speech after her loss to Coco Gauff in the French Open earlier this year, where she was criticized for her words, Belarusian player and World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka jokingly told reporters that they wouldn't get that sort of reaction after her Wimbledon loss.

“Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a Roland-Garros press conference,” Sabalenka said on Thursday when she arrived for her question-and-answer session after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4 4-6 6-4 at Centre Court. “So anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now.” 

The online vitriol was so intense that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club.

“I just don't want to face that hate again. We're all people. We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option,” the 27-year-old said.

“The first moment (is) always the worst one, because every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream. Then you lose the match, and you feel like, OK, this is the end,” she added. 

Talking about Anisimova, Sabalenka said that her opponent played a brave brand of tennis.

“She was more brave today. Maybe when I was just trying to stay in the point, she was going for all. She was playing more aggressive,” she said.



Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025. She also was trying to get to her first title match at Wimbledon but ultimately fell short.

The grass season is short and sweet -- and therefore extremely volatile. But that doesn't begin to explain this highly unlikely pairing in Saturday's Wimbledon final that will produce a first-time champion at the All England Club.

Amanda Anisimova, the No. 13 seed, was well outside the Top 400 early last year and wound up losing in the last round of qualifying at Wimbledon. And now a few days from her first visit to the PIF WTA Rankings Top 10, she's into the first Grand Slam final of her career.

No. 8 Iga Swiatek hasn't won a tournament since collecting her fourth Roland Garros title last spring. After losing in the Paris semifinals, she's had the best grass-court season of her life, winning nine of 10 matches, the last one a forceful 6-2, 6-0 performance against Belinda Bencic.

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draws

Earlier Thursday, Anisimova defeated No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a match that ran more than two-and-a-half hours.

The early rounds of Grand Slams are littered with first-time matchups, but this is only the third Wimbledon final of the Open Era featuring two players who have never met at the Hologic WTA Tour -- which makes this one so intriguing.

Who's going to take the crown this year? We make the case for both players:

With all the exciting new players coming into the game, the 24-year-old Swiatek doesn't produce a lot of “the youngest since …” statistics.

But here are a few significant precedents to consider. Swiatek, at 24 years and 30 days, is the youngest woman to reach:

“Tennis keeps surprising me,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “Honestly, I never even dreamed it would be possible to play in the final.”

One theory going around makes sense. Because she was so absorbed in winning those four titles in five years at Roland Garros (and all the commitments that entails), she came into the grass-court season understandably depleted. This year she took a few weeks off, practiced in Mallorca and came into Wimbledon fresh and eager.

“Honestly, I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practice,” Swiatek said. “If I win Roland Garros and then I come here and everybody ask me already about ... They put, like, super high expectations.”

Her fabulous forehand and footwork play well on grass and, at the urging of coach Wim Fissette, Swiatek is being more aggressive with her serve and, rather than settling in to defend long points, looking to end them after two or three shots. This fortnight, it's been a deadly combination.

See you Saturday @iga_swiatek 👏#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/tkl5O9PkUF

Swiatek has won 78 percent of her first-serve points, the best mark of any player that got past the first round. Throwing in a bagel to complete a semifinal is audacious stuff, and it's a window to the confidence she's feeling right now.

With a significant edge in her ability to cover the court, Swiatek will lean into that aggressive mindset against Anisimova.

And there's this: Swiatek has won all five of the major finals she's played. A sixth would mark her 100th match-win in Grand Slams, a fitting milestone on the surface she wondered if she'd ever conquer.

In the quarterfinals, Anisimova won 11 of the first 14 games against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and found herself a game away from a career-defining victory when the nerves rushed in. Eventually, though, she won the tiebreak, 11-9.

A similar scenario was in play in the semifinals, when Anisimova had a break-point opportunity for a 5-1 lead in the third before Sabalenka got it back on serve at 4-5. With a screaming forehand winner, Anisimova converted her fourth match point.

“In the third set I knew that I was going to really have to go for it,” Anisimova told reporters. “Her level just kept increasing and getting better and better throughout the match. So to be able to come on top, I really had to bring my game and do as much as I could.

Sabalenka couldn't disagree.

“I have to say that she was more brave today,” she said. “Maybe when I was just, like, trying to stay in the point, she was going for all -- she was playing more aggressive.”

Confidence? In the biggest match of her career, Anisimova defeated the World No. 1 for the sixth time in nine matches.

To beat Swiatek, she'll need to start fast. In 2025, Anisimova has won 28 straight matches when she takes the first set. She passed the ultimate test against Sabalenka, who had come back to win 11 of 13 matches this year when she dropped the first set.

Anisimova's backhand is her biggest strength, but on Thursday she took good care of her second serve, winning 24 of those 40 points -- the biggest statistical disparity in the match. She also saved an impressive 11 of 14 break points.

It's been quite a journey for Anisimova, who walked away from tennis halfway through the 2023 season. She reached the French Open semifinals as a 17-year-old and eventually struggled with the pressures of expectation.

“When I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game,” Anisimova said. “That was a little hard to digest because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a Grand Slam one day.”

Anisimova scored her first Top 10 win in a Grand Slam, beating Simona Halep in Paris. Six years later, she notched her second against Sabalenka.

She's playing with the joy and fearlessness of that long-ago 17-year-old, who now knows what she didn't know before.

Tennis

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Iga Świątek is into her first Wimbledon final and is not messing around.

She dominated Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 Thursday to set up a meeting with Amanda Anisimova of the U.S., with the controlled, clinical aggression on both serve and return that has defined her tennis the past fortnight.

Neither Świątek nor Anisimova has reached this stage before, but the Pole is the vastly more experienced player. She is a five-time Grand Slam champion who has spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1, even if by her own extremely high standards, she has fallen on harder times of late. The win makes Swiatek the only active WTA Tour player to reach a Grand Slam final on all three surfaces and a victory on Saturday would be Świątek's first title anywhere since winning a fourth Roland Garros title in June 2024, in what will be only her second final in that time.

Świątek suggested afterward that she's been helped by not coming into Wimbledon as the French Open champion. “I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practice,” she said in a news conference.

“If I win Roland Garros and then I come here and everybody ask me already about (winning Wimbledon)… They put, like, super high expectations. It's not kind of logical for me.”

She continues to look like a different player to the one who struggled throughout stretches of the last year. Her ability to ride out difficult moments has been a particular feature of this Wimbledon run, in contrast to the way in which she had started letting tight matches run away from her, by overhitting when things got tight and sending herself into a doom loop of mistakes. It happened in her shock defeat to a redlining Yulia Putintseva, who made one unforced error in a 13-game stretch of their third-round meeting here last year.

Świątek was so good against Bencic that there weren't too many tight moments. It briefly looked like things might get interesting when consecutive double faults helped give Bencic a couple of break points at the start of the second set, but Świątek quickly closed the door and got back to serving efficiently and returning with devastating aggression.

She won 83 percent of first-serve points and made 90 percent of returns.

Those strong foundations gave Świątek the platform to produce the kind of masterclass that brought back memories of the 2022 version of her who won two Grand Slams and won 37 matches in a row. She played with variety when needed, volleying with confidence for instance, but she barely needed to veer from her Plan A because it was working so well.

“I definitely thought today was just a different level from Iga,” Bencic said in a news conference.

“She was completely on fire. Maybe I would have had to play my absolutely best tennis of my life and risk every shot to beat her today the way she played.

“She was just playing very, very fast, very accurate, serving great. Just didn't really let me in the match. She didn't allow me to play my game.”

After winning the first three games of the match, confidence was coursing through Świątek. Bencic took a little while to settle, not helped by a nasty-looking fall in the second set. Play was paused after a spectator required medical assistance in the crowd, but Świątek did not allow the break in her momentum to affect her.

In the final game of the first set, she chased down a drop shot and flicked away a forehand passing-shot winner; In the first point of the second, she crunched a forehand winner down the line to send the message that there was going to be no let up.

At the start of the next game she middled a crosscourt backhand return winner past her demoralized opponent. “She's in the zone,” nine-time champion Martina Navratilova said in commentary for the BBC.

Świątek herself used the same phrase to describe herself afterward, and explained what she has learned to appreciate on grass.

“I think there's no place to overthink here,” she said.

“You kind of have to follow your instincts. If that is going well and you can rely on them for sure if you feel comfortable, so this is kind of fun in some way and different than on other surfaces where you have more time to build the rally.”

A feature of watching Świątek during 2022, and whenever she's been at her best, is wondering not whether she will lose, but how many games her opponent will win. She streaked away to a 5-0 lead in the second set, before crunching a backhand return to bring up a first match point.

Bencic saved it, but Świątek secured a trademark bagel set a couple of points later with another backhand winner, after just 71 minutes on court.

This was a statement victory, and Anisimova need only listen to how in awe Bencic was afterwards to know how big a task she has Saturday.

Zverev lost a five-set marathon to France's Arthur Rinderknech and later told reporters he felt "empty" and was considering therapy.

"Alexander Zverev has unfortunately withdrawn from the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad 2025 for personal reasons," organisers said.

They added that defending champion Matteo Berrettini would also miss the event due to injury. The Italian also suffered a surprise first-round exit at the recent grasscourt Grand Slam.

The Swiss Open begins on Monday.

John McEnroe is known for being an outspoken individual especially during his tennis career.

The American has never been afraid to speak his mind, as his memorable outbursts at chair umpires illustrate.

Since his playing days John McEnroe, 66, has gone on to become one of tennis' most successful commentators.

But following the conclusion of the men's French Open final a month ago, the former world number one made a comment that left some members of the tennis world both surprised and unhappy.

The tennis world was left in awe after witnessing an all-time classic French Open final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

The Spaniard came from two sets down and saved match points in the fourth set to win 4–6, 6–7, 6–4, 7–6, 7–6 in five hours and 29 minutes, the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time.

After seeing the level they were able to produce, McEnroe seemed to suggest that Sinner and Alcaraz could beat Rafael Nadal in his prime at the French Open. The seven-time Grand Slam champion's comments were criticised, but he has since clarified what he meant.

“He would still win six or seven of them. He might not have won 14 of them, that's all I am saying. That these guys could challenge him. I did not say that they are better than him,” McEnroe told 6-Love-6 on BBC Sounds.

“Nadal would have the same equipment and blah, blah, blah. They just make it up [what he said]. They didn't misunderstand it, they made it up.

“This is what I said ‘the fact you could even think someone could compete with Nadal is amazing'. You could look at Alcaraz the way he plays at the French and go, he could give him a match.”

Nadal played Sinner and Alcaraz a combined total of six times during his career.

The 22-time Grand Slam champion defeated Sinner each of the three times they faced one another. Each meeting took place on clay and the current world number one was unable to win a set.

Like Sinner, Nadal played his 2024 Olympics doubles partner Alcaraz on three occasions. The first match came at the 2021 Madrid Open, where Nadal secured a comprehensive 6-1, 6-2 victory.

The following year they met in the Indian Wells semi-finals, which Nadal claimed in three sets in blustery conditions.

 ‘But in their third and final meeting, Alcaraz and Nadal played in the Spanish capital once again, and this time it was the younger Spaniard who prevailed, bringing their short rivalry to an end.

Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a 'hate relationship' with Wimbledon after to failing to win her third semi-final on Centre Court on Thursday afternoon. 

The world No1 had been looking to compete in her third major final of the season after defeats at the Australian Open and Roland-Garros, but was thwarted by the No13 seed Amanda Anisimova in three knife's-edge sets. 

Last year saw the 27-year-old forced to withdraw on the eve of the tournament after suffering a shoulder injury, with Sabalenka then vowing to be back 'stronger than ever'. 

Instead, Sabalenka's heartbreak on grass continued, with the Belarusian having previously lost to Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 semi-final, and Ons Jabeur at the same stage two years later. 

When asked about whether her experience against the American star in the 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 defeat would make help make her a better Wimbledon champion in the future, Sabalenka was honest about the immediate difficulties she is facing in the aftermath of the loss. 

'It's tough, like you said, to think about that, but I really hope so,' Sabalenka said. 'I lost three semis, three tough ones. 

Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a choppy ongoing relationship with Wimbledon

The world No1 was defeated across three tight sets by American star Amanda Anisimova

In a challenging press conference after the match, Sabalenka tried to balance her good humour with bitter disappointment

'Then I was banned from playing (due to her nationality, in 2022). Then I was injured. So I have really more of a hate relationship right now with Wimbledon, but I really hope that one day I will, yeah, turn it around and have love relationship.

'Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it.

'Yeah, now it's tough, but I never give up, and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure.'

Sabalenka also revealed that she had almost let her tempter get the better of her and smashed up her racquets on-court. 

On-court in the final stages of the match, Sabalenka had crashed her racquet into her head briefly, but avoided a major fine by refusing to take her anger out on the grass. 

'We all can lose control over our emotions,' Sabalenka continued. 'It's absolutely normal. 

'Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start... I don't know... yelling, screaming, smashing the racquets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option, and it's not going to help me to stay in the match and to fight for my dream.

'Even right now I took a bit more time before doing my media just so I can be Aryna, not that crazy person that been on that media day at Roland-Garros.'

The 27-year-old has previously been defeated in three semi-finals at the SW19 tournament

But Sabalenka was keen the manage her sadness in light of the backlash she received after losing to Coco Gauff in Paris

Sabalenka's reference to the French Open final came after the US Open champion found herself at the centre of a media firestorm after she was accused of failing to acknowledge her opponent Coco Gauff's achievements in winning in Paris. 

The star later apologised both publicly and privately to Gauff, with the pair filming a TikTok dance together on Centre Court after the olive branch had been extended. 

But as much as Sabalenka was able to keep her emotions in check to a degree, she could not fully extinguish her trademark competitive fire. 

Sabalenka had declared that she was 'p****d off' by Anisimova for two of her celebrations on court during the tight match. 

The 23-year-old first appeared to celebrate a winner before the ball had bounced twice, as is custom, with Sabalenka questioning the umpire as to whether the noise was a 'hinderance'. 

Anisimova reportedly implied that was something that Sabalenka had done in the past, adding to the charged atmosphere. 

'I was just trying to chase the ball and, yeah, she was already celebrating it,' said Sabalenka. 'I was, like, I mean, that's a bit too early. Then she kind of p****d me off saying that, "oh, that's what she does all the time."

'I was grateful she actually said that because it actually helped me to keep fighting. I'm like, "okay, now I'm going to show you the tennis." So I came back because I got really angry in that moment.

The point which won Anisimova her fifth game of the final set occurred after the ball hit the top of the net and bounced over - which usually results in the player apologising to their opponent

But Anisimova (top) celebrated after winning the point, leaving Sabalenka (bottom) unamused

'So probably in the third set I should have remembered and it probably will help!'

Another celebration came in the closing stages of the match, when Anisimova's ball clipped the net cord and fell fortuitously over the other side - and rather than offering a brief, and likely insincere, apology, Anisimova clenched her fist to cheer the point won. 

A disgusted Sabalenka turned to her box before glaring at Anisimova and asking her why she didn't apologise.

'I just looked at her and, for sure, she didn't hear me, I was like "You don't want to say sorry?",' said Sabalenka. 'She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match.

'It's on her. If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation, that's on her.' 

But after match point, the hostilities quickly ebbed away, with the pair hugging at the net and Anisimova paying tribute to her opponent in her own press conference.  

Anisimova and Sabalenka put the match behind them to share a hug at the net at its end

Anisimova will now prepare for her first-ever Grand Slam final against Poland's Iga Swiatek

'This doesn't feel real right now,' said Anisimova. 'Aryna is such a tough competitor and I was absolutely dying out there. I don't know how I pulled it off, shes's an incredible competitor and an inspiration to me and to so many people.

'We have had so many tough battles and to come out on top and reach the final at Wimbledon is incredibly special.'

Anisimova will meet Iga Swiatek in Saturday's final in their first meeting on the professional tour. 

The duo previously met as juniors in a Fed Cup (now known as the Junior Billie Jean King Cup) match-up between USA and Poland, with Swiatek taking the 2016 match.

Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner have both had injury scares during the second week at Wimbledon

Wimbledon 2025

Venue: All England Club Dates: 30 June-13 July 

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

The prospect of watching 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic take on world number one Jannik Sinner for a place in the Wimbledon final is a mouth-watering one, but fitness concerns remain before Friday's match.

Djokovic, 38, fell awkwardly late on in his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli, but picked himself up to wrap up victory and progress.

Sinner, meanwhile, hurt his right elbow after slipping in the first game of his fourth-round tie with Grigor Dimitrov on Monday.

The Italian ultimately progressed after his opponent retired through injury, but he had heavy strapping on his elbow in his quarter-final win over Ben Shelton.

Sinner said he would be "100% fit" to face Djokovic, but the Serb has not been quite so definitive and cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday.

Sinner cancelled a scheduled session on Tuesday, heading indoors for some light hitting while he awaited the results of a scan.

Djokovic may have done likewise - but it does still cast some doubt over his fitness.

Djokovic reached the semi-finals of this year's Australian Open but had to retire after the first set against Alexander Zverev, having injured his leg in the previous round.

Given his age, Djokovic accepts he has to work harder than 23-year-old Sinner or 22-year-old Wimbledon defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to keep up with them physically.

"Sometimes I get tired of all the chores I have to do on a daily basis to get my body ready to be able to perform," he said.

"It's a lot of hours spent off the court, in the gym or on the table just trying to work with what I have.

"Physically, I hope that I'll be able to sustain that."

Sinner, who is bidding to reach his first Wimbledon final, did take part in his scheduled practice session on Thursday but seemed in no discomfort as he laughed and joked with his team.

Alcaraz will face Taylor Fritz in the first men's semi-final on Friday - but the American too had to take a medical timeout in his quarter-final win over Karen Khachanov.

Fifth seed Fritz had treatment on his feet - and concerns were heightened by the fact he had just lost the third set 6-1 after controlling the first two.

But Fritz, through to the last four at SW19 for the first time, allayed those fears after his victory, saying he just needed taping on his foot redone.

"It's pretty common - a lot of players do this tape job so your foot doesn't get irritated," he said.

"I think I ripped it off at some point in the second so I just needed to get it redone."

The only person who got through the quarter-finals without a hint of an injury was world number two Alcaraz.

A fully-fit Alcaraz is certainly a concern for his rivals as he bids for a third Wimbledon title in a row.

She was derided for being the ultimate tennis “WAG” and accused of profiting from her boyfriend's successful career. But Morgan Riddle, the immaculately dressed girlfriend of Taylor Fritz who has graced Wimbledon with her fashion tips this past fortnight, is becoming something of a cult heroine in tennis. Not only that, she is being credited with elevating SW19's fashion game and attracting legions of younger fans to the sport.

Such is Riddle's influence that she was dubbed “the most famous woman in men's tennis” when she was splashed on the cover of The New York Times two years ago. Ever since she was profiled in Netflix's Break Point series in 2023, the cameras have trailed the glamorous former model, who is known for her “tenniscore chic”, wherever she goes.

She has been a regular face in Fritz's box and will be expected to make another dutiful appearance for his semi-final showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Friday, when the American fifth seed will need all the support he can get. But this glitzy 27-year-old is not simply content with playing the secondary role of cheerleader from the sidelines.

Curiously, it is at the All England Club where Riddle's authority is the strongest. In a savvy move, Wimbledon organisers snapped her up two summers ago to front a dedicated fashion blog called Wimbledon Threads – where she imparts sacred knowledge on the latest clothing trends and in-season outfits to don at the Championships.

This year, it has proved a popular hit after the social media trend “Inspired by Moorgs” took off, which involves Riddle re-sharing photos of glam fans who have opted for her look. It may not chime with tennis tradition, but it is working.

Radiating a picture-perfect vibe with her elegant outfits and flowing blonde locks, a cursory look at Riddle's social feeds would suggest she is an easy target for male attention. Her fanbase, though, is in fact predominantly female and she has previously talked about her desire to use her platforms and engaging content to make sport more welcoming to women.

She has 600,000 followers and counting on TikTok, close to half a million on Instagram and an additional 80,000 on YouTube – with 18 to 24-year-old women reportedly making up around 80 per cent across all of her platforms.

But how likely is it that these Riddle fangirls will become hardcore tennis aficionados? It is one thing to gorge on the latest fashion tips and trends fed to you by an influencer, but quite another to get hooked on a five-set epic between Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, let alone buy tickets to events.

“She's quite divisive,” claims 20-year-old tennis fan Stella Newman. “People who are into tennis just want to watch tennis and that's true when it comes to social media. Clips compiled of Alcaraz and Sinner hitting all their different winners, for example – that's the sort of tennis that I interact with. Tennis purists debating about who's the GOAT on social media aren't that concerned about Morgan Riddle. There's definitely a bit of a split.”

Wimbledon's own social-media footprint has seen considerable growth across its channels this year – notably TikTok – with video clips of on-court action among the tournament's highest-performing content. Perhaps one reason is the new crop of personalities the sport has to celebrate, from Alcaraz's immense likeability to Coco Gauff's striking ability to fuse athleisure with high-end fashion.

“Everyone knows who Alcaraz is – it's the same with Coco Gauff, who has lots of brand recognisability behind her,” says Newman. “For me, that feels more genuine than following someone like Morgan Riddle. Rivalries are important – for people my age they missed out on the rivalry of the so-called ‘big three' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Now everyone's thinking Sinner and Alcaraz are the next big thing, so they all want to cotton on to it.”

Still, Riddle's presence may be welcome given tennis is battling to stay relevant in light of the astronomical rise of padel – a racket sport popularised by a growing number of celebrities from Stormzy to David Beckham.

This American has taken the definition of “WAG” – that horribly outdated term designated to sportsmen's wives and girlfriends – to a completely new stratosphere. This is Morgan Riddle's world and even if she might be dividing opinion, there are a lot of people living it.

"Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a ‘Roland-Garros press conference,'" the world No. 1 quipped after losing to Amanda Anisimova.ByAssociated PressPublished Jul 10, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 10, 2025

LONDON (AP) — As if there were any doubt whether Aryna Sabalenka's loss in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday brought to mind her loss in the French Open final — and its aftermath — a month ago, she made it quite clear right away."Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a ‘Roland-Garros press conference,'" the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said when she arrived for her question-and-answer session with reporters after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Centre Court, "so anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now."It was delivered as a punch line, knowing full well that the three-time Grand Slam champion was widely criticized for her words following a three-set loss to Coco Gauff with the trophy at stake in Paris.There was plenty of online venom directed Sabalenka's way.So much so, that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff, then offered a public mea culpa, before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club.

"I just don't want to face that hate again," Sabalenka said Thursday. "We're all people. We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option."After praising Anisimova — an American seeded 13th who will play in her first major final on Saturday against Iga Swiatek — as "the better player," Sabalenka spoke about the feelings she experiences following a setback."The first moment (is) always the worst one, because every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream," said the 27-year-old from Belarus. "Then you lose the match, and you feel like, ‘OK, this is the end.'"Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025.She also was trying to get to her first title match at Wimbledon.

So used to overpowering opponents, Sabalenka ran into someone who hits as big a ball as she does."She was more brave today," Sabalenka said. "Maybe when I was just trying to stay in the point, she was going for all. She was playing more aggressive."There were other things about Anisimova that Sabalenka acknowledged were irritating.During one exchange, for example, Anisimova let out a shout before a point was over, and Sabalenka thought it was a premature celebration."I was, like, I mean, ‘That's a bit too early.' Then she kind of (angered me), saying that, oh, that's what she does all the time," Sabalenka said. "I was grateful that she actually said that," because it helped bring out more fight.

Then she kind of (angered me), saying that, oh, that's what she does all the time," Sabalenka said. "I was grateful that she actually said that," because it helped bring out more fight.

Asked about that moment, Anisimova said: "I wasn't celebrating. It was just a long grunt, I guess. I don't really know what was the deal there, to be honest, because I didn't feel like it was that interfering. But I tried to not do it again."During another point, Anisimova benefited from the ball trickling over the tape of the net and, instead of the usual "Sorry, not sorry" gesture players often use by raising a hand when that happens, seemed to be celebrating."I was like, ‘You don't want to say sorry?' She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match," Sabalenka said. "If she doesn't feel like saying sorry — she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation? — that's on her."As for what comes next for Sabalenka?"I never give up," she said, "and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure."

David Lynch was a true original, so singular that we had to invent the term “Lynchian” just to describe his work. The fact that we all instantly know what that means speaks to how powerfully his style and sensibility came through in every frame, through a deep, intentional marriage of form and content. While his talent was once-in-a-generation, that uniqueness was something he cultivated and protected through his creative process.

“He had that infinite wonder of everything, he would get transfixed into just the sheer act of exploration, experimentation, discovery,” said longtime Lynch collaborator Dean Hurley on the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “He loved to get into the sandbox of experimentation because the emotional spark that happens when you discover something, or stumble upon something, to him was the secret sauce to how things started. You're rubbing a flint against something and you're creating that spark that hopefully jumps onto something and creates a fire. He was always doing that.”

For 14 years, Hurley had a front-row seat to how exactly Lynch did that. He worked daily with the “Twin Peaks” director in his Hollywood Hills studio.

 










Lynch owned a compound of three homes in the Hollywood Hills, one of which appeared in “Lost Highway” before he converted it into the recording studio where he spent most of his waking hours. Hurley was originally hired as the studio engineer, but quickly realized the role was much broader. He became Lynch's all-purpose “sound guy,” handling everything from recording, mixing, and session playing to archiving, post supervision, and tracking down unusual instruments and sound-making devices.

“The space was a hundred percent unique,” said Hurley. “It was built like a commercial studio, and he put a ton of money into it, but it was all bespoke.”

Hurley described how the home studio was an extension of Lynch's art. The painter-musician-filmmaker designed every inch of the space, down to the texture of the walls and the furniture (which he built himself).

“He lived his whole life like that,” Hurley said. “He would craft everything down to every detail.  He literally curated and designed his whole experience on life: Where he lived, where he worked, where he moved. It was incredible.”

Sound and music provided Lynch the “emotional spark” for so much of his art.

 










“Sound is a very unique thing. Sound and music, these things of vibrations, at that certain window of frequency, it does something to us as humans. It is a carrier tone for our emotions,” said Hurley. “When you have a brain like [David's], that is so tuned into emotional learning, there's something that grabbed him and it set up this intense glowing breadcrumb where he wanted to follow and chase that feeling.”

Lynch himself told the origin story of when he was first inspired to make a film while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While working on a painting of a woman in a garden at night, he heard wind. He saw the green in the painting move, the still life becoming a moving picture in his mind. For Lynch, something so non-narrative as wind inspired him to pursue a new medium. Hurley said he saw the anecdote play out every day and believes it is the connective tissue to other great directors.

“I think for filmmakers in general, it's the ones who are masters at their craft who are chasing feelings and figuring out the architecture of how to design that feeling for an audience,” said Hurley.

Like the wind in the painting, Lynch would often get transfixed by something seemingly small. On the podcast, Hurley said Lynch became fascinated by the sounds he could generate scratching on his favorite chair in the studio.

 










“It's funny, going back and listening to some of these [recordings], they all sound the same, but like everyone he would start scratching a little rhythm, and he'd be say [Hurley doing an impression of an excited Lynch], ‘Listen to that Dean [pause], listen to that, Dean.' It would almost be like he'd forgotten the last time and he would get re-excited,” said Hurley. “It was always a reset for him. He was incredibly fired up about the smallest little things, just the simple act of life dancing before his eyes and ears.”

Hurley admitted he could be dismissive — “Yeah, I've got that recording already” — but he grew to see how moments like this were key to Lynch's process.

“He could stay a long time in that zone,” said Hurley. “The lowering of the barometer is bringing down that awareness and interest to a sort of subatomic level that most people are not vibrating on that zone. One of his favorite quotes was ‘Where the attention goes, that becomes lively.'”

What Hurley described as Lynch's “lowering of the barometer” was exploration done without a specific project, story, or medium in mind. The scratching could lead to a song, or the emotional underpinning of a scene in “Twin Peaks,” or the concept for window display. The longer he remained in the zone of following a spark of interest, the greater the possibility of discovery and alchemy.

 










“That lens of somebody like him is one I think a lot of the filmmakers that we gravitate to [have],” said Hurley. “They're putting a magnifying glass over something that is often skimmed over, they're elevating it to a hyper-focused level where you didn't realize how deep that area was before.”

Hurley wore many hats in Lynch's world. On “Twin Peaks: The Return” he had many official titles because Lynch didn't want to bring in specialized professionals every time he tried to make something. He preferred a more DIY, hands-on approach that allowed discoveries to evolve organically.

“That way he could impart more of himself and have a more of an action-and-reaction kind of process with the making of things,” said Hurley.

Hurley said this also explained Lynch's instant love affair with digital technology in the 2000s.

“[Digital] reduced his time, specifically the action and reaction time; he wanted that feedback,” said Hurley. “He definitely took to digital like a duck to water because it just reduced, reduced, reduced, and also allowed him to go back to the early days of basically doing everything DIY himself, like with short films, having a Bolex and just having a small group of people.”

Much of Lynch's creative life was about finding ways to extend the process of exploration and discovery. Even after their recordings transitioned from experimentation to the building blocks of a film, Hurley would come up with ways that allowed Lynch to extend his action-and-reaction process.

 










For example, Hurley would take a theme, like the sound of electricity in “Twin Peaks,” and use samplers to create a full keyboard array where each key had different sounds that Lynch could play.

“He liked discovery, so you put a garden of discovery in front of him and he would stumble over certain things, and then you could see which were exciting him [doing his excited Lynch impression again], ‘ I love that Dean. I love that,'” said Hurley.

That which thrilled Lynch became the first step in building a palette. Lynch would categorize sounds, applying unusual names that spoke to him about the feeling of a section of the show or movie.

“He would be like, ‘Yeah, that section where it got really hairy,' or ‘that really low mood stuff,” so you'd start to categorize that stuff as building blocks,” said Hurley. “You could chop it up, ‘Okay, I've got this here.' ‘This is a distinctly different mood than this section.' You just start slowly building the thing and then with that stuff floating all in the air, something would inspire something else. It's really hard to talk about, because as it's laid out in a linear fashion, when you got to the end, you could see, ‘Oh, that led to that, led to that.' But when you're in it, it feels like you're in a dark room bumping into furniture.”

 










The rise of digital sound made it much easier to build dense, multi-layered soundtracks, although not always to the benefit of the artform. One key lesson Hurley took from working with Lynch, and still applies to his work as a sound editor today, is the power of restraint and efficiency.

“You can throw a bunch of different sounds [at a scene] trying to think more is better, but [David] was always interested in ‘Let's find a sound for this.' It was about finding the exact right sound to elicit the emotion,” said Hurley. “It creates an architecture of, 'Is this doing anything for us?' If it's not, get it out of there. Everything has its purpose.”

While working on “Twin Peaks: The Return,” Hurley saw how Lynch applied this principle across his creative process. Lynch often grew frustrated when collaborators focused on background details or secondary actions — anything he felt distracted from the primary focus of a scene.

“There's a power in efficiency, and I think that goes across the board with him, with his writing, with his shot syntax,” said Hurley. “A director is someone who directs your attention.  So when you have a scene, a tool of directing is what do I want them to pay attention to? Each element is an opportunity to exploit, to focus, to present in a way that crafts a feeling.”

 










Lynch's studio was transformed into the post-production hub for all 18 episodes of “Twin Peaks: The Return.” He invited a small group of trusted collaborators into this tightly controlled, insular space. Like an unnecessary sound effect, anyone not essential to that process was kept outside the environment he so carefully maintained.

“I think that's one of the clear-cut tools of David is that he unified the goals and intentions of a massive group of people so he could align people to his vantage point, to his goal, to the result he was after, and people latched onto that,” said Hurley. “And when everybody's in the same house, there was a huge comfort factor for David because it's all insular and it's all his home, and I think that plays into it as well.”

Hurley said it was during the edit that he fully grasped the deeper alchemy of Lynch's art. After more than a decade working on sound, he could now see how every element of Lynch's craft fed into a unified creative process.

“You're seeing different practitioners problem solve and you're seeing what's coming for you later [referring to dailies, and picture editing], and they're walking in and hearing what's coming later. It had a very hive mind vibe, it got everybody on the same wavelength,” said Hurley.

 










In the decade leading up to the third season of “Twin Peaks,” Lynch focused on smaller side projects and work outside of film and television. But according to Hurley, the “Twin Peaks” experience reignited his drive to pursue another large-scale project. At one point, “The Unrecorded Night” was briefly in motion until COVID brought everything to a halt.

“What happened after ‘Twin Peaks' wrapped is I think he got rejuvenated for that process of being the conductor of a large orchestra for something like that. I think he loved the humanity, the camaraderie, the relationships, the circus of activity with projects like that definitely put the bug in his bonnet to want to do another large scale film or TV project,” said Hurley.

It's our loss that he didn't get to do his last film project. If there's one thing we know for sure, it's that Lynch and his process would have led to another creation unlike anything else we'll see again.

James Gunn's DC Studios reset “Superman” is flying toward a potential $150 million weekend debut at the box office, with $22 million already in the bank from Thursday previews. But now that we've finally seen it, IndieWire's “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio are here to debate the movie, which swaps Henry Cavill for newcomer David Corenswet as the kryptonite-averse hero who also goes by Clark Kent. (Read David Ehrlich's IndieWire review here.)

Anne was in New York this week to join Ryan in-studio at the IndieWire offices to discuss the movie and more, Ryan having just seen it at the Regal Times Square during the first afternoon 2 p.m. public screening. While Anne enjoyed the screwball-romantic chemistry between Corenswet and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” breakout Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Ryan loathed the experience and found it to be another serving of superhero slop as depressing as any other (despite some winky, cheeky banter). Like other superhero tentpoles before it, Gunn's new “Superman” descends into a 45-minute maelstrom of CGI nonsense, yet another good-vs.-evil battle that crosses times and dimensions and may be easy to follow (at least compared to other Marvel or DC final battles) but is ultimately hard to care about or invest in.

Corenswet is plenty handsome and charming as the character originated on the big screen by Christopher Reeve and created in the comics by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. But the fact is no Superman movie has been as good as Richard Donner's 1978 take, which Anne and Ryan can both agree on. (Same goes for another summer tentpole, “Jurassic World Rebirth,” another franchise wherein the first movie was the only true great one.) This “Superman” movie's message of good prevailing over evil grew tiresome for Ryan, but then again, what possible psychological nuance were we expecting from a fun-in-the-sun summer blockbuster? He felt exhausted and defeated, whereas Anne found things to like about what's going to be one of the season's biggest films, the casting especially.

 










Later in the episode, and since we took a break for Fourth of July, we finally parse the New York Times' list of the 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century, crowned by Bong Joon Ho's historic Best Picture winner “Parasite” at #1. We factor in some recency bias for that choice — though we aren't denying it's a fantastic film — as well as its timely take on class disparity that is strongly resonating in America today. (The Times' list of 500 participants included no film critics.) We offer up our own favorites, which veer wildly, though we both agree “No Country for Old Men” (#6 on the Times' list) is a lock for any best-of-century Top 10. (Also check out IndieWire's best films of the 2020s, which published earlier in June.)

Elsewhere, we take a look at new TV series including “Dept. Q,” a British crime thriller on Netflix from Scott Frank and Chandni Lakhani that Anne loves. Ryan, however, raves about “Girls” creator Lena Dunham's return to TV with “Too Much,” starring Megan Stalter as a Dunham-adjacent who moves to London and falls in with a quote-unquote bad boy (Will Sharpe) after a bad breakup. It's as much a send-up of millennial culture as it is a tribute to the great British romantic comedies of the '90s and aughts, like “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones's Diary.”

A film told from the rose-colored binoculars of an inquisitive child's perspective would never work without a strong child actor to anchor it. Enter Lexi Venter, the first-time performer Embeth Davidtz discovered for her feature debut, “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight,” an adaptation of Alexandra Fuller's 2001 memoir of a hardscrabble life as the youngest of a white Zimbabwean family living in civil-war-torn Rhodesia in the 1980s.

Davidtz told IndieWire she needed “a wild, untrained, feral, spontaneous creature” for her lead, and after working with a casting director who scouts for child reality could-be stars, she found Venter, who is a true revelation as Bobo. (As tired a prescriptive cliche as “revelation” may be to criticism around a debut actor.) Venter's performance, with a wild-eyedness that both captures Bobo's naivete as well as the fact that she has grown up too fast and seen all too much, is the emotional anchor of Davidtz's personal tale.

The “Schindler's List,” “Matilda,” and “Mad Men” star moved to South Africa around the same age as Bobo/Fuller, similarly observing casual and not-so-casual racism and violence as farm girl Bobo does in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Davidtz approaches the material not from an ethnographic or anthropological vantage — she's now, of course, a privileged woman who's brushed with Hollywood — but an eye-level emotional clarity. Despite its tongue-twister of a title, “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” is never confused on its journey toward an emotional impact.

 










As Fuller's award-winning memoir exists as a collection of memories, so too does the film “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” unfold impressionistically, Bobo catching observations of her prejudiced, alcoholic mother Nicola (Davidtz) and distant, soldier father Tim (Rob Van Vuuren) through gauzy curtains, under tables and bedsheets, the adults around her looming tall from her tiny frame of view. 

Free-flowing “Days of Heaven”-esque narration courtesy of Fuller's text is read by Vinter in voiceover, occasionally muddling whether the words are supposed to be from Bobo as a young girl (Venter is seven years old) or an older, wiser Fuller. It's a poetic, if disorienting, swirl of both. At one point, Bobo spies Nicola and Tim having giddy, delirious sex after he's returned from the hazardous bush, where he's been gunning down guerrilla fighters (“they're laughing and drinking brandy while moving furniture with their clothes off”). At another, after her father has left the farm yet again without saying goodbye, she realizes, “We are women without men now, which is a bad state of affairs.”

Bobo, disheveled and barefoot with unkempt hair, runs amok on the family's dilapidated Rhodesian grounds, cinematographer Willie Nel's camera keeping close behind her or even inhabiting her viewpoint. The film has a restless energy to match, with a rock soundtrack and a searching, handheld lens that goes  as in and out of focus as Bobo's grasp on her world does. 

 










Nicola, meanwhile, sleeps with an assault rifle when she's not dazed in a hangover after another night (or early afternoon) of heavy boozing, and her mother's racist vitriol toward the servants on the farm and lingerers around it are ones Bobo copies back to the one she's closest to, Sarah (Zikhona Bali). Davidtz's observations about how racism is often hereditary are the throughline that makes “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” a movie about children but not necessarily for them. Though rooting that intention in the eyes of a white child threatens to come at the dismissal of the Black Africans more directly affected.

Meanwhile, Bobo's older sister Vanessa (Anina Reed) is subject to the leering eyes and grabby hands of white men in the Rhodesian outpost, where raucous dance nights send Nicola drunkenly, coquettishly twirling into the arms of others while her husband is away, her children left dangerously to fend for themselves. Davidtz's performance is raw-emotioned — the strain of having only three hours a day for production in South Africa due to child labor restrictions (per Anne Thompson's IndieWire reporting) might have inadvertently made for a more distressed turn in front of the camera, and it's effective. What's fascinating about “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” being told from a child's eye is how that very eye never renders the adults in more childlike terms: Bobo sees and understands these people as an adult would.

 










Hovering on the horizon is the impending election that would turn Rhodesia into Zimbabwe, as African nationalists attempted to distance themselves from white colonial rule. With that tidal wave of a change is the inevitability that Tim will sell their farm. Davidtz's film ends where Fuller's memoir continued — what happened to her family after they left Rhodesia/Zimbabwe for East Africa — less limiting the perspective than whittling the material down to a workable, sizable story. The grand takeaway is Venter's astonishing turn. That kid's got a future, and it began with a filmmaker who knew how to direct her: with patient energy while also encouraging the freedom to play and seek and explore as Bobo does within her little big world.

“Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” opens from Sony Pictures Classics on Friday, July 11.

EXCLUSIVE: Finn Little will reprise his Yellowstone character, Carter, as a series regular in the as-yet-untitled Beth and Rip spinoff for Paramount+, sources tell Deadline. He joins his former co-stars Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, who are leading the Taylor Sheridan series as their characters from the original series, Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, respectively.


As Deadline revealed in December, the show is expected to remain on the same present-day timeline, with the new offshoot sharing the most DNA with the mothership of any show in the universe to date.


	The original series follows the Dutton family that controls the largest contiguous cattle ranch in the United States. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip Wheeler, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son.

	Little debuted as Carter in Yellowstone‘s fourth season premiere, a role he continued until the series finale. His character is a troubled teen who met Beth at the hospital when she was visiting her ailing father, and where Carter's father was dying. After he loses his father due to drug addiction, Beth and Rip become his guardians, giving Carter work on their ranch. Beth, unable to have children due to a forced sterilization, is uninterested in being a mother. However, she and Rip form a bond with the hard-working young man who remained with them.

	











	Paramount+ declined to comment.


Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.


	The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals for CBS, led by Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, with additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 previously announced as being in development.


	Australian-born Little's credits also include the films The Surfer (2024), working opposite Nicolas Cage, the Taylor Sheridan-directed Those Who Wish Me Dead (2021), alongside Angelina Jolie and Jon Bernthal. His TV credits include roles in Netflix's Reckoning, with Milly Alcock and Sam Trammell, and Tidelands, also from the streamer. He also portrayed Noomi Rapace's son in the psychological thriller Angel of Mine. He is repped by Paradigm and Hansen Jacobson.

Tyler Perry accuser Derek Dixon came forward with his allegations because “I couldn't just let him get away with this,” he says in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “There are always attempts to resolve situations like this privately, but they never result in the type of change necessary to protect further victims. At the end of the day my absolute fear is that he will be able to continue doing this without any major consequences.”

Dixon has filed a lawsuit against Perry alleging sexual harassment and assault. He tells THR that Perry first singled him out when Dixon was working as an event coordinator in Atlanta and organized a party for Tyler Perry Studios. The connection led to an audition for The Oval spin-off Ruthless, landing a role which would eventually become a recurring spot on the flagship series. But Dixon claims that this good fortune came with unwanted attention, including incessant, inappropriate personal text messages (Per THR, the legal complaint includes texts from Perry commenting on Dixon's “thick” body, asking “Why do you twist your hips when you walk?”, noting that Dixon “liked being choked” after shooting a choking scene on the show, and telling Dixon he needed to “let someone hold you and make love to you”). 

Dixon recounts multiple instances where Perry crossed physical boundaries, once even getting into Dixon's bed uninvited when the actor was staying in Perry's guest house. Dixon says he attempted to defuse the situation by saying he wasn't looking for a sexual relationship, a situation that would repeat multiple times over the next few years. But he maintained a friendly relationship with Perry and continued to accept invitations because of Perry's power over his career, including a promise to shoot a comedy pilot that Dixon had written. 

In 2021, Dixon says Perry assaulted him at Perry's home, in a situation where Dixon believed he was going to be raped. Perry “forcefully pulled down my underwear and groped my bare ass,” Dixon recalls, adding “When I tried to pull my underwear back up, he grabbed my wrists to keep me from putting them back on. I couldn't believe what was happening.” Dixon says he managed to deescalate the situation, but was shaken; however, he “was too afraid to come forward” about it because of his career, particularly after a TPS coworker reminded him what was at stake. “I knew it would be awful. And I was right.”

Dixon eventually moved away from Atlanta to put distance between himself and Perry, ultimately quitting and filing a sexual harassment complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2024. In a statement to THR, a lawyer for Perry describes Dixon as an “individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,” adding, “Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.”

“I was an employee, and he was my boss,” Dixon says tells THR. “The fact that I'm an actor doesn't make me any less an employee. For a long time, I convinced myself that it was part of the industry, or that somehow I had to accept it to keep working. But eventually, I couldn't stay silent anymore.” You can read the full interview here.

Writer/director Christian Swegal's “Sovereign” dramatizes the true story of the final days of sovereign citizens Jerry and Joe Kane before their 2010 flight from law enforcement ended in a violent exchange of gunfire. The film fits thematically into a cinematic continuum with recent releases like “Civil War” and “Warfare,” exploring the complexities of American life and belief systems at a time of heightened tribalism. But for fans of its star Nick Offerman, Jerry Kane also aligns with a handful of other roles — including in “Civil War”, where he played the President — where the outspoken progressive has portrayed characters with conservative or extreme right-wing ideologies.

Of course, Offerman is best known for playing Libertarian Ron Swanson for seven seasons on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation.” But the juxtaposition between — and conflation of — the actor's personal and professional lives has only grown more complicated since the show went off the air, not only offering Offerman more of these roles in both TV and film but forcing him to defend the highly meme-able Swanson from being co-opted by people with views the character would vociferously not share. Recently, for example, he felt compelled to respond to a post by Michael Flynn Jr., son of retired Lieutenant General and former Presidential candidate Michael Flynn, after he used a gif of Offerman as Ron to express criticism about Pride month.

 










Gathering in the long shadow of Swanson, this crop of (distantly) similar performances, including in HBO's “The Last of Us,” Ava DuVernay's “Origin,” Craig Gillespie's “Dumb Money,” and this summer's “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” evidences the actor's aptitude for inhabiting characters like these with a complexity that belies the great divide between their values and his own. Ahead of the July 11 release of “Sovereign,” Offerman spoke to IndieWire via Zoom about the opportunities he's been given as a result of being identified on screen with conservative roles, while maintaining an active and public role as a champion of liberal causes.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

IndieWire: “Sovereign” presents Jerry's belief system subtly, almost seductively. What, if anything, was the core quality that you zeroed in on when you started to build your performance?

Nick Offerman: In this time in our society … we're so divided, people are so emotionally biased, based in some part on misinformation. To see this really sympathetic portrayal of these victims of this kind of misinformation, and victims of the way our government is exclusionary toward the working class, like the way a family can end up homeless if you just roll the dice in the wrong way with your mortgage or medical bills, I said to my agent, “I think I have to do this movie.” Because my beliefs are sincerely rooted in a flawed human's attempts at decency — with equality for all, and discriminating against no one. And even the people who are actually running the country right now, telling us that the floodwaters stopped rising because of prayer, even those people, I want them to be healthy, and happy, and have good, productive lives. That's the marked difference, I think, in my political ideology, is there are a group of people who want everyone to have the same dignity and rights to life — even the assholes.

 










It's disappointing to think that philosophy is considered transgressive these days.

In wanting to be part of the medicinal force that is the arts, to use what powers I may or may not have in storytelling, when I finished reading the script, it made me think about the January 6 rioters … sure there are a lot of actual Nazis, but there are also a lot of Trump voters that are very good citizens who are getting bad information. And people are using our broken system for their profit, to such an extent that I feel like this film is an honest portrayal to humanize that struggle that people undergo.

You compassionately describe Jerry and Joe as victims. But he increasingly uses these philosophical beliefs to validate his own shortcomings. How do you draw the line where his victimhood ends and his culpability begins?

Christian [Swegal] grew up with a Sovereign citizen in his family. The movie is inspired by the true story of Jerry and Joe Kane, but there are scenes drawn from Christian's own experience as well. He's done such a beautiful job of embroidering the two together, and I remember specifically saying to him, at a certain point, “How do I justify Jerry? Is he a charlatan? Is he a mountebank? And how much of this is belief?” And he said, “In the case of people who take these ideologies to the mat — who literally die on these hills — they often cross the line into mental illness.” And that is the case with Jerry, that he got around to the delusional sensibility that these things are true, and that he is a victim who will defeat the government that is duping all the rest of us.

 










That was completely necessary for me to hear from the writer/director. It made sense. And again, it brings up the very interesting conundrum in our country, that religion is being leaned on so heavily in the public arena where we're officially not supposed to have religion. We're supposed to all get together and make our government without the church impinging upon the state, but nonetheless, so much legislation and so much policy. Again, it brings me back to what's going on in Texas right now: Somehow when our elected leaders fail, they somehow continue to get a pass time after time by saying, “I know you elected me to do this job, but I happen to be on vacation, so speak to God. That's what I do.”

Their constituents are out of luck.

For Jerry, Christianity is part of his ideology, but I think it's all part of a larger scapegoating that human weakness is susceptible to, where it's like, “Well, it can't be me in my failings. It has to be the government. It has to be God's plan.”

You are outspoken as a progressive on social media. But you have certainly in recent years taken on roles that fall into a similar wheelhouse as this. Is there a commonality, or a psychology that you've identified in some of these more right-wing, reactive characters that has helped you dial into them so effectively?
 










I've been asked this a couple of times recently, when I played the president in Alex Garland's “Civil War.” I am a well-fed, middle-aged white guy who went to college, so, sadly, there are a lot of roles for me, both in the protagonist and villain categories. I don't seek out anything in this particular wheelhouse. I don't feel like I have a bailiwick. Or if it is, it may include roles of this ilk, but also plumbers, lumberjacks, dads, farmers. But to think about why people continue to want to see me in this, I don't know the answer to that because I'm not the discerning eye choosing me.

But I do know that I'm grateful to be given the opportunity, because the mistakes of our civilization are so frustrating on a daily basis. We're just sprinting to hell in a handbasket at the moment. We're literally despoiling our public lands. I mean, just as fast as they can hand over the work of our hands to billionaire oligarchs is just really frustrating. And the way that I don't go on a killing spree, or go burn someone's building down, or blow up a bunch of embarrassing Cybertrucks, is to say, “OK, look at my next script.” When I tour your town and I sing a song about maybe we shouldn't be discriminatory to others, if I only sway one person, it's so worth it to me. And that's how I maintain my sanity. And so I feel like, if somehow because I played Ron Swanson, I can bring eyeballs to a project that wouldn't necessarily otherwise be there, maybe just slowly, that's part of the erosion of the bigotry in this country.

 










I imagine many of those downstream opportunities came as a result of your success playing Ron. It must be frustrating to see people co-opt him in contexts that contradict his values, much less yours.

Ron Swanson, a wonderful creation from much more brilliant minds than my own, people hold up for the wrong reasons, and take their own reading of this true Libertarian who was cool with everybody. And they somehow say, “Well, he had a shotgun, so he must be one of us.” Like, dumb people insist that Ron Swanson would've voted for Trump. And I don't deign to answer myself. I take it to Mike Schur, the main creator of Ron, and he said, “Swanson would've despised Trump, because Ron loved capitalism. And Trump made the stupidest move you could make as a capitalist, which is to go into public service.” He would think he's an absolute idiot. He would also despise him because he's disrespectful to women and many others. And that's just an example of all the people and value sets that Ron would despise, because Ron is a good person.

How, then, do you link your own beliefs with the roles you choose and work you do?

I enter into every conversation with fallibility. I don't know everything, or near an approximation of it, which is why I remain curious. There are groups of people who are being bombed, and we're sending people money and bombs so that they can kill other people's children. I want to side with the children. I approach every issue with that sensibility. When Zelensky came to the White House, this guy who's a sitcom star who became the leader of Ukraine just unmanned our President and our Vice President. He made them look like simpering schoolboys, just by exhibiting the values that we Americans purport to espouse. All he did was behave with character and allow them to completely humiliate themselves on such a public stage.

 










By doing a film like [“Sovereign”], I just recognized the value in trying to examine the humanity of all of these people, including the shitty people running our country. I invite people to look at them and say, “Do you really think they are interested in taking care of you, and the good of our communities? Is that really what Elon is after?”

You express such gratitude for these opportunities, but professionally speaking, is that success ever for you a double-edged sword in going, “As good as I am at doing this, I might like to play somebody who's maybe more openly a little more progressive than some of these characters?”

I'm over the moon with people who are really receiving [“Sovereign”] generously. But it kind of makes me pull my hair out that a lot of people's reviews open with “Nick Offerman takes Ron Swanson completely to…” Fill in the blank, as though my entire career is some variation on the theme of Ron Swanson. I know actors that have worse problems than that. But the interesting thing is, and part of my gratitude is founded upon the fact that I'm not Ryan Gosling. I don't have my pick of all of the things that are going on. I'm not a top-tier talent according to the business. I am so grateful that I keep getting material that I am inspired by. I never am made to take a job in order to pay my mortgage, where I'm like, “Well, this is just a good medium superhero thing.” I don't have to do that. Because I base my choices on good writing, I'm confident that it's not going to hurt me. So I feel so lucky I keep getting these really plum roles.

 










I took [MSNBC anchor] Lawrence O'Donnell to see the premiere [of “Sovereign”] at the Tribeca Film Festival, because as I suspected, he was over the moon about the film. And so gratifyingly, he said that he sees it in the sequence of “Civil War,” “Warfare,” and then this movie. And he said, “It's trying to do the same thing.” To be part of that conversation, and to be in something that Lawrence thinks was a good job, that's all the approbation I need, where I'm like, “OK, great. For better or worse, for whatever faults I have in my personal life, I feel like I'm making the right choices, as far as being part of the medicinal side of storytelling.”

At a very tribal time, you've navigated a narrow line between being publicly open about your political beliefs and working across a broad spectrum of roles. Does it become difficult to assess when the time is right for you to speak out about something?

Social media used to be a lot of fun. I mean, I met one of the greatest friends of my life, James Rebanks and his family, and we own a beef herd together in England. And now, basically since Trump arrived, and the MAGA sensibility, where people use social media to troll and for violence of many colors, I feel like it's an exercise in futility. I feel like if I'm loud on social media, it's preaching to the choir. So I'm going to continue to fill my work with my ideology, either overtly or indirectly, like playing a MAGA plumber in “Origin” or whatever.

 










I do very much curb myself, and I generally will only get loud on social media, [like] in the case of that thing recently with Michael Flynn Jr., where it was using my image and my character for hate. I'm going to say something about that. But even that, it's just dumb, because a troll like that guy, that's all he wants to do is use my platform to create clickbait and get more people signed on to take his supplements.

One of the things that you've been extraordinarily good at in your roles is presenting what appears to be a very traditional kind of masculinity, and then subverting it. You were very quick to credit Mike Schur about Ron Swanson's reaction to Trump, but do you feel like you're able to take any credit for that subversion, even if it's just in choosing the roles?

I don't feel like I need to take any credit, per se. The arc of my own messaging was so exponentially serviced by my big break in the role of Ron Swanson, where suddenly I was invited to colleges to perform my stand-up, which was not something I did. I was a theater actor. I wasn't a comedian. But I am really thrilled at the opportunity to go speak to thousands of college students, so I began to write material and then I began to write books. And here I am putting my sixth book out this fall. What I had to learn, and I think what any successful human has to learn, is that what you have is good enough. Who I am is good enough, warts and all. If anybody has been moved by my writing, it's a fucking miracle. But the fact that I can bring my shovel to the campaign of these great artists who make these shows. I know that I'm never going to create a TV series, but I'm so grateful that I can be of service to the incredible talents that do.

 










I feel like that gratitude and humility, again, are both these kinds of “traditional” masculine traits.

So it's funny, I never realized before I got cast as Ron Swanson that I would be accused of masculinity. I knew I was a guy, I was a carpenter, I was an athlete, and I am built in a certain way. But suddenly, people were like, “Speak to us as the paragon of masculinity. What are your thoughts?” And I was like, “Oh, fuck. I didn't realize I would somehow become the default, the go-to guy.” And so I looked around and said, “Well, I think, forget John Wayne. I think boys can make cupcakes and girls can swing a hammer.” But I think what you're looking at as masculinity, in a lot of ways, is just character or decency that everyone should aspire to. And in terms of masculine traits versus feminine, sure, if you want to be a protector, then do it with decency and with empathy. Try to hug someone before you punch them, is my policy.

“Sovereign” is now playing in select theaters.

When it comes to big families, the Duggars have long been the gold standard. But Jed Duggar and his wife Katey Duggar are already on track to outpace even Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's famously large brood. With four kids under the age of four—including newborn twins—the young couple has reached a major milestone faster than Jed's parents ever did.

The couple reflected on the rapid growth during an appearance on The Jinger & Jeremy Podcast. “We've known each other five years,” Katey shared. “So when we look at it like that, we're like, ‘Wow, this has been crazy.'”

Jeremy Vuolo didn't hesitate to ask the obvious: “So you guys are four in four years—are you going to keep going?”

Jed responded, “We're just praying about that,” while Katey added they're currently taking a “sabbatical” from growing the family. “We would love to just enjoy the kids we have right now for a good minute,” she said. “It's an insanely busy season, the little years—especially because we have two infants right now. It's just all hands on deck at all times, 24/7.”

Still, they admitted they “both have a number in mind.” Katey revealed, “We'd love to have five or six kids.”

As noted by TV Insider, Jim Bob and Michelle's fourth child, Jill Duggar, wasn't born until their eldest, Josh Duggar, was three years old. Jed and Katey? Their four little ones—Truett, 3, Nora, 2, and twins Elsie and Emma, 5 months—are all under the age of four.

A post shared by Jed Duggar (@jed_duggar)

Parenting four kids under four isn't easy, and Jed and Katey are the first to admit it—especially now that they've entered the world of twins. “When you have twins, you're both doing the same thing at the same time,” Katey explained. “It's not like, ‘I'll change them this time, you change them next time.' No, we're both changing them at the same time.”

The couple also opened up about naming their oldest, Truett. Some fans speculated it was a tribute to Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy—but that wasn't the case.

“We love Chick-fil-A,” Jed joked, “but that's not why we named him that.” Katey clarified, “The meaning of the name is ‘warrior for Christ,' and his middle name, Oliver, means ‘peace.' That's a solid name, and he's a solid kid.”

Their fast-growing family may be a handful, but they wouldn't have it any other way. As Jed wrote in his 2021 wedding tribute: “The thought of sharing the rest of my life with you makes me the happiest man in the world.”

	Remember that old fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Princess and the Pea”? 


	Whether you're watching an animated retelling, reading the backstory of a limited edition Barbie doll, or streaming a bootleg version of the musical that once starred Sarah Jessica Parker, the story remains pretty consistent. To test if she's truly royalty — and worthy of marriage to a prince — a princess is given a bed heaped with a pile of mattresses. Secretly, her doubters place a single pea under the mattress on the bottom. When morning arrives and she tells her hosts that she was kept awake by an uncomfortable lump, it's taken as proof that she has the delicate senses of a true princess. While people on TikTok aren't conducting psychological sleep experiments on each other in the name of a monarchical system, they are making it clear that their dating sensibilities are just as delicate with the latest phrase du jour on the app: princess treatment. And as the discourse around it keeps stacking up, what started as a silly turn of phrase has devolved into an incomprehensible mess that's preventing people from noticing the much more insidious shift around them. 

	











	Online, the term “princess treatment” means above and beyond handling in a relationship setting. But what internet users can't seem to agree on is its application — what's anniversary behavior for one couple might be an average Tuesday for another . Enter the “bare minimum vs princess treatment” trend, a challenge where women ask their significant other where a particular task might land for them. The scenarios range from filling up a girlfriend's gas tank or giving her your jacket when she's cold to carrying her when her feet hurt or never letting her touch a door handle. Calling something “princess treatment” implies that it's an over-the-top request. If the girlfriend doesn't agree with their boyfriend, the men in question get an instant blast of water to the face.

EVERYTHING is the bare minimum 😤 ib: @Colton Connelly #andyandmichelle 

We just had to participate in this trend 😂😂 #bareminimum #princesstreatment #husbandandwife #marriagehumor #relationship #trend #fyp #couplecomedy #foryoupage 


	In addition to the sheer fun some women have with dousing their significant others with a garden hose, the trend has been characterized by countless disagreements in the comments section over what kind of treatment makes for a good relationship. But when housewife and content creator Courtney Palmer posted a video explaining her husband's princess treatment, what people managed to agree upon was that her video took the idea to an entirely new level. 


	“If I am at a restaurant with my husband, I do not talk to the hostess, I do not open any doors, and I do not order my food,” Palmer said in a video describing a typical date night. “I want him to order for me. I like when he orders for me. It's not that I'm not capable of ordering for myself, it's just a fun princess treatment sort of thing.” Palmer's video describing how she typically avoids eye contact with service staff, relying on her husband to speak for her, drew the ire of followers and a wave of comments calling the behavior problematic. “Me when I'm a prisoner,” read one comment. “It's giving cult or hostage situation,” said another. “They be like ‘princess treatment' but it's medieval times and you're locked in a castle.” 

I thought this was like a joke or like an aesthetic 🌸 #tradwife #princesstreament #comedy 

The princess treatment epidemic MUST be stopped! #princesstreatment #tradwives #tradwife #comedy 

Stand up 


	There were parodies aplenty, many from service workers and restaurant–themed accounts focused on how disconcerting a lack of eye contact would be during a shift. But the prevalent commentary was about the link between the seemingly controlling nature of Palmer's husband and the growing popularity of trad wife content creators. Trad wives — women who prioritize traditional gender roles and often project old-school fantasies of staying home with the kids, returning to the land, home cooking, and serving their husband — have played an outsized role on the internet in the past few years, marking the rise of conservative presences in digital spaces. These women, like Hannah Neeleman of Ballerina Farm, or even cooking creator Nara Smith, gain millions of followers by posting content themed around household management, from-scratch cooking, and child rearing — carefully noting that it's their personal choice while encouraging others to lean into their own divine feminine impulses.

	While everyone is decrying the death of feminism in Palmer's comments, she's raking in the cash. Posting about princess treatment isn't declaring what kind of feminist you are. It's a way to get attention — and its working. In an interview with People, she said she gained close to 24,000 followers from the success of the princess treatment video, which on its own received close to 4.5 million views. “Your softness isn't giving anyone control over you. It's giving a partner space to lead with that strength,” Palmer told People. “When I'm leaning into my grace, I invite him to rise as that protector, a provider, a partner, because that's what he wants to do. It works in a perfect balance and becomes that effortless, graceful, calm, peaceful lifestyle.”

	While people are patting each other on the back in Palmer's comments for being able to recognize red flags from a marriage influencer, what they're not realizing is that there's far more nebulous patterns slipping completely under the radar. Palmer's princess treatment video is simply the final boss of a TikTok practically terraformed by girl content. There's girl dinner, girl math, viral “we were girls together” sounds, the “looking for a man in finance” trend — all predicated on the underlying assumption that women need to be taken care of, protected, and are incapable of deep thought. 


	If you look at the comments on the “bare minimum vs princess treatment” challenges, the large majority jokingly side with the girlfriends, saying that women are in need of gentle treatment and pampering. And beyond the viral jokes littering Palmer's comments are thousands of seemingly serious comments calling her video just an example of how leaning into feminine roles can be self care. It's not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time that the Stanford Prison Experiment redux known as Love Island USA is streaming — where the biggest crime you can accuse someone of is not being “a girl's girl.” There's no good way to have subtle conversations around feminism online. But that doesn't mean princess treatment isn't important. The rise in trad wife popularity is occurring at the same time as a serious attack on reproductive rights in the United States. Calling out misogynistic content matters. But what the reaction to Palmer's video is showing that when posters take the fight to a singular comment section without challenging the patterns underneath it — everything stays the same.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Mothership FBI will be the only representative of the crime drama franchise on CBS‘ fall schedule. Offshoot CIA starring Tom Ellis, which received a straight-to-series order in April, is being delayed until midseason and is undergoing a showrunner change. Watson, which had been set to return for a second season in midseason, will now be on for fall. 


FBI: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins, who originally was tapped to lead the series and co-write the pilot script with FBI, Law & Order & Chicago franchise boss Dick Wolf, has exited. He is being replaced by Wolf universe veteran Warren Leight, known for his two stints as showrunner of Law & Order: SVU.

	There had been early signs that CIA may not be ready for fall. The original plan was for three characters, including the one played by Ellis, to be introduced in a planted spinoff episode of mothership FBI which was pushed a couple of times over casting delays until a decision was made not to proceed with it. There were questions about the creative of the project at the time of the straight-to-series order in late April. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	While the writers room is up and running, I hear there may not be finished scripts approved for production, and there have been no additional castings on the series since the initial pickup announcement that included Ellis. That is about to change. 


	With Leight at the helm, the series is expected to forge ahead, and casting is set to begin shortly for an early fall production start. It is unclear whether the project's original concept about two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent who believes in the rule of law — will be tweaked. 

	











	Wolf and Leight executive produce CIA alongside Nicole Perlman, David Chasteen, and Peter Jankowski. Eriq La Salle remains attached to direct and executive produce the pilot episode. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, produces in association with Wolf Entertainment and CBS Studios.


	With CIA not coming together as fast as CBS had hoped, the network may have been making contingency plans as, despite being benched until midseason, Watson has already started production. 


	It is unclear whether Watson, from Kapital Entertainment and CBS Studios, will replace CIA on the fall schedule, taking over the post-FBI Monday 10 PM time slot, or whether the network will make scheduling changes. That will be revealed shortly when CBS announces fall premiere dates. (UPDATE: Watson will return for Season 2 in the Monday 10 PM slot, giving Kapital 3 series on the night, The Neighborhood at 8 PM, new comedy DMV at 8:30 PM and Watson at 10 PM.)


	The move to fall will give Watson, which launched with a 13-episode run earlier this year, a typical air pattern. New scripted broadcast series launching in midseason usually return in the fall (unless it is designed for a limited-run seasons, which Watson, starring Morris Chestnut, is not) because a midseason run is not considered long enough to get a new series fully established, and a long gap after the short initial may hut its longevity prospects.  


	Leight served as Law & Order: SVU executive producer/showrunner from 2011–2016 and 2019–2022. He also worked on Law & Order: Criminal Intent.

Country star and former “American Idol” winner Scotty McCreery is coming to grips with a doubly difficult loss, sharing with fans on July 10, 2025, that both of his grandmas had died the previous day. 

“My heart is absolutely broken,” McCreery captioned a photo from his 2018 wedding to wife Gabi Dugal, flanked by each of his grandmothers. “Yesterday, both my Grandma Janet and my Grandma Paquita passed away. I think I am still in a bit of shock as I type this, but I'm choosing to remember the great memories we all made with both of them.” 

Fans and famous friends flooded McCreery's late-night post with condolences and sympathy, and his mom confirmed that her mother and mother-in-law had passed hours apart, noting that losing them both so quickly was “hard to fathom.”

McCreery's paternal Grandma Paquita was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where she met her future husband, McCreery's grandpa, when he was stationed there in the U.S. Air Force, according to The Boot. They married and raised their family in North Carolina, which is where their only grandson grew up, too, and later won “American Idol” in 2011. 

McCreery recalled in his July 10 post some of the memories he cherished of his grandmothers, writing, “There really are too many to count. From being on the farm in Elizabeth City or visiting the Outer Banks with Grandma Janet.. And then the incredible memories we made at the backyard pool in Pinehurst, all the way to visiting Puerto Rico with Grandma Paquita.” 

“Both of them truly taught me what love is all about,” the country star wrote. “I will miss them dearly. If yall could keep my family in your prayers I'd appreciate it.”

McCreery's mom Judy shared a Facebook post on July 10 confirming her mother and mother-in-law's deaths, writing, “Here is a post I hoped I wouldn't be making for several years. My precious mom, age 85, passed away yesterday at WakeMed, shortly after 1pm. She had been battling norovirus & the flu, which led to dehydration and pneumonia. My heart is broken. I have to accept it was her time.”

She then continued, “This is hard to fathom, but we also lost Mike's mom, Paquita, yesterday, a few hours later at 4pm. She was 93 and had been in declining health. We will celebrate my mom's life in her hometown next Monday. Paquita's services are still pending. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.”

Fans and friends flooded McCreery's post with supportive messages, including several of his fellow “American Idol” contestants from season 10 in 2011. 

Country star Lauren Alaina, with whom he became close friends on “American Idol” and was his runner-up, left a comment that hundreds of fans liked, which said, “Sending so much love and prayer your way.”

Hailey Reinhart, another success story who emerged from season 10, wrote, “Sending love to you & your families, Scotty 💓”

Season 10 finalist James Durbin chimed in, “All of my love to you and your family, Scotty. That's heartbreaking”

Fans were stunned by McCreery's double loss, including one who wrote, “I'm heartbroken for you and your families…. I have no words for losing both grandmothers in one day. Sending lots of prayers and hugs. 🙏🏻”

Another wrote, “Oh my gosh so sorry losing both Grandma's on the same day is just unbelievable. 🙏🙏”

McCreery, who's been on tour in Great Britain, was scheduled to perform in Fort Loramie, Ohio, on July 10 and Manchester, Iowa, on July 11. One who attended his July 10 concert wrote on his Instagram post, “Your concert was amazing tonight and a good memorial to your grandmas! 💕💕”

Kelly Clarkson may have one of the most popular daytime talk shows in the U.S., but great ratings and Emmy Awards may not be enough to keep the first-ever “American Idol” winner happy behind the scenes. Rumors have swirled for months that Clarkson has wanted to spend more time with her kids, and that “insanely complicated” personal matters have been impacting her stress levels. 

After months of rumors that Clarkson has been unhappy at “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” an insider told People on July 10, 2025, that she is seriously considering making changes when her contract ends after the show's seventh season, which premieres in the fall. 

The news came just hours after Clarkson and her team received eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Daytime Talk Series and Outstanding Daytime Talk Series Host, per Billboard.

“The Kelly Clarkson Show” launched in 2019, but production moved from Los Angeles to New York in 2023 after Clarkson's bitter divorce from Brendan Blackstock was finalized. The change came after Clarkson decided it was best for her and the former couple's two kids — Remington “Remy” Alexander, now nine, and daughter River Rose, 10 — to have a fresh start somewhere new. 

The inside source who spoke with People said, “After her divorce, she wanted to focus on balance and not burnout.”

However, the source continued, “Daytime TV is still demanding. She's thinking that she might need a shift next year when her contract is up. She still has time to figure out what's best for her career and family. She was never one to rush into things.”

During the sixth season of her talk show, there was widespread speculation about Clarkson after she missed two weeks of episodes in March without explanation, requiring other celebrities to fill in for her at the last minute. 

In addition to pulling her away from quality time with her kids, her talk show schedule has made it hard to tour and create new music, although she did release the new single “Where Have You Been” in the spring of 2025. 

At an Atlantic City, New Jersey, concert in May, Page Six reported that Clarkson told the audience, “We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job.”

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

Although Clarkson may be frustrated behind the scenes, Emmy voters clearly can't tell, because they just gave her and her team eight Daytime Emmy nominations, announced on July 10. 

According to People, “The Kelly Clarkson Show” has won 22 Emmys since it launched in 2019, per People, including three for Clarkson as a host. 

Clarkson has some tough competition in the category, including against another “American Idol” alum — season three powerhouse finalist Jennifer Hudson, whose talk show was nominated for three awards, including for Outstanding Talk Series and Host. Other hosts nominated in 2025 are Jenna Bush Hager and Hoda Kotb, Drew Barrymore, and Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos.

Levin will write and direct the feature. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


The Black Phone filmmaker Scott Derrickson has teamed up with his wife, filmmaker Maggie Levin, to tackle an adaptation of the horror novel Ghost Eaters.


Screen Gems, which has a first-look with Derrickson's Crooked Highway banner, is behind the project and has picked up the rights to the bestseller written by Clay McLeod Chapman.




	Levin will write and direct the adaptation. Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill and Vince Cheng will develop and produce via Crooked Highway. The project is in early development.

	Chapman's novel has been described as a terrifying supernatural descent into the depths of grief and addiction. It follows a group of friends who discover a drug called Ghost, which allows them to see the dead. But Ghost has unfathomable side effects, and as the book jacket says, once you take it, you can never go back.

	











	The book scored many accolades when it was published three years ago. It was named one of Vulture‘s best horror novels of 2022, Paste's best horror books of 2022, Book Riot's best horror novels of 2022, and Crime Reads' best horror fiction books of the same year. It was also a September 2022 Library Reads pick and an October 2022 Indie Next Pick.


	Chapman has earned Bram Stoker and Shirley Jackson Award nominations for such horror novels as Wake Up and Open Your Eyes, What Kind of Mother, and Whisper Down the Lane. He recently signed a three-book deal with Tor Nightfire, which will kick off with Mr. Lonelyhearts in 2027. Chapman has also worked in the comics and film spaces.


	Levin previously wrote and directed My Valentine, a feature-length episode of the Hulu/Blumhouse horror anthology series titled Into the Dark. She also wrote and directed an original segment of V/H/S/99, which premiered at TIFF in 2022 and was picked up by Shudder.

	











	She worked as a second unit director on Derrickson's big-budget AppleTV+ monster movie The Gorge, one of the most-watched movies on the platform, as well as his Black Phone. She handled similar duties on his upcoming sequel, Black Phone 2, which opens in theaters this October.


	Levin is repped by WME and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Chapman is repped by Gotham Group and Ziffren.

Few actors today can toggle between massive blockbusters, like “Dune,” and small-scale auteurist works, such as Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” with the ease of Stellan Skarsgård. And few are quite as candid when they open up.

As reported by Variety from the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, where the actor was promoting “Sentimental Value” and on hand for a tribute, Skarsgård made some startling comments about Ingmar Bergman, whom the Swedish actor worked for on a 1986 stage production of August Strindberg's “A Dream Play.”

The actor talked about his personal dislike of Bergman, whom he found to be tyrannical and manipulative. Skarsgård links Bergman's attitude as a director to the fact that Bergman was a Nazi supporter during World War II. This may be new information to more casual cinephiles now, but Bergman's Nazi sympathies are widely known. Bergman never hid this, and admitted his affinity for Nazism was not just a teenage infatuation — it was only when the Holocaust's atrocities were revealed at World War II's end that he completely disavowed Hitler and Nazism.

“Bergman was manipulative,” Skarsgård said. “He was a Nazi during the war and the only person I know who cried when Hitler died. We kept excusing him, but I have a feeling he had a very weird outlook on other people. [He thought] some people were not worthy. You felt it, when he was manipulating others. He wasn't nice.”

 










Most admirers of Bergman have accepted the director's disavowal of Nazism following the war. But Bergman was 26 when Hitler took his own life in 1945, and Bergman had already been a prolific stage director and had even written his first movie, “Torment,” for the director Alf Sjöberg, by that point. Sweden had been officially neutral during the war, though various figures in its government were sympathetic to Hitler and the Nazi regime. Bergman himself went to great lengths not to excuse, ignore, or explain away his Nazi sympathies.

Bergman acknowledged seeing Hitler in person on a family trip to Weimar, Germany, in 1934 when he was 16. “Hitler was unbelievably charismatic. He electrified the crowd,” Bergman told author Maria Pia-Boethius (as reported by the BBC), who wrote a book about what Sweden's neutrality really meant during the war. And he noted that his family put a photo of Hitler by the future director's bed afterward. “The Nazism I had seen seemed fun and youthful.”

The director also acknowledged his support for Nazism in his own 1987 memoir, “The Magic Lantern,” where he wrote, “For many years, I was on Hitler's side, delighted by his success and saddened by his defeats.” And he admitted to Pia-Boethius that “when the doors to the concentration camps were thrown open … I was suddenly ripped of my innocence.”

 










This is not a portrait of an unrepentant Nazi. And any cinephile can see Bergman's anguish over the horrors of war in “Winter Light,” “The Silence,” and “Shame.”

Much of Skarsgård's distaste for Bergman seems to be personal. At Karlovy Vary, he also said, “My complicated relationship with Bergman has to do with him not being a very nice guy. He was a nice director, but you can still denounce a person as an asshole. Caravaggio was probably an asshole as well, but he did great paintings.”

This follows comments he made in 2012 to The Guardian's Xan Brooks, where Skarsgård spoke similarly, including of Bergman that “I didn't want him near my life.”

To his credit, Skarsgård is almost certainly not saying that Bergman's body of work should be dismissed the way that Cannes tried to dismiss his own longtime collaborator Lars von Trier — in 2011, Cannes officially declared von Trier “persona non grata” for calling himself a Nazi in an instantly infamous press conference promoting his film “Melancholia.” Skarsgård expressed an aversion to language-policing in his talk.

“Everyone in that room knew he was not a Nazi, that he was the opposite, and yet they all used it as a headline. And then people who only read headlines thought he was a Nazi. He just told a bad joke. Lars grew up with a Jewish father, and when his mother was dying, she told him he wasn't his real father. It was her boss, who was a German,” the Swedish actor said in defense of von Trier.

 










“When I meet people, especially in the U.S., they still [ask about von Trier's Nazi comment at Cannes]. You have so many banned words over there. My kids can say any words they want – it depends on what their intention is.”

However, that Skarsgård's comments about Bergman came up in the context of von Trier, it almost seems like the actor is saying, “Why is one director persona non grata and another not?” And it's also important to recognize the full context that Bergman's Nazi sympathies in his youth are something he strongly turned against.

	The White House's latest meme of Donald Trump is the president as Superman, coming just as Warner Bros/DC Studios releases James Gunn's mega-pic about the superhero.


	“THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP,” the White House account read, with Trump taking the place of David Corenswet from the movie's marketing material.

	The White House meme follows what has been a week of MAGA commentators and others on the right attacking Gunn's recent comments about the DC superhero. In an interview, the writer-director told the Times of London, “I mean, Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	That reference to Superman being an immigrant has been enough to get figures like Ben Shapiro and Jesse Watters claiming that Superman has “gone woke,” even though it is not clear if they have even seen the movie, which opens wide at the box office Friday. Shapiro has a history of seizing on Hollywood productions to gin up the culture wars, as he did with Barbie in 2023.


	The press office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, also seized on the attention, writing on X, “Superman was an undocumented immigrant.” Newsom has been challenging Trump's deployment of the National Guard amid protests over ICE raids.

	











	The governor posted a video of a raid on a cannibis farm in Camarillo, writing, “Kids running from tear gas, crying on the phone because their mother was just taken from the fields. Trump calls me ‘Newscum' — but he's the real scum.”

	Rodney Scott, commissioner at Customs and Border Patrol, responded that “10 juveniles were found at this marijuana facility – all illegal aliens, 8 of them unaccompanied. It's now under investigation for child labor violations. This is Newsom's California.”


	The governor replied, “California prosecutes child exploiters and traffickers. Trump tear-gasses children, rips them from their parents, and deports farmworkers. Priorities.”

	So far, the politics behind Superman, immigration and ICE don't seem to have depressed initial box office returns. Previews brought in $22.5 million on Thursday, per Deadline's Anthony D'Alessandro, a record for the director.

The irony for MAGA is that the champion for truth, justice and the American Way is essentially an undocumented immigrant probably illegally adopted by the Kents who raised their adopted alien son to uphold American values and respect every living creature and protect everyone from harm. Contrary to MAGA dogma.

I missed the episode where Superman demonstrated against the oppressors/racists in America that wouldn't give him free stuff..all while carrying a flag from the planet Krypton

I don't believe that Superman was an ingrate..in fact he loved America..Imagine that

Bingo.

A. Superman is literally a f*cking alien. 

B. Our president is literally a fascist idiot. And this meme is pathetic and gross…because there is absolutely nothing truthful about trump.

Would had made more sense if he was added to Lex Luthor LOL.

Please tell me that someone created a meme with his lard ass.

the deadline comments section is like a window into 2018.

What is your point?

that the world is moving on without you

I thought righties hated Superman because he is so “woke” in their terms? This new Superman movie is about kindness – something Trump would know nothing about.

One year after “Brat Summer,” Chappell Roan's rise to stardom, and a full six-month period where the lyrics “That's that me espresso” were stuck in every American's head, 2025 pop music has proven disappointingly ordinary. With the charts staler than ever and little new releases to enjoy on the horizon, pop excellence has to be found in unconventional places. 

Enter: Huntr/x, a K-pop trio with banging leather outfits and a likable lineup that slots into the classic “Powerpuff Girls” mold: there's the childish and sweet “Bubbles” type Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), the tough and sarcastic “Buttercup” type Mira (May Hong), and the “Blossom”-esque earnest type-A leader Rumi (Arden Cho). Since June, the group has blown up in America with an album at No. 3 on Billboard and a hit single climbing up the Hot 100. It's a particularly impressive feat for a group that isn't actually “real,” instead hailing from Netflix‘s animated musical, “Kpop Demon Hunters.”

Since premiering on Netflix in June 20 to relatively little promotion, “Kpop Demon Hunters” has, via word and mouth and social media, blossomed into a bona fide success for the streamer and Sony Pictures Animation. As of this writing, it's the No. 1 film on the site, and its soundtrack album — featuring the catchy multilingual earworms performed by Huntr/x and their rival group Saja Boys — has produced moderate hits (the song “Your Idol” managed to reach no. 1 on the US Spotify chart, surpassing BTS' “Dynamite” as the biggest song on the chart). 

 










In many respects, the film's success isn't exactly a surprise, reflecting on the widening market for kpop and the many fans of Asian animation that are primed to enjoy a western product that takes obvious inspiration from anime in its visual style. But thankfully, “Kpop Demon Hunters” isn't just a cynical attempt from Sony to cash in on a cultural trend: in the hands of directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, it's a endearing, beautifully animated crowdpleaser, with a dorkily sincere love for the pop culture phenomena it embeds itself in.  

The film's screenplay — credited to Kang, Appelhans, Danya Jimenez, and Hannah McMechan — thankfully doesn't waste too much time on setting up or over-explaining the film's somewhat silly mythology. Each generation, a new trio of women has risen up to take on the mantle of maintaining the Honmoon, a magical barrier that seals demons from the human world, with the power of song. In modern times, that translates to the trio being the hottest girl group in South Korea, with legions of fans at every concert to buy merch and squeal like babies as they perform under the bright lights. 

Smartly, “Kpop Demon Hunters” picks up with the three women already having long come into their own as Demon Hunters, giving room for them to bounce off each other as friends. That's a very good thing, because it allows for fun, knowing jokes about the Kpop industry — from the rabid fandoms to the corny variety shows burgeoning stars are forced to take part in — and because the cast chemistry between the three women is a huge part of what makes the film such a delight. Statuesque goddesses on stage but utter goofballs in the privacy of their home, Huntr/x's  personalities might be archetypical, but a combination of the three actresses' vocal performances and lively writing makes them likable and relatable as they slurp self-branded instant noodles and complain about the hiatus Rumi keeps pushing them back from taking. 

 










Comedic moments are where the animation — a mix of the sharp style of Sony's “Spider-Verse” films with some clear Eastern influence — also shines the brightest. The action is well-choreographed, and the on-stage performances are convincing replicas of real K-pop girl groups, but nothing in the film is as delightful as the way the animators contort the faces of the leads with some manga inspired faces and reactions. In a standout moment, when the girls first encounter the Saja Boys — their rivals not just on the charts but on the battlefield, a band of monsters sent to destroy the Honmoon from the film's unfortunately generic demon lord — Mira and Zoey's eyes shift from red-eyed cartoon hearts to a pair of six-pack abs to popping corn, in a hilarious PG-friendly depiction of abject thirst. 

The Saja Boys are memorable creations of their own, an over-the-top collection of shaggy haircuts, dewy faces, and bright streetwear that instantly invokes the heartthrobs of BTS or Stray Kids. They're mostly anonymous grunts, though, with the exception of the dark-haired and soft-voiced leader Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), who immediately clashes with Rumi on a more personal level than just being on opposite sides of a demon/hunter war, which belies an obvious attraction. For Rumi, stressed out about finally fully strengthening the barrier and carrying a secret she keeps hidden from both of her friends, Jinu — with his own complicated backstory — becomes a safe space where she can finally feel like herself.    

 










Like much of the film's storyline, this star-crossed romance draws inspiration and beats from dozens of coming-of-age fantasies you've watched or read before, a more chaste version of Buffy and Angel, but “Kpop Demon Hunters” still makes it work. Cho and Ahn create believably compelling chemistry together, and their relationship gives an otherwise lighthearted adventure some much needed depth and weight. 

Introducing the Saja Boys also allows the directors an excuse to cram the film with more music numbers, most of which were written by real professionals in the K-pop industry: contributors include Ejae (who also provides Rumi's singing voice), who has worked on songs for girl groups like Twice and Red Velvet, as well as prolific Kpop producer Teddy Park. The result isn't necessarily a full collection of bangers: a few (opening song “How It's Done,” “Your Idol”) lean towards the generic and blend together too easily. But they're eminently believable as real K-pop songs you can stream in the real world, and the highlights — including Saja Boys bouncy intro number “Soda Pop” and Huntr/x's big inspirational ballad “Golden” — are spectacular. 

 










What's more impressive about the music in the film is how the directors find smart, varied ways to stage the songs. Some numbers like “How It's Done” are performed as the girls are fighting demons, while others like “Golden” are presented via music videos emulating the high-budget endeavors of real-world groups. “Takedown,” a nasty diss track, gets introduced in a montage as the girls create it, while “Soda Pop” is a spirited dance number. When Rumi and Jinu have a moment of understanding, they launch into a short love duet. The film's versatility with how it flexes its musical muscles makes the K-pop trappings more than just a goofy gimmick but a central and vital component of its storytelling.      

If there's a fatal flaw to “Kpop Demon Hunters,” it's that there's almost too little of it. The film's quick pace and short runtime — subtract the end credits, and it barely lasts an hour and 25 minutes — is a boon at points, as the film moves on from it's stuffier plot points. At other times, it glides a little too quickly away from depth. The film sticks to Rumi as the lead for expediency, giving Mira and Zoey short shrift storyline wise, while also not digging nearly enough into the resentment Rumi feels towards former hunter and surrogate mother figure Celine (Yunjin Kim). The rushed climax also lands as slightly underwhelming, an overly easy resolution that doesn't give these lovable girls the ending they deserve.

 










That said, who's to say it is the end? The last shot of the film seems begging for a sequel to be made, and the film's success feels like it could very well become a reality. And it'd be welcome too, giving the charming fantasy Kpop world of the film another chance to shine. Until then, fans will just have to keep streaming “Golden” as they await Huntr/x's comeback. 

“Kpop Demon Hunters” is currently streaming on Netflix.

The LP dropped just hours after the pop star announced its existence.

	We may as well be chilling by the fire while we eatin' fondue, because Justin Bieber‘s Swag is here.


	Released at midnight Friday (July 11) — just a few hours after the pop star announced its existence — Bieber's seventh studio album features 21 new songs. The singer first unveiled the tracklist in a video of a black-and-white billboard shared on his Instagram without explanation, revealing the titles “All I Can Take,” “Daisies,” “Yukon,” “Go Baby,” “Things You Do,” “Butterflies,” “Way It Is,” “First Place,” “Soulful,” “Walking Away,” “Glory Voice Memo,” “Devotion,” “Dadz Love,” “Therapy Session,” “Sweet Spot,” “405,” “Swag,” “Zuma House,” “Too Long” and “Forgiveness.”


	When the album arrived, it featured an additional track: “Standing on Business,” featuring an audio sample of Bieber's own meme-fueling viral exchange with paparazzi in June. 

	











	The project marks Bieber's first full-length since 2021's Justice, which spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — one of eight No. 1 entries he's scored on the chart over the course of his career. He's also become a father since he last dropped an album, welcoming baby boy Jack Blues with wife Hailey Bieber last August.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Both the 11-month-old and the Rhode founder were featured heavily in promotional photos that circulated in the hours leading up to Swag, with the whole family appearing on the billboard shared by Justin on Instagram. In the artwork, Hailey holds little Jack in the background while the two-time Grammy winner stares down the camera in front.


	For years, it was unclear whether Bieber would ever release another album as the star took a large step back from performing. In 2022, he announced that he'd been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a condition that caused half of his face to be temporarily paralyzed. 

	











	In the months leading up to Swag, however, he repeatedly teased that he was back to making music by sharing photos of himself in the studio.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


UPDATED FRIDAY AM AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros is seeing $22.5M all in for previews for James Gunn‘s Superman. Not only is that still the best previews YTD and a record for James Gunn, but it's higher than the previews for last year's Barbie ($22.3M, 3-day $162M) and ahead of all the previews for Matt Reeves' The Batman ($21.6M, $134M opening in 2022).


	What do audiences think? It's a 78% definite recommend on PostTrak for general audiences — you can take that to the bank, seriously. Five stars from kids under 12 and parents. Superman is flying around everywhere.


	Will President Donald Trump's meme posted on the White House X handle be Kryptonite to business in addition to the snarks from right-wingers on Fox News? Not a chance, insiders say. Get out of the way, here comes Superman.

Gunn told the Sunday Times last week: “I mean, Superman is the story of America … an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country. But for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	The statement was a reflection of the current aggressive immigration policies set forth by Trump. The filmmaker and co-DC Studios Boss in his chat with the Sunday Times isn't losing sleep over any criticism.

	











	“Yes, it plays differently,” Gunn said. “But it's about human kindness, and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.”


	During an episode of Fox's table talk The Five this week, Republican operative Kellyanne Conway said: “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and have someone throw their ideology on to us. I wonder if it will be successful.”

	Yes, Ms. Conway, the movie will be extremely successful. At this level, industry projections have raised to $140M-$150M+ for the weekend. As we told you, Thursday night's previews include the Tuesday Amazon Prime Members shows, which collected $2.8M.


	It's gonna be a fun weekend, and Warner Bros, you've done it again with an overperformance streak that includes A Minecraft Movie ($162.7M), Sinners ($48M), Final Destination Bloodlines ($51.6M), F1 ($57M) and now Superman. Weekend 28, the second weekend of July last year, brought in $123M with the second frame of Despicable Me 4. The marketplace is going to boom past that easily.

	Here's how the rest of the week went down:


	1.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,308 theaters Thu $7.5M (-25% from Wed), Wk $136.3M/Wk 1


	2.)  F1 (Apple/WB) 3,732 theaters, Thu $2.5M (-34%), Wk $39.66M (-52%), Total $123.1M/Wk 2


	3.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) 3,714 theaters, Thu $1.67M (-10%), Wk $19M (-41%), Total $232M/Wk 4


	4.) Elio (Dis) 3,235 theaters, Thu $985K (-14%), Wk $10.3M (-42%), Total $59.7M/Wk 3


	5.) 28 Years Later (Sony) 2,917 theaters, Thu $557K (-20%) Wk $7.4M (-50%) Total $63M/Wk 3

EXCLUSIVE: Count gravitational pull as a superpower for James Gunn's Superman as the first movie under the filmmaker's DC Studios, which he co-runs with Peter Safran, is heading to a massive $21M+ in overall previews, sources tell us tonight.


	Oh, and audiences love it at 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. Gunn and Safran and all of Warner Bros can rest easy after the cynics' snarking over the first trailer back in December. That's the best RT audience score ever for a Superman movie, even better than Richard Donner's 1978 original (86%). Take that, trolls.


Superman‘s preview figure includes Tuesday night's Amazon Prime members screenings cash of $2.8M, plus monies from showtimes which began today at 2 p.m.

	Lots of records flying around here for the first title in DC's Phase One “Gods and Monsters”: First, Superman‘s previews rep a record for a James Gunn-directed film, besting Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‘s $17.5M ($118.4M 3-day in 2023). It's also the best damn previews we've seen all year, ahead of Disney's Lilo & Stitch ($14.5M, $146M 3-day opening) and Captain America: Brave New World ($12M, $88.8M 3-day).


	While Warners was hoping for a $100M 3-day start and tracking and exhibition were spotting $115M-$130M, Superman, looks to be leaving all those projections in the dust. The IP has been done several times through history — not just on the big screen but going back to radio with several iterations on TV including the first 1950s George Reeves black-and-white show. So what's the deciding factor for non-frequent moviegoers to discover this superhero on the big screen again? Why, reviews. This Superman stands at 82% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, the second-best reviewed Superman ever after Richard Donner's 1978 original, which stands at 86%.

	Other intriguing benchmarks: Gunn's Superman is easily ahead of the preview box office of Zack Snyder's 2013 Man of Steel ($9M, 10 p.m. start time, different era for previews, which turned into a $116.6M opening). There's also a shot when we wake up tomorrow morning it could be higher than Matt Reeves' The Batman from 2022, which did $21.6M in overall previews (including $4M Tuesday shows and Thursday showtimes that began at 3PM; $134M opening). Gunn's Superman is close to the sun as far preview records go for Superman movies overall, but hasn't surpassed it (and that's not a bad thing), meaning 2016's Batman v. Superman holds the record for the best previews ever for a Superman movie with $27.7M ($166M 3-day).


	Social media analytics firm RelishMix has noticed positive word of mouth leading up to opening with a massive social media universe across YouTube, TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook of 953.8 million, +20% of superhero genre pics' reach before their openings. That reach buries that of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (709.7M) and The Batman (631.7M), Joker Folie à Deux (567M), and it's not far from Deadpool & Wolverine (1.15 billion).


RELATED: James Gunn “Didn't Feel Guilt At All” Leaving MCU To Direct For DC


	Says RelishMix: “The exuberant tone and dedication to the characters is winning many fans over, i.e. ‘A comic book movie that's not ashamed to be a comic book is something we desperately needed,' and, ‘The trailers we've gotten for this movie have given me the warm fuzzy feelings…this Superman feels right.' After his widely popular Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy for Marvel, James Gunn in the director chair is inspiring a lot of confidence: ‘Mr. James Gunn is going to do us DC fans right for once.' The nostalgia is strong with this film, capturing the heart of the original 1978 film, ‘His look reminds me of Reeves Superman,' and, ‘The actors are great. And the theme music a remix of the old theme. Take my money now.'”


	These numbers do not come from Warners and by tomorrow business could be higher.

When you start on a Wednesday …  records will be broken

How is this a fair comparison if you're including preview grosses from additional days compared to Barbie and The Batman?

It's a wonder any film succeeds when you have trolls like you do in this comment section rooting for everything to fail.

Don't call them trolls. They are high level corporate accountants who know more about film budgets marketing budgets and revenue splits than the people who actually do this for a living. And they all have the same name. Anonymous.

lol thank you for this

LOL Peter.

Truly hilarous if you think this movie is touching a billion. It'll be lucky to outgross MoS from 13 years ago globally. Touting 21 mil and sweeping the fact yesterday's showings made 2.2 million.

It's not even going to earn what MOS did because the international markets would rather see dinosaurs. When you account for bigger budgets and inflation, the result won't be good. My prediction is a $450mil finish. And before I am accused of being an MCU fan, I think Fantastic 4 will flop even harder. No one but comic nerds have ever cared about F4, and there aren't any movie stars in the cast. Both films will be frontloaded and sink like a stone. Superhero movies need a reset.

Stock in the mega-exhibitor soared on Friday as a Wedbush analyst argued glaring uncertainties brought on by the pandemic and the Hollywood strikes are behind the debt-laden company. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Is the worst behind AMC Theatres and its beleaguered stock price? One Wall Street analyst thinks so.


	With Hollywood at last giving the mega-exhibitor the certainty in its supply of tentpole releases needed to get film lovers back in the habit of going to the multiplex, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese on Friday upgraded stock in AMC from neutral to outperform and set a $4.00 price target, from $3.00.




	Reese argued in a July 11 investor note AMC “is poised to benefit from a more consistent release slate over the next several quarters,” and gain market share through to 2026 in North America and Europe. That good news for a company attempting to get out of a financial hole brought on by the pandemic lifted parent AMC Entertainment Holdings shares by 30 cents, or 10 percent, to $3.30 on Friday morning.

	The Wedbush analysis is also more sanguine about AMC's debt woes after the company repaid or postponed all borrowing obligations that were due in 2026. “With box office expected to be more consistent in the coming quarters, we expect AMC's EBITDA to cover interest expense, relieving its need to issue more shares,” Reese wrote.

	AMC as a meme stock in the past has been decidedly volatile as the exhibition giant burned through cash to maintain operations and raised fresh financing from new stock sales. On July 1, AMC announced an agreement with key creditors, debt holders and other lenders that offered more financial flexibility, resolved key litigation and allow the company to focus on box office upside.

	











	The Wedbush analyst made clear she doesn't see clear sailing for AMC. “To be clear, we do not see substantial growth in 2025, 2026, or beyond. This is a low-growth industry in a period of recovery. Over the next few years, we anticipate mid-to-high single-digit growth rates in box office revenue, followed by low-to-mid single-digit growth rates thereafter,” the note stated.


	The Wall Street analyst sees small mercies for exhibitors in the major studios committing to theatrical releases after uncertainty brought on by pandemic-era theater closures and a shift of Hollywood titles to emerging streaming platforms.


	The industry's year of strikes in 2023 also disrupted the flow of Hollywood movie releases to the local multiplex. “We think that post-SAG-AFTRA strike in 2023/2024, studios collectively created a compelling, genre-balanced 2025 – 2026, which we believe will drive audiences to theaters regardless of economic turmoil,” Reese wrote in her note.


	Now all Hollywood has to do is deliver box office winners — whether comic book reboots or arthouse standouts from Paul Thomas Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos — that more consistently draw consumers to theaters, however much recession worries overhang the wider economy.


	“The theater business has historically been resilient in recessions, with attendance driven by content quality and viewed as a relatively inexpensive escape from reality. As such, at this juncture, we are more concerned about content quality than with overarching economic pressure on attendance,” the Wedbush note stated.

[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers from Poker Face's season-two finale.]

Patti Harrison isn't afraid to dial up the humor (as you will find out towards the end of this interview). If her performance in various I Think You Should Leave sketches is any indication, she thrives on playing ludicrous, over-the-top people (seen also in Hulu's Shrill). Now, as she did in 2021's Together, Together, Harrison takes an interesting swerve on Poker Face with her performance as an unassuming woman. Harrison makes her season two debut in “A New Lease On Death” as Alex, who quickly befriends bullshit detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne). It makes sense because Alex hates dishonesty. “If you ask me a question and I lie, who are you having a conversation with? Nobody,” she smoothly tells her new pal at one point. 

The actor's convincingly bashful performance comes to a halt in the finale. Halfway through “The End Of The Road,” Alex reveals herself as a ruthless assassin who tricked Charlie into taking her to a target in Indiana. Not only that, she also tries to drive them both off a cliff to an early grave. This is devastating for Charlie, who's left friendless once more. Instead, she gains a sociopathic nemesis who is well and truly obsessed with her, Moriarty-style. (Alex went as far as controlling her breathing technique so she wouldn't be caught in a lie, now that's commitment.) 

The A.V. Club spoke to Harrison about what made this role particularly challenging, her tricks for playing a nefarious villain, and, as the conversation winds down, she displays those aforementioned comical skills in her answers. 

The A.V. Club: How did you feel about taking Alex from an amusing sidekick to this evil big bad? What did you want to achieve with this switch as an actor primarily known for comedy? 

Patti Harrison: I talked to the team about how to differentiate between the two a lot. I knew the twist beforehand, but I love to imagine what the experience would've been like on day 11 of playing this character if they said to me that she goes from telling Charlie “Oh, here's a coffee” to “Sit in the chair, bitch” and “I'm going to drive you off a cliff.” Hopefully, watching [the reveal] is like a surprise party, and you feel the same chemical reaction happening in your brain. When they filled me in on the details, it truly was the most excited I've ever been for a role because I've always wanted to do an action movie, stunts, combat stuff, and use weapons. I've never really gotten that opportunity because I'm a comedian, and that makes complete sense. Coming into it with this story, we had a lot of meetings. [Season two showrunner] Tony Tost, who is an angel, really helped to guide me tonally. 

I love Poker Face‘s comedy, but I didn't want to dishonor the stakes that were being built by this moment when the turn happens. I wanted it to feel evil in the sense that, when all is said and done, Charlie is a deeply wounded and traumatized person with no sense of security in her life. The show is about resilience and resourcefulness in the face of her loneliness, considering she's subjected to people who are trying to kill her. I wanted this moment to feel like a death knell of “Oh my gosh, I can't trust anybody.” Imagine what would happen to her brain after that. I didn't want it to feel silly, yet all of us were determined to keep Alex as an interesting, fun character. Tony, Natasha, and everyone were constantly checking in with me to see how I was doing. We were also having in-depth conversations about what my voice would be like in the finale and how it would juxtapose against how Alex talked. 

AVC: What were those conversations like about modifying your voice? Was it daunting as a performer to navigate these specific qualities of the character? 

PH: Well, as you can hear from my actual speaking voice, it's pretty low, kind of chainsaw, cigar smoker-esque, and it's not that I smoke. I have asthma. I think my voice is just scratchy because in my teens and my early twenties, I wanted to be in a metal band. I would make scream songs on GarageBand, and it shredded my vocal cords, and no one ever heard them. But it gives me this “sexy woman in her 90s” voice, which is different than Alex's voice, as you can also hear. She's sincere. When I thought of what would be impactful for Charlie, Alex felt like a super earnest character.  She has an almost infantilized level of sweetness. So I based part of that on one of my college friends whom I met during improv. Her name is Emily, and to this day, she is the most earnest person I've met in my life. 

I come from a pretty sarcastic family that uses dark humor to cope with stuff. I guess I can't speak for all of us, but for me, my humor when I entered college became irony-poisoned, and Emily was so open about what she was feeling. She was always going like, “Awww,” and you could hear it in her voice when she was happy. Being around her helped me become more gentle. So I thought, for me, it would be the most painful to find out that she was the person using me. I was also trying to strain my neck so the voice is dance-y and to get a ribbon-like intonation. My acting coach throughout the process, Michael Warner, was constantly there to help and make it feel fun and real for the story. God bless that man. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson needs to get that stripped from him, and it needs to go to Michael “The Rock” Warner for all the help he gave me to figure out the two different voices. 

AVC: Since you have only the last 20 minutes or so of the finale to sell the switch, does it help knowing the weird details of your character's backstory, like how she supposedly wrestled a polar bear and walked 100 miles in the snow?

PH: Totally. It helps me take the performance where I need it to go because the details of her life are so absurd. The things that she's done, there is a version of it that we could have done, where it's very silly and caricature-like of a catty assassin. But in learning about how extreme her backstory is, it makes me oddly ground her and add naturalism. I mean, I wouldn't say that for me it's a naturalistic performance. I was definitely having fun with the creative liberties I got, but there was a lot of attention towards how to bring these aspects of her to life without tipping over into caricature, and how we honor the betrayal emotionally. Natasha is giving an incredible performance. She has to do so much emotional lifting in those final beats where her character is being traumatized in real time. I didn't want it to then cut to me, and I'm just like all “Ha ha, I'm goofy and silly and crazy and I might kill you.” So it was cool to find a bridge between the backstory and the presence this character has on camera in this moment. 



Even the incredible costume department was helpful with that, and the fittings were a lot of fun. I got to try the craziest shit, like all the snow outfits we put on were so fucking cool. That black outfit, in particular, was great. Up until that point, I'd been wearing girl dinner universe clothes, if that makes sense. So to get to wear a knife holster on my arm and feel the weight of that, wear the driving gloves and fucking Louboutin combat boots made me want to do a flip, wrap my legs around someone's head, and then flip backwards and slam their head on the ground. 

AVC: In an alternate universe, would you have liked to continue playing Alex as Charlie's friend and gotten the chance to develop that character and dynamic? 

PH: It would've been nice. And it would've been nice for Charlie to just have a friend, and I think she'll have one someday who can give her the comfort and safety that she deserves. I think even if she stayed friends with Alex, who didn't turn out to be evil, she would have inevitably, kind of accidentally gotten her to sign up for a weird pyramid scheme or something where they would lose all their money. I think she would be in a life of pain in a different way with Alex, and would be annoyed to death. 

AVC: Now that you've tried your hand at playing a sociopath, do you have definitive tips and tricks for getting it right as a performer? 

PH: [Laughs] I would just say to act like who you are on the inside and not who you are when you're saying hi to your friends, talking on the phone with your family, or talking to your partner. Be the person who, when you're standing on a platform waiting for the train or in a grocery store, when someone gets in front of you in line, there's that voice saying “Bury him” or something. Listen to those voices.

AVC: The comparison to Moriarty is inevitable because he was obsessed with Sherlock in a way your character is with Charlie. Was that an inspiration for you, or did you go back to watch any Columbo episodes with memorable villains? 

PH: I don't know what the hell that is. [Laughs]. They told me I was going to be like Moriarty, and I was like, “Who the fuck is that? I don't give a shit.” They were like, “You don't know Sherlock Holmes? We are setting you up to go from Watson to Moriarty.” We got in a huge fight about it that day. I remember I had to wear a brace on my wrist because Tony picked me up and threw me through my trailer window, and then I came through the other green room trailer, the makeup trailer, and then just got in a huge fight with everyone there. Yeah, it was a rough day.

AVC: Now that sounds like it would make a good movie.

PH: True, but some things are personal. We live in a society that teaches us to capitalize on every story, and some of these stories are just for us and our friends who experience them, and I think that's a beautiful thing.

AVC: Have you talked to Rian Johnson about returning for season three as Charlie's ultimate nemesis since your character survived that car crash? 

PH: You know, I can't say because as I'm talking to you right now, there is a representative from Peacock who has an anti-tank rifle pointed at me and there's a red dot laser right at my throat, which is such a strange, painful place to do it if you're going to kill me. But don't worry, I won't say anything. All I can say is you'll have to keep an eye out in the future.

AVC: Well, now you know how Charlie feels.

PH: [Laughs] Exactly, yeah, I'm feeling empathy and I hate it. I'm getting a perspective of how other people feel, which is not making me feel great.

This story is being published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy.


	Major retirement systems in blue states — where many governors and attorneys general are fighting hard to counter extreme and likely illegal actions by the Trump administration — have invested billions of dollars in some of the biggest corporate supporters of those actions, a review by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has found. 


	Since his inauguration in January, President Donald Trump has focused his ire on blue states in a number of ways. He's closed Department of Health and Human Services regional offices in states where he lost the last election, attacked “state overreach” on climate mitigation policies he opposes, and threatened to withhold federal funds from universities located in Democratic-led states that voted against him in 2024. He has also attempted to withhold already allocated funding to blue states on the basis of their immigration policies, deployed National Guard troops and the Marines in California over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and sent masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain immigrants, primarily in blue state “sanctuary cities.” 

	











	Trump has made no effort to hide his campaign of retribution, posting to Truth Social after June's “No Kings” protests across the country that he intended to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York… and other such Cities, [which] are the core of the Democrat Power Center.” 

	











	Blue state attorneys general have responded with more than 30 lawsuits against the Trump administration's unconstitutional moves. But despite these high-stakes battles, public pension funds in California, New York, and Illinois have invested more than $6.1 billion in six companies that bankrolled Trump's election or are deeply involved in carrying out his authoritarian agenda.

	The investments made by pension funds are made with limited input from the public sector workers that contribute to them — a fact that labor experts believe is a major problem for corporate accountability. Many public sector workers have protested and urged their pension funds to divest from Tesla in recent months as Elon Musk-backed cuts have wreaked havoc in communities across the country. 


	The following corporations have been helping the president execute some of his most controversial and authoritarian policies this year: 


	Tesla CEO Elon Musk pumped $290 million into helping elect Trump and Republicans last year, spending far more on the election than any other billionaire donor. The president then rewarded Musk by keeping him at his side throughout the transition and anointing him head of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a controversial, chaos-generating special operation best epitomized by Musk wielding a chainsaw as he abolished and halted the work of whole agencies and gleefully reduced the federal workforce by about 250,000 federal workers, the majority of whom were represented by unions. 


	Since departing the DOGE effort at the end of May, Musk and Trump have butted heads, but the world's richest man still reaped massive dividends from the effort, largely from gutting agencies that were investigating him. Investors have raised concerns about Tesla's lofty valuations in the aftermath of his public split with Trump. State retirement systems in California, New York, and Illinois have $3.7 billion invested in Tesla.


	Valor Equity is run by Musk's friend and private equity manager Antonio Gracias, who has worked with DOGE in an attempt to dig up evidence of voting by immigrants through controversial access to once private Social Security data. Valor Equity manages billions of dollars for blue state pension funds — while also investing in Musk company SpaceX and the drone maker Anduril, which hope to be awarded contracts to help build Trump's proposed $830-billion, Israel-inspired Golden Dome missile defense shield. The recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” included a provision that mandated that federal funding for border surveillance towers go to companies with the exact specifications provided by Anduril.

	SpaceX has also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to invalidate the National Labor Relations Act, setting up a potential abrogation of the cornerstone of labor rights in the U.S. by the ultra-conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Valor Equity has also invested in xAI, which owns Musk's platform X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 8, controversy emerged as Grok, xAI's AI chatbot integrated with X, began spouting pro-Hitler propaganda. California, Illinois, and New York retirement systems have $1.3 billion invested in Valor Equity funds.


	Right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel's company Palantir is building a national database to help the Trump administration better amass information on everyone living in the U.S., with the company having already received $113 million in federal funds as of the end of May, according to recent reporting by The New York Times. 


	The tech company was also awarded an additional $795 million Defense Department contract in May, and has received a new $30 million contract from ICE to more closely track immigrants in the U.S. In total, the pension funds surveyed have $745 million invested with Palantir. 


	Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, a designer and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who became a “close friend” of Musk's and still owns a seven percent stake in his vacation and short-term rental firm, has been heavily involved with DOGE since the beginning and now hopes to replace Musk in leading the department's ongoing effort to slash the federal workforce. The 43-year-old billionaire also sits on Tesla's board and was a longtime Democratic donor before voting for Trump in 2024. The pension funds surveyed have $330 million invested in Airbnb stock.


	GEO Group, one of the two components of the major private prison duopoly, received a $1 billion contract with ICE in 2025. On a recent earnings call, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley remarked on the lucrative opportunity presented by Trump's mass deportation agenda.


	“This is a unique moment in our company's history,” he said. “We believe we are well positioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders.” 


	GEO Group is being sued for illegal labor trafficking related to work performed by immigrant detainees, and major concerns have been raised about conditions inside of GEO facilities. GEO Group subsidiaries contributed $1.3 million to a pro-Trump super PAC in 2024, and another $500,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. The Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund and the New York State Teachers' Retirement System have $3.9 million invested with GEO Group.

	











	The CEO of the private prison firm CoreCivic stated on a recent earnings call, “Our team has always been mission and outcomes-focused, but this is such a significant moment of time in our company's history. Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now.” 


	The firm recently received a no-bid contract to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Kansas that had been effectively shuttered by Biden administration policies, after donating $500,000 to the Trump inaugural committee. Stocks in both GEO Group and CoreCivic have soared following passage of Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will pump another $45 billion into immigration detention capacity and transportation over the next few years. The Illinois Municipal and New York State Teachers' funds have $8.4 million in CoreCivic holdings. 


	The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), the country's largest pension fund, and the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), the country's second-largest pension fund, have received calls to divest from Tesla (as well as from the broader military-industrial complex). 


	Other public pension funds in the U.S. and abroad have already taken action to pull their investments in Tesla and other anti-labor corporations. The pension fund for public sector workers in purple Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, recently voted to stop buying new Tesla shares and begin the divestment process from the carmaker. On June 13, the Swedish pension fund AP7 announced its intention to sell its entire $1.4 billion stake in the automaker, stating that “AP7 has decided to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of labor rights in the United States.” 


	In March, Denmark's Akademiker Pension also announced its intentions to divest in Tesla over labor rights issues. In January, Europe's largest pension, the Dutch ABP fund, divested from Tesla, as well as from Meta and Alphabet, over environmental, social, and governance concerns. Other Dutch pension funds had divested from Tesla prior to this year due to labor rights concerns. In October, the Norwegian asset manager Storebrand announced its intentions to sell Palantir stock due to their concerns that its practices violate human rights law. 


	Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley, a Democrat, told CMD that “there's a real fiduciary issue here…. Tesla's client base is Democrats, people who care about the environment. Then [Musk] goes and [effectively] alienates all of his customers. [So] all fiduciaries should be looking at this — at the very least telling active managers to not invest in Tesla… until [the company] makes some changes,” including agreeing to a neutrality agreement with labor unions. (Given Musk's ongoing feud with Trump, he may well alienate Republican customers, too.)

	











	On April 2, Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.6 million-member American Federation of Teachers, sent a letter to state chief fiduciary officers urging them to examine risks inherent to investing in Tesla by “communicating with the money managers that manage Tesla stock on behalf of your state and its retirement funds to ask them what steps they are taking to safeguard retirement assets.”


	The typical defense from public pension fund managers who are held to account for investments considered contrary to the public interest is that they have a fiduciary duty to pensioners that trumps all other concerns, and that this obligation includes diversification. In a 2017 statement, CalPERS claimed that divestment “limits investment opportunities, decreasing diversification, limiting returns, and increasing risk in our investment portfolio.” 


	But the definition of fiduciary duty is notoriously fuzzy, asTed Siedle, a former attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), points out. 


	“There's an argument that anything can be a breach of fiduciary duty or consistent with fiduciary duty,” he told CMD. “Public pension funds are not governed by any federal fiduciary standard, and [there are] scant state standards, which means that any argument can be made that a particular investment is consistent with or violates fiduciary duties.”


	Samir Sonti, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York, told CMD that the flexible definition of fiduciary duty is frequently used as a dodge against divestment and keeps many managers from taking action.


	“In the eyes of many, pension fund managers' fiduciary duty has been reduced to the notion that whatever can deliver the quickest [return on investment] is in the interest of the fund,” said Sonti. “What this misses is that often what promises to deliver the quickest [profit] also poses existential threats to the labor movement, public pensions, and the public sector more broadly. It's incumbent on those who oversee pension funds to recognize the real threats… that DOGE and the Trump administration more broadly present to their existence.”


	Forty years ago, pension funds were far more conservative, investing the bulk of their capital only in stocks and bonds. Yet the types of risky investments being made today — namely private equity, in which the 10 largest U.S. pension funds have invested over $300 billion, and which are subject to losing all of their value — continue to pass fiduciary muster at most pension funds, even those with managers who have fiercely rejected arguments in favor of divestment.

	











	Siedle points out that there is extremely little public information about this enormous sum of money pumped into the industry. “If you're going to manage public money, you must be subject to public scrutiny,” he said. “The private equity industry has successfully gone city by city, and state by state, arguing that their offering documents are proprietary and contain trade secrets,” excluding them from public records laws, meaning that the public lacks critical information about this increasingly influential industry. 


	What are the barriers to pension funds divesting from pro-Trump companies? Mike McCarthy, a professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz who studies the labor movement and pension funds, noted the “tremendous lack of democracy in these funds,” adding: “There's a lack of any oversight from workers about how these funds are invested.”


	McCarthy pointed to a $34-billion Dutch pension fund for retail sector workers that has a far more robust process for engaging its members and beneficiaries in investment practices than do most American pension funds. 


	Several years ago, the Dutch pension fund brought beneficiaries and members together for a multi-day discussion about how the fund was invested. A randomly selected group of participants chose to invest more in social good and public housing. “There was an explicit recognition in these recommendations that [beneficiaries would] be willing to give up a certain return on investment,” McCarthy said. “We just don't have that [kind of process] here.”

	Given the excesses of the current Trump administration, McCarthy called on public sector union members to be more vocal about the need to take control over the way their pensions are invested. Some of these unions have been outspoken, but others have historically been more reticent to criticize the investment strategy of their public pension fund managers. 


	“I think public sector unions should demand control over their investments,” said McCarthy. “Historically, the money that has gone into these funds has been considered deferred wages. It's their investment. They own it, but they don't control it.”

Senior International Film Correspondent


	U.S. citizen Francis Charles Kaufmann, the self-proclaimed movie producer who is accused of murdering his partner and baby daughter in Rome, has been extradited to Italy from Greece. Italian media reported that Kaufmann arrived at the Rome airport of Ciampino on an Italian Air Force Falcon just before midday local time Friday. Kaufmann was originally arrested on the Greek island of Skiathos on June 13 on suspicion of killing his 28-year-old Russian partner Anastasia Trofimova and their 11-month-old daughter Andromeda, whose lifeless bodies were discovered in Rome's Villa Pamphili park on June 7.

	











	He denied the accusations in a hearing in Larissa in Greece shortly after his detention, saying: ” “I am innocent: I didn't kill them.”  The mother and child had reportedly accompanied Kaufmann to the Italian capital for meetings on a number of feature film projects he said he was trying to get off the ground.As reported by Deadline last month, it emerged in the wake of the murders and Kaufmann's arrest that he had been operating under a number of aliases and that many of his producer credits on IMDb were untrue. It also came to light that Kaufmann had secured a €863,595 ($996,112) tax credit from the Italian Ministry of Culture in 2020 for a feature entitled Stelle della Notte, which never got made, using the alias of Rexal Ford and a fake passport. Under rules around the Italian film tax credit, the application was handled by Rome-based company Coevolutions and Kaufmann did not have direct access to the monies, but one hypothesis is that he traveled to Rome to secure part of the payout.


	This revelation led to the resignation of Nicola Borrelli, the General Director of Cinema and Audiovisual at the Italian Ministry of Culture.  Kaufmann has now been transferred to a secure section of Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of Rome and a preliminary face-to-face hearing with Italian investigators is expected to take place next week.

	In the official trailer for Billy Joel: And So It Goes, the musician considers a reality in which “Uptown Girl” was a Mozart piece. It's not entirely farfetched. His history as a musician started with listening to classical music. Besides, the singer and songwriter has learned not to count out the impossible. “Sometimes it's alien to me — this guy, Billy Joel. I don't know who that is, or what that is,” he says in the clip from the two-part HBO documentary. “I'm reminded of it when I go walk on the street. Oh, right, I'm that guy.”


	Joel doesn't have an explanation for how his first band, the Hassles, were ever successful (“I don't know one person that liked what we were doing”) or how he ended up dating the supermodel Christie Brinkley (“Me? I'm from Hicksville”). Still, he thinks he has the secret to the music mostly figured out. “If there was a skeleton key to unlocking what's behind the songs, it's my relationship with others,” he said.


	In the documentary, Joel will reflect on how his upbringing influenced his songwriting. “I'm still trying to put the pieces together,” he says in one scene. “I didn't know my father at all from eight years old until I was in my 20s. I've had a lot of hard lessons in my life.” There's trauma that lingers, but he learned how to flip it into music magic.

	Paul McCartney appears in the trailer to recall his first encounter with the singer, saying, “When I first heard Billy Joel, it was like, wait a minute. ‘Who's this?'” Even Bruce Springsteen popped in to admit, “Billy's melodies are better than mine.” For P!nk, Joel prevailed because “he cares about the human experience” and “he wrote songs that mattered.”

	Joel learned “that life is a fight,” and wore his songs like armor. “I think music saved my life. It gave me a reason to live,” he says. “Everything I've done and everything I've lived through has somehow found its way into my music.”


And So It Goes premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June. Joel was unable to attend the screening due to his recent brain disorder diagnosis. The first part of the film directed by Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin will premiere on HBO on Friday, July 18 at 8 p.m. EST followed part two on Friday, July 25.=

	As a teenage musician, Jon Batiste used to call himself “a new-age blues artist.” Now, many genre-jumps later, he's taking a deeply enjoyable left turn towards roots music on his seventh studio album, Aug. 22's Big Money — and reminding the world he's always been a bluesman at heart. “I'm just now making an explicit Americana blues statement,” Batiste says, “but for me, it's at the beginning. It's always the undercurrent. I think about everything that I have done, and it all is in some way a form of homage to the blues.”


	The album ranges from a full-on Sly Stone homage on the Andra Day duet “Lean on My Love” to the title track's mutated Chess Records R&B to the entirely unexpected rockabilly romp of “Pinnacle,” with Batiste playing at least as much guitar as piano throughout the album. As a whole, you could call it Americana, or simply rock & roll — and Batiste sees the album as part of a recent wave of Black cultural reclamation, a “repatriation process” that also includes Beyoncé‘s Cowboy Carter (which he guested on while he was in the middle of recording this album) and even Ryan Coogler's Sinners.

	











	 ”American history has oftentimes gone through this pattern of something being born and then it being transferred to anyone else other than Black folks,” Batiste says. “I had the honor to play with the Rolling Stones, and I know Paul [McCartney]. I love the Beatles, but how did this thing called rock & roll that was invented by a bunch of black sharecroppers and farmers in the South and then spearheaded by Little Richard and Fats Domino and Chuck Berry end up being [seen as] the result of the British Invasion? Rock & roll became our national music and became the face of our youth culture and national culture — and a white face at that — when, self-admittedly, they were playing songs and speaking to the ideas of these Black Americans.”

	The album was born in spontaneous moments on Batiste's tour last year, his first real outing as a solo artist. “I would run into people on the road and we'd go into sessions,” he says. “Every song is a performance. It's me playing and singing at the same time with the band. All of us in the same room, breathing the same air, creating onto the tape.” Batiste is also launching a tour behind Big Money, kicking off Aug. 27 in Kansas City, MO and stopping at 30 venues throughout the country.

	Five of the album's nine tracks feature production by frequent Jay-Z collaborator No ID.  “Music is so monolithic these days,” No ID says. “It's tough to find people who have learned it enough to understand it from multiple perspectives, culturally. Jon is not just a genius-level player, but he's a highly educated and scientific thinker…. Because I had an opportunity to work with someone so skilled and diverse, we weren't in a box in terms of what we could do and what audience we could target. Jon is the most fun human I've ever worked in the studio with.” It was No ID's idea to give the album's final song, “Angels,” an airy reggae feel, and it ended up becoming a callback to the globetrotting sound of Batiste's last album of originals, 2023's World Music Radio.


Big Money‘s capitalism-tweaking title track (and first single) offers a broader mission statement for the album, as sung by Batiste and The Womack Sisters, who happen to be Sam Cooke's granddaughters: “Might as well live for something you can feel/ Might as well live for something real.” As that lyric suggests, Batiste sees his organic approach as, in part, a rejoinder to the rise of A.I. music:  ”I think about this album being a direct statement of the importance of people keeping these traditions alive,” he says. “AI is not going to ever replace this sort of practice. But I do fear that in the short term we'll forget what this means, and why it's important, unless artists make statements that are definitively of the essence of communal expression in the traditions of our music, and make them in a way that's relevant to the contemporary mind and contemporary culture.”

	One of the album's most striking moments is Batiste's piano-and-voice living-room duet with Randy Newman on “Lonely Avenue,” a bluesy Doc Pomus-penned ballad that Ray Charles made famous in the Fifties. The song was an unexpected product of the friendship Batiste has struck up recently with Newman, 81, who has faced serious health struggles in recent years — they initially bonded over their mutual gigs scoring Pixar movies, and soon started talking about New Orleans music and more. Newman hadn't been singing or playing much, but when Batiste started playing piano at the older man's house, he suddenly started singing along. On his next visit, Batiste came with recording equipment. “He was coming alive right before us,” he says.

	











	Batiste hopes other musicians follow Big Money‘s roots-conscious approach. “We have such a profoundly rich cultural inheritance in America that many of us don't know of, don't fully embrace, don't fully understand,” he says. “And artists just have to keep making statements that point back to that and counter things that are trying to dilute that or erase it.”

What's in a story?: Up until last Sunday, Gillian Anderson pic The Salt Path, a true-to-life underdog film about a couple made homeless who walk along a South England coastal path, was a local box office hit. Then, The Observer dropped a bombshell investigation, questioning multiple elements of the couple's story and revealing that the author of the source material, Raynor Winn, was once arrested after being accused of stealing tens of thousands of pounds from her employer. What's followed has been an almost nationwide debate around truth, fiction and just how far Raynor Winn was able to push the believability of her story. Given that it is supposed to be a raw, honest re-telling of a couple finding light amid disaster, The Observer report called the very essence of the book into question. Having spoken to multiple experts, it also queried Raynor's husband Moth Winn's CBD, a debilitating disorder that has an average life expectancy of 6-8 years, and which he has been living with for more than double that period. Both the book's publisher Penguin and the movie's producer Number 9 Films said they had undertaken “all due diligence,” yet the messy affair raises interesting questions over just how far these efforts should stretch, and just how far Raynor Winn had been stretching her story. She hit back furiously Wednesday, issuing a lengthy statement partnered with hard medical evidence of Moth Winn's CBD, while calling The Observer's report “grotesquely unfair, highly misleading and [seeking] to systematically pick apart my life.”

Disney & ITV Deal











			Watch on Deadline		







‘Love Island' meets ‘The Bear': It's been a summer of streamer-broadcaster co-operation. The latest American SVoD to land a bedfellow is Disney+, which has struck a landmark deal with ITV that will see a “Taste of Disney+” rail feature on ITVX and vice versa. Content heading to ITV includes The Bear, Andor and The Kardashians, while Love Island, Mr Bates vs the Post Office and Vera head the other way. Karl Holmes, Disney+'s boss in EMEA, told us the secret of the deal's success will be in its complementary nature, (Less than 10% of Disney+'s audience is over the age of 55, while for ITV the figure is around 40%) while ITV content chief Kevin Lygo labeled the tie-up a “mutually beneficial alliance.” Free-to-air VoD players and U.S. streamers will “come closer in the future,” Holmes said, as he teased more Disney partnerships of this ilk to come. Disney hasn't been the only big player looking to collaborate. Netflix and France's TF1 struck a “new kind of partnership” last month that will see the former carry channels from the latter, while Amazon and France Télévisions did similarly for France Télévisions' streaming service a couple weeks later. The new age is upon us and collaboration between old and new is the name of the game.


Britain & France Team On Cinema Pact


‘Plein' sailing: More collaboration, this time between nations, was revealed after French President Emmanuel Macron visited the UK this week. Macron was in Britain to try and strike a UK-France illegal migration deal but his trip offered an opportunity for the two nations' movie industries to deepen ties. As Macron hob-nobbed with King Charles, Kate Middleton and the Prime Minister, the BFI and France's CNC signed a Moving Image Co-operation Agreement aimed at fostering closer collaboration between the UK and French film industries. Given the strength of their respective movie sectors, Mel's dispatch from the BFI Southbank, where the deal was revealed, notes that co-operation of this ilk has not always been straightforward. The two have vastly different financing systems and legislation, while Brexit has been an impediment to collaboration. Never one to miss an opportunity to address a crowd of culture vultures, UK Minister Chris Bryant, who speaks fluent French, waxed lyrical about French cinema, citing Plein Soleil and Les Enfants du Paradis as personal faves.


Czeching Out Karlovy Vary


Soft power “depleting”: There was some serious star power in town at this year's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF), with Dakota Johnson, Michael Douglas and Peter Sarsgaard making the journey to the Czech Republic for what is always a lively event. But in one of the more intriguing sessions, Hollywood's very status as a titan of global cinema was called into question. The latest Nostradamus report from the Göteborg Film Festival, which was unveiled during the Karlovy industry sidebar, found that Hollywood is losing its “symbolic value” in mainstream culture, as it went on to posit that America's soft power is being depleted despite the appearance of the A-list stars. “The concept of Americanization has been quite challenged for some time,” Göteborg boss Josef Kullengärd told an audience at the KVIFF industry headquarters. This session came after one where more local concerns were aired, as figureheads made impassioned speeches about how far-right purges are threatening cultural sectors in Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, there remained plenty of glitz and glamor. One of the most popular sessions was Fifty Shades star Johnson's, who had two films at the fest, Celine Song's sleeper Materialists and Michael Angelo Corvino's Cannes hit Splitsville. The two modern dating films got Johnson thinking that “dating sucks,” she told an engaged audience. Karlovy coverage can be found here.












Terry Gilliam Reflects


No more fights: Nancy sat down with the weird and wacky Terry Gilliam on Monday as he headed to the Umbria Film Festival in Italy, where a screening next weekend of his iconic 1985 dystopian black comedy Brazil will celebrate the film's 40th anniversary. The Oscar-nominated icon, a former member of the Monty Python troupe, is always happy to speak with honesty and purpose but appears to be mellowing with age. He told us that while he has often courted controversy during a lengthy career, he doesn't want “any more fights.” His views on the current state of cinema are rather depressing. “It just feels like it's not a very interesting time,” he added. “I watch movies now, and I see very technically skilled films, but they are not doing anything to make my view of the world different.” That is certainly a thought to ponder. The director has lined up the likes of Johnny Depp, Adam Driver, Jeff Bridges, Jason Momoa and Tom Waits for his next project, Carnival at the End of Days, but financing is proving a challenge. Dive deeper.

Blackpink have officially released “Jump,” a new song that they debuted at the opening night of their Deadline World Tour. Teddy, Diplo, 24, Zikai, Claudia Valentina, Jumpa, Malachiii, and Jesse Bluu co-wrote “Jump,” and Diplo, 24, Boaz van de Beatz, Zecca, and Ape Drums co-produced the song. Dave Meyers directed the accompanying music video. Watch it below.

“Jump” is the first new song from Blackpink since August 2023's “The Girls (Blackpink the Game OST).” Since then, the K-pop band's members—Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa—have each focused on their respective solo careers. Rosé was the first of the group to share a solo album, dropping Rosie in December 2024. Jisoo soon followed, in February 2025, with her mini-album Amortage. Next came Lisa's Alter Ego, and then Jennie's Ruby.

Blackpink began their Deadline World Tour on Saturday, July 5, in their native South Korea. They will play North American shows in July, and the tour will stretch into the beginning of 2026. See all of Blackpink's upcoming tour dates below.

The arrival of James Gunn's Superman in theaters this weekend has put a lot of focus on the many, and frequently troubled, attempts Warner Bros. has made over the decades to leverage the character in film. That includes a new Wall Street Journal piece tracking Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav's attempts to course-correct the company's whole superhero franchise around the time the DCEU was falling apart—a process that included fielding big pitches from Dwayne Johnson and, apparently, dismissing a high-profile script from Ta-Naheisi Coates that would have centered on a Black Superman on the grounds of it being “too woke.”

Coates' script dates back to 2021, when it was announced that he'd be writing the project under the auspices of producer J.J. Abrams. (Which probably didn't help it pass muster with Zaslav, in hindsight; the studio head has not been shy about letting it be known he's not especially happy with how little he feels the studio has gotten out of its very expensive overall deal with Abrams' Bad Robot.) In addition to his work as an author and essayist, Coates is well-known for his work writing comics, having penned a critically acclaimed run on Black Panther in the 2010s. His Superman would have been, per comments made at the time, his attempt at “meaningfully adding to the legacy of America's most iconic mythic hero.” Details about the script are hard to come by—the Wall Street Journal piece runs with the idea that it would have been a period piece set during the civil rights movement—but Coates was, per a THR piece, expected to turn it in some time late in 2021, with Warner Bros. hunting around for a Black director and star to team up on the film.

Which runs the timeline smack into April 2022, when Zaslav took over leadership of the just-merged Warner Bros. Discovery, and started quickly looking around for a lifeboat to rescue the company's floundering superhero fortunes. At which point, per the WSJ, “He dismissed as too woke a script being written by Ta-Nehisi Coates about a Black Superman in the civil rights era, according to people familiar with the matter.” For a minute, Zaslav apparently flirted with giving Dwayne Johnson more creative control over the universe, which is presumably how we got that incredibly awkward Henry Cavill cameo in Black Adam—conversations that ended pretty much the minute the box office returns for the movie came in. (News that Gunn and Peter Safran would be taking over sole control over all WBD superhero production arrived literally four days after the film's premiere.)

Interestingly, Gunn has been asked about the Coates script in the past, noting that, while he hadn't read it—as of May 2023—he could imagine it existing as an out-of-continuity “Elseworlds” movie. (Like the Joker films, or Matt Reeves' The Batman movies.) The Wall Street Journal article notes that the same sources who say Zaslav dismissed the concept said it was still possible Coates' film might someday see the light of day under Gunn and Safran's leadership.

	When a California jury handed hip-hop mogul T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris an eye-popping $71.4 million award at a civil trial that pitted the couple's pop group OMG Girlz against a line of candy-colored plastic dolls, even Tiny was blown away.


	“I mean, wow. They did more than I thought they would,” she told Rolling Stone, referring to the generous jurors as she left the courthouse last September. “They blessed us more than beyond.”


	Three weeks later, T.I. appeared on an Atlanta radio station and announced his retirement from live performance. “I do not need the money anymore,” the rapper born Clifford Harris said. “I don't want people to pay me to hop around and sweat for their entertainment anymore.”


	After three trials spanning almost two years, it seemed like the couple's long battle was over. They proved toy titan MGA Entertainment stole the name, neon hair, and distinct fashions of their teen trio for seven dolls in MGA's wildly popular line of the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. dolls. And jurors found the infringement was willful.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But the war wasn't over. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that the largest chunk of the award — the $53.6 million awarded for punitive damages — was not supported by the evidence. He said the couple had a choice. They could take $1 for punitive damages on top of the $17.9 million compensatory damages and walk away, or they could opt for yet another new trial. On Thursday, the couple's lawyer rejected the $1, setting the stage for a fourth jury to hear evidence in the case.

	











	So how exactly did we get here after so much time and money already spent in court? It's been a long road stretching back decades. Here's your timeline to get up to speed:


MGA Launches Bratz Dolls, May 21, 2001


	MGA catapulted itself into the top ranks of toy manufacturing when it introduced its first line of wide-eyed and culturally diverse Bratz dolls. The original quartet of 10-inch dolls were Yasmin (Latina), Cloe (white), Jade (East Asian), and Sasha (Black). Company CEO Isaac Larian would go on the credit MGA with having “invented diversity in dolls.” Bratz toys became a billion-dollar brand within two years and were credited with revolutionizing a corner of the market long dominated by Mattel's Barbie.

 The OMG Girlz Are Formed, 2009


	A member of the Nineties R&B group Xscape as well as a songwriter known for the TLC hit “No Scrubs,” Tiny switched gears to management and formed the first version of the OMG Girlz with daughter Zonnique Pullins, Bahja Rodriguez, and other temporary members including Lil Wayne's daughter Reginae Carter. The group made its TV debut on Tiny's BET reality show Tiny and Toya. After Carter left, the group evolved into a trio with Pullins, Rodriguez, and new core member Breaunna Womack. The OMG Girlz later appeared on the 2012 VH1 show T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, and they were nominated for the Outstanding New Artist award at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards.


MGA Debuts L.O.L. Surprise! Dolls, Dec. 7, 2016


	When MGA launched its set of miniature collectible dolls known as L.O.L. Surprise!, the line became the company's new best-selling juggernaut. The blockbuster dolls quickly filled the void left by the waning popularity of the Bratz line. Famously dressed in crop tops, fishnet stockings and miniskirts, the Bratz toys were called out by the American Psychological Association for “sexualizing” young girls. The new L.O.L. Surprise! line featured smaller, brighter and less-edgy models sold in blind packaging that made each surprise “unboxing,” and its rush of feel-good neurotransmitters, part of the fun.

MGA Introduces the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. Line at Center of Case, July 10, 2019


	Looking to expand its new powerhouse product line, MGA released its L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. Outrageous Millennial Girls line with bigger dolls marketed as the big sisters of its prior offerings. Like the original line, the new dolls were sold in opaque packaging. But getting back to more of a Bratz aesthetic, the company added more articulation and more elaborate, fashion-forward outfits.

	











The Harrises Send Cease-and-Desist Letter, Dec. 8, 2020


	Testifying at trial, Tiny said she learned about the MGA dolls in late 2020 when someone texted her a photo showing a particular doll named “Chillax” on sale at Target. She said the doll's distinctive white and black two-piece costume was a clear copy of an outfit the OMG Girlz sported on their 2013 All Around The World tour. The doll also had neon blue hair. Tiny said she called Bahja Rodriguez's mom, who “immediately went crazy.” After that, Tiny contacted her lawyers, and the cease-and-desist letter accusing MGA of infringement was sent.


MGA Files Preemptive Lawsuit, Dec. 22, 2020


	After receiving the letter accusing it of copying the OMG Girlz's signature look, MGA rushed to federal court and asked a judge to step in and affirm that it owned everything about its L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. dolls and did nothing wrong. In the 10-page complaint, MGA said its L.O.L. Surprise! products were among the bestselling toys in the U.S. It also claimed OMG Girlz disbanded in 2015, so there was “no likelihood of confusion that the OMG Girlz sponsored or are associated with L.O.L. Surprise!”


T.I. and Tiny File Counterclaim, Feb. 22, 2021


	The Harrises, on behalf of the OMG Girlz, answered the lawsuit and filed a counterclaim alleging MGA illegally copied the trade dress, name and brand of the OMG Girlz without consent. They said Larian and MGA “engaged in both cultural appropriation and outright theft of the intellectual property, brand and image of a musical recording group of young multicultural women.”


First Trial, Jan. 25, 2023


	The first attempt to reach a verdict ended in a mistrial after jurors heard barred testimony accusing the toy company of “racist cultural appropriation.” U.S. District Court Judge James V. Selna made a pre-trial ruling that the Harrises had to steer clear of their claims that Larian engaged in a “routine practice” of “using his doll business to misappropriate the likeness of Black female artists.” So it was a violation when a consumer testified on video that she “stopped purchasing” MGA's dolls when she learned the OMG Girlz were not affiliated with the toys. The woman said she “did not want to support a company that steals from African Americans and their ideas.”

Second Trial, May 9, 2023


	A second trial in the case started in Santa Ana, California, with Judge Selna at the helm again. Two weeks later, a jury returned a verdict in favor of MGA. The jury found that the OMG Girlz had not proven that the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. doll line infringed the OMG Girlz' colorful trade dress or misappropriated the OMG Girlz' name, likeness, or identity.

	











Verdict Overturned, June 8, 2023


	The U.S. Supreme Court issued a major ruling that found the First Amendment didn't necessarily protect a dog toy company that created a humorous chew toy that looked like a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The ruling led Judge Selna to find that one of the jury instructions related to the Harrises' trade dress claim was erroneous. He granted the Harrises the right to another trial.


Third Trial Begins, Sept. 3, 2024


	When the Harrises started their third trial, they narrowed the scope of their claims to just seven dolls out of the dozens they previously challenged. T.I. and Tiny both took the witness stand, but it was MGA designer Lora Stephens whose testimony may have been the most significant. She told jurors she knew about the OMG Girlz before she started working at MGA in 2017 and that she followed Tiny on Instagram. She also had a photo of Womack on her Pinterest board, though the inspiration board had approximately 1,200 images total. Stephens admitted MGA had not asked her about her knowledge of OMG Girlz before the company responded to a discovery request in the case saying no employees knew about the group before the lawsuit.


New Verdict Awards Harrises $71 million, Sept. 23, 2024


	The jury found MGA infringed on the OMG Girlz' trade dress with respect to all seven dolls: Chillax, Roller Chick, Metal Chick, Bhad Gurl, Prism, Miss Divine, and Runaway Diva. The jury also found the same seven dolls misappropriated the OMG Girlz' name, likeness, or identity. The panel awarded $17,872,253 in compensatory damages and $53,616,759 in punitive damages. “I think justice was served. I think it's a testament to the relentlessness and resilience of my wife, daughter, and nieces,” T.I. told Rolling Stone by phone, minutes after the verdict. “We're just happy we were able to come out on top and fight for creatives and our intellectual property that large corporations seem to think is just public domain and free for all to come and grab and use.”


MGA Challenge, May 27, 2025


	MGA filed a motion claiming “the staggering amount of the punitive award” violated its right to due process. The company asked Judge Selna to step in and vacate the “constitutionally excessive” award or, at a minimum, order a new trial.


Punitive Damages Award Gutted, July 8, 2025

	Judge Selna issued a ruling that effectively slashed the $53.6 million punitive award down to $1 while leaving the $17.9 million award for compensatory damages in place. While he faulted Larian for the “belittling” way he treated the Harrises, the judge said that the evidence at trial, in his opinion, failed to show MGA designers “willfully” copied the OMG Girlz. He described Larian as an Iranian immigrant who proudly sold a “diverse line of dolls” well before launching his L.O.L. Surprise! line.

	











	As Rolling Stone previously reported, Judge Selna gave the Harrises the option of rejecting his proposed $1 in punitive damages and going for another trial. His ruling did not clarify the contours such a trial would take. In a statement to Rolling Stone, the lead lawyer for T.I. and Tiny said he believed it would be only a “mini-trial” on the issue of whether MGA acted “willfully” and should be on the hook for some new amount of punitive damages. “We expect another jury will be similarly offended by MGA's maliciousness and copying,” the lawyer, John Keville, said. A day later, on July 9, the Harrises filed paperwork confirming they wanted to try again with a fourth trial.

If almost every And Just Like That… character must be forced under one roof, Charlotte's birthday party is a far more believable conceit than last week's funeral for Lisa Todd Wexley's father. (RIP to the man, who may or may not have died twice, but no one besides Charlotte knew him or is close to LTW to attend.) This is still AJLT… we're talking about, where it feels like the writers skipped huge chunks of Sex And The City entirely. So they expect us to forget that an episode in the original's fifth season already established that Charlotte's big day is actually in January. In “Luck Be A Lady,” she's nervous about turning 36 when the gang goes out to Atlantic City at Carrie's insistence. 

Anyway, forget that fun fact now because in “Just Wanna Have Fun,” Carrie throws her pal a get-together on a decidedly non-winter day in her spacious apartment. Sorry, Miranda, your new home isn't big enough for the shindig. Carrie plans to distract Char with a chic party so that she gets a break from thinking about Harry's prostate cancer diagnosis. She also invites her hot gardener, whom she barely knows, to the event. Look, I'm not complaining about more Logan Marshall-Green or his character's excellent flirting scenes with Seema; in fact, that's a very welcome sight. But AJLT… continues to expect us to suspend logic at basically every turn. At this point, we'd best give in. 

That's the only way to process the dynamic between Carrie and Gianna (guest star Patti LuPone) in this episode. Before any talk of Charlotte's party even comes up, the three women are gabbing at their new favorite hangout, Anthony's cafe/bread store. And that's where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte meet Giuseppe's mother, who is visiting from Rome. Anthony obviously wants to make a strong first impression on his boyfriend's mom (Spoiler alert: He does not). Carrie, however, forms an instant connection with her by proclaiming, “We love your son.” Wait, what? Carrie and Giuseppe have barely shared scenes together, but sure, let's go with this heartfelt declaration. 

AJLT… just needed a way to put Sarah Jessica Parker and LuPone—two New York City legends—in a scene together. So when Gia invites Carrie for a meal, much to Anthony's chagrin, who are we to complain? Gia also shares her romantic past with her new friend: She was 21 when she met her lover, who was 50 at the time. Gia later stopped her work as an artist and started studying Freudian theory to better understand her stepchildren, who still don't like her. If, like me, you were also sighing out loud and wondering why in the world we are hearing about Giuseppe's parents, there's a really on-the-nose connection. After all, Carrie is also having problems integrating with Aidan's family, particularly troubled teen Wyatt. Gia's advice to Carrie is to be herself, as if our girl knows any other way. “Inauthentic beings never win,” Gia adds, in a dialogue that feels ironical when spoken out loud on a show like And Just Like That….

Let's circle back to this birthday party, though. The long list of attendees includes Harry, a surprisingly attentive Rock, a reluctant Lily who has just been dumped, Miranda, Brady, Joy, the Wexleys, Char's co-workers, Bitsy Von Muffling, Anthony, Giuseppe, Gia, Seema, hot gardener Adam, Carrie's downstairs neighbor, Duncan, and a bunch of other randos to fill the balloon-infested room. With everyone gathered under Carrie's sparkling Gramercy roof, tensions are bound to rise, right? And it all happens with background music courtesy of a fancy karaoke machine Miranda brings. (LTW's son hogs it for the most part, and Miranda's efforts to get her gal pals up for a round of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” are a bust. Did she really think Carrie as she is now would come up and join her?) 

Cringeworthy as this installment may be, AJLT… infuses a few genuinely heartfelt moments that undercut the silliness and continuity errors. Take, for instance, Harry finally admitting to LTW, Miranda, and Carrie about his health issues and upcoming surgery. He can't stand to see his wife dealing with the agony alone (especially when he has a personal shopper he's already confessed to in a scene that's so random, I'd rather not dwell on it). He is the absolute best man in the SATC universe, as seen also when he agrees with Charlotte that her dog dying of cancer instead would be “almost worse” for her. I will not forgive the powers-that-be if they kill him off. I'm glad Charlotte's birthday is mostly drama-free for her, no thanks to Lily. Even Seema has a good night with Adam full of intense banter. Best of all, he serenades her on that karaoke machine with “Bette Davis Eyes.” Sarita Choudhury and Green share some sizzling chemistry, so let's hope AJLT… bothers to flesh their relationship further. Seema's plot needs to stop revolving around how she's broke. It's unbelievable that, as a longtime real estate agent, she has no savings and can't afford to take an Uber ride to her preferred salon. Let's not fly so far off the ground, writers. 

While all this takes place in her house, Carrie spends time bonding with Duncan. Remember when the two didn't get along because she wouldn't even remove her heels? Well, those episode five days are long gone. Now, they're sharing scotch from the same glass, doing light arm touches, and exchanging drafts of their novels. He can't stop gushing over the 1846-set period novel she's writing. We've heard snippets of it in her voiceovers, so we know it really isn't all that he's making it out to be. Clearly, Duncan is poised to be a love interest and a potential dilemma for Carrie and Aidan. Personally, I think it works. 

Carrie's wishy washy bond with Aidan has been particularly frustrating to watch in season three. She was more bothered by Miranda pointing out her vibe with  Duncan than she was last week, when Aidan confessed he cheated on her with Kathy. Carrie's sooo upset by Miranda's implication about Duncan because she already has a boyfriend with whom she shares 20 years of history. But wasn't she just telling Aidan that he shouldn't have expected her not to sleep with anyone else? What in the world is going on with her? Carrie needs a reality check right now, and Miranda is usually the one to give it to her. So this scene in the kitchen between them was actually lovely to witness. It reminded me of how Miranda would warn her about getting close to Big in SATC. Carrie needs to pay attention to her own words from the novel: “The woman wondered what she had gotten herself into,” a line that stopped Duncan in his tracks when he read it. A crush will make you say and feel the craziest things, huh? 

“Just Wanna Have Fun” is a marginal improvement for season three, primarily because the mostly contained setting allows for simmering feelings to bubble to the surface and, hey, no Aidan appearance is a win. And yet, plot-wise, it frustratingly makes a dent in the overarching arc, so let's hope the remaining five episodes offer more.

It's been 11 years since Peter Jackson last directed a non-documentary film, and seven since he last wrote one. (The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies and Mortal Engines, respectively; shout-out to anyone who knew that second one, because we're guessing you're the last person you know who still remembers the Mortal Engines movie.) That decade-plus might seem like big a number, in the course of Hollywood careers that typically run for 50 or 60 years. But perhaps, we suggest, a little perspective is in order. Let's compare that (largely Beatles-focused) span of time to a much larger sum. Like, say, 600 years—how long the New Zealand giant moa has been extinct—or 300 or 400, i.e., the number of the dead birds' bones that Peter Jackson apparently owns, spends his time amassing more of, and is now embarking on genetic experimentation upon.

We got to thinking about Peter Jackson's massive collection of big-ass bird bones courtesy of a very weird interview he gave to ScreenRant this week. In said conversation, Jackson took a little time to deny that he was retired from making movies, noting that he's working on three different film scripts at the moment, including the one for Andy Serkis' upcoming Lord Of The Rings return project, The Hunt For Gollum. It's just that he's been a little distracted by all these bird bones, and his deep-seated, extremely expensive desire to use them to bring the moa back to life.

This is, wouldn't you know it, all about Colossal Biosciences, the company that made headlines a few months back when it announced that it had “recreated” some long-extinct direwolves, complete with a vote of support from No. 1 direwolf publicist George R.R. Martin. Jackson, as it turns out, is a “major” investor in the company, which he and wife Fran Walsh tossed money at with the stipulation that they switch at least some of their focus to these very large, very extinct birds that he's apparently obsessed with. (Brief educational parenthetical: The moa was a large flightless bird native to New Zealand, and does, to be fair to the man, sound exactly like the sort of shit Peter Jackson would be into—with some reportedly standing more than 2 meters tall.)

Jackson had already been collecting bones from the animal out of simple hobbyist interest, as one does when one is embarking on a new career as an eccentric billionaire. More recently, he's been focused on working with Colossal to try to use those bones to extract the genome for the nine known species of the animal. (It's apparently pretty tough: Even Peter Jackson, who owns more moa bones than anybody we know, apparently only had 25 viable specimens in his whole collection!) As with the wolves, Colossal intends to use the genome to alter the DNA of existing animals to adopt more “moa” traits, with an eye toward creating a moa-ish animal that can then be bred. So, yeah: There's your answer the next time someone asks you “Hey, what's Peter Jackson been up to for the last decade?” Dead Bird Jurassic Park (and also writing a script for that Andy Serkis movie, of course).

The 16-track LP includes collaborations with Travis Scott, Shaboozey, Mick Jagger & Stromae. 


													By
												

	Heran Mamo



Burna Boy released his eighth studio album No Sign of Weakness late Thursday (July 10) via Spaceship Records, Bad Habit and Atlantic Records.


	The 16-track project includes previously released singles “Bundle by Bundle,” “Update,” “Sweet Love,” “TaTaTa” (featuring Travis Scott) and “Change Your Mind” (featuring Shaboozey). No Sign of Weakness also includes more collaborations too, with Mick Jagger (“Empty Chairs”) and Stromae (“Pardon”). “TaTaTa” reached No. 2 on U.S. Afrobeats Songs, while “Bundle by Bundle” and “Update” both hit No. 5.


	“It's extrospective,” he told Billboard France in his recent cover story. “It's not just about me but about looking outward, reflecting on the world, and how my experiences connect to the bigger picture. It's about growth, understanding, and challenging perceptions while staying true to who I am.”

	











	Burna is headlining the third and final night of Afro Nation Portugal tonight at the Lit Stage, marking his first time being able to perform songs from the album shortly after its release. Come November, he'll kick of his headlining No Sign of Weakness Tour at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, becoming the first Nigerian artist to headline the iconic venue. The 17-date trek will also go through major cities including Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta before wrapping up with two dates at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, on Dec. 17 and 18.




			Trending on Billboard		







No Sign of Weakness arrives two years after his last album I Told Them…., which was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Its hit singles “City Boys” and “Sittin' On Top of the World” (featuring 21 Savage on the remix) also scored Grammy nominations that year, for best African music performance and best melodic rap performance, respectively.

Lando Norris is sitting in a London hotel room and unboxing a Labubu. 


	Only it's not an official Labubu on this day (because who can find one in this economy?) but rather a similar blind box from the viral bag charm's parent company, POP MART. Norris has just been handed a Care Bears series blind box to open, and he playfully teases the ripping of the packaging, drawing it out just long enough for dramatic effect.


	“I actually don't have a Labubu yet,” the F1 driver tells the room, which on this day has no less than a dozen important-looking people in it, all decked out in papaya-colored McLaren gear and blue Hilton hotel badges. Norris closes his eyes, flashes a smile, then pulls a clover-green Care Bear from the box. “Thank you so much,” he says. “This'll be my lucky charm for the weekend.”


	Three days later, Norris is behind the wheel of his chrome-colored McLaren at the British Grand Prix, where he overtakes teammate Oscar Piastri on lap 44 and hangs on to claim the checkered flag eight laps later. It's the British driver's maiden win at his home track and it gives McLaren its first F1 victory at Silverstone since Lewis Hamilton in 2008. Lucky Lando indeed.




	Of course those who have followed Lando Norris' career know there's more than luck involved when it comes to his rapid rise through the Formula 1 ranks, which culminated in him suddenly competing for the Driver's Championship against Max Verstappen last year, pushing the four-time World Champ up until the third-to-last race of the season. This season, Norris is second in the standings, just a few points behind Piastri, as McLaren looks to repeat as Constructor's Champs. Though he's been labeled in the past by some as “immature” and “arrogant,” Norris has silenced critics — and perhaps his own self doubt — with impressive showings both on — and off — the track.




	The growth was evident in an Instagram message Norris posted following his Silverstone win. “A weekend I'll remember forever,” he wrote, “made even better by having the people who've been with me since day one all there to enjoy it too.”

	The F1 star's newfound hospitality also takes shape in a new activation between McLaren Racing and Hilton, the global hospitality brand that has been a partner of the F1 team for 20 years. To celebrate the occasion, Norris recently helped to unveil the hotel's “Stay Like McLaren Racing” suite at The Trafalgar St. James London, Curio Collection by Hilton.


	Created in collaboration with the McLaren Formula 1 Team, the suite features two rooms of racing-inspired gear, decor and activations, all decked out in McLaren's signature “papaya” colorway. While one room offers a bed and living space (complete with a welcome package and virtual greeting from team principal Zak Brown), the other room features a “heritage hub,” with twin racing simulators, a “pit wall” airing race day replays, an in-room bar, and scores of new and retro McLaren merch (including Norris and Oscar Piastri uniforms hanging from replica lockers). 


	Guests also receive a smoothie delivery inspired by the drivers each morning: Norris' “Energy Smoothie” features papaya, natch, along with mango, ginger and electrolytes, while Piastri's “Morning Change” smoothie uses bananas, berries, milk, honey and Optimum Nutrition protein.


	Fans can book a night at the “Stay Like McLaren Racing” suite from now until July 20, just in time to celebrate Norris' recent win at the the Formula 1 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Hilton will offer other “Hilton Honors Experiences” to Hilton Honors members throughout the year.




	For the Bristol-born Norris, winning at nearby Silverstone was more than a dream come true — it was proof that his years of hard work and dedication are finally paying off. It was also a reminder for the 25-year-old to give himself grace and sometimes, to just let the chips fall where they may.


	“Sometimes you're confident and you're excited for a race, but it's not like you can be completely prepared for it,” he says. “You don't know what's going to happen. So you just have to wing it at times and go with the flow.”


	Three days before taking victory at Silverstone, Norris talked to Rolling Stone about balancing off-track partnerships with on-track performance, re-shaping his winning mindset, and how, six years into his Formula 1 career, he's already thinking about his legacy.




We're here in London at your home race. What are your earliest memories of Silverstone?


	The first time I ever went to this Formula 1 race with McLaren was 2017 I think, which was one of my first appearances with McLaren as part of the team and it was as cool as you can get because it was at Silverstone.


	But my first-ever one, I honestly can't remember how old I was — I was probably 10 — and it was my dad, my brother and myself, just us three. We went on a Thursday or Friday. I think we were racing at a cart track nearby and we went during one of the days or halfway through the day, just to kind of get a quick look. I was so small I could barely see because I couldn't see over any of the barriers, and we didn't have like grandstand tickets or anything, so I barely got to see much. But that was like my first smell and taste of what it was like to be there on a race weekend. We waited outside the paddock where the gates are, and the drivers are coming out, and I remember I had my race helmet and we tried to get as many people to sign it as possible. And at home now, I've still got that very, very, very first helmet I ever had with some signatures from the drivers.


Who did you see? Who signed it?


	I think the best one I had was Jenson [Button]. I got maybe four or five drivers and a couple of — at the time, I didn't even know who they were — but it was probably like team managers or something and that was cool for me, you know, to get that first experience. Then there were some drivers that well… were not so nice, but I don't want to say who.


You can put them on blast in Rolling Stone right now.


	No, no, I never talk about someone because sometimes, drivers can be in — even for myself — you can not be in the best mood or you're in a rush or something. So you know, there are times when maybe I don't sign as much stuff as I should, but because of different situations. So I never talk bad about someone.


We're here at Silverstone with Hilton, who are one of the McLaren Racing partners. What is it about this partnership that resonates with you?


	Traveling is pretty much half of our time and like half of our job. The most important thing, especially for myself, is rest and recovery. In my list of priorities and how I can make sure I'm as prepared as can be for a race, sleep is probably one of, if not the highest. And for the team, especially when we're traveling all over the world in different time zones, Hilton is there to try and make us feel as comfortable as possible, not just for me, but for the over 100 people that normally travel every single weekend.




Do you have specific routines or rituals to help you fall asleep?


	Everyone wants a good night's sleep and clearly, everyone has their own preferences. Hilton's always very good at trying to understand what everyone likes in particular. For me, I like the more blacked-out room, where you don't see the daylight in bed. I'm also particular about the temperature of a room. I want it as cold as possible. The minimum. I just don't like heat.


	Sometimes I take my own pillow with me, but sometimes I tell them what I like — for me, I like quite a firm pillow. Too soft and then it wraps around too much [pointing to neck]. For us, the neck is one of the most important things, so I can never afford to wake up with a bad neck because I slept funny. Trying to keep that consistency is one of the most important things.


	And then I like little snacks, like mints and Kinders and subtle things that aren't needed, but just nice to have.


Do you like working on these brand partnerships or do they sometimes get in the way of training?


	Well you want someone who actively wants to try and make your team and your situation better. And then you want to obviously be able to give something back in return. For us, one of those big things is our fans and our supporters, because without them, we don't have Formula 1. So we are always trying to have a good situation [with partners] where we can help each other, but at the same time we can give more access to the fans, the supporters of McLaren, because they're very, very important to us.


	As drivers, we know we have to be part of all of these things, so the more attractive and cool they can make it for us, the more it's going to be better for everyone, right? We're drivers, you know, not actors or anything. So the more fun it can be for us, the more of a positive it's going to be for the fans, for the partners, and for the team.


This is your sixth year as a full-time Formula 1 driver. How do you think your mindset or awareness has changed?


	I think you get so used to it being normal, and you kind of get used to waking up on a Sunday, knowing that it's race day. I remember the first year or two in Formula 1, I would wake up on a Sunday and be like, ‘Oh God!' You're kind of excited, nervous… you don't know what's going to happen because there are a lot of new situations. Now I'm able to anticipate much better what might happen, and I'm able to narrow down a lot more of the situations I might be in. So that's just experience. 




Do you still get nervous before a race?


	There are still times when I'm obviously more anxious, more nervous, all of these things, and then maybe not feeling as comfortable or confident or whatever. But then you've got to try and know when those times are and turn it into excitement, and then the excitement turns into confidence when you kind of have a good plan in place. Knowing how to turn different situations into a positive one is really the main thing. But I don't think you can avoid ever being overly excited or nervous or anxious at times. I think sometimes you've just got to roll with it.


What is your attack plan like when you get to the track each weekend?


	I think for some things, it's good to have a very good plan. But at the same time, with racing, you can have plenty of plans in place, but we're also human at the end of it, so you can't plan for what everyone else is going to do. And I think those are sometimes the exciting races, especially when they say there's rain or it's drying out. Yes, it's nerve racking, but it's also exciting because there's opportunity for everyone, including yourself. I think other races where it's just going to be completely dry or whatever, it's much easier to put a decent plan in place and try and execute that. But when it's like this weekend, where it's probably going to rain for maybe half the race or something, that's one where you're like, ‘Okay, what's going to happen?' 


Do you like driving in the rain?


	Some of the time, those conditions are the most scary, nerve-racking conditions, especially when you might be on slicks in the wet [rain]. I say scary and nerve-racking because it's so easy to crash and so easy to be off, and for everything to just be gone. But it's also a time when there's more opportunity than ever before. So it's really playing with fire and it's a very risk-reward game, and sometimes those are the most exciting.


Since this is for Rolling Stone, would you say you're a big music guy?


	I like music. Whenever I'm in my room, whenever I go for a run, whenever I'm in the car — not the race car, but in the other car — I'll be listening to music. But I also like to have some peace and quiet every now and then because everything is so noisy. There are always so many people [around] so having some some quietness is good, but I'm a music guy. 


What's like, your shout-out-loud, roll-down-the-windows song?


	I mean, I'm more chill than anything, so it'll be like a country song. 




Who's your favorite country singer?


	The easy one is Zach Bryan. But I'm not very good at artist names.


We talked about mindset earlier, but what is a lesson that you've learned recently?


	I think one of the best things you learn in Formula 1 is that there are so many people that work within a team — over a thousand people work with McLaren. And what I'm learning is just to utilize the people that you have around you. In Formula 1, you have several people assigned to every single thing that you can think of. So everyone there has a specialty and is an expert in different areas. 


	So it's about knowing when to not just think that you can do it, but knowing when to go, ‘Okay, maybe I need to speak to this person, maybe they can help,' or ‘Maybe they've experienced it before.' Sometimes I would love to think that I got it and I can do it and I don't need to [ask for help]. I think you learn that everyone there has something that they can offer to help you. And sometimes vice versa, you know, you'll help them. But I think that's probably one of the best things I've learned.

“Some people want to be remembered as the ‘best driver ever.' But I don't know, I feel like eventually everyone forgets.”


You have so many young fans that look up to you, though of course, you're still young yourself. But I wonder, do you ever think ahead to what you would want your legacy to be?


	I guess the only thing that I want is for people to know the kind of person I was, rather than anything else. I'm not fussed about having a legacy or being remembered as being one of the best drivers or anything. It's just something that I'm not too bothered by. You know, some people are different. Some people want to be remembered as the ‘best driver ever.' But I don't know, I feel like eventually everyone forgets. So for me, there's no use. There's no excitement for me in thinking of those things. 




	For me, it's just trying to achieve the things that I want to achieve in my career and in my life, and share those moments with others. And then just be remembered for being the person that I am, more than the driver that I was.

Another day, another Stephen King adaptation—this time, of the prolific author's 2019 thriller The Institute. 

The story of a group of children who are kidnapped by a mysterious organization for seemingly malevolent purposes, King's novel is a hybrid of his own Firestarter and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. From its unique terminology to its cold, menacing atmosphere, Benjamin Cavell's MGM+ series (July 13) is as faithful as they come. 

Yet like its source, it's a saga that's short on real sparks, treading such well-worn supernatural territory that even the best efforts of stars Ben Barnes and Mary Louise Parker aren't enough to make it more than a passable entry in the ever-burgeoning King-to-screen catalogue.

From the outside, 14-year-old Jake Ellis (Joe Freeman) looks like the rest of his Timberwolves-loving Minneapolis peers. In reality, however, he's a child prodigy who's on the cusp of receiving an opportunity to attend MIT that will force his parents to uproot their lives and relocate to New England. That's not to be, since one evening Jake is snatched from his bed, and when he awakens, he's in a facsimile of his room that exists in a cold gray building. 

Emerging into a hallway that's covered in strange elementary school-style posters, Jake meets Kalisha (Simone Miller), who explains that he's now a resident of The Institute, whose pre-adult residents are all either TK (telekinetic) or TP (telepathic). Given that objects have a funny habit of moving around Jake when he's upset, this isn't altogether stunning news to the kid, and he's soon welcomed into a group that includes trusting George (Arien So), nervous Iris (Birva Pandya), and rebellious Nicky (Fionn Laird).

As Jake learns, the Institute is run by cunning head honcho Ms. Sigsby (Parker), her ruthless chief of security Stackhouse (Julian Richings), and rational Dr. Hendricks (Robert Joy), who with the assistance of sadistic orderly Tony (Jason Diaz) conducts tests on the kids that are designed to instigate and enhance their extraordinary powers—and, in the best case scenario, reveal them to be PCs (precogs) who can see the future. 

All of this takes place in the Institute's Front Half, after which the captive children graduate to the facility's Back Half and then, supposedly, gain their freedom. Nicky doesn't buy that story, and neither does Luke. From the outset, he's skeptical about everything sold by Ms. Sigsby, whom Parker embodies with a superficial positivity that reeks of deception, not to mention derangement—the latter of which is underscored by an early scene in which, upon returning home from work, she soothes herself by burning her leg with a red-hot wire hanger.

Strange, sinister things are afoot at the Institute, and Cavell's series doles out hints about the organization's true motives at an enticing pace. Those revelations are at once horrible and complex, as well as thematically related to the recent ordeal plaguing former cop Tim Jamieson (Barnes). 

Arriving in small-town Maine with few belongings and no overt purpose, Tim successfully gets a job as the police department's “night knocker,” whose job it is to nocturnally patrol the enclave's streets. This is Tim's way of feeling useful after a traumatic incident in which he shot and killed a kid who was threatening to shoot up a mall. During the course of his duties, he meets officer Wendy (Hannah Galway), to whom he slowly grows closer, and local homeless crank Annie (Mary Walsh), whose intriguing conspiracy theories involve the Institute and psychic phenomena.

Tim and Jake's paths are destined to cross, but The Institute is most captivating when focusing on the latter's plight, which involves bizarre experiments known as “Shots for Dots” that make subjects disturbingly sick and weak. The Institute's combination of pragmatism and cruelty cloaks the proceedings in ominousness, as do Parker and Richings as bureaucratic cogs in a machine that's ultimately cast in quasi-Holocaust terms.

Instead of just a one-note boogeyman nightmare, the show complicates matters by giving its villains a potentially altruistic reason for their monstrousness. While the moral questions raised by their conduct (and motivations) are ultimately discarded in a way that suggests no one involved really cared about them, they nonetheless add a tantalizing layer to the otherwise straightforward material.

What holds The Institute back from generating more suspense is its performances, especially from its greener cast members. Freeman is competent, if lacking the charisma required to elicit real engagement with his suffering. The same goes for Viggo Hanvelt as Avery, the newest and youngest Institute victim, whose abilities are so great that they afford Luke and company a chance to break out of the Institute. 

Their functional turns are a burden the series can't totally overcome, and the visually unimaginative direction by Jack Bender, Brad Turner, and Jeff Renfroe doesn't do them any favor—and, at times, seems to actively work against them. As with the Lumineers' morose credit-sequence cover of Tears for Fears' “Shout,” the flat action is gloomy to a fault.

Like the best-selling novel upon which it's based, The Institute feels a tad too much like reheated leftovers. Stackhouse and Tony are psychos that we've seen before, Tim is the sort of good-hearted hero that King has favored since Salem's Lot, and the plot weaves together its strands in a fashion that will be intensely familiar to the writer's Constant Readers. 

This isn't to knock those conventions (which remain sturdy and entertaining) so much as to wish that the narrative at hand were more animated and surprising. Even its climactic tragedies feel of a piece with King's prior output—and, in this instance, don't hit as hard as they should as a result of the proceedings' ho-hum Institute protagonists.

Despite its weaknesses, The Institute captures the eerie, constricting mood of the Institute as well as King's issue with the idea that the ends justify the means—even if, perhaps, those means really are in service of the greater good. It's also, by design, an efficiently structured and thankfully self-contained affair, all the way to a finale that leaves little wiggle room for any (unnecessary) follow-up. It may be a middle-of-the-road tale from the Master of Horror, but that's still better than most.

He previously predicted Donald Trump's second term and BLM 

Nicolas Aujula, a psychic who is said to have accurately predicted the COVID-19 pandemic, has made a series of horrifying claims about 2025, and perhaps most shockingly, one of them has already come true.

Whether you believe it or not, there's something strikingly alluring about predictions. From Baba Vanga's almost supernatural accuracy to Nostradamus' foretellings about global economic collapse, I will never refuse a brief – and somewhat shaky – look into the future.

South London's Nicolas Aujula, who claims to have accurately predicted everything from Donald Trump's 2024 Presidency to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, has possessed the ability to see the future since he was 17 years old.

His first prediction for 2025 is that sometime “from the middle of the year”, WW3 will kick off. Considering the prevalence of WW3-themed articles right now, and growing conflicts in several areas of the world, this is proboably a prediction we were all expecting. With that in mind, here are the safest countries in the world.

Nicolas further noted how 2025 will be “a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world, where we will see horrific acts of human evil and violence towards each other in the name of religion and nationalism.”

We humans have never shied away from “horrific acts of human evil”, but in 2025 so far, we've had: Alligator Alcatraz, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, the continued persecution of Trans people, Diddy's trial, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, and the rise of Reform UK. Yeah, 2025 has been pretty sh*t.

On the subject of slightly fluffier predictions, albeit still depressing, Nicolas accurately predicted the breakdown of Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's nine-year relationship. The couple officially separated earlier this month, despite being seen on holiday together just this week.

“Katy Perry will have marriage problems in 2025, and Cate Blanchett has a successful year,” he said. “I've had visions of her bagging a lot of awards for her work.”

Can he predict that I will become a billionaire?

Let's start with the facts. 

Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old practice of spraying tiny particles into a rain cloud in the hope of pushing it to rain or snow just a little more. It's used in nine states, mostly to fight droughts that can hurt farmers, community water supplies and even some factories. No one knows whether it actually works.

It's important to lay this information out up front because one of the unfortunate aspects of writing about conspiracy theories is that people tend to remember the claims but not the facts that they're false. It helps to start with the truth.

You're going to hear a lot about cloud seeding in the next few days. Much of it won't be factual.

That's because a loose group of online conspiracy theorists have latched onto cloud seeding as an explanation for the devastating Texas floods. As a longtime reporter, I might say something like "there is no evidence for this claim" or cite some higher authority to say it's not true. But this is an opinion column, so I'm going to just come out and say it: This is bonkers.

I'm going to just come out and say it: This is bonkers.

As I said at the beginning, no one knows whether cloud seeding even works. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in December found that studies of how much additional rain it produces "ranged from 0 to 20 percent." That's because clouds aren't like hamsters that you can set loose in a maze; they are incredibly complex natural phenomena. You can't just seed one cloud and not another cloud and measure how much rain came out because of seeding.

Even if the outliers are correct and cloud seeding can increase precipitation by as much as one-fifth, that would still not be enough to account for the 15 inches of rain that fell in Texas on July 3, more than double what had been forecast a day earlier. The cloud seeding that online theorists have seized on involved 70 grams of silver iodide sprayed into a cloud more than 100 miles away two days earlier, according to The Washington Post. They might as well blame a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil.

Nevertheless, the theory gained ground after it was cited by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., GOP House candidate Kandiss Taylor and former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. Greene even proposed a national cloud seeding ban. 

In what appears to have been an effort to combat the misinformation, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted online resources explaining the science behind cloud seeding, geoengineering and even the condensation trails left by planes flying at high altitudes. This is commendable. 

But unfortunately, the administration's rhetoric isn't well-suited for this kind of debunking. 

"Americans have questions about geoengineering and contrails," Zeldin wrote on X. "They expect honesty and transparency from their government when seeking answers. For years, people who asked questions in good faith were dismissed, even vilified by the media and their own government. This ends today."

That is the kind of tweet that you would write before claiming there's an invisible map to secret treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence. It's not what you write to promote a sober fact-check.

Remember when I started with the facts at the top of this column? That was because people who study conspiracy theories have found that it helps to use a "truth sandwich" that begins and ends with the facts, rather than highlight the conspiracy theories first and then rebut them. Unfortunately, the webpage that Zeldin promoted doesn't take that approach.

Noting that there have been "myths and misconceptions" about contrails for decades, the EPA site says it "addresses head-on various claims that these occurrences are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather."

It would have been better if the EPA started off by citing some facts, then noted that there have been conspiracy theories about it (without repeating the spurious claims) and then went back through the facts again. But saying that you're going to address the claims without actually addressing them right then and there is an invitation to misreading. 

The underlying problem is that Trump likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. 

The underlying problem here is that Zeldin's boss, President Donald Trump, likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. Over the years, he has made spurious claims about Barack Obama's birthplace, liberal donor George Soros, climate change and vaccines and cozied up to those who argue that there's a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who control the government.

Trump's words have helped foster an environment in which conspiracy theories flourish and even a government agency trying to debunk obvious misinformation hems and haws. Instead of just stating the truth, the leader of that government agency lionizes the conspiracy theorists as virtuous Americans who were targeted by an unnamed enemy, and he repeats their wildest claims. 

I don't know what to say about that, except to complete the truth sandwich by repeating the facts that I began with: Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old practice, used in nine states, to encourage precipitation. It may or may not even work, and it was definitely not the reason it flooded in Texas.

“Trust” showcases an unexpected evolution in Innellea's sonic palette, incorporating breakbeat elements that transform the energy in ways that have been captivating audiences across his recent performances. It sees Innellea join forces with SCRIPT, the 26-year-old producer behind standout Afterlife track “On The Low” and viral hit “Where I'm From,” standing tall on the newly launched label's strengthening ethos of fostering connections between established and emerging talent in the scene. SCRIPT, based in California, has quickly gained recognition across the American festival circuit, performing at major events like EDC Las Vegas, EDC Orlando, Electric Zoo, and Seismic Dance Event.

The track has already proven its potency as a secret weapon in Innellea's live sets, with its distinctive breakbeat section creating moments of pure dancefloor euphoria. Whether deployed during peak-time intensity or deeper atmospheric segments, “Trust” delivers what Innellea describes as “unmistakable impact” every time it drops.



This collaborative ethos has defined the Finding Home project since its inception, with the full 12-track compilation aiming to weave together diverse artistic perspectives into a cohesive exploration of connection and belonging. The album's September 5th release will complete a journey that began with community involvement through belonging's dedicated Telegram channel, where fans help shape everything from artwork selection to single choices. Innellea recently expanded belonging's community-driven vision with the launch of the belonging ‘Inclusion Series', his new DJ mix podcast series. The first installment sees the label-head take the reins with a mix of energetic IDs, his favorite current dancefloor weapons, and another taste of what's to come in Finding Home

With “Trust,” Innellea and SCRIPT have created something that transcends traditional collaboration, forging a piece that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant – exactly the kind of authentic connection that Finding Home was designed to celebrate.

ABOUT INNELLEA – A visionary live act, DJ, and producer who fuses melancholic, cinematic soundscapes with relentless percussive energy. His performances embody the spirit between indie and global dance, blending underground dynamism with genre-bending creativity and erupting into experimental breakouts that defy conventional boundaries. That's what he also captures in his own record label, “belonging”. It´s more than a label: it's a community for music, art, and the shared human experience that connects them. A space dedicated to the feeling of finding home.

Christian Vasquez, Senior Project Architect and Business Development Executive at National Engineering Bureau (NEB), has been re-elected President of the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) Dubai Chapter for the 2025–2026 fiscal year.

The announcement was made during the prestigious annual UAP Dubai Design Awards Ceremony on June 28 at Bluewaters Forum, Delano Dubai — a landmark event showcasing architectural excellence, innovation, and cross-sector collaboration.

The ceremony drew an elite crowd of industry leaders, including top executives and senior architects from prestigious firms such as AtkinsRéalis, Nikken Sekkei, AECOM, Gensler, RSP, BSBG, P&T, Dewan, Integrity Design, WSP, RAW-NYC, Arcadis, AE7, PALAFOX, Perkins Eastman, and many others. Influential developers and real estate giants like Emaar, DP World, Sobha Realty, Majid Al Futtaim, Aldar, and Expo City Dubai also participated. The event's prestige was further amplified by the presence of dignitaries and representatives from Dubai Municipality, TECOM Group, the Philippine Consulate General in Dubai & Northern Emirates, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Middle East, and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gulf Chapter.

A Leading Professional Network in Dubai and Beyond

UAP Dubai stands as a dynamic and influential professional community of over 500 licensed architects, all accredited by the Philippine Professional Regulatory Commission, making significant contributions across architectural firms, government agencies, contractors, and developers throughout the region. As one of the largest architect chapters in Dubai, it plays a vital role in shaping the built environment with a global outlook.

Introducing the New Leadership Team

Ambitious Vision for Knowledge Exchange, Partnership, and Global Influence

Vasquez's agenda prioritizes elevating UAP Dubai as a leading platform for architectural knowledge exchange, strategic business collaboration, and international dialogue. Planned initiatives include executive roundtables connecting architects, developers, and industry leaders; masterclasses empowering architects as entrepreneurs; mentorship-driven networking; and an expanded series of global webinars and lectures.

“UAP Dubai is more than a professional organization — it is a powerful, interconnected network fostering innovation, expertise, and leadership,” Vasquez said. “By harnessing our collective expertise and global connections, we aim to deliver meaningful impact for our members and the broader architecture and design community.”

Rooted in a Global Professional Framework

Founded in 1975, UAP is the official body of Filipino architects, affiliated with the Union of International Architects (UIA), Architects Regional Council Asia (ARCASIA), and the APEC Architects Registry. With over 500 licensed Filipino architects in Dubai alone and a global membership exceeding 60,000, UAP champions continuous professional development.
