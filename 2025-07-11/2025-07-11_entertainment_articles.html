David Lynch was a true original, so singular that we had to invent the term “Lynchian” just to describe his work. The fact that we all instantly know what that means speaks to how powerfully his style and sensibility came through in every frame, through a deep, intentional marriage of form and content. “He had that infinite wonder of everything, he would get transfixed into just the sheer act of exploration, experimentation, discovery,” said longtime Lynch collaborator Dean Hurley on the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “He loved to get into the sandbox of experimentation because the emotional spark that happens when you discover something, or stumble upon something, to him was the secret sauce to how things started. You're rubbing a flint against something and you're creating that spark that hopefully jumps onto something and creates a fire. Related Stories ‘To a Land Unknown' Review: This Palestinian Twist on ‘Midnight Cowboy' Is Full of Masterful Storytelling and Wrenching Humanity  ‘Superman' Is Here. For 14 years, Hurley had a front-row seat to how exactly Lynch did that. He worked daily with the “Twin Peaks” director in his Hollywood Hills studio. Lynch owned a compound of three homes in the Hollywood Hills, one of which appeared in “Lost Highway” before he converted it into the recording studio where he spent most of his waking hours. “The space was a hundred percent unique,” said Hurley. Hurley described how the home studio was an extension of Lynch's art. “He lived his whole life like that,” Hurley said. Sound and music provided Lynch the “emotional spark” for so much of his art. It is a carrier tone for our emotions,” said Hurley. “When you have a brain like [David's], that is so tuned into emotional learning, there's something that grabbed him and it set up this intense glowing breadcrumb where he wanted to follow and chase that feeling.” Lynch himself told the origin story of when he was first inspired to make a film while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. For Lynch, something so non-narrative as wind inspired him to pursue a new medium. Hurley said he saw the anecdote play out every day and believes it is the connective tissue to other great directors. “I think for filmmakers in general, it's the ones who are masters at their craft who are chasing feelings and figuring out the architecture of how to design that feeling for an audience,” said Hurley. “It's funny, going back and listening to some of these [recordings], they all sound the same, but like everyone he would start scratching a little rhythm, and he'd be say [Hurley doing an impression of an excited Lynch], ‘Listen to that Dean [pause], listen to that, Dean.' He was incredibly fired up about the smallest little things, just the simple act of life dancing before his eyes and ears.” Hurley admitted he could be dismissive — “Yeah, I've got that recording already” — but he grew to see how moments like this were key to Lynch's process. “He could stay a long time in that zone,” said Hurley. One of his favorite quotes was ‘Where the attention goes, that becomes lively. What Hurley described as Lynch's “lowering of the barometer” was exploration done without a specific project, story, or medium in mind. “That lens of somebody like him is one I think a lot of the filmmakers that we gravitate to [have],” said Hurley. “They're putting a magnifying glass over something that is often skimmed over, they're elevating it to a hyper-focused level where you didn't realize how deep that area was before.” On “Twin Peaks: The Return” he had many official titles because Lynch didn't want to bring in specialized professionals every time he tried to make something. He preferred a more DIY, hands-on approach that allowed discoveries to evolve organically. Hurley said this also explained Lynch's instant love affair with digital technology in the 2000s. “He definitely took to digital like a duck to water because it just reduced, reduced, reduced, and also allowed him to go back to the early days of basically doing everything DIY himself, like with short films, having a Bolex and just having a small group of people.” Even after their recordings transitioned from experimentation to the building blocks of a film, Hurley would come up with ways that allowed Lynch to extend his action-and-reaction process. For example, Hurley would take a theme, like the sound of electricity in “Twin Peaks,” and use samplers to create a full keyboard array where each key had different sounds that Lynch could play. “He liked discovery, so you put a garden of discovery in front of him and he would stumble over certain things, and then you could see which were exciting him [doing his excited Lynch impression again], ‘ I love that Dean. That which thrilled Lynch became the first step in building a palette. Lynch would categorize sounds, applying unusual names that spoke to him about the feeling of a section of the show or movie. “You could chop it up, ‘Okay, I've got this here.' You just start slowly building the thing and then with that stuff floating all in the air, something would inspire something else. One key lesson Hurley took from working with Lynch, and still applies to his work as a sound editor today, is the power of restraint and efficiency. “It creates an architecture of, 'Is this doing anything for us?' While working on “Twin Peaks: The Return,” Hurley saw how Lynch applied this principle across his creative process. Lynch often grew frustrated when collaborators focused on background details or secondary actions — anything he felt distracted from the primary focus of a scene. So when you have a scene, a tool of directing is what do I want them to pay attention to? Lynch's studio was transformed into the post-production hub for all 18 episodes of “Twin Peaks: The Return.” He invited a small group of trusted collaborators into this tightly controlled, insular space. Like an unnecessary sound effect, anyone not essential to that process was kept outside the environment he so carefully maintained. “I think that's one of the clear-cut tools of David is that he unified the goals and intentions of a massive group of people so he could align people to his vantage point, to his goal, to the result he was after, and people latched onto that,” said Hurley. “And when everybody's in the same house, there was a huge comfort factor for David because it's all insular and it's all his home, and I think that plays into it as well.” After more than a decade working on sound, he could now see how every element of Lynch's craft fed into a unified creative process. In the decade leading up to the third season of “Twin Peaks,” Lynch focused on smaller side projects and work outside of film and television. At one point, “The Unrecorded Night” was briefly in motion until COVID brought everything to a halt. “What happened after ‘Twin Peaks' wrapped is I think he got rejuvenated for that process of being the conductor of a large orchestra for something like that. It's our loss that he didn't get to do his last film project. If there's one thing we know for sure, it's that Lynch and his process would have led to another creation unlike anything else we'll see again.

James Gunn's DC Studios reset “Superman” is flying toward a potential $150 million weekend debut at the box office, with $22 million already in the bank from Thursday previews. But now that we've finally seen it, IndieWire's “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio are here to debate the movie, which swaps Henry Cavill for newcomer David Corenswet as the kryptonite-averse hero who also goes by Clark Kent. While Anne enjoyed the screwball-romantic chemistry between Corenswet and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” breakout Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Ryan loathed the experience and found it to be another serving of superhero slop as depressing as any other (despite some winky, cheeky banter). Like other superhero tentpoles before it, Gunn's new “Superman” descends into a 45-minute maelstrom of CGI nonsense, yet another good-vs.-evil battle that crosses times and dimensions and may be easy to follow (at least compared to other Marvel or DC final battles) but is ultimately hard to care about or invest in. Related Stories ‘Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight' Review: Embeth Davidtz's Personal Wartime Story Boasts a Beyond-Her-Years Child Star Nick Offerman on What the Right Gets Wrong About Ron Swanson: ‘Dumb People Insist He Would've Voted for Trump' This “Superman” movie's message of good prevailing over evil grew tiresome for Ryan, but then again, what possible psychological nuance were we expecting from a fun-in-the-sun summer blockbuster? He felt exhausted and defeated, whereas Anne found things to like about what's going to be one of the season's biggest films, the casting especially. We factor in some recency bias for that choice — though we aren't denying it's a fantastic film — as well as its timely take on class disparity that is strongly resonating in America today. We offer up our own favorites, which veer wildly, though we both agree “No Country for Old Men” (#6 on the Times' list) is a lock for any best-of-century Top 10. (Also check out IndieWire's best films of the 2020s, which published earlier in June.) Elsewhere, we take a look at new TV series including “Dept. Q,” a British crime thriller on Netflix from Scott Frank and Chandni Lakhani that Anne loves. Ryan, however, raves about “Girls” creator Lena Dunham's return to TV with “Too Much,” starring Megan Stalter as a Dunham-adjacent who moves to London and falls in with a quote-unquote bad boy (Will Sharpe) after a bad breakup. It's as much a send-up of millennial culture as it is a tribute to the great British romantic comedies of the '90s and aughts, like “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones's Diary.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Finn Little will reprise his Yellowstone character, Carter, as a series regular in the as-yet-untitled Beth and Rip spinoff for Paramount+, sources tell Deadline. He joins his former co-stars Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, who are leading the Taylor Sheridan series as their characters from the original series, Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, respectively. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip Wheeler, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son. Little debuted as Carter in Yellowstone‘s fourth season premiere, a role he continued until the series finale. His character is a troubled teen who met Beth at the hospital when she was visiting her ailing father, and where Carter's father was dying. After he loses his father due to drug addiction, Beth and Rip become his guardians, giving Carter work on their ranch. Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals for CBS, led by Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, with additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 previously announced as being in development. His TV credits include roles in Netflix's Reckoning, with Milly Alcock and Sam Trammell, and Tidelands, also from the streamer. He also portrayed Noomi Rapace's son in the psychological thriller Angel of Mine. He is repped by Paradigm and Hansen Jacobson. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“There are always attempts to resolve situations like this privately, but they never result in the type of change necessary to protect further victims. At the end of the day my absolute fear is that he will be able to continue doing this without any major consequences.” Dixon has filed a lawsuit against Perry alleging sexual harassment and assault. He tells THR that Perry first singled him out when Dixon was working as an event coordinator in Atlanta and organized a party for Tyler Perry Studios. But Dixon claims that this good fortune came with unwanted attention, including incessant, inappropriate personal text messages (Per THR, the legal complaint includes texts from Perry commenting on Dixon's “thick” body, asking “Why do you twist your hips when you walk?”, noting that Dixon “liked being choked” after shooting a choking scene on the show, and telling Dixon he needed to “let someone hold you and make love to you”). Dixon recounts multiple instances where Perry crossed physical boundaries, once even getting into Dixon's bed uninvited when the actor was staying in Perry's guest house. Dixon says he attempted to defuse the situation by saying he wasn't looking for a sexual relationship, a situation that would repeat multiple times over the next few years. Dixon eventually moved away from Atlanta to put distance between himself and Perry, ultimately quitting and filing a sexual harassment complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2024. In a statement to THR, a lawyer for Perry describes Dixon as an “individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,” adding, “Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.” For a long time, I convinced myself that it was part of the industry, or that somehow I had to accept it to keep working. But eventually, I couldn't stay silent anymore.” You can read the full interview here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With four kids under the age of four—including newborn twins—the young couple has reached a major milestone faster than Jed's parents ever did. “We've known each other five years,” Katey shared. Jeremy Vuolo didn't hesitate to ask the obvious: “So you guys are four in four years—are you going to keep going?” Jed responded, “We're just praying about that,” while Katey added they're currently taking a “sabbatical” from growing the family. “We would love to just enjoy the kids we have right now for a good minute,” she said. “It's an insanely busy season, the little years—especially because we have two infants right now. Still, they admitted they “both have a number in mind.” Katey revealed, “We'd love to have five or six kids.” As noted by TV Insider, Jim Bob and Michelle's fourth child, Jill Duggar, wasn't born until their eldest, Josh Duggar, was three years old. Parenting four kids under four isn't easy, and Jed and Katey are the first to admit it—especially now that they've entered the world of twins. No, we're both changing them at the same time.” The couple also opened up about naming their oldest, Truett. “We love Chick-fil-A,” Jed joked, “but that's not why we named him that.” Katey clarified, “The meaning of the name is ‘warrior for Christ,' and his middle name, Oliver, means ‘peace.' Their fast-growing family may be a handful, but they wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether you're watching an animated retelling, reading the backstory of a limited edition Barbie doll, or streaming a bootleg version of the musical that once starred Sarah Jessica Parker, the story remains pretty consistent. While people on TikTok aren't conducting psychological sleep experiments on each other in the name of a monarchical system, they are making it clear that their dating sensibilities are just as delicate with the latest phrase du jour on the app: princess treatment. And as the discourse around it keeps stacking up, what started as a silly turn of phrase has devolved into an incomprehensible mess that's preventing people from noticing the much more insidious shift around them. Online, the term “princess treatment” means above and beyond handling in a relationship setting. But what internet users can't seem to agree on is its application — what's anniversary behavior for one couple might be an average Tuesday for another . Enter the “bare minimum vs princess treatment” trend, a challenge where women ask their significant other where a particular task might land for them. Calling something “princess treatment” implies that it's an over-the-top request. EVERYTHING is the bare minimum 😤 ib: @Colton Connelly #andyandmichelle In addition to the sheer fun some women have with dousing their significant others with a garden hose, the trend has been characterized by countless disagreements in the comments section over what kind of treatment makes for a good relationship. But when housewife and content creator Courtney Palmer posted a video explaining her husband's princess treatment, what people managed to agree upon was that her video took the idea to an entirely new level. It's not that I'm not capable of ordering for myself, it's just a fun princess treatment sort of thing.” Palmer's video describing how she typically avoids eye contact with service staff, relying on her husband to speak for her, drew the ire of followers and a wave of comments calling the behavior problematic. “Me when I'm a prisoner,” read one comment. “It's giving cult or hostage situation,” said another. “They be like ‘princess treatment' but it's medieval times and you're locked in a castle.” There were parodies aplenty, many from service workers and restaurant–themed accounts focused on how disconcerting a lack of eye contact would be during a shift. These women, like Hannah Neeleman of Ballerina Farm, or even cooking creator Nara Smith, gain millions of followers by posting content themed around household management, from-scratch cooking, and child rearing — carefully noting that it's their personal choice while encouraging others to lean into their own divine feminine impulses. Posting about princess treatment isn't declaring what kind of feminist you are. It's a way to get attention — and its working. In an interview with People, she said she gained close to 24,000 followers from the success of the princess treatment video, which on its own received close to 4.5 million views. “Your softness isn't giving anyone control over you. It's giving a partner space to lead with that strength,” Palmer told People. “When I'm leaning into my grace, I invite him to rise as that protector, a provider, a partner, because that's what he wants to do. It works in a perfect balance and becomes that effortless, graceful, calm, peaceful lifestyle.” Texas Flood Aftermath Shows How Trump Is Breaking FEMA Deftones Announce First Album in Five Years, Drop New Song While people are patting each other on the back in Palmer's comments for being able to recognize red flags from a marriage influencer, what they're not realizing is that there's far more nebulous patterns slipping completely under the radar. Palmer's princess treatment video is simply the final boss of a TikTok practically terraformed by girl content. There's girl dinner, girl math, viral “we were girls together” sounds, the “looking for a man in finance” trend — all predicated on the underlying assumption that women need to be taken care of, protected, and are incapable of deep thought. And beyond the viral jokes littering Palmer's comments are thousands of seemingly serious comments calling her video just an example of how leaning into feminine roles can be self care. It's not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time that the Stanford Prison Experiment redux known as Love Island USA is streaming — where the biggest crime you can accuse someone of is not being “a girl's girl.” There's no good way to have subtle conversations around feminism online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Offshoot CIA starring Tom Ellis, which received a straight-to-series order in April, is being delayed until midseason and is undergoing a showrunner change. Watson, which had been set to return for a second season in midseason, will now be on for fall. FBI: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins, who originally was tapped to lead the series and co-write the pilot script with FBI, Law & Order & Chicago franchise boss Dick Wolf, has exited. He is being replaced by Wolf universe veteran Warren Leight, known for his two stints as showrunner of Law & Order: SVU. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming There had been early signs that CIA may not be ready for fall. The original plan was for three characters, including the one played by Ellis, to be introduced in a planted spinoff episode of mothership FBI which was pushed a couple of times over casting delays until a decision was made not to proceed with it. While the writers room is up and running, I hear there may not be finished scripts approved for production, and there have been no additional castings on the series since the initial pickup announcement that included Ellis. With Leight at the helm, the series is expected to forge ahead, and casting is set to begin shortly for an early fall production start. It is unclear whether the project's original concept about two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent who believes in the rule of law — will be tweaked. Eriq La Salle remains attached to direct and executive produce the pilot episode. It is unclear whether Watson, from Kapital Entertainment and CBS Studios, will replace CIA on the fall schedule, taking over the post-FBI Monday 10 PM time slot, or whether the network will make scheduling changes. That will be revealed shortly when CBS announces fall premiere dates. The move to fall will give Watson, which launched with a 13-episode run earlier this year, a typical air pattern. New scripted broadcast series launching in midseason usually return in the fall (unless it is designed for a limited-run seasons, which Watson, starring Morris Chestnut, is not) because a midseason run is not considered long enough to get a new series fully established, and a long gap after the short initial may hut its longevity prospects. Leight served as Law & Order: SVU executive producer/showrunner from 2011–2016 and 2019–2022. He also worked on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country star and former “American Idol” winner Scotty McCreery is coming to grips with a doubly difficult loss, sharing with fans on July 10, 2025, that both of his grandmas had died the previous day. McCreery's paternal Grandma Paquita was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where she met her future husband, McCreery's grandpa, when he was stationed there in the U.S. Air Force, according to The Boot. “Both of them truly taught me what love is all about,” the country star wrote. If yall could keep my family in your prayers I'd appreciate it.” McCreery's mom Judy shared a Facebook post on July 10 confirming her mother and mother-in-law's deaths, writing, “Here is a post I hoped I wouldn't be making for several years. My precious mom, age 85, passed away yesterday at WakeMed, shortly after 1pm. She had been battling norovirus & the flu, which led to dehydration and pneumonia. She then continued, “This is hard to fathom, but we also lost Mike's mom, Paquita, yesterday, a few hours later at 4pm. We will celebrate my mom's life in her hometown next Monday. Fans and friends flooded McCreery's post with supportive messages, including several of his fellow “American Idol” contestants from season 10 in 2011. Country star Lauren Alaina, with whom he became close friends on “American Idol” and was his runner-up, left a comment that hundreds of fans liked, which said, “Sending so much love and prayer your way.” Hailey Reinhart, another success story who emerged from season 10, wrote, “Sending love to you & your families, Scotty 💓” Season 10 finalist James Durbin chimed in, “All of my love to you and your family, Scotty. Fans were stunned by McCreery's double loss, including one who wrote, “I'm heartbroken for you and your families…. I have no words for losing both grandmothers in one day. Another wrote, “Oh my gosh so sorry losing both Grandma's on the same day is just unbelievable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may as well be chilling by the fire while we eatin' fondue, because Justin Bieber‘s Swag is here. Released at midnight Friday (July 11) — just a few hours after the pop star announced its existence — Bieber's seventh studio album features 21 new songs. The singer first unveiled the tracklist in a video of a black-and-white billboard shared on his Instagram without explanation, revealing the titles “All I Can Take,” “Daisies,” “Yukon,” “Go Baby,” “Things You Do,” “Butterflies,” “Way It Is,” “First Place,” “Soulful,” “Walking Away,” “Glory Voice Memo,” “Devotion,” “Dadz Love,” “Therapy Session,” “Sweet Spot,” “405,” “Swag,” “Zuma House,” “Too Long” and “Forgiveness.” When the album arrived, it featured an additional track: “Standing on Business,” featuring an audio sample of Bieber's own meme-fueling viral exchange with paparazzi in June. The project marks Bieber's first full-length since 2021's Justice, which spent two weeks at No. He's also become a father since he last dropped an album, welcoming baby boy Jack Blues with wife Hailey Bieber last August. For years, it was unclear whether Bieber would ever release another album as the star took a large step back from performing. In 2022, he announced that he'd been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a condition that caused half of his face to be temporarily paralyzed. In the months leading up to Swag, however, he repeatedly teased that he was back to making music by sharing photos of himself in the studio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the worst behind AMC Theatres and its beleaguered stock price? Reese argued in a July 11 investor note AMC “is poised to benefit from a more consistent release slate over the next several quarters,” and gain market share through to 2026 in North America and Europe. That good news for a company attempting to get out of a financial hole brought on by the pandemic lifted parent AMC Entertainment Holdings shares by 30 cents, or 10 percent, to $3.30 on Friday morning. AMC Theatres Strikes Deals to Resolve Litigation, Boost Balance Sheet, Touts Box Office Outlook AMC as a meme stock in the past has been decidedly volatile as the exhibition giant burned through cash to maintain operations and raised fresh financing from new stock sales. On July 1, AMC announced an agreement with key creditors, debt holders and other lenders that offered more financial flexibility, resolved key litigation and allow the company to focus on box office upside. “To be clear, we do not see substantial growth in 2025, 2026, or beyond. The Wall Street analyst sees small mercies for exhibitors in the major studios committing to theatrical releases after uncertainty brought on by pandemic-era theater closures and a shift of Hollywood titles to emerging streaming platforms. “We think that post-SAG-AFTRA strike in 2023/2024, studios collectively created a compelling, genre-balanced 2025 – 2026, which we believe will drive audiences to theaters regardless of economic turmoil,” Reese wrote in her note. Now all Hollywood has to do is deliver box office winners — whether comic book reboots or arthouse standouts from Paul Thomas Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos — that more consistently draw consumers to theaters, however much recession worries overhang the wider economy. “The theater business has historically been resilient in recessions, with attendance driven by content quality and viewed as a relatively inexpensive escape from reality. As such, at this juncture, we are more concerned about content quality than with overarching economic pressure on attendance,” the Wedbush note stated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers from Poker Face's season-two finale.] Patti Harrison isn't afraid to dial up the humor (as you will find out towards the end of this interview). If her performance in various I Think You Should Leave sketches is any indication, she thrives on playing ludicrous, over-the-top people (seen also in Hulu's Shrill). Now, as she did in 2021's Together, Together, Harrison takes an interesting swerve on Poker Face with her performance as an unassuming woman. Harrison makes her season two debut in “A New Lease On Death” as Alex, who quickly befriends bullshit detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne). Nobody,” she smoothly tells her new pal at one point. Halfway through “The End Of The Road,” Alex reveals herself as a ruthless assassin who tricked Charlie into taking her to a target in Indiana. This is devastating for Charlie, who's left friendless once more. Instead, she gains a sociopathic nemesis who is well and truly obsessed with her, Moriarty-style. (Alex went as far as controlling her breathing technique so she wouldn't be caught in a lie, now that's commitment.) Club spoke to Harrison about what made this role particularly challenging, her tricks for playing a nefarious villain, and, as the conversation winds down, she displays those aforementioned comical skills in her answers. Club: How did you feel about taking Alex from an amusing sidekick to this evil big bad? What did you want to achieve with this switch as an actor primarily known for comedy? I knew the twist beforehand, but I love to imagine what the experience would've been like on day 11 of playing this character if they said to me that she goes from telling Charlie “Oh, here's a coffee” to “Sit in the chair, bitch” and “I'm going to drive you off a cliff.” Hopefully, watching [the reveal] is like a surprise party, and you feel the same chemical reaction happening in your brain. When they filled me in on the details, it truly was the most excited I've ever been for a role because I've always wanted to do an action movie, stunts, combat stuff, and use weapons. Coming into it with this story, we had a lot of meetings. [Season two showrunner] Tony Tost, who is an angel, really helped to guide me tonally. I love Poker Face‘s comedy, but I didn't want to dishonor the stakes that were being built by this moment when the turn happens. I wanted it to feel evil in the sense that, when all is said and done, Charlie is a deeply wounded and traumatized person with no sense of security in her life. The show is about resilience and resourcefulness in the face of her loneliness, considering she's subjected to people who are trying to kill her. I wanted this moment to feel like a death knell of “Oh my gosh, I can't trust anybody.” Imagine what would happen to her brain after that. I didn't want it to feel silly, yet all of us were determined to keep Alex as an interesting, fun character. Tony, Natasha, and everyone were constantly checking in with me to see how I was doing. We were also having in-depth conversations about what my voice would be like in the finale and how it would juxtapose against how Alex talked. AVC: What were those conversations like about modifying your voice? Was it daunting as a performer to navigate these specific qualities of the character? PH: Well, as you can hear from my actual speaking voice, it's pretty low, kind of chainsaw, cigar smoker-esque, and it's not that I smoke. But it gives me this “sexy woman in her 90s” voice, which is different than Alex's voice, as you can also hear. When I thought of what would be impactful for Charlie, Alex felt like a super earnest character. I come from a pretty sarcastic family that uses dark humor to cope with stuff. Being around her helped me become more gentle. So I thought, for me, it would be the most painful to find out that she was the person using me. My acting coach throughout the process, Michael Warner, was constantly there to help and make it feel fun and real for the story. It helps me take the performance where I need it to go because the details of her life are so absurd. The things that she's done, there is a version of it that we could have done, where it's very silly and caricature-like of a catty assassin. I was definitely having fun with the creative liberties I got, but there was a lot of attention towards how to bring these aspects of her to life without tipping over into caricature, and how we honor the betrayal emotionally. She has to do so much emotional lifting in those final beats where her character is being traumatized in real time. So to get to wear a knife holster on my arm and feel the weight of that, wear the driving gloves and fucking Louboutin combat boots made me want to do a flip, wrap my legs around someone's head, and then flip backwards and slam their head on the ground. AVC: In an alternate universe, would you have liked to continue playing Alex as Charlie's friend and gotten the chance to develop that character and dynamic? I think even if she stayed friends with Alex, who didn't turn out to be evil, she would have inevitably, kind of accidentally gotten her to sign up for a weird pyramid scheme or something where they would lose all their money. I think she would be in a life of pain in a different way with Alex, and would be annoyed to death. AVC: Now that you've tried your hand at playing a sociopath, do you have definitive tips and tricks for getting it right as a performer? PH: [Laughs] I would just say to act like who you are on the inside and not who you are when you're saying hi to your friends, talking on the phone with your family, or talking to your partner. Be the person who, when you're standing on a platform waiting for the train or in a grocery store, when someone gets in front of you in line, there's that voice saying “Bury him” or something. AVC: The comparison to Moriarty is inevitable because he was obsessed with Sherlock in a way your character is with Charlie. PH: I don't know what the hell that is. They told me I was going to be like Moriarty, and I was like, “Who the fuck is that? We are setting you up to go from Watson to Moriarty.” We got in a huge fight about it that day. I remember I had to wear a brace on my wrist because Tony picked me up and threw me through my trailer window, and then I came through the other green room trailer, the makeup trailer, and then just got in a huge fight with everyone there. AVC: Now that sounds like it would make a good movie. We live in a society that teaches us to capitalize on every story, and some of these stories are just for us and our friends who experience them, and I think that's a beautiful thing. AVC: Have you talked to Rian Johnson about returning for season three as Charlie's ultimate nemesis since your character survived that car crash? PH: You know, I can't say because as I'm talking to you right now, there is a representative from Peacock who has an anti-tank rifle pointed at me and there's a red dot laser right at my throat, which is such a strange, painful place to do it if you're going to kill me. All I can say is you'll have to keep an eye out in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story is being published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy. Major retirement systems in blue states — where many governors and attorneys general are fighting hard to counter extreme and likely illegal actions by the Trump administration — have invested billions of dollars in some of the biggest corporate supporters of those actions, a review by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has found. He's closed Department of Health and Human Services regional offices in states where he lost the last election, attacked “state overreach” on climate mitigation policies he opposes, and threatened to withhold federal funds from universities located in Democratic-led states that voted against him in 2024. Trump has made no effort to hide his campaign of retribution, posting to Truth Social after June's “No Kings” protests across the country that he intended to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York… and other such Cities, [which] are the core of the Democrat Power Center.” Blue state attorneys general have responded with more than 30 lawsuits against the Trump administration's unconstitutional moves. The investments made by pension funds are made with limited input from the public sector workers that contribute to them — a fact that labor experts believe is a major problem for corporate accountability. Many public sector workers have protested and urged their pension funds to divest from Tesla in recent months as Elon Musk-backed cuts have wreaked havoc in communities across the country. Tesla CEO Elon Musk pumped $290 million into helping elect Trump and Republicans last year, spending far more on the election than any other billionaire donor. Investors have raised concerns about Tesla's lofty valuations in the aftermath of his public split with Trump. Valor Equity is run by Musk's friend and private equity manager Antonio Gracias, who has worked with DOGE in an attempt to dig up evidence of voting by immigrants through controversial access to once private Social Security data. Valor Equity manages billions of dollars for blue state pension funds — while also investing in Musk company SpaceX and the drone maker Anduril, which hope to be awarded contracts to help build Trump's proposed $830-billion, Israel-inspired Golden Dome missile defense shield. The recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” included a provision that mandated that federal funding for border surveillance towers go to companies with the exact specifications provided by Anduril. Every Dirty Gift Trump's Big Bill Gives the Fossil Fuel Industry Valor Equity has also invested in xAI, which owns Musk's platform X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 8, controversy emerged as Grok, xAI's AI chatbot integrated with X, began spouting pro-Hitler propaganda. California, Illinois, and New York retirement systems have $1.3 billion invested in Valor Equity funds. The tech company was also awarded an additional $795 million Defense Department contract in May, and has received a new $30 million contract from ICE to more closely track immigrants in the U.S. In total, the pension funds surveyed have $745 million invested with Palantir. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, a designer and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who became a “close friend” of Musk's and still owns a seven percent stake in his vacation and short-term rental firm, has been heavily involved with DOGE since the beginning and now hopes to replace Musk in leading the department's ongoing effort to slash the federal workforce. The 43-year-old billionaire also sits on Tesla's board and was a longtime Democratic donor before voting for Trump in 2024. “This is a unique moment in our company's history,” he said. GEO Group is being sued for illegal labor trafficking related to work performed by immigrant detainees, and major concerns have been raised about conditions inside of GEO facilities. The CEO of the private prison firm CoreCivic stated on a recent earnings call, “Our team has always been mission and outcomes-focused, but this is such a significant moment of time in our company's history. The firm recently received a no-bid contract to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Kansas that had been effectively shuttered by Biden administration policies, after donating $500,000 to the Trump inaugural committee. Stocks in both GEO Group and CoreCivic have soared following passage of Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will pump another $45 billion into immigration detention capacity and transportation over the next few years. The Illinois Municipal and New York State Teachers' funds have $8.4 million in CoreCivic holdings. In January, Europe's largest pension, the Dutch ABP fund, divested from Tesla, as well as from Meta and Alphabet, over environmental, social, and governance concerns. In October, the Norwegian asset manager Storebrand announced its intentions to sell Palantir stock due to their concerns that its practices violate human rights law. Tesla's client base is Democrats, people who care about the environment. [So] all fiduciaries should be looking at this — at the very least telling active managers to not invest in Tesla… until [the company] makes some changes,” including agreeing to a neutrality agreement with labor unions. (Given Musk's ongoing feud with Trump, he may well alienate Republican customers, too.) The typical defense from public pension fund managers who are held to account for investments considered contrary to the public interest is that they have a fiduciary duty to pensioners that trumps all other concerns, and that this obligation includes diversification. “Public pension funds are not governed by any federal fiduciary standard, and [there are] scant state standards, which means that any argument can be made that a particular investment is consistent with or violates fiduciary duties.” Forty years ago, pension funds were far more conservative, investing the bulk of their capital only in stocks and bonds. Yet the types of risky investments being made today — namely private equity, in which the 10 largest U.S. pension funds have invested over $300 billion, and which are subject to losing all of their value — continue to pass fiduciary muster at most pension funds, even those with managers who have fiercely rejected arguments in favor of divestment. Siedle points out that there is extremely little public information about this enormous sum of money pumped into the industry. “The private equity industry has successfully gone city by city, and state by state, arguing that their offering documents are proprietary and contain trade secrets,” excluding them from public records laws, meaning that the public lacks critical information about this increasingly influential industry. What are the barriers to pension funds divesting from pro-Trump companies? Mike McCarthy, a professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz who studies the labor movement and pension funds, noted the “tremendous lack of democracy in these funds,” adding: “There's a lack of any oversight from workers about how these funds are invested.” McCarthy pointed to a $34-billion Dutch pension fund for retail sector workers that has a far more robust process for engaging its members and beneficiaries in investment practices than do most American pension funds. A randomly selected group of participants chose to invest more in social good and public housing. “There was an explicit recognition in these recommendations that [beneficiaries would] be willing to give up a certain return on investment,” McCarthy said. “We just don't have that [kind of process] here.” Deftones Announce First Album in Five Years, Drop New Song Some of these unions have been outspoken, but others have historically been more reticent to criticize the investment strategy of their public pension fund managers. “I think public sector unions should demand control over their investments,” said McCarthy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 16-track LP includes collaborations with Travis Scott, Shaboozey, Mick Jagger & Stromae. The 16-track project includes previously released singles “Bundle by Bundle,” “Update,” “Sweet Love,” “TaTaTa” (featuring Travis Scott) and “Change Your Mind” (featuring Shaboozey). No Sign of Weakness also includes more collaborations too, with Mick Jagger (“Empty Chairs”) and Stromae (“Pardon”). “It's extrospective,” he told Billboard France in his recent cover story. “It's not just about me but about looking outward, reflecting on the world, and how my experiences connect to the bigger picture. It's about growth, understanding, and challenging perceptions while staying true to who I am.” The 17-date trek will also go through major cities including Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta before wrapping up with two dates at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, on Dec. 17 and 18. No Sign of Weakness arrives two years after his last album I Told Them…., which was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Its hit singles “City Boys” and “Sittin' On Top of the World” (featuring 21 Savage on the remix) also scored Grammy nominations that year, for best African music performance and best melodic rap performance, respectively.
