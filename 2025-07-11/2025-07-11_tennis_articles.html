                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic exited a Grand Slam at the semifinal stage for the third time this season, falling short against Jannik Sinner once more. Looking for revenge at SW19, it wasn't to be as Sinner defeated Djokovic in straight sets once again, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. At 38 years of age, it's hard to imagine Djokovic will be around for much longer, although one former WTA star doesn't think this is the last we will see of him at the All England Club. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match, Robson compared Djokovic's exit from Centre Court to his exit from Court Philippe Chatrier in June. “I would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on Centre Court,” he said. I'm planning to come back, definitely at least one more time.” Djokovic will be 39 at Wimbledon in 2026, two years older than Ken Rosewall was at the 1972 Australian Open when he became the oldest player to win a Grand Slam title (37 years, 2 months), a record that stands to this day. The Serb will need to find something from somewhere if he wants to avoid another defeat in 2026, as he looked some way off his younger rival in this year's semifinal. Briefly showing signs of life in the third, Djokovic led 3-0, but won just one more game, as Sinner came through to win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. “Yeah, it was a bit unfortunate, it looked like the damage had been done by two blistering sets by [Jannik] Sinner,” he said. “Novak [Djokovic] struggled after that, but incredible the standard of tennis that Sinner brought out in the first two sets, just an hour wasn't it, it was something else, full credit to him. Winning just 17% of his points behind his second serve to Sinner's 71%, Djokovic never really stood a chance of beating the world number one. There's still work to be done for Sinner in London, however, as he now prepares to take on Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. Sinner and Alcaraz will battle it out for the 2025 Wimbledon title on Sunday, July 13.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By reaching the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have achieved something that only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had previously done in the Open Era. Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship besides Federer and Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008. Nadal lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires in all three years, adding to his eventual count of 14 trophies at the clay-court major. In 2008, Nadal earned the crown at both tournaments. Repeat Roland Garros & Wimbledon Finalists In Same Season (Open Era) Alcaraz carries the momentum of an unforgettable victory at Roland Garros, where he saved three championship points before stunning Sinner in a  five-set thriller. Sinner has advanced to four straight Grand Slam finals, having won last year's US Open and this year's Australian Open. The last time the same two men battled in consecutive major finals was at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2016, when Novak Djokovic defeated Andy Murray for two straight Slam titles. This will be their second clash in a Grand Slam final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 Carlos Alcaraz will face each other for the 2025 Wimbledon men's championship after both won their semifinal matches on Friday. Going into Friday's matchup, there was some question as to whether Djokovic hurt himself on a fall late in his quarterfinal match with Flavio Cobelli on Wednesday. Djokovic canceled his Thursday practice, which raised further concerns. Djokovic appeared to recover after a medical timeout between the second and third sets and took a 3-0 lead. But Sinner wasn't fazed, eventually breaking serve and taking back control from a clearly hobbled Djokovic. On several points, Djokovic couldn't even attempt to reach Sinner's returns, especially if it meant changing direction. In the earlier semifinal, Fritz provided a strong threat. The American played arguably the best match of his career, frequently overpowering Alcaraz with his serve. The defending champion baffled Fritz with a variety of shots, feathering drop shots at the net and slicing backhands down the line to catch his opponent out of position. Fritz forced a tiebreaker in the final set, but Alcaraz never faltered. As he often demonstrates, he can raise his game as needed while the player on the other side hits a ceiling. Alcaraz has won the event the last two years, and will be looking for a third consecutive Wimbledon title Sunday against Sinner. Here is how Friday's men's semifinal matches played out in Yahoo Sports' live coverage:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka is expanding on her perspective following a tense moment Thursday in her women's semifinals loss to Amanda Anisimova at Wimbledon. “I just look at her and I just, for sure, she didn't hear me, but I was just like, ‘You don't want to say sorry?' but she just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match. It's on her,” said Sabalenka, who lost 4-6, 6-4, 4-6. "You don't want to say sorry?" Aryna Sabalenka wasn't thrilled with Amanda Anisimova's reaction to a contentious point during their #Wimbledon semi-final clash… pic.twitter.com/W368OIUFuJ “If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying, ‘Sorry for that tricky situation,' that's on her.” The lack of an apology appeared to irritate Sabalenka, 27, who also took exception to what she viewed as a premature celebration from Anisimova, 23. “But I was grateful and thankful that she said that because I was like, it actually helped me to keep fighting. Anisimova, who later clarified she wasn't celebrating, is now set to face Poland's Iga Swiatek in the ladies' singles final Saturday. “This doesn't feel real right now, honestly,” the American said post-match. The daughter of Russian immigrants, Anisimova took a break from tennis in 2023 amid mental health concerns and was ranked No. She reached the fourth round at the French Open earlier this summer, falling to Sabalenka in two sets. Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, reached the final at Roland Garros before losing to American Coco Gauff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic is a natural born winner. Using every weapon in his armoury and every advantage the rules of the game allow has got him to a staggering 24 Grand Slam titles, and put him in a position to hunt down a record-breaking 25th at the age of 38. World No.1 Jannik Sinner stands in his way, with the pair going head-to-head in a Wimbledon semi-final this afternoon. Although Sinner is only 23, it will be the third time they have met competitively at SW19, with Djokovic winning the two previous encounters. During their first Wimbledon showdown, in 2022, Djokovic came back from two sets down to break Sinner's heart. You can check out at any time. And he admitted after winning 5-7 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-2 that a lengthy toilet break partway through the match, and what he did during it, instigated the turnaround. "It's true - sometimes these things are necessary. I go through the same doubtful moments as anyone else. In the current landscape, players are only permitted to take one three-minute toilet break per match, and it must be taken at the end of a set. It remains to be seen whether that has any bearing on Djokovic and Sinner's 10th competitive meeting. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Djokovic rated his chances ahead of the clash, saying: "I don't think I'm a favourite against these guys [Carlos Alcaraz and Sinner] at the moment. But I probably have my best chance against them here. "If it comes down to me facing one or both of them, which I hope it does, as it would mean I have proceeded all the way to the final, then I'll obviously look for my best game to win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday's Wimbledon semifinal between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz saw two stoppages in the eighth game of the second set, due to spectators feeling unwell on Centre Court. Chair umpire Marijana Veljovic called a brief stoppage as stewards tended to an unwell spectator, shielding them with umbrellas. Three points later at 30-30, the players were forced to stop again, as another incident saw a spectator receive medical attention. Both instances took place to Fritz's left, with supporters sitting in a stand unshaded against the sun. Veljovic joined several officials in a discussion courtside, including tournament referee Denise Parnell, before restarting to play. Fritz went on to force an immediate break point, but Alcaraz saved it, and sealed the hold to continue a tightly contested second set which Fritz eventually won 7-5. There have been several incidents of play being stopped at this year's event. Both women's semifinals were interrupted Thursday — twice during Aryna Sabalenka's match against Amanda Anisimova — as stewards tended to the affected spectators. Sabalenka passed a bottle of water and an ice pack into the crowd. Alcaraz similarly offered a water bottle to a spectator during his first-round match against Fabio Fognini, while Fritz saw his third-round match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina paused several times due to similar issues in the stands.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, the 59-year old founder of Pershing Square Capital Management will suit up at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island, indulging his sports fantasy while making a mockery of the tournament and the ATP Challenger Tour where players strive to eke out a living. "I am playing the best tennis of my life," Ackman wrote last week on X, where he posts frequently about politics and is often far-too-eager to embrace ridiculous conspiracy theories. Including the idea that he belongs in a pro tennis event. He's a bit of a gadfly on tour, befriending several players and helping bankroll the Professional Tennis Players Association when it was launched in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. He says he practices nearly every day, seems to be in good shape for a 59-year old and, because of his access to top players, has found himself on the other side of the net from all-time greats like Roger Federer in informal hitting sessions. And still, there is no deeper story to what's happening in Newport this week other than exactly what it looks like: A wealthy tennis benefactor who started playing seriously a decade ago using his privilege to say he competed in a pro tour event. We can be honest about how gross that is – both in Ackman's desire to make it happen and the ATP's willingness to humor him. According to Ackman's social media posts, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios had proposed playing doubles together at one point, but ongoing injury issues delayed their partnership indefinitely. It's simply the privilege of being Bill Ackman. Even though entrants for every tournament on the ATP or Challenger Tour level must meet a rankings threshold or earn a spot through a qualifying event, every tournament reserves a handful of wildcards that can be given out at its discretion. The wildcard system isn't perfect and sometimes creates controversy, but in general they're used for reasonable purposes: An accomplished player who lost their ranking due to injury and is trying to come back, an up-and-coming star with local ties, a highly-ranked player who didn't enter initially but decided to play at the last minute. There's just one little issue: Sock, 32, is a pickleball player and podcaster now. His last professional tennis match was at the U.S. Open in 2023, and there is no indication that he's planning a comeback. Also interesting: In an interview with Front Office Sports last week, Ackman said he had never even met Sock but that they were going to begin practicing together last weekend. So Sock – out of the blue, apparently – requested a wildcard from Newport even though his tennis career has long been over. The tournament granted it, and Sock listed Ackman as his doubles partner. Which, again, the tournament allowed even though you can't find results on Ackman in any of the public tennis databases kept by the USTA or Universal Tennis Rating (UTR). One truly wonders – unless, of course, you know how the world works. But that's not how tennis is supposed to work. But this isn't a golf pro-am. And as long as we have pro sports, you'd like them to be played by professionals and not exist for the whims of potential benefactors who have a ton of money and a delusion about how good they are at playing tennis. It's a bad look, and it certainly doesn't help the image of a sport that does not necessarily deserve its country club reputation. The top two men's players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both emerged from middle class backgrounds. Djokovic grew up flat-out poor in a war-torn country. And even for those who had advantages like Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills, there's no faking it in tennis. You can't use your social media fame or friendships or wealth to buy your way onto the pro tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morgan Riddle the girlfriend of Taylor Fritz of the U.S. arrives to take her seat before her boyfriend plays Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a men's singles semifinal at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday, July 11, 2025. Taylor Fritz of the U.S. returns to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a men's singles semifinal at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Friday, July 11, 2025. LONDON (AP) — Morgan Riddle's effect on Wimbledon semifinalist Taylor Fritz's rise in the rankings has been significant. Riddle has been at the All England Club this year and others in her role as a fashion influencer, telling her hundreds of thousands of social media followers how tennis has become “the chicest sport in the world.” She's been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times' Style section. She was seated at Centre Court on Friday for her boyfriend Fritz's match against Carlos Alcaraz. Riddle frequently is at tournaments to cheer for him. They were featured in the Netflix tennis documentary “ Break Point.” Riddle, 27, is a Minnesota native who attended Wagner College in New York City. “By the end of my junior year, I had completed seven internships,” she said in a Wagner College video about the Class of 2019 member. “I would have to say she's been a big help to me, just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.” Riddle has worked with the All England Club to create video segments called “Wimbledon Threads.” Wearing brands such as Chanel and Jimmy Choo, she details trends like “tenniscore.” “‘Tenniscore' isn't just about pleated skirts and vintage polos. Riddle isn't afraid to throw a few zingers. “Of course we're here for the tennis but what was once a strictly sporting event has also turned into a global fashion spectacle. I know some of you may not want to hear that but just because the fact annoys you, doesn't make it any less true,” she said. That segment has 12,300 views as of Friday — a different Wimbledon video featuring a kid asking Aryna Sabalenka about pancakes has more than double that. Riddle's clips on TikTok, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, are more popular. Fritz often takes photos of her to post on social media. “I've definitely gotten a lot better over the last couple of years but very reluctantly,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press last year.</p>

You're not going to see a Roland-Garros press conference,” Sabalenka said on Thursday when she arrived for her question-and-answer session after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4 4-6 6-4 at Centre Court. “So anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now.” “I just don't want to face that hate again. We all can lose control over our emotions. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option,” the 27-year-old said. Talking about Anisimova, Sabalenka said that her opponent played a brave brand of tennis. Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But that doesn't begin to explain this highly unlikely pairing in Saturday's Wimbledon final that will produce a first-time champion at the All England Club. 13 seed, was well outside the Top 400 early last year and wound up losing in the last round of qualifying at Wimbledon. And now a few days from her first visit to the PIF WTA Rankings Top 10, she's into the first Grand Slam final of her career. 8 Iga Swiatek hasn't won a tournament since collecting her fourth Roland Garros title last spring. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a match that ran more than two-and-a-half hours. The early rounds of Grand Slams are littered with first-time matchups, but this is only the third Wimbledon final of the Open Era featuring two players who have never met at the Hologic WTA Tour -- which makes this one so intriguing. Who's going to take the crown this year? But here are a few significant precedents to consider. Swiatek, at 24 years and 30 days, is the youngest woman to reach: “Tennis keeps surprising me,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “Honestly, I never even dreamed it would be possible to play in the final.” Sensational Swiatek strikes on Centre Court ✨Iga Swiatek produces a remarkable performance against Belinda Bencic to win 6-2, 6-0 and reach her first #Wimbledon final 👏A defiant semi-final showing from the No.8 seed 👊 pic.twitter.com/NGGOI62uIk Because she was so absorbed in winning those four titles in five years at Roland Garros (and all the commitments that entails), she came into the grass-court season understandably depleted. “Honestly, I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practice,” Swiatek said. Her fabulous forehand and footwork play well on grass and, at the urging of coach Wim Fissette, Swiatek is being more aggressive with her serve and, rather than settling in to defend long points, looking to end them after two or three shots. Swiatek has won 78 percent of her first-serve points, the best mark of any player that got past the first round. With a significant edge in her ability to cover the court, Swiatek will lean into that aggressive mindset against Anisimova. And there's this: Swiatek has won all five of the major finals she's played. A sixth would mark her 100th match-win in Grand Slams, a fitting milestone on the surface she wondered if she'd ever conquer. A similar scenario was in play in the semifinals, when Anisimova had a break-point opportunity for a 5-1 lead in the third before Sabalenka got it back on serve at 4-5. With a screaming forehand winner, Anisimova converted her fourth match point. "It's been such a privilege to compete here." “In the third set I knew that I was going to really have to go for it,” Anisimova told reporters. In 2025, Anisimova has won 28 straight matches when she takes the first set. She passed the ultimate test against Sabalenka, who had come back to win 11 of 13 matches this year when she dropped the first set. "The moment of this young woman's life" 👏Amanda Anisimova completes an extraordinary semi-final to defeat No.1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 and book her spot in her first ever #Wimbledon final 💥Take. Anisimova's backhand is her biggest strength, but on Thursday she took good care of her second serve, winning 24 of those 40 points -- the biggest statistical disparity in the match. She also saved an impressive 11 of 14 break points. It's been quite a journey for Anisimova, who walked away from tennis halfway through the 2023 season. “When I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game,” Anisimova said. Six years later, she notched her second against Sabalenka. She's playing with the joy and fearlessness of that long-ago 17-year-old, who now knows what she didn't know before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a 'hate relationship' with Wimbledon after to failing to win her third semi-final on Centre Court on Thursday afternoon. Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a choppy ongoing relationship with Wimbledon The world No1 was defeated across three tight sets by American star Amanda Anisimova In a challenging press conference after the match, Sabalenka tried to balance her good humour with bitter disappointment 'Then I was banned from playing (due to her nationality, in 2022). So I have really more of a hate relationship right now with Wimbledon, but I really hope that one day I will, yeah, turn it around and have love relationship. 'Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it. On-court in the final stages of the match, Sabalenka had crashed her racquet into her head briefly, but avoided a major fine by refusing to take her anger out on the grass. 'We all can lose control over our emotions,' Sabalenka continued. I don't know... yelling, screaming, smashing the racquets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option, and it's not going to help me to stay in the match and to fight for my dream. 'Even right now I took a bit more time before doing my media just so I can be Aryna, not that crazy person that been on that media day at Roland-Garros.' But Sabalenka was keen the manage her sadness in light of the backlash she received after losing to Coco Gauff in Paris Sabalenka's reference to the French Open final came after the US Open champion found herself at the centre of a media firestorm after she was accused of failing to acknowledge her opponent Coco Gauff's achievements in winning in Paris. But as much as Sabalenka was able to keep her emotions in check to a degree, she could not fully extinguish her trademark competitive fire. Sabalenka had declared that she was 'p****d off' by Anisimova for two of her celebrations on court during the tight match. Anisimova reportedly implied that was something that Sabalenka had done in the past, adding to the charged atmosphere. Then she kind of p****d me off saying that, "oh, that's what she does all the time." But Anisimova (top) celebrated after winning the point, leaving Sabalenka (bottom) unamused A disgusted Sabalenka turned to her box before glaring at Anisimova and asking her why she didn't apologise. 'I just looked at her and, for sure, she didn't hear me, I was like "You don't want to say sorry? 'She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match. If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation, that's on her.' But after match point, the hostilities quickly ebbed away, with the pair hugging at the net and Anisimova paying tribute to her opponent in her own press conference. Anisimova and Sabalenka put the match behind them to share a hug at the net at its end Anisimova will now prepare for her first-ever Grand Slam final against Poland's Iga Swiatek 'This doesn't feel real right now,' said Anisimova. 'Aryna is such a tough competitor and I was absolutely dying out there. I don't know how I pulled it off, shes's an incredible competitor and an inspiration to me and to so many people. 'We have had so many tough battles and to come out on top and reach the final at Wimbledon is incredibly special.' The duo previously met as juniors in a Fed Cup (now known as the Junior Billie Jean King Cup) match-up between USA and Poland, with Swiatek taking the 2016 match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner have both had injury scares during the second week at Wimbledon The prospect of watching 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic take on world number one Jannik Sinner for a place in the Wimbledon final is a mouth-watering one, but fitness concerns remain before Friday's match. Sinner said he would be "100% fit" to face Djokovic, but the Serb has not been quite so definitive and cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday. Djokovic may have done likewise - but it does still cast some doubt over his fitness. 'You're not just a tennis player' - taking care of mental health Given his age, Djokovic accepts he has to work harder than 23-year-old Sinner or 22-year-old Wimbledon defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to keep up with them physically. Djokovic overcomes injury scare to wrap up victory over Cobolli Alcaraz will face Taylor Fritz in the first men's semi-final on Friday - but the American too had to take a medical timeout in his quarter-final win over Karen Khachanov. But Fritz, through to the last four at SW19 for the first time, allayed those fears after his victory, saying he just needed taping on his foot redone. "It's pretty common - a lot of players do this tape job so your foot doesn't get irritated," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She was derided for being the ultimate tennis “WAG” and accused of profiting from her boyfriend's successful career. But Morgan Riddle, the immaculately dressed girlfriend of Taylor Fritz who has graced Wimbledon with her fashion tips this past fortnight, is becoming something of a cult heroine in tennis. Not only that, she is being credited with elevating SW19's fashion game and attracting legions of younger fans to the sport. Ever since she was profiled in Netflix's Break Point series in 2023, the cameras have trailed the glamorous former model, who is known for her “tenniscore chic”, wherever she goes. She has been a regular face in Fritz's box and will be expected to make another dutiful appearance for his semi-final showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Friday, when the American fifth seed will need all the support he can get. In a savvy move, Wimbledon organisers snapped her up two summers ago to front a dedicated fashion blog called Wimbledon Threads – where she imparts sacred knowledge on the latest clothing trends and in-season outfits to don at the Championships. This year, it has proved a popular hit after the social media trend “Inspired by Moorgs” took off, which involves Riddle re-sharing photos of glam fans who have opted for her look. Radiating a picture-perfect vibe with her elegant outfits and flowing blonde locks, a cursory look at Riddle's social feeds would suggest she is an easy target for male attention. But how likely is it that these Riddle fangirls will become hardcore tennis aficionados? Clips compiled of Alcaraz and Sinner hitting all their different winners, for example – that's the sort of tennis that I interact with. Wimbledon's own social-media footprint has seen considerable growth across its channels this year – notably TikTok – with video clips of on-court action among the tournament's highest-performing content. “Everyone knows who Alcaraz is – it's the same with Coco Gauff, who has lots of brand recognisability behind her,” says Newman. “For me, that feels more genuine than following someone like Morgan Riddle. Rivalries are important – for people my age they missed out on the rivalry of the so-called ‘big three' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Still, Riddle's presence may be welcome given tennis is battling to stay relevant in light of the astronomical rise of padel – a racket sport popularised by a growing number of celebrities from Stormzy to David Beckham. This American has taken the definition of “WAG” – that horribly outdated term designated to sportsmen's wives and girlfriends – to a completely new stratosphere. This is Morgan Riddle's world and even if she might be dividing opinion, there are a lot of people living it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She was derided for being the ultimate tennis “WAG” and accused of profiting from her boyfriend's successful career. But Morgan Riddle, the immaculately dressed girlfriend of Taylor Fritz who has graced Wimbledon with her fashion tips this past fortnight, is becoming something of a cult heroine in tennis. Not only that, she is being credited with elevating SW19's fashion game and attracting legions of younger fans to the sport. Ever since she was profiled in Netflix's Break Point series in 2023, the cameras have trailed the glamorous former model, who is known for her “tenniscore chic”, wherever she goes. She has been a regular face in Fritz's box and will be expected to make another dutiful appearance for his semi-final showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Friday, when the American fifth seed will need all the support he can get. In a savvy move, Wimbledon organisers snapped her up two summers ago to front a dedicated fashion blog called Wimbledon Threads – where she imparts sacred knowledge on the latest clothing trends and in-season outfits to don at the Championships. Wimbledon Threads with Morgan Riddle | Episode 1 https://t.co/AkbSOeQlbR The late Lt. Col. Frank Slade (Scent of a Woman, 1992) would likely call the show "Wimbledon Threads with Daphne" This year, it has proved a popular hit after the social media trend “Inspired by Moorgs” took off, which involves Riddle re-sharing photos of glam fans who have opted for her look. Radiating a picture-perfect vibe with her elegant outfits and flowing blonde locks, a cursory look at Riddle's social feeds would suggest she is an easy target for male attention. She has 600,000 followers and counting on TikTok, close to half a million on Instagram and an additional 80,000 on YouTube – with 18 to 24-year-old women reportedly making up around 80 per cent across all of her platforms. But how likely is it that these Riddle fangirls will become hardcore tennis aficionados? Clips compiled of Alcaraz and Sinner hitting all their different winners, for example – that's the sort of tennis that I interact with. Wimbledon's own social-media footprint has seen considerable growth across its channels this year – notably TikTok – with video clips of on-court action among the tournament's highest-performing content. “Everyone knows who Alcaraz is – it's the same with Coco Gauff, who has lots of brand recognisability behind her,” says Newman. “For me, that feels more genuine than following someone like Morgan Riddle. Rivalries are important – for people my age they missed out on the rivalry of the so-called ‘big three' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Still, Riddle's presence may be welcome given tennis is battling to stay relevant in light of the astronomical rise of padel – a racket sport popularised by a growing number of celebrities from Stormzy to David Beckham. This American has taken the definition of “WAG” – that horribly outdated term designated to sportsmen's wives and girlfriends – to a completely new stratosphere. This is Morgan Riddle's world and even if she might be dividing opinion, there are a lot of people living it.</p>
