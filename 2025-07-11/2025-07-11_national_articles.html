                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says migrants would need to know “how to run away from an alligator” to flee the new detention center he's visiting in a remote area of the Florida Everglades.

Environmental advocates and protesters at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on Tamiami Trail E, Ochopee, Fla., on Saturday, June 28, 2025, object to the “Alligator Alcatraz” being built at the facility. Detainees wave and spell out a rough SOS to a helicopter flying overhead, at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Krome Detention Center, Friday, July 4, 2025, in Miami. Toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste. Air conditioners that suddenly shut off in the tropical heat. Only days after President Donald Trump toured a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” these are some of the conditions described by people held inside. Attorneys, advocates, detainees and families are speaking out about the makeshift migrant detention center Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration raced to build on an isolated airstrip surrounded by swampland. “These are human beings who have inherent rights, and they have a right to dignity,” said immigration attorney Josephine Arroyo. “And they're violating a lot of their rights by putting them there.” A televised tour for Trump and DeSantis showed rows of chain-link cages, each containing dozens of bunkbeds, under large white tents. A group of Democratic lawmakers sued the DeSantis administration for access. The administration is allowing a site visit by state legislators and members of Congress on Saturday, July 12. Families and attorneys who spoke with The Associated Press relayed detainees' accounts of a place they say is unsanitary and lacks adequate medical care, pushing some into a state of extreme distress. Such conditions make other immigration detention centers where advocates and staff have warned of unsanitary confinements, medical neglect and a lack of food and water seem “advanced,” said immigration attorney Atara Eig. But among those locked inside the chain-link enclosures are people with no criminal records, and at least one teenage boy, attorneys told the AP. Immigration attorney Katie Blankenship described a concerning lack of medical care at the facility, relaying an account from a 35-year-old Cuban client who told his wife that detainees go days without a shower. “There are days when I don't know anything about him until the evening,” she said, describing waiting for his calls, interrupted every three minutes by an announcement that the conversation is being recorded. The detainees' attorneys say their due process rights are among numerous constitutional protections being denied. Blankenship is among the lawyers who have been refused access. After traveling to the remote facility and waiting for hours to speak with her clients, including a 15-year-old Mexican boy with no criminal charges, she was turned away by a security guard who told her to wait for a phone call in 48 hours that would notify her when she could return. “You have due process obligations, and this is a violation of it.” Arroyo's client, a 36-year-old Mexican man who came to the U.S. as a child, has been detained at the center since July 5 after being picked up for driving with a suspended license in Florida's Orange County. He's a beneficiary of the DACA program, created to protect young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and to provide them with work authorization. Blankenship's Cuban client paid a bond and was told he'd be freed on a criminal charge in Miami, only to be detained and transferred to the Everglades. Eig has been seeking the release of a client in his 50s with no criminal record and a stay of removal, meaning the government can't legally deport him while he appeals. But she hasn't been able to get a bond hearing. She's heard that an immigration court inside the Krome Detention Center in Miami “may be hearing cases” from the Everglades facility, but as of Friday, they were still waiting. “Jurisdiction remains an issue,” Eig said, adding “the issue of who's in charge over there is very concerning.” Report for America is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this photo provided by the National Park Service, smoke from wildfires settles over Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona on Friday, July 11, 2025. This image provided by Eddie Vallee and taken from the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona shows smoke over the park's North Rim on Thursday, July 10, 2025. JACOB LAKE, Ariz. (AP) — Visitors and staff at two national parks in the U.S. West have been evacuated because of wildfires. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (418 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed Thursday morning after lighting sparked blazes on both rims, the park said. The park is closed until further notice. The conditions there have been ripe for wildfire with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday. Firefighters saved the visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn. The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed Thursday because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby. The fire began Wednesday evening after a thunderstorm moved through the area, fire officials said. About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joelle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place.</p>

According to a safety director, three paint buckets filled to the brim with uranium ore were stored in the National Park's Museum Collections Building. The White Sage Fire, near Jacob Lake, prompted the National Park Service to evacuate all North Rim visitors "immediately" on Thursday night. As of Thursday night, the fire had burned about 1,000 acres and remains active with no containment, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The National Park Service ordered all North Rim Grand Canyon visitors to evacuate immediately. Officials on Friday advised hikers not to enter the Grand Canyon, noting there was extreme heat and wildfire smoke inside the canyon. The BLM said smoke was reported Wednesday night after a thunderstorm rolled through the White Sage area. Grand Canyon hikers were warned about extreme heat and smoke caused by the fire. Two single-engine air tankers based in Mesquite delivered fire retardant to assist with initial suppression efforts before dark, according to the report. Air attack arrived on scene Thursday and aircraft continued to support ground crews, officials said. A Complex Incident Management Team was ordered. The White Sage Fire has burned more than 1,000 acres near Jacob Lake. Highway 89A to Fredonia is closed in both directions at mile marker 595 due to the fire, with no estimated reopening time, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.

Baltimore Orioles fans received an interesting rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" before sweeping the New York Mets in a double-header on Thursday night, but apparently not everyone was impressed with the autotuned version. Dan Deacon, the Baltimore-based recording artist known for his "innovative electronic music," welcomed fans with just that before the Orioles took care of the Mets 3-1 in Game 1 and 7-3 in Game 2. "I think the Orioles have officially hit rock bottom," one person wrote in a post on X. New York Mets third baseman Ronny Mauricio (10) tags Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Jordan Westburg (11) out trying to reach third base during the fourth inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on July 10, 2025. The video of Deacon's performance received over 1.2 million views, and it left fans at home and in the stands a bit confused. "What's his claim to fame ?…it's not singing…," another added. Dan Deacon performs during Riot Fest at National Western Complex on September 2, 2016, in Denver, Colorado. But fans on Deacon's Instagram, which has over 47,000 followers, seemed to appreciate his unique performance. Baltimore Orioles' Jordan Westburg (11) celebrates with Ryan O'Hearn (32) after hitting a two-run home run during the second inning in the second baseball game of a double-header against the New York Mets, Thursday, July 10, 2025, in Baltimore. Jordan Westburg homered and drove in three runs while Alex Jackson doubled twice and scored two runs in his Baltimore debut to help the Orioles win for the fifth time in six games. Meanwhile, the Mets fell 1.5 games behind first-place Philadelphia in the NL East after sinking to 14-16 in interleague play. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

This handout photo from the U.S. Air Force shows the Modernized Enterprise Terminal sits inside a radome at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, Jan. 21, 2016. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian attack on an air base in Qatar that's key to the U.S. military likely hit a geodesic dome housing equipment used by the Americans for secure communications, satellite images analyzed Friday by The Associated Press show. The U.S. military and Qatar didn't respond to requests for comment over the damage, which so far hasn't been publicly acknowledged. The Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base outside of Doha, Qatar's capital, on June 23 came as a response to the American bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran — and provided the Islamic Republic a way to retaliate that quickly led to a ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump ending the 12-day Iran-Israel war. Trump also has said that Iran signaled when and how it would retaliate, allowing American and Qatari air defense to be ready for the attack, which briefly disrupted air travel in the Middle East, but otherwise didn't tip over into the regional war long feared by analysts. The U.S. Air Force's 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, which operates out of the base, announced in 2016 the installation of the $15 million piece of equipment, known as a modernized enterprise terminal. Photos show a satellite dish inside of the dome, known as a radome. Images taken June 25 and every day subsequently show the dome is gone, with some damage visible on a nearby building. It's possible a fragment or something else struck the dome, but given the destruction of the dome, it was likely an Iranian attack, possibly with a bomb-carrying drone given the limited visible damage to surrounding structures. The London-based satellite news channel Iran International first reported on the damage, citing satellite photos taken by a different provider. In the U.S., Trump described the Iranian attack as a “very weak response.” He had said that Tehran fired 14 missiles, with 13 intercepted and one being “set free” as it was going in a “nonthreatening” direction. “I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,” he wrote on his website Truth Social. After the attack, Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard insisted that the air base had been the “target of a destructive and powerful missile attack.” Iran's Supreme National Security Council also said that the base had been “smashed,” without offering any specific damage assessments. Potentially signaling that he knew the dome had been hit, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei separately said that the base's communications had been disconnected by the attack. “All equipment of the base was completely destroyed and now the U.S. command stream and connection from Al Udeid base to its other military bases have been completely cut,” said Ahmad Alamolhoda, a hard-line cleric. Nasser Karimi contributed to this report from Tehran, Iran.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's stunning Democratic Party primary victory in the nation's most populous city proved to be a gift for Republicans aiming to paint Democrats as extreme radicals. One of the latest examples comes from New Hampshire, in the high-profile 2026 race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Republican candidate and former Sen. Scott Brown went up this week with a digital ad that edits a picture of Rep. Chris Pappas, the Democratic candidate in the race, alongside photos of Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive rock star who backed Mamdani. A digital ad by Republican senate candidate in New Hampshire former Sen. Scott Brown edits together a photo of the Democratic candidate in the 2026 race, Rep. Chris Pappas, next to photos of Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Scott Brown Senate campaign) Responding, the Pappas campaign told Fox News that "Scott Brown is so desperate to make this election about anything other than the issues because he knows he embraces an agenda of higher costs and health care cuts that's deeply unpopular in New Hampshire." And Pappas campaign communications adviser Collin Gately added that "Chris is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress, and has a demonstrated record of working across the aisle to deliver results for New Hampshire." The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on Mamdani's leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after his victory that claimed, "the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare." Aiming to tie House Democrats to Mamdani, NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella argued that "every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him." No surprise - the Republican attacks have even come from President Donald Trump, who, since Mamdani's victory two weeks ago, has repeatedly claimed that the 33-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from the New York City borough of Queens is a "communist." Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic mayoral nomination and take a big step towards becoming the city's first Muslim mayor, is giving Republicans plenty of ammunition. He's proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5, and setting up government-run grocery stores. Also fueling the Republican attacks are recent news items that have gone viral. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December, when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his recent comments in a cable news interview that "I have many critiques of capitalism." New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is surrounded by supporters after a press conference with union leaders in New York City, on July 2, 2025. "Now, that entire effort is undercut by a socialist winning handily in a bellwether election to determine who's going to run America's largest city." "It's a messaging nightmare that's going to unfold in real time from now until the midterms," said Reed, who is a top political adviser to Brown. Veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News that "the primary challenge for Democrats regarding Mamdani's candidacy is not his policy approach. The challenge is his party identification as a democratic socialist." "If there's any doubt about the negative implications of adding the word socialist to Mamdani's party affiliation, one need only peruse the national coverage whose focus has been on his party and the absence of party leadership to rush to his defense or offer endorsements," Lesperance, the president of New England College, said. Now-Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani takes the stage at his primary election party, in New York City on June 24, 2025. They argue that there's a world of difference between heavily blue New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin, and some key battleground states and swing districts across the country. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee told reporters the day after Mamdani's victory that "I love New York, but it's a very liberal place and I don't know that you can necessarily apply that to the rest of the country." And veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo cautioned, "I wouldn't read too much into this." Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, argued that "Republicans are making too much out of this." Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons discuss President Donald Trump signing his 'big, beautiful bill' into law and the opening of 'Alligator Alcatraz.' EXCLUSIVE: Some individuals awaiting deportation at "Alligator Alcatraz" in Florida were convicted of serious crimes, according to new information from the Florida Attorney General's office. "The left-wing press continues to spend their time amplifying false reports, but the reality is that there are monsters awaiting deportation within Alligator Alcatraz far worse than the monsters lurking in the surrounding Everglades," Jeremy Redfern, communications director for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, said in a statement. "This group of murderers, rapists, and gang members are just a small sample of the deranged psychopaths that Florida is helping President Trump and his administration remove from our country," he continued. Lazaro Rodriguez Santana, a Cuban national, was convicted in Texas of sexual assault and failure to register as a sex offender. Honduran national Jose Fortin was convicted of second-degree murder in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Furthermore, authorities say Oscar "Satan" Sanchez of Honduras is an MS-13 gang member who faced convictions for resisting arrest, conspiracy to commit murder and assault in New York, as well as RICO offenses. Guatemalan national Luis Donald Corado was convicted of burglary, forced entry, and voyeurism in Miami. Specifically, Corado's case involved him looking into a woman's window, according to the Florida official's office. Venezuelan national Wilfredo Alberto Lazama-Garcia is wanted for murder and aggravated robbery in the South American country. He is presumed to be a "gotaway" in 2021 during the border crisis. President President Donald Trump tours a migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida, on July 1, 2025. He was arrested for "cutting the throat of an elderly woman" in Key Largo, Florida, and then lit her residence on fire with hopes of hiding the evidence. Later that night, he allegedly "threatened to kill" another woman via beheading. "It's known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz,' which is very appropriate, because I looked outside, and that's not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon," Trump said while touring the facility earlier this month. Beds are seen inside a migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, on July 1, 2025. Alligator Alcatraz opened earlier this month with fierce opposition from environmentalists, who oppose its location in the Everglades, as well as some Democrats, who have been critical of the Trump administration's immigration and deportation policies. "This proposed detention center isn't just cruel, it's environmentally catastrophic. This facility would desecrate ecologically critical wetlands, trample on Tribal sovereignty, and transform one of the world's most cherished ecosystems into a prison camp for political gain," Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a June 24 news release.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened Brazil with a crippling tariff of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter he sent to the country's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In the letter posted on Truth Social, Trump alleged Lula is undertaking a “Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” over charges against its right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, who has bragged about his closeness with Trump, is facing trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against Lula. Lula vowed to reciprocate if Trump follows through with his threat. “Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,” Lula said in a post on X. “Any measure to increase tariffs unilaterally will be responded to in light of Brazil's Law of Economic Reciprocity,” he added. This marks the first time in months another country has threatened to match Trump's tariff threat. Unlike the 21 other countries that have received letters from Trump this week, the US ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, meaning the US exported more goods to there than it imported from there. Top US exports to the South American country last year included aircraft and spacecraft, fuels, industrial machinery like nuclear reactors, and electrical equipment, according to US Census Bureau data. So a 50% Brazilian tariff on American goods could severely harm these industries. Imports from Brazil to the US have faced a minimum 10% tariff since Trump's announcement of “reciprocal” tariffs in April – the baseline rate he has applied to most goods from most countries during the 90-day negotiation period, which has now been extended to August 1. This is not the first time Trump has used the threat of tariffs to try to change other countries' domestic policy decisions. Earlier this year, he threatened 25% tariffs on Colombian exports that would grow to 50% if the country didn't accept deportees from the US. (Colombia ultimately accepted the deportees and avoided those tariffs.) Trump also imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China over the role he alleges they play in facilitating illegal migration to the US and enabling fentanyl to reach the country. But despite Trump's discontent with the Bolsonaro trial, he wrote that “there will be no Tariff if Brazil, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States.” Trump's made nearly identical offers in a slew of other letters he sent to heads of state this week. Other recipients of tariff letters on Wednesday included the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Moldova, Brunei, Algeria, Libya and Iraq, with rates going as high as 30% on goods they ship to the United States. The new tariffs go into effect August 1, pending negotiations. The rates Trump said would be imposed on goods from Sri Lanka, Moldova, Iraq and Libya were lower than those he announced in early April. The US and various trading partners have been negotiating new trade agreements since Trump announced so-called “reciprocal” tariffs back in April. In all the letters except the one sent to Brazil's Lula, Trump wrote that he takes particular issue with the trade deficits the United States runs with other nations, meaning America buys more goods from there compared to how much American businesses export to those countries. Trump also said the tariffs would be set in response to other policies that he deems are impeding American goods from being sold abroad. Trump has now sent 22 letters on tariff rates to heads of government this week, and more could still come. JPMorgan economists said in a note to clients on Wednesday titled “Another day, another step closer to Liberation Day” that the 50% tariff threat on Brazilian goods was “most surprising.” (“Liberation Day” refers to April 2, the day Trump held a Rose Garden event to announce “reciprocal” tariff rates.) “It is possible these tariffs will never be implemented, as some in the market are hoping for,” the economists said, referring to Trump's latest threats. ET was the initial deadline Trump set three months ago for countries to ink trade deals with the US or instantly face higher tariff rates. However, on Monday he extended that deadline to August 1. He and dozens of associates have been charged with attempting a coup d'état, which prosecutors allege involved a plan to potentially assassinate elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Trump late Wednesday also announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, as he had promised on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. The tariff announcement comes after Trump on February 25 signed an executive action requiring the Commerce Department to assess whether America's copper imports posed a national security risk. “I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT,” Trump said on Truth Social Wednesday. This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity.” America imports about half of the copper it uses, according to the London Stock Exchange, and most of it comes from China, Chile, Japan and Congo. Copper is a key ingredient in electrical wiring necessary semiconductors and a host of other key goods, including batteries and defense equipment. “America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry,” Trump said. Copper futures jumped 13.1% on Tuesday to settle at a record high $5.69 per pound. It was the biggest single-day increase on record going back to 1968. They fell a bit Wednesday but were up nearly 3% in late trading. “I've been surprised it's taken this long to get the copper tariff,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “There are three buckets of tariffs: new revenue, national security, forced policy change. But some analysts were skeptical that tariffs could quickly boost America's copper mining industry and reduce its reliance on foreign countries for the key metal. “The US remains structurally short on copper, importing over 50% of its needs—primarily from South America—with no clear path to improving that for years to come,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “A tariff-induced price premium risks making copper—and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure—materially more expensive.” While the US imported most of its refined copper from Chile, Canada and Peru last year, China is a major player in the copper trade. China has also been investing in copper mines in African countries, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, over the last few decades.

As Americans pushed west, we learned to work with the land. As a result, our nation's leaders have increasingly failed to enact durable, long-lasting, and balanced environmental policies. A subject matter that once transcended partisan politics and brought leaders from all sides together has seen little to no substantial progress in the modern political era. These years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach and neglect have left America's natural resources in crisis. We've seen glimmers of hope with overwhelming bipartisan support for conservation legislation — like the "Great American Outdoors Act." But issues with broad support nationwide remain trapped in partisan gridlock. Today, the National Park System is in $23 billion of debt. Unnecessarily stringent restrictions are stripping hunting and recreational access to public lands. Our nation's ecosystems and wildlife populations are in a state of disrepair. President Donald Trump is organizing a commission to protect our natural legacy. FILE: Glacier National Park is surrounded by chiseled valleys and peaks in the Rocky Mountains of Montana. Known for its rugged and breathtaking landscapes, Glacier was named a national park in 1910. We are dedicated to putting every American first by prioritizing conservation, restoring our lands and waters and protecting our nation's outdoor heritage. That is why President Donald Trump signed an executive order to "Make America Beautiful Again." This order is a monumental first step to restoring America's natural beauty through bold leadership, innovation and commonsense policies. The order establishes the Make America Beautiful Again Commission, which will give a politically diverse set of elected leaders, experts, nonprofits and other decision-makers with a wide variety of backgrounds a seat at the table. The commission will then submit a comprehensive strategy outlining recommended actions for achieving long-term conservation success. The Make America Beautiful Again Commission will bring federal and state officials, private sector leaders, conservation organizations and tribal governments together to develop policy strategies for conservation. The purpose of establishing this commission is to develop commonsense solutions and kick-start action that all Americans can agree is much needed and long overdue. Getting that job done requires bipartisan, inter-agency partnerships — bringing folks together to discuss their personal experiences and insights regarding environmental efforts, working to reach compromises and forming unlikely alliances around our shared love of nature. The US is home to 63 different national parks. FILE: Bison by the Midway Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park We understand that it is our duty to conserve our natural resources, to be good stewards of our land, and to create long-lasting policies that actually work for the environment, the economy and the American people. From sea to shining sea, the natural majesty of the United States of America must be protected and passed down to future generations. We are kickstarting the restoration of our country's conservation legacy with this executive order. But the real work starts now as we come together to do all that we can to preserve our natural beauty, conserve our natural resources and Make America Beautiful Again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this photo released Cambodia National Assembly, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, front right, sits together with his Minister of Economy and Finance Aun Pornmoniroth, front left, and others lawmaker during a session at the National Assembly, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Friday, July 11, 2025. PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodian lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment that would allow the government to draft legislation seeking to revoke the citizenship of anyone found guilty of conspiring with foreign nations to harm the national interest. The latest legal move by supporters of Prime Minister Hun Manet was viewed by critics as a way to suppress internal dissent and eliminate policital opponents of his administration and the ruling Cambodian People's Party. The change would apply to lifelong Cambodian citizens, people with dual citizenship in Cambodia and another nation and people from other countries who have been granted Cambodian citizenship. Some government critics and opposition politicians are known to have dual citizenship. Justice Minister Koeut Rith said government officials will urgently draft a bill to revoke the citizenship of any individual found guilty of treason or collaborating with foreign entities to seriously harm the interests of Cambodia and its people. He claimed some Cambodians have colluded with a foreign country to harm their nation's interests. The comment appeared to be a reference to a May 28 confrontation between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area on the border. Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office earlier this month pending an ethics investigation over a leaked phone call about the border dispute with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the influential former prime minister and father of Hun Manet. The leaked phone call set off political turmoil in Thailand as Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the conflict. The consitutional amendment in Cambodia comes after Hun Sen last week called for the Ministry of Justice to explore legal avenues in response to frequent government criticism by opposition figures. Speaking to villagers and government officials last week in northern Kampong Thom province, Hun Manet claimed that among nearly 200 United Nations member states, 150 countries have laws allowing citizenship revocation, including the United States. “No true patriot would ever plot with foreign powers to destroy their nation.” This has enabled the government's authoritarian practices to continue unchecked, such as its persecution of opposition leaders, activists and independent journalists,” Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in a statement. Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy was one of those named by Hun Sen as making comments detrimental to the nation. Rainsy for decades has been a harsh critic and one of the most popular opponents of the Cambodian People's Party, which fueled Hun Sen's rise to power. Rainsy has been in exile since 2016 to avoid serving prison sentences on defamation, treason and other charges, which his supporters consider politically motivated. Rainsy said recent comments by Hun Sen about the border dispute with Thailand were not patriotism but a personal and political reaction rooted in fear and panic over the potential collapse of a regime deeply entangled with international criminal networks. “Hun Sen's anti Thai rhetoric is nothing more than a political smokescreen. While he presents the dispute as one of historical grievance and national dignity, the real motive behind his indignation is Thailand's concerted effort to dismantle Chines-run cyber-scam operations based in border areas — operations that have become a vital source of illicit funding for the current Phnom Penh regime,” Rainsy said in a June 28 online post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawyers for pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for being arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside his apartment in New York City and subsequently detained at a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil's lawsuit is for $20 million in damages, claiming he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted, and had his reputation tarnished due to unsubstantiated claims against him of antisemitism, among other things, the Washington Post reported. Khalil expressed anger over being arrested in March, citing an excessive amount of emotional pain over the events that transpired. “I cannot describe the pain of that night,” Khalil said. In June, a federal judge ordered Khalil to be released from the detention facility. Moreover, he said he wanted to show the administration could be held accountable for its actions, the Washington Post reported. “Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.” Despite the significant amount specified in the lawsuit, Khalil said he would abandon his quest for restitution if he received an apology from the Trump administration and it decided to implement changes to its illegal immigration enforcement policies, according to the Washington Post. If no apology was offered, and he won his case, Khalil said he would split any settlement funds he received with other people who were “targeted” by the Trump administration for pro-Palestinian beliefs. “My beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,” said Khalil.</p>

Many American schoolchildren grow up learning that Yellowstone was the world's first national park. Like many things in Mongolia, that mountain has a connection to Chinggis Khan (also known as Genghis Khan), who founded the Mongol empire in the 1200s and whose name and likeness are ubiquitous in present-day Mongolia. The Terelj River carves a path through dense patches of pine, birch and aspen trees. As a result of the park's long-standing respected status, many native plants and animals have flourished, protected from hunting and farming. Visitors should also be on the lookout for eagles, vultures, marmots and wild boars. The mountain of Bogd Khan Uul “is sacred and symbolic for all the Mongols,” says Saruul-Erdene Myagmar, an Ulaanbaatar native who is a Mongolia specialist at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. Bogd means “saint” in Mongolian, and “uul” is mountain, while Khan is a ceremonial title given to rulers. And what about the claim that Bogd Khan Uul is older than Yellowstone? Meanwhile, Yellowstone, which stretches across parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, was established in 1872. The Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve, established in 1776, also has a claim to being the world's oldest protected area. That has a lot to do with Mongolia's location — this cold, landlocked country wedged between China and Russia has not seen many international visitors. Mongolia is investing heavily in tourism and hopes the industry can grow to contribute 10% to its economy by 2030. Related article This remote eco-lodge offers travelers a rare opportunity to experience Mongolia's Gobi For Mongolians like Myagmar, the mountain's significance is not just about whether it really is the world's oldest national park or not. Very ancient belief is that all the mountains and rivers have their own owner. “Bogd Uul's owner is this white old man. If we offend this owner, then all sorts of bad things will happen.” At the park, it's considered bad manners, if not downright bad luck, to leave behind trash, use the bathroom outside of designated areas or interfere with an ovoo. Many travelers staying in the city center combine a visit to the national park with a stop at Zaisan Hill, home to a monument of the same name. This dramatic Brutalist memorial has colorful murals on the inside and is dedicated to Soviet and Mongolian soldiers killed during World War II. However, this largely depends on the sky conditions that day — the air in “UB,” as locals call it, can be very hazy. There are trails that range from easy to difficult, all well marked. Once a Buddhist stronghold and home to many monks, Manzushir was destroyed in 1937 by local communists who had joined forces with the Soviet occupiers of the country. Still, the ruins and remaining religious objects are well looked after by residents, especially as the current government is encouraging Mongolian pride and identity. Most foreign tourists opt for day hikes in Bogd Khan Uul, but those who want to stay the night have a few options with local companies that operate camps of gers, the traditional round Mongolian tents. These camps are rustic and have only basic amenities, but they provide a rare chance to experience the exceptional peace and quiet while stargazing and — for much of the year  — watching the snow fall. Although Bogd Khan Uul is only about 10 miles south of central Ulaanbaatar, the city's notoriously congested traffic means it can take up to an hour to get to the park at peak times of day. Your best bet is to go there on a weekday just after morning rush hour, giving you plenty of daylight for exploring. Public transit is limited in Ulaanbaatar — there is no subway system, so people either use buses or their own cars to get around. Taxis are generally not labeled — most people simply stand on the side of the road with their hand out and wait for one to pull up. There is an available taxi app, called UBCab app, that offers English functionality, but you'll need cash to pay if you don't have a Mongolian bank account. Related article One of Mongolia's best-kept secrets looks more like Greece than a remote lake in Asia The country's air hub, Chinggis Khaan International Airport (UBN), is about an hour and a half from the park. The airport is mostly limited to short-haul flights from Asian cities like Seoul, Hong Kong and Beijing. United Airlines operates seasonal flights to Mongolia from the US, but they require a stopover in Tokyo. Beyond Bogd Khan Uul, Mongolia is home to some of the world's most diverse landscapes and has a total of 29 national parks.</p>

President Donald Trump has announced an additional 35% tariff for Canada that will go into effect on August 1 with considerations for an adjustment if “Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.”

Trump has sent out a number of letters to several different countries announcing his tariff intentions over the last few days.

“Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a Tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,” Trump wrote in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to social media.

The president's tariffs on Canada will be some of the most impactful for U.S. consumers, as border states share energy and other things with the country. He said that if Canada offers reciprocal tariffs, he will increase the tariffs to whatever their number is on top of the 35%.

Countries who have not received a letter or who have reached a trade agreement will be charged a blanket rate, NBC News reported Thursday. 

“We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,” Trump said, according to the outlet.

Canada is the top buyer of U.S. exported goods, importing around $349 billion in 2024. They also shipped $413 billion worth of goods to America last year, the third-highest for any country to the U.S.

Trump added that there will be no tariffs if Canada decides “to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approval…in a matter of weeks.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ruling from the bench, Laplante granted a request from immigration rights attorneys to certify a nationwide class that “will be comprised only of those deprived of citizenship” and issued a preliminary injunction indefinitely blocking Trump's Day One order from being enforced against any baby born after February 20. The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said he would pause his order for several days to give the Trump administration time to appeal his decision. Laplante wrote that he “has no difficulty concluding that the rapid adoption by executive order, without legislation and the attending national debate, of a new government policy of highly questionable constitutionality that would deny citizenship to many thousands of individuals previously granted citizenship under an indisputably longstanding policy, constitutes irreparable harm, and that all class representatives could suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.” Laplante's ruling could prove to be a critical bulwark against Trump's policy as other courts scramble to take a second look at their decisions in light of the Supreme Court's ruling. “This judge's decision disregards the rule of law by abusing class action certification procedures. In February, Laplante indefinitely blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order only against members of several nonprofit groups who would have been impacted by it. “I'm the judge who wasn't comfortable with issuing a nationwide injunction. Class action is different,” the judge said at one point during Thursday's hearing. “The Supreme Court suggested class action is a better option.” Thursday's proceeding focused largely on the request from immigration rights attorneys who brought the legal challenge for Laplante to certify a class of individuals that would include “all current and future children” who would be affected by Trump's order and their parents. “You're right, (ordinarily) we'd conduct discovery before granting class certification,” Laplante said. In this case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, those proposed representatives had included a Honduran asylum-seeker – referred to in court papers as “Barbara” and who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a baby in October – and a Brazilian man – referred to as “Mark” – who is attempting to get lawful permanent status. “If the Order is left in place,” the ACLU lawyers wrote, “those children will face numerous obstacles to life in the United States, including stigma and potential statelessness; loss of their right to vote, serve on federal juries and in many elected offices, and work in various federal jobs; ineligibility for various federal programs; and potential arrest, detention, and deportation to countries they may have never even seen.” Related article The behind-the-scenes power John Roberts wields to ensure his influence with justices But that process will take time and it's unclear whether any of those courts will narrow their injunctions ahead of when Trump is permitted to enforce the birthright policy. “I feel like we're the only people who rushed around here,” Laplante quipped during Thursday's hearing. Laplante's decision aligns with the Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling last month, which left class-action litigation on the table as a way to block Trump's birthright citizenship order – and potentially other policies. The Supreme Court's decision was focused on one type of court order – a nationwide injunction – but several of the justices were keen to note that plaintiffs suing an administration would have other avenues to shut down policies that might run afoul of the Constitution or federal law. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested the kind of class-action litigation immigrant rights groups are now pursuing have many advantages. “Today's decision on district court injunctions will not affect this court's vitally important responsibility to resolve applications for stays or injunctions with respect to major new federal statutes and executive actions,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Deciding those applications is not a distraction from our job. “No matter how the preliminary-injunction litigation on those kinds of significant matters transpires in the district courts, the courts of appeals in turn will undoubtedly be called upon to promptly grant or deny temporary stays or temporary injunctions in many cases,” Kavanaugh wrote. But Laplante's ruling is nevertheless almost certain to force the justices to deal with a split that emerged over the particulars of those cases. Several conservatives, including Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, warned against courts using class-action litigation to essentially supplant the kind of nationwide injunction the court had just shot down. “Lax enforcement of the requirements” for certifying a class, Alito wrote in an opinion joined by Thomas, “would create a potentially significant loophole to today's decision.” Federal courts, he added, “should thus be vigilant against such potential abuses of these tools.” Whether Laplante's decision is an “abuse” or exactly what the Supreme Court had in mind will likely wind up back before the justices in short order.
