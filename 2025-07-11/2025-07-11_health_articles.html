                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new device combining ultrasound and advanced imaging to provide crucial information for the safe delivery of drugs into the brain has been developed by University of Queensland researchers. Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute said the device allows real-time observation of individual cells after ultrasound treatment, which is an emerging technology for the delivery of drugs past the blood-brain barrier. The information learned about how treated cells respond and change could ultimately benefit the treatment of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Insights from this device will help inform ultrasound treatment protocols and establish a balance where uptake of drugs into the brain is effective, yet still safe.'' Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute The custom-built device will examine sonoporation-based drug delivery. Sonoporation is an emerging strategy involving ultrasound-based treatment combined with injected 'microbubbles'. In this process, sound waves interact with the microbubbles causing them to vibrate and exert force on the blood-brain barrier to create a tiny pore at the cell surface. "This device will enable scientists to understand how ultrasound-based treatments work at the single-molecule and single-cell levels,'' he said. "It has the potential to improve treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where drugs target specific areas of the brain. "The goal is really to improve the rate of uptake of drugs into the brain, as currently only about 1-2 per cent of small molecule drugs actually reach it. "The results could also help inform treatment in other medical fields where sonoporation shows great promise, including cardiology and oncology.'' The research is published in Journal of Controlled Release. In the interview, Lloyd M. Smith discusses proteoforms, an area of research worthy of the next Human Genome Project. In this interview, the team at n6 discusses their groundbreaking iconPCR thermocycler and its impact on laboratory automation, NGS data quality, and real-time control in life sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The gap between a brain's chronological age and its predicted age on brain imaging appears to be a strong mediator of risk factors for cognitive decline, especially in individuals with cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), new research suggested. Results showed that a higher number of cognitive impairment risk factors were associated with lower cognitive performance scores — and that a larger BAG may influence this relationship, with the strongest effects observed in participants with CeVD. “This suggests that accelerated brain aging, as measured by BAG, plays a disproportionate role in cognitive vulnerability among individuals with vascular pathology,” study co-investigator Saima Hilal, MD, PhD, assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, Singapore, told Medscape Medical News. “While we expected BAG to have some mediating effect, the domain-specific nature of this influence was unexpected,” Hilal added. The findings were published online on June 18 in Neurology. The investigators initiated the study to explore how the BAG neuroimaging-derived biomarker might help explain a connection between known risk factors for cognitive impairment and actual cognitive decline, particularly in Southeast Asian populations, Hilal reported. “Prior research has largely focused on Western cohorts, leaving a gap in understanding how [CeVD], which is highly prevalent in Asia, may interact with BAG to affect cognition,” she said. Additionally, she noted that CeVD often coexists with Alzheimer's pathology in individuals from Southeast Asia. Understanding whether BAG could serve as a mediator in that relationship “could enhance early risk stratification and open new avenues for targeted cognitive interventions in at-risk populations,” Hilal said. The researchers reviewed medical records for more than 2000 participants (mean age, 66 years; 53% men; 60% with no cognitive impairment) from the Singapore community and memory clinics to identify cognitive impairment risk factors. For this, they used the Cognitive Impairment Scoring System (CISS), which consisted of 11 sociodemographic and vascular factors, including age, education, smoking status, blood pressure, and history of diabetes. The investigators also measured cognitive performance using tests that assessed overall global cognition, executive function, language, memory, attention, visuomotor speed — which is the ability to coordinate visual information with motor actions — and visuoconstruction, which involves coordinating fine motor skills with spatial abilities. Results showed a significant association between a higher CISS score (showing more impairment risk factors) and lower performance across all cognitive domains measured, especially visuomotor speed (β = -2.7; P < .001) and visuoconstruction (β = -3.0; P < .001). The effect was even stronger for those with high CeVD burden. There were no significant effects in the low-CeVD-burden group. “These findings underscore the importance of stratifying by vascular burden and considering domain-specific outcomes when investigating brain aging,” Hilal said. “For clinicians, the key message is that the brain age gap can serve as a meaningful intermediate biomarker linking modifiable risk factors to cognitive decline,” she added. “Future longitudinal studies should verify these relationships and explore additional factors not captured in our model,” they wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review reveals how timed eating patterns spark a chain of reactions in your gut and brain that could help prevent Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Study: Intermittent Fasting as a Neuroprotective Strategy: Gut–Brain Axis Modulation and Metabolic Reprogramming in Neurodegenerative Disorders. A review published in Nutrients examined existing preclinical and limited clinical evidence showing that intermittent fasting (IF) may help reduce the toxic protein burden, support synaptic function, and rehabilitate glial and immune homeostasis across models of various neurodegenerative disorders. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are crucial signalling molecules in the gut-brain axis (GBA), and existing evidence points to the role of IF in increasing SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia spp., and Anaerostipes spp. Preclinical studies have associated this with increased hippocampal synaptic density and reduced tau protein phosphorylation in animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). IF upregulates microbial gene expression, particularly enhancing the growth of butyrate-producing taxa. It also modifies bile acid metabolism and modulates tryptophan pathways, thereby improving the production of neuromodulatory metabolites, e.g., serotonin and kynurenine. Chronic low-grade inflammation and inflammaging from the gut are increasingly recognized as key factors in neurodegeneration. Intestinal permeability, also known as "leaky gut," allows microbial endotoxins to enter the systemic circulation, triggering immune responses and producing proinflammatory cytokines. IF can enhance SCFA-producing microbes, improving epithelial integrity and reducing endotoxin exposure. Recent findings suggest that IF affects neurotransmitter pathways originating in the gut, specifically those involved in tryptophan and serotonin metabolism. Under IF conditions, there is greater microbial conversion of tryptophan into indole derivatives, which may offer neuroprotective benefits through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. This may also support the balance between intestinal and immune functions. Neuroinflammation is circadian-sensitive, where hypothalamic inflammation can increase in the case of misaligned feeding schedules. IF's impact on circadian rhythms may also affect redox homeostasis in the brain and alter mitochondrial dynamics. IF could enhance mitochondrial efficiency and antioxidant capacity by facilitating metabolic switching from glucose to lipid and ketone-based substrates, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB exerts neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant defences, modulation of mitochondrial function, and GBA. IF activates autophagy by activating SIRT1 and inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). SCFAs have also been shown to influence epigenetic regulation of autophagy genes. Elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, lowered amyloid plaque burden, and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD models, as well as similar effects, have been noted in models of Parkinson's Disease. IF influences neuroimmune homeostasis via GBA-integrated signals that regulate glial activity, cytokine networks, and immune–metabolic resilience. These adaptations are key for long-term cognitive preservation and neuroprotection. Translating IF's promise to clinical practice requires thorough interrogation of mechanistic monitoring, safety, personalisation, and ethical deployment. It can be tricky to deploy IF interventions in vulnerable populations such as older adults, due to risks of hypoglycaemia, dehydration, and micronutrient deficiencies. Adherence can also be challenging, especially when cognitive decline hinders routine maintenance, making unsupervised IF potentially hazardous. Caregiver-linked compliance platforms, app-guided timers, and other digital solutions could bridge this gap. A shift toward precision fasting is emerging, guided by increasing evidence that genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic, and microbiome-related factors shape individual responses to fasting. Incorporating circadian biomarkers, such as melatonin rhythm, sleep phase, and cortisol amplitude, offers a promising path for personalized chrono-nutrition. This approach may be especially beneficial for individuals with neurodegenerative disorders, who often experience disrupted circadian rhythms. IF's pleiotropic effects make it an ideal backbone for multimodal therapeutic synergies. This is crucial in the case of neurodegeneration, where monotherapeutic approaches are unlikely to yield long-lasting clinical benefits. Co-administration of aerobic or resistance training and IF has yielded additive neurocognitive benefits in some preclinical and pilot clinical studies. IF is emerging as a potentially scalable neurotherapeutic strategy. As clinical applications progress, the focus should be on incorporating IF into a comprehensive precision medicine framework. This could be done utilizing digital health technologies, multi-omics biomarkers, and complementary therapies. However, it is essential to note that most supporting evidence currently comes from preclinical animal studies, and robust, large-scale human trials are still limited. Future research conducting randomized controlled trials should adopt stratified designs, integrate longitudinal biomarkers, and consider real-world adherence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children from ethnic minority backgrounds and those living in areas with higher levels of child poverty were more likely to die in intensive care than White children and those from the least deprived areas. Researchers analyzed 14 years of UK-wide data on more than 160,000 critically ill children and found that children of Asian, Multiple and other ethnicities were more likely to die in intensive care than White children. They also found that children living in areas with higher levels of poverty were more severely ill on arrival to intensive care and more likely to die after admission to paediatric intensive care than those from the least deprived areas. It was led by researchers at Imperial College London, University of Leicester, UCL and University of Leeds, and is based on data commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP)through its national clinical audit programme. The findings raise serious concerns about equity in critical care for children and should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders, according to the researchers. Our findings show that inequalities persist even at this stage of care and are deeply troubling. These are not just statistics - they represent real, preventable differences in outcomes for critically ill children. These findings should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders. "Ethnic inequalities in child health have been highlighted repeatedly, and our study adds clear, national-scale evidence of disparities in intensive care. Reducing avoidable deaths in children must include serious, sustained action to reduce child poverty, improve access to healthcare, and address the structural barriers faced by marginalized communities." This is particularly concerning as use of Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is projected to rise in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of complex chronic conditions in children. It shouldn't be the case that a child's ethnicity or postcode determines their outcomes in PICU. Our findings show the urgent need for improved access to urgent care, reducing barriers to healthcare access, earlier recognition of serious illness in children, and more coordination between hospitals and community care teams to improve PICU outcomes across the UK." Children from economically disadvantaged areas or minority ethnic backgrounds experience worse health outcomes across a range of acute care conditions, with most of this research originating from the USA. Evidence from the UK and the USA shows increased rates of admissions to PICUs for children from more deprived areas, and a previous Imperial study also reported increased rates of PICU admissions for children of Asian and Black ethnicities in the UK. They analyzed nationwide data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network of 245,099 admissions for 163,163 children aged 0-15 years admitted to UK PICUs between 1 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 2021. They analyzed ethnicity and area-level deprivation at the time of admission. They compared this with mortality, length of stay during PICU and unplanned readmission within 60 days. The team found that children of Asian ethnicity had higher mortality – 1,336 deaths per 26,022 admissions, while mortality was lowest amongst White children – 4,960 deaths per 154,041 admissions. Mortality was also higher in children living in areas with higher levels of child poverty – 2,432 deaths per 58,110 admissions compared to children in least deprived areas – 1,025 deaths per 33,331 admissions, revealing an association between PICU mortality and area-level child poverty. Children living in the most deprived areas had 13% higher odds of death compared to those living in the least deprived areas. Both children of Asian ethnicity and children from more deprived areas were more severely unwell at admission than children of White ethnicity and those from less deprived areas. Children from ethnic minority backgrounds had longer stays in PICU (average 66 hours) and increased odds of unplanned readmission to PICU within 60 days (9%) compared with those of White ethnicity (average 52 hours and 6.8%).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It can be difficult to decide whether to expedite birth when a woman in the final stage of pregnancy perceives less fetal movements. An additional ultrasound measurement to assess resistance infetal blood vessels can help make this decision more accurately, leading to fewer complications during delivery. This is the conclusion of a large international study led by gynecologist Sanne Gordijn from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), in collaboration with Wessel Ganzevoort from Amsterdam UMC. Sometimes, pregnant women perceive less fetal movements in the final weeks of pregnancy. Usually, this is not a cause for concern-the baby may be in a different position, or the mother may have been busy and not noticed the movements. However, it can be alarming for both the pregnant woman and healthcare providers, as it may precede severe oxygen deprivation or even fetal death. In such cases, the placenta may not be functioning properly, resulting in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply to the baby. Early delivery, before severe hypoxia occurs, may then be the best option. Currently, when a pregnant woman reports reduced fetal movement in the final weeks, she is referred to a hospital. While these details provide insight into the fetal condition, there may be more effective ways to assess it. These measurements provide further insight into placental function and the baby's condition. A total of 1,684 women participated in the study. The idea is that an abnormal CPR value, which may indicate a poorly functioning placenta, suggests it is better to expedite birth. If the CPR is normal, it may be better to wait, as the baby may not yet be ready. Women who wish to give birth at home can still do so in that case." Gordijn: "This means we see fewer complications around birth when this measurement is performed in cases of reduced fetal movement, compared to current practice where it is not." According to Gordijn, the study provides essential information for obstetric care: "If doctors know the CPR result, they can better determine whether reduced fetal movement is harmless or requires action. This ensures that both mother and baby receive the care best suited to their situation." In the interview, Lloyd M. Smith discusses proteoforms, an area of research worthy of the next Human Genome Project.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)--29% and 85%, respectively-finds a large medical records study published online in the journal Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine. What's more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition-18-64 year olds-the findings indicate. Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers. But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including if particular age groups might be more vulnerable they add. In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on real-time data from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains electronic health records from 68 healthcare organisations across the USA. They scrutinised the anonymised records of adult patients who had and hadn't been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs. Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64 year olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn't been prescribed gabapentin. While there was no heightened risk among 18–34 year olds prescribed the drug, the risks of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49 year olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64 year olds. Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between 3 and 11 times. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren't able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use. Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence." They add: "Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, now have a better chance of having their own children after treatment. In the HD21 trial, patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma received one of two therapies: either the experimental therapy with BrECADD or the previous standard of care eBEACOPP. Three years after treatment was concluded, there were major differences: In the BrECADD group, 95 per cent of women and 86 per cent of men had normal hormone levels again – compared to 73  per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the eBEACOPP group. More pregnancies and births were documented after the BrECADD regimen was applied. For men in particular, this means a significantly higher chance of biological paternity after treatment. BrECADD gives young adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma a better chance of starting a family later in life – with an equally good or even slightly better cure rate." Dr. Justin Ferdinandus, Study Physician in the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and first author of the publication Our data clearly show that BrECADD is the preferred first-line treatment for patients who wish to have children – at University Hospital Cologne and in the current Onkopedia guideline, this is already the new standard," adds Dr. Karolin Behringer, Study Physician at the GHSG and last author of the study. The HD21 study is a randomized phase III clinical trial involving over 1,500 participants up to the age of 60 at 233 centres in nine countries. Among other things, the recovery of hormone levels (measured via blood serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone) were examined along with pregnancies and births after therapy was concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that while losing weight can rejuvenate aging fat tissue, stubborn immune cells keep a “memory” of obesity, offering fresh targets for lasting metabolic health. Study: Selective remodelling of the adipose niche in obesity and weight loss. Their landmark study provides the most detailed view yet into how fat tissue transforms during obesity and weight loss. Study findings reveal that obesity induces cellular senescence, inflammation, and structural stress within fat, which are only partially reversed by weight loss. In combination with the 171,247-cell strong atlas, these findings provide a revolutionary understanding of fat tissue plasticity, representing the first step towards novel therapeutic directions that may finally overcome obesity's notorious capacity to bounce back. Obesity is a metabolic condition characterized by excessive systemic fat accumulation, with potentially lethal outcomes. Clinically defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m², obesity has been linked to several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and even certain cancers. While pharmacological, behavioral, and surgical interventions have demonstrated promise in achieving weight loss, these benefits are often temporary. These facts reveal our surface understanding of the association and correlation between weight loss and improved obesity-associated health outcomes, while emphasizing our lack of knowledge of the mechanistic interplay governing fat (adipose tissue [AT]) remodeling. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and progress our war on obesity by deciphering the cellular, molecular, and spatial changes that occur in human AT during obesity and after weight loss. Study samples (subcutaneous abdominal AT) were obtained from morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/m²; n = 25; age = 20–70 yrs) and healthy controls (BMI < 26 kg/m²) intra-operatively via laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Follow-up samples were collected five months later for comparative assays. All samples were subjected to single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the Illumina NextSeq2000 platform. Simultaneously, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) AT samples were subjected to 5 μm sectioning, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and in situ hybridization assays, allowing researchers to both carry out nuclear identification and measure gene activity directly within intact tissue architecture. Weight loss selectively reverses senescence in metabolic, vascular, and precursor cells Metabolic adipocytes, precursor cells, and vascular cells of patients with obesity were found to express senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes and other markers of cellular senescence. These cells contribute to fibrosis, immune signaling, and local tissue stress. Notably, following weight loss (bariatric surgery), the fraction of "stressed" adipocytes (AD3) was observed to decrease dramatically (from 55% to 14%; P < 0.0001), and p21-positive senescent cells were nearly eliminated in these lineages. However, senescence persisted in immune cells (macrophages), suggesting only partial and cell-type-specific rejuvenation of the adipose niche. While the infiltration of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) was observed to decrease following weight loss, these LAMs retained inflammatory signature (TREM1 and TLR2) expression, indicating transcriptional memory that may predispose to metabolic dysfunction and potentially explain obesity's frequent reappearance. Adipocyte metabolism globally activates during weight loss but fails to restore lean-state flexibility Weight loss enhanced substrate cycling (e.g., triglyceride hydrolysis/resynthesis) and branched-chain amino acid breakdown, but metabolic parameters (e.g., insulin sensitivity) remained suboptimal relative to lean baselines. Spatial mapping reveals stress niches adjacent to immune hotspots The study identified five functional tissue niches: adipocyte, vascular, stress, arterial, and stem-like zones. Stressed cells formed distinct "stress niches" adjacent to immune-enriched arterial zones, indicating microenvironments of obesity-caused damage with delayed recovery. Several stress-associated factors (THBS1, NAMPT, AREG) were found to be enriched in obesity and reversed by weight loss (P < 0.05), highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets. a, Graphical representation of the primary study cohort (left; single-nucleus analyses in n = 25 obese (OB) people before and after WL and n = 24 lean (LN) people, with spatial analyses in n = 4 people per group) and AT anatomical location (right). b, Clinical characteristics of the primary cohort (n = 24 LN and 25 paired OB–WL donors). BMI, body mass index (kg m–2); F insulin, fasting insulin (mIU L–1); HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c (%); HDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mM); DBP, diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). d, Cell-type proportions (for the cell types in c) in the combined cohort, mean per group, and for each sample (single nucleus). This study marks a prominent leap in scientific understanding of adipose tissue biology, highlighting that while weight loss can partially and selectively reverse the cellular damage inflicted by obesity (reducing inflammation, senescence in specific lineages, and tissue stress), some immune and metabolic programs retain obesity-associated signatures, potentially explaining the stubborn tendency for weight to return. The findings highlight fat as a complex, adaptive organ exhibiting cell-type-specific memory, suggesting that future interventions targeting unresolved senescence (e.g., in macrophages) or niche-specific stress signals (e.g., THBS1/NAMPT) may improve long-term outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging science spotlights pomegranate seed oil's unique fatty acids as promising allies for heart and metabolic health, if future clinical trials back up the early buzz. Study: Punicic Acid: A Potential Nutraceutical Compound in Pomegranate Seed Oil and Its Cardiovascular Benefits. Pomegranate seed oil has shown great promise in its beneficial effects on health in multiple preclinical studies. Its potential role as a nutraceutical is the focus of a recent research paper published in the journal Foods. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading killer among all diseases worldwide, causing a quarter of all deaths in the UK. It is associated with poor dietary habits, including a high intake of saturated fats, which increases blood cholesterol levels. Approximately 31% of CVD cases and 11% of strokes globally are traceable to diets with a high saturated fat content. Fats in a healthy diet would come mainly from oily fish and plants rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with low amounts of saturated fats and trans fats. All parts of the pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) are rich in nutrients and medicinal components. After the juice is extracted, the seed waste, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of its weight, becomes a byproduct. The 1.6 million tons of pomegranate seed waste produced annually are a treasure trove of bioactive compounds with enormous therapeutic and economic potential. For instance, pomegranate seed extracts have been shown to possess anti-cancer and anti-osteoporotic properties. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) comprises approximately 12% to 20% of the total seed weight, with a high punicic acid content. Punicic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. It enhances immunity, improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, while reducing blood lipid levels. Additionally, it protects both the liver and kidneys. Thus, PSO is an example of a healthy supplement produced from a waste product, largely due to its punicic acid content. The current review examines punicic acid as a potential cardioprotective agent. Punicic acid transforms in your liver to 9Z,11E-CLA, a bioactive fat that may influence brain, adipose, and plasma lipid profiles based on rodent studies. It is the most abundant fatty acid in pomegranate seed oil, comprising up to 83% of the total fatty acid content. In addition to pomegranate, this acid is also obtained from various other plant sources, such as Trichosanthes kirilowii seeds. Increasing punicic acid intake, for example, by eating more T. kirilowii seeds, improves its levels in blood by ~0.47% in plasma and its metabolites in red blood cell membranes by 0.17%. Human trials have shown inconsistent metabolic responses, and optimal dosing remains unclear. PSO induces vasodilation, with a slight, gender-specific (female-only) decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. PSO protects cardiac muscle cells against oxidative stress, both by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by improving antioxidant capacity. PPARγ activation doesn't just help glucose - it calms obesity-related inflammation by dialing down cytokines like IL-6 while boosting anti-inflammatory IL-10. PSO reduces various lipid risk markers in the blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (‘bad' cholesterol), triglycerides, and total cholesterol, in some animal and hyperlipidemic human studies, though results are inconsistent across trials. It also reduces liver fat accumulation, with marked suppression of apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 secretion – this being an LDL component and a risk marker for coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. PSO supplementation also reduces obesity induced by unhealthy or high-fat diets. In hyperlipidemic individuals, PSO intake reduced triglycerides and improved the triglyceride-to-'good' cholesterol ratio. The primary benefit of PSO appears to be its ability to maintain normal lipid metabolism, regardless of fat loss. PA specifically blocks TNF-α triggered inflammation in gut models, helping restore intestinal barrier function and prevent conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis. PSO improves insulin sensitivity and reduces fasting glucose levels in animal models and some diabetic patients, though human data are mixed. It may be a safer alternative to prevent and treat inflammation associated with cardiometabolic disease. PSO may act by increasing mitochondrial energy metabolism and enhancing glucose absorption into cells that are insulin-resistant. These actions may be mediated by PPAR-γ. Systemic inflammation underlies these chronic conditions, signaled by pro-inflammatory markers like (NF)-κB, TNF-α, and interleukin (IL)-6. PSO reduces oxidative stress while increasing antioxidant buffer enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The antioxidant activity of PSO is attributed to its tocopherol and polyphenolic compound content. These effects have been well-documented in preclinical models but require further clinical validation. Omega-3 PUFAs are established cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents. Punicic acid is a PPARγ activator, providing complementary benefits to these compounds by inhibiting lipogenic gene expression. Unlike them, it does not primarily act on eicosanoid pathways but rather inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines. It also scavenges ROS while increasing antioxidant activity through its conjugated triene structure. Furthermore, more work is needed to establish its dosing, bioavailability, and metabolism. PSO is rich in bioactive compounds, which account for both its nutritional content and its multifaceted health benefits. Punicic acid, a major fatty acid component of PSO, appears to help prevent as well as treat cardiometabolic diseases in preclinical models. The activity of punicic acid is similar to that of omega-3 PUFAs but through different mechanisms, offering potential complementary or synergistic benefits. However, rigorous clinical trials are essential to establish the use of PA as a complementary nutritional agent – a nutraceutical – in the prevention and management of chronic disease. Until then, its therapeutic potential remains promising but unconfirmed in humans. Dr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001. She has counseled hundreds of patients facing issues from pregnancy-related problems and infertility, and has been in charge of over 2,000 deliveries, striving always to achieve a normal delivery rather than operative.
