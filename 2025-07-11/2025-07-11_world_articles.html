                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US state department has begun issuing the first of more than 1,350 termination notices as part of a huge reorganisation of America's diplomatic corps under the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, according to internal documents and US diplomats at the state department on Friday. Career diplomats and other staff began to receive the notices on Friday morning, days after the supreme court lifted a ban on the Trump administration moving forward with mass firings of government employees that will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers. In an internal email obtained by the Guardian on Friday, state department workers were told that nearly 3,000 employees would leave as part of a vast reorganisation meant to align the department's goals with Donald Trump's stated goal of putting America first. Another 1,600 employees are believed to have left the service via a voluntary redundancy scheme in recent months. “At a moment of great global instability – with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order – the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,” said a statement from the American Foreign Service Association, a professional group that represents US diplomats. “I think for some people the fact it is finally happening is a relief but it's awful,” the person added. A senior state department official said: “This is simply not true. Email systems always take time to roll these out, and the timeline has been consistent with expectations. We did not have plans for one big email blast at a specific time, and did not indicate any such time to the workforce.” Members of the PDCA and other groups that support federal employees were expected to meet at the state department at 4pm on Friday in order to “clap out” employees who had received RIFs and to “protest the department's actions”. A senior state department official on Thursday told journalists that the department was “going to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees and foreign service officers and civil servants who are affected by this. “While there are targeted reforms that our government can pursue to maximize the impact of every tax dollar, that's not what this is,” read the statement, which was co-signed by 10 Democratic senators, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the US Senate foreign relations committee. Now is the time to strengthen our diplomatic hand, not weaken it. From pursuing peaceful resolutions to out-competing China diplomatically and economically, we can't afford to not have experienced diplomats at the table.”</p>

Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed. Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed. Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement. Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.” US prosecutors won't seek death penalty for son of Mexican drug cartel leader ‘El Chapo' Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.” “In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.” “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders. Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President hints at ‘major announcement' on Monday after halting arms shipments due to dwindling stockpiles During an interview with NBC News, Trump said he will probably have a “major announcement” on Russia on Monday and confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine. Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on the same day for a week-long trip that comes after the US temporarily halted weapons shipments to Ukraine as part of a Pentagon review of dwindling stockpiles of crucial munitions including Patriot air defense missiles. “I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.” During the interview, Trump laid out a plan by which the US could sell weapons to Nato and then they could be sent on to Ukraine. Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine. “So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv. Ukraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions. Yet a key stumbling block remains US military production. Kellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump's inauguration. Experts have said that the bill would give Trump new methods to target Russia, but that he could also tighten enforcement or issue other sanctions unilaterally without waiting for authorization from Congress. “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting this week. “He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”</p>

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. A bipartisan group of senators representing an eighth of the Senate posed for photos and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to the U.S. this week, sparking criticism over senators' smiles next to a man wanted in the Hague for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu also met with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the latter of whom said in a post on social media that the two “discussed America's commitment to Israel's security and our shared goal of achieving a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.” Pictures of the Senate meeting also showed Senators Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Jon Husted (R-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), and Adam Schiff (D-California). The lawmakers posed next to a table set with food and drinks. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has already drawn criticism for being on vacation in Greece amid the devastating floods in his state last week, was also at the meeting. Lawmakers have drawn criticism for meeting with Netanyahu as his government moves toward expelling all Palestinians from Gaza, through death or force. Earlier this week, Netanyahu's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, told reporters that he has instructed the military to plan for confining all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp where they won't be allowed to leave — a plan likened to concentration camps by advocates for Palestinian rights. “Yesterday these Senators took part in a photo-op with Netanyahu, who is wanted for war crimes. Shameful,” wrote the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project in a post on social media. “In a just world, every one of these Democratic senators would be primaried — especially the hypocritical Cory Booker who is wisely trying to hide his face in this picture,” said Zeteo Editor-in-Chief Mehdi Hasan. Indeed, Booker and Klobuchar are standing behind other senators in photos posted online. In fact, earlier this week, the U.S. State Department threatened the ICC in a UN meeting ahead of Netanyahu's visit, demanding that it drop the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant and terminate “all investigations and all arrest warrants” against Israel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As work stoppages spread, the Teamsters' president says a waste disposal company is at “war” with sanitation workers. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. A local sanitation workers strike that began on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company. For example, workers in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better pay at a regional landfill near Stockton. “Republic Services has been threatening a war with American workers for years — and now, they've got one,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien in a statement on Wednesday. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. While trash collection has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports. The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health issue. Republic Services is a private contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country, and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the picket line to job sites beyond Boston. Republic Services did not respond to a request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. “We will continue to focus on providing service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. The right to join a union and go on strike is protected by federal labor law, so it's unclear what “criminal acts” Republic Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. “They burn massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O'Brien said. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we've ever come across.” But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,” Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9. However, Zuckerman said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic Services. “To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of Republic's strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,” said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division, in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.” Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders last year. Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California, said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services. Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line, and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in Boston extended its picket line this week. “They deserve a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said. Meanwhile, after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State, Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a contract with city officials. “We felt our clock was running out,” Boulware said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says so-called smishing attempts appear to be on the rise, thanks in part to new technologies that allow for co-ordinated bulk attacks. He says smishing is “more than likely increasing” with help from artificial intelligence tools that can craft convincing messages or scour data from security breaches to uncover new targets. The ruse comes in many forms but often involves a message that purports to come from a real organization or business urging immediate action to address an alleged problem. Horncastle says it differs from more involved scams such as a text invitation to call a supposed job recruiter, who then tries to extract personal or financial information by phone. Nevertheless, he says a text scam might be quite sophisticated since today's fraudsters can use artificial intelligence to scan data leaks for personal details that bolster the hoax, or use AI writing tools to help write convincing text messages. “In the past, part of our messaging was always: watch for spelling mistakes. “Now, this message could be coming from another country where English may not be the first language but because the technology is available, there may not be spelling mistakes like there were a couple of years ago.” The Competition Bureau warns against clicking on suspicious links and forwarding texts to 7726 (SPAM), so that the cellular provider can investigate further. It also encourages people to delete smishing messages, block the number and ignore texts even if they ask to reply with “STOP” or “NO.” But those numbers don't quite tell the story, he says. “We get a very small percentage of what's actually out there. And specifically when we're looking at phishing or smishing, the reporting rate is very low. So generally we say that we estimate that only five to 10 per cent of victims report fraud to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.” Horncastle says it's hard to say for sure how new technology is being used, but he notes AI is a frequent tool for all sorts of nefarious schemes such as manipulated photos, video and audio. “So we would discuss AI a lot where fraudsters now have that tool available to them. “Since SIM cards lack identification verification, enforcement agencies like the Competition Bureau have a hard time in actually tracking these perpetrators down,” Palumbo says. Fraudsters can also spoof phone numbers, making it seem like a text has originated with a legitimate agency such as the Canada Revenue Agency, Horncastle adds. “We've seen (that) with the CRA and even the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, where fraudsters have made our phone numbers show up on victims' call display.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death, independent media outlet Astra reported on July 11, citing Chuvash Republic authorities. According to Russian milbloggers, 22 people in total were killed as a result of the Ukrainian HIMARS strike. News of Ilyin's death and burial was initially posted on the VKontakte social media page of the Urmarsky District administration in Russia's Chuvash Republic. Kyiv has accused the 155th Separate Marine Brigade of committing numerous war crimes in Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, members of the brigade are responsible for executing prisoners of war and humiliating captured Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, making it the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign troops since World War II. The move was intended to disrupt a planned Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's Sumy Oblast and to relieve pressure on the Donetsk front. Since then, Ukraine claims it has inflicted 63,402 Russian troop casualties in the oblast, including 25,625 killed and 971 captured. Ukrainian forces also say they have destroyed or damaged over 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment in the area. Russia retook most of the lost territory during a renewed offensive in March 2025, supported by North Korean troops. The Ukraine-U.S. Reconstruction Investment Fund will provide opportunities not only for U.S. companies but also for other countries, representatives of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said during a workshop at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 11. "We consider these searches to be another wave of attack on Vitaliy Shabunin and the Anti-Corruption Action Center for criticizing the Presidential Office and (Presidential Office head) Andrii Yermak personally," the center said. Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death. A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported. "As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed," Ukraine's military intelligence said. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on July 14 for a week-long visit, he told a Novyny Live journalist at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome. The deal is one of the largest publicly disclosed investments in Ukrainian defense technology since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. Regional authorities reported casualties in at least six Ukrainian oblasts over the past day. During several months of testing, the system intercepted nearly 550 Russian drones over Kyiv Oblast, an official said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“He prides himself or being able to make deals, so this is another test case,” said Rachel Brandenburg, the Israel Policy Forum's Washington managing director and senior fellow. Nearly 800 killed while receiving aid in Gaza, UN human rights office says Rubio, who spoke to reporters while traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, also said that Trump “wants to see a ceasefire and we've invested a lot of time and energy.” “He wants to be the one who gets hostages home and see the war in Gaza end so he can move on to some of these bigger deals,” Brandenburg said. It's unclear how much pressure Trump put on Netanyahu in their private talks this week. Trump made the risky move to join Israel's attacks on Iran last month, delivering pivotal U.S. firepower while alarming world leaders and some of Trump's “America first” supporters. Trump also inserted himself into Israel's domestic affairs, calling for Netanyahu's yearslong corruption trial to be thrown out. Trump shocked some of his fellow Republicans and staunch supporters of Israel by publicly criticizing Netanyahu not long after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the conflict. Opinion: Tactics without strategy: How Trump's weakness and Netanyahu's self-interest exploded in Iran He said that Netanyahu “was not prepared” for the attack from Hamas and that Netanyahu had “let us down” just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Even during his last visit to the White House earlier this year, Netanyahu seemed caught off guard when Trump announced the U.S. would hold talks with Iran over its nuclear deal rather than embrace Netanyahu's push for military pressure. In a video he released after the U.S. strikes, Netanyahu spoke – in English instead of Hebrew – of the “unshakeable alliance” between their countries while repeatedly praising Trump. “His leadership today has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace,” Netanyahu said. But the Israeli leader is also under mounting public pressure to end the war as hostages languish in captivity and more Israeli soldiers are killed in guerrilla-style attacks. Doctors at Gaza City's Al-Helou hospital said that they are struggling to care for newborn and premature babies, who are crammed into single incubators, due to crippling fuel shortages. Israel's military success against Iran has given him some political capital, but if he ends the war while leaving Hamas intact, he will have broken his repeated promise of “total victory.” His far-right coalition partners have threatened to bolt if he does that, sparking early elections that could end his nearly unbroken 16 years in power and leave him more vulnerable to long-standing corruption charges. In a video statement on Thursday, Netanyahu said that he would agree to a “temporary” 60-day ceasefire in return for the release of half the hostages remaining in Gaza, many of whom are believed dead, and that he would begin negotiations on ending the war. But he conditioned any lasting ceasefire on Hamas giving up its arms – something the militants have refused to do as long as Israel occupies parts of Gaza. If Hamas can be disarmed through negotiations, “so much the better,” Netanyahu said. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine on July 10 destroyed a Russian command post and killed five Russian soldiers in occupied Melitopol in a joint operation by military intelligence (HUR) and partisans, the intelligence agency said. The southern city of Melitopol in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. "As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station — intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces — was also destroyed," the agency said. Ukrainian partisan groups, alongside Ukrainian intelligence officers, routinely execute covert missions within Russian-occupied territories to degrade the operational capacity of Russian forces. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved $500 million in aid for Ukraine as part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Reuters reported on July 11. According to Ukraine's military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov, Russia's earlier announcement of its entry into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast serves a political goal. "We consider these searches to be another wave of attack on Vitaliy Shabunin and the Anti-Corruption Action Center for criticizing the Presidential Office and (Presidential Office head) Andrii Yermak personally," the center said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's intellectual elite will continue to defend the country's nuclear program as its legitimate right, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said in an interview with TASS. Asked whether Tehran plans to resume production of enriched uranium in the medium term following the US and Israeli strikes, the diplomat replied, "This aggression has strengthened Iran's determination to build a desirable future for the country, and as we go toward that goal, our intellectual and scientific elite will continue to adamantly defend its nuclear program as an indisputable and legitimate right." "Iran's nuclear capabilities are internal, domestic, so damage to infrastructure would be ineffective because nuclear expertise can't be destroyed by bombardment and missiles," the ambassador said. "We have not had and do not have any demands other than respect for international law." Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. According to the US, there were no casualties or significant damage. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The threat that the conflict in the Middle East will escalate to a hot phase has not passed yet, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali told TASS. "There is still a possibility of the Israeli regime entering the phase of radicalization in decision-making," he said when asked about how sustainable the truce with Israel is. "We did not initiate this war. It was imposed on our country by the aggressive actions of the Zionist regime and the United States," Jalali said. "As [Russian] officials have pointed out, the war party is still active in the region, but we do not seek conflict." Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran.
