            What looked like a simple, one-story beige cabin near the banks of the Guadalupe River held the stories of generations of young girls marking a rite of passage.
    


            It's where shy, homesick 8-year-olds entered as strangers and emerged as confident young ladies equipped with new skills from the great outdoors and lifelong friends – bonds that would one day prove vital in the face of unfathomable tragedy.
    


            Bubble Inn housed many of the youngest girls at Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old haven tucked in the foothills of Texas' Hill Country.
    


            “You get into those gates, and the whole world disappears,” said Lauren Lindley, who spent six summers as a Camp Mystic counselor – several of them at Bubble Inn. “When you grow up as a Camp Mystic camper, that legacy and the feeling that camp gives you sticks with you for life because it is such a unique and special place.”
    


            On July 4, a new group of young girls were just a week into their formative journey at Bubble Inn when the beloved cabin turned into an epicenter of grief.
    


            Torrential rainfall and catastrophic flooding ripped through Central Texas, killing at least 120 people and leaving at least 160 missing. Camp Mystic, which largely sits in a flood-prone area, lost 27 campers and counselors in the disaster.
    


            No cabin suffered more than Bubble Inn. Most of its 15 campers and counselors were killed. The rest are still missing one week later.
    


 How torrential flooding wrought tragedy at an almost century-old camp for girls in central Texas



             It's not clear whether the girls were overcome by floodwater inside their cabin or outside while trying to escape.
    


            Camp Mystic's longtime co-director, Dick Eastland, reportedly died while trying to rescue girls from Bubble Inn.
    


            “I really, truly think he went there because they're the youngest,” said Alex Loyd, the mother of two Camp Mystic girls who are close to Eastland's grandchildren. “These are first-time campers … you're going to run to the babies, absolutely.”
    


            For decades, Bubble Inn welcomed young girls from across the country and even overseas. Some of those girls later became mothers and sent their own daughters to Bubble Inn.
    


            “I have watched my former campers grow into adults with families of their own,” said Lindley, who's now a professional photographer. “I have photographed their weddings.”
    


            There was nothing particularly special about the building itself. Rather, it was the lessons learned and the relationships fostered between the walls that made Bubble Inn so unique.
    


            “The cabins are all very basic. They're just one big open room,” Lindley said. “You have metal camp beds in a row. The girls would all pack a trunk and bring their trunk, and then at the back of every cabin is a community bathroom with two to three showers, two to three bathroom stalls and two to three sinks … depending on the size of the cabin.”
    


            Realizing Bubble Inn housed some of the youngest children, the directors of Camp Mystic – Eastland and his wife, Tweety – had a plan to help any girls who were particularly homesick.
    


            “We were really taught to focus on all of the kids and keep an eye out for the ones that were seeming to have a hard time or were a little quieter,” Lindley said.
    


            “There was a rest hour every day, and the girls were writing letters back and forth. And if a mom or dad was getting a bunch of letters where a camper was talking about being homesick, they were instructed to call and let Tweety know. And Tweety would let (counselors) know,” Lindley said.
    


            “We were just trained to make sure to watch out for the littlest souls.”
    


            The cabin also gave children a crash course in teamwork and responsibility.
    


            “There's a cabin inspection every day. Whoever wins cabin inspection from The Flats and from the Upper Hill both get to go to the commissary after rest hour first – which is a very big deal,” Lindley said, recalling her time as a counselor from 1999 to 2005.
    


            In the scorching Texas heat, being first in line to get dibs on ice cream at the commissary was a major incentive. But whenever a young camper fell short of her duties – perhaps by leaving dirty clothes on the floor – Lindley would hold her accountable by displaying the evidence on the cabin's front porch.
    


            “Clothes were supposed to be hanging on the clothesline. Your bed was supposed to be made. Trash was supposed to be in trash bins. There's not supposed to be stuff on the floor,” she said. “We were teaching the girls discipline, I guess, and pride for and care for your home. It was a hard sell in the little cabin.”
    


            Lindley said she's still in touch with her “first little loves” from when she started as a counselor in 1999. “And there's probably six or eight of them in that little cohort that to this day are still very, very close,” she said.
    


            Part of the reason: After girls “graduate” from Bubble Inn, they often return to camp year after year and progress to more senior cabins together. So many of the lifelong friendships forged at Camp Mystic start at Bubble Inn.
    


            Bubble Inn was nestled among a cluster of cabins housing the camp's youngest girls, and each of the cabins had a charming, age-appropriate name. The Bubble Inn was flanked by the Giggle Box and Twins I & II, which sat next to the Wiggle Inn.
    


            Those junior cabins were called The Flats because the cottages were on low-lying, flat land near the Guadalupe River. Older campers stayed farther from the river up on Senior Hill, and the girls from Bubble Inn looked up to them – literally and figuratively.
    


            There were also practical reasons for why the youngest girls were down closest to the water, Lindley said.
    


            In the blazing Texas heat, “an older camper is better equipped to go up and down the hill constantly all day, in between classes,” she said. “Little girls, most of the activities are going to be down in the main valley” near The Flats.
    


            The Guadalupe River provided boundless fun for the girls by hosting snorkeling, kayaking, canoeing, diving and many other activities in the tranquil green water.
    


            But the same river that gave decades of joy turned into a cataclysmic force in the predawn hours of July 4.
    


            Torrential rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise more than 20 feet in less than two hours. And Bubble Inn, near the confluence of Cypress Creek and Guadalupe River, suffered catastrophic losses.
    


            Many of the grieving families who lost daughters from Bubble Inn have asked for privacy and declined to speak with the media.
    


            But Dr. Patricia Bellows, whose 8-year-old daughter Margaret perished in the flooding, wanted to thank the many counselors who tried to get campers to safety – including the two Bubble Inn counselors.
    


            “The main thing I have to say is unending gratitude for the brave camp counselors who safely evacuated so many campers, and to the two camp counselors who gave their lives trying to protect my baby,” Bellows told CNN affiliate KTRK.
    


            One of the Bubble Inn counselors, Chloe Childress, died in the flood. The other, Katherine Ferruzzo, remains missing.
    


            Virginia Wynne Naylor, an 8-year-old Bubble Inn camper, also perished in the flood. Her family channeled their grief into action by launching a foundation in her memory.
    


            “The More Like Wynne Fund was established to honor the legacy of Wynne Naylor by inspiring limitless passion for adventure,” her father, Cole Naylor, said in an email to CNN.
    


            The foundation will “support Wynne's local education system, youth wildlife conservation efforts, and select Christian ministries,” her father said.
    


            “Replace grief with hope. Replace stress with servitude. Replace tears of despair with joyful recollection.”
    


            It's not clear what will happen to Camp Mystic or if any of the cabins will be refurbished or rebuilt elsewhere. But the destruction can't break the family traditions, friendships and life lessons cultivated at the camp, Lindley said.
    


            “The memories transport you in a way that transcends nostalgia,” she said. “And the relationships that you forge in this special place are just so incredibly unique that it's like a knot that can't be untied.”

            US Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Florida, has called for an investigation into the Federal Emergency Management Agency, citing CNN reporting that the agency's response to the devastating flooding in Texas was slowed by bureaucratic red tape and cost control measures implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
    


                    “I am alarmed by reports that the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) response to the Texas floods was delayed and hampered by a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ‘cost-control' policy imposed by Secretary Kristi Noem,” Moskowitz said in a letter to leadership of the House Homeland Security and Transportation committees on Thursday. “If accurate, this represents a major deviation from long-standing FEMA protocol that may have slowed down life-saving efforts and contributed to the tragedy's severity.”
                





                    “In a crisis like this, FEMA's responsibility is clear: move swiftly, anticipate needs, pre-position resources, and launch rescue efforts without delay,” Moskowitz, who worked as director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management prior to his time in Congress, also said in the letter. “That did not happen here.”
                





            CNN reported on Wednesday that the federal disaster-management agency's response was slowed by new policies that required Noem's approval for relatively small expenditures. Urban search and rescue teams were not deployed to Texas until more than 72 hours after the flooding, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            DHS has defended its response to the Texas flooding and said that it sent other assets from the federal government outside of FEMA to Texas.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced that the federal government added additional counties to President Donald Trump's major disaster declaration following the flooding in central Texas.
    


            This update means that Burnet, Kerr, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties are now eligible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency Individual Assistance program. Additionally, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Menard, and San Saba counties have been approved for FEMA's Public Assistance program.
    


                    “There has been extraordinary collaboration with the state and the federal government to make sure that we address Texans' needs as quickly as possible through disaster assistance programs,” Abbott said in a statement today.
                





            The approval allows qualifying Texans who sustained damage to apply for grant funding to assist with repair and recovery expenses.
    


            Two new committees have been created to address last weekend's deadly flooding in Texas during the state legislature's upcoming special session, according to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.
    


            The joint committees on Disaster Preparedness and Flooding will examine flood warning systems, emergency communications, natural disaster preparation and relief funds during their first hearing on July 23 in Austin, the state capital, Patrick's office said in a statement.
    


            The second session will take place in the hard-hit city of Kerrville a week later “to give residents an opportunity to have their voices heard.”
    


            The House and Senate committees are “just the beginning of the Legislature looking at every aspect of this tragic event,” Patrick said in a statement.
    


                    “In the coming year, and into the next regular legislative session, we will gather all the facts and answer the many questions to which the public demands answers.”
                





More background: Gov. Greg Abbott called the legislature's special session earlier this week. It begins July 21 and will also address an array of topics including redistricting and abortion, according to Abbott's announcement.
    


            House Speaker Dustin Burrows, who co-created the new committees with Patrick, said in a statement that they will ensure “both chambers move in lockstep from day one of the special session.”
    


                    “With only 30 days to act, we must make every moment count,” Patrick said. “This effort is about moving quickly to help Texans recover and laying the foundation to better protect our communities—and our children—from future disasters.”
                





            President Donald Trump is en route to central Texas to survey damage from the catastrophic flooding that has killed more than 120 people.
    


            “It's a horrible thing, a horrible thing,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One earlier this morning.
    


            He is expected to tout the progress that search teams are making on the ground and to emphasize the White House's coordination with local officials.
    


Who else will be there: First lady Melania Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Ted Cruz are among those expected to be on site with Trump.
    


Questions about FEMA: While the administration pledges support for Texas, Trump officials continue the push to downsize federal emergency preparedness operations — or even eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether. Trump officials have doubled down on their vows to shrink FEMA and shift more responsibility for disaster management to individual states.
    


            The Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country announced today they have received over $30 million in donations that will start being distributed as grants immediately.
    


            The first $5 million in grants will be allocated to local organizations doing work on the ground, Austin Dixon, Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country CEO, said at a news conference.
    


            Additional grants will be available to directly support individuals and families with cash assistance, food, gift cards, rent assistance, utility assistance and other emergency needs.
    


            The foundation is also providing grants to local businesses and to first responder agencies for the tools and supplies needed for the crisis response.
    


            The Salvation Army will receive a grant for their work distributing pallets of supplies and offering spiritual care, which they will continue to provide for up to two years, according to Salvation Army Major Phil Swyers.
    


            “Our prayer is that the service provided will help to bring comfort and compassion to those that have suffered in our community unimaginable loss and grief, so that each tomorrow may bring more hope than the day before,” Swyers said.
    


            Other donors included James Avery Artisan Jewelry, which was founded in Kerrville by local resident James Avery 70 years ago. The company's charm line got its start when Avery began designing and making charms for campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, which lost 27 campers and counselors in the disaster, his son, Chris Avery, chairman of the James Avery board, said at the news conference.
    


            US Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, will join President Donald Trump Friday in central Texas as the president surveys damage from deadly floods while questions loom over how local and federal officials responded to the disaster.
    


            “The president is here for the right reasons and will be met with people who are thankful for his personal opportunity to come visit,” Sessions told CNN's Wolf Blitzer ahead of Trump's visit.
    


            Sessions added he believes Texas Gov. Greg Abbott acted quickly to alert Texas officials and “in that coordination that the federal government did provide the helicopter support that would be necessary.”
    


In case you missed it: Trump, with first lady Melania, is expected to meet with first responders in the area, receive a briefing from local elected officials and plans to meet with some families who were affected by the flood, according to a White House official. The trip has been designed, in part, to not interfere with ongoing search and rescue and recovery efforts.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the launch of the Texas Flooding Emotional Support Line, a new crisis support service for residents who have been impacted by the recent catastrophic floods.
    


                    “This new statewide crisis support line will ensure survivors, families, and first responders have access to emotional support and crisis counseling as they work to heal and recover,” Abbott said in a news release.
                





            All affected by the disaster can receive professional crisis counseling at no cost by calling 833-812-2480.
    


            CNN's Bill Weir reports from the ruins of Texas' Camp Mystic, where deadly floods have claimed at least 27 lives. Weir explains how climate change is making flooding more extreme and common.
    


            During the Kerr County Commissioners' regularly scheduled meeting Monday morning, officials will “consider, discuss, and take appropriate action following update on status of recovery efforts” after deadly floods swept through the community, according to the meeting agenda.
    


Remember: Local officials have faced questions all week over their actions in the hours – and even years – before the catastrophic flooding that killed over 100 people in central Texas.
    


            Local officials have been pressed about a timeline of warnings and the emergency response as the Guadalupe River flooded over its banks last week, sweeping away buildings and people in its path.
    


            CNN pieces together what happened in those critical first hours of the disaster.
    


Watch here:



            Here are the tools that Kerr County, where the most deaths from the Texas flooding occurred, had and didn't have in place to warn people as torrential rain sent water surging over the banks of the Guadalupe River last Friday.
    


River gauges: These systems measure river levels and signal officials in real time to rising waters, allowing emergency managers to prepare and alert people.
    


            The Upper Guadalupe River Authority, which manages the river, does have at least five gauges on the river in Kerr County, but experts say that number should double or even triple.
    


                    “How can you have a timely warning when you have no data?” said Mark Rose, former general manager of the Lower Colorado River Authority.
                





            One gauge along the river shows the water levels hit 23.4 feet at 4:45 a.m. local time last Friday morning, then didn't record data again for three hours.
    


IPAWS: The Integrated Public Alert & Warning System (IPAWS) is FEMA's system for local and federal authorities to send emergency information to the public. IPAWS uses Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) sent to mobile phones, the Emergency Alert System, which delivers warnings via radio and television, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Radio.
    


            It's unclear how widely WEA messages reached those in remote areas where cell phone service was limited — including at Camp Mystic, where at least 27 campers and counselors were killed.
    


Emergency sirens: In recent years, multiple efforts in Kerr County to build a more substantial flood warning system have failed or been abandoned due to budget concerns or noise complaints, but Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state would “step up” and get sirens in place by next year.
    


            County officials and the river authority applied for $980,000 in FEMA funds to build a new warning system in 2017 but were denied, public records show.
    


            “I think everyone in Kerrville, everyone in Kerr County, wishes to God we've had some way to warn them,” Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring Jr. said.
    


            Within 36 hours of catastrophic and deadly flooding in central Texas, Gary LeBlanc deployed to the area and started doing what he does best – cook.
    


            Feeling disappointed in the quality of food fed to victims, first responders and volunteers during natural disasters and national emergencies and with over 30 years of experience in the hotel restaurant business, LeBlanc created a national, faith-based nonprofit, Mercy Chefs, with a mission to “just go feed people.”
    


            “The first meals we fed (in Texas) were to search and rescue teams that hadn't had a hot meal since they started,” LeBlanc, the founder of Mercy Chefs, told CNN's Sara Sidner, adding that in his 19 years of volunteer work, he's never seen anything worse than the flooding devastation in central Texas.
    


            “We're seeing them (the volunteers) take a few bites and put their head down, and you can see they're just contemplating the day, and they'll look up and they'll say, ‘you know, I've seen things today that I can never unsee,'” he said.
    


            LeBlanc said Mercy Chefs plans on sticking around in Texas as long as their services are needed, noting that his team is still serving meals in North Carolina, nearly nine months after Hurricane Helene.
    


            “Those men and women are heroes,” he added. “The work they do is just  incredible.”
    


            It's been one week since floodwaters devastated the Texas Hill Country, and the death toll continues to rise, with more than 160 people still missing.
    


            RickyRay Robertson's family property lines spans both sides of the Guadalupe River. He says the bodies of victims have been found on each side.
    


            “There was five as of yesterday (Wednesday), over there and one on this side. They did pull the sixth one out yesterday, that's the one we saw,” Robertson said. “And apparently, they just said that they found another one over there.”
    


            It's a shocking transformation for these parts of the Guadalupe River, which had long offered a peaceful way of life.
    


            “This still blows me away, really does blow me away,” Robertson said.
    


            He showed us the foundation of what was once his cabin home, since the structure was washed away. Robertson recalled a couple searching his property late one night and asked if he could help.
    


            “The man walked to me and he said we're looking for our daughter,” Robertson said. “And he said, I know we're not gonna find her, but we can't just sit in the hotel.”
    


            Just up the road, at a Kerrville park along the river, 91-year-old Charles Hanson has been clearing debris every morning, finding solace in the work.
    


            “On behalf of the people who can't be here or shouldn't be here right now, I'm here,” Hanson said.
    


            A week after disaster struck, the communities and people along the now calm Guadalupe River are trying to find a way forward.
    


            “I think the best thing I can do in respect for the people is to help clean up the mess,” Hanson said, dragging away large branches.
    


            “They're not numbers, you know. They're little girls and men and mothers and fathers and what is this … a big square box full of stuff, you know,” Robertson said tearfully. “That, I can easily rebuild.”
    


            Kerr County officials warned “it is likely” that the county “will experience a flood event in the next year” in a hazard mitigation report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) last October.
    


            The 220-page report, which addressed a range of natural threats, emphasized that such a flood event could be especially dangerous for residents living in “substandard structures” and may result in “increased damage, injuries, or loss of life.”
    


            One of the solutions outlined was to have a local flood warning system that could alert residents to rising waters. The report estimates a cost of less than $1 million for a system that would include precipitation sensors, automatic crossing barriers and a web-based alert platform. Implementing the plan would take three to five years, according to the report, which also identifies FEMA programs for possible funding.
    


            The plan also listed a goal in the next two to five years of expanding warning systems with possible sirens. Other recommendations include possible new restrictions on development in areas at high risk of flooding and educating the public about floods and other hazards.
    


            Last week's catastrophic flooding has put fresh scrutiny on the systems in place to keep Kerr County residents safe in the event of flooding. In recent years, multiple efforts in Kerr County to build a more substantial flood warning system have failed or been abandoned due to budget concerns or noise complaints.
    


            As the urgent search of at least 160 missing people continues in the aftermath of the devastating flooding in Central Texas, concerns are growing over the systems meant to notify residents in emergency situations.
    


            It comes as President Donald Trump will visit the region today.
    


Here's what we learned yesterday:



CNN's Ollie Leltsov, Danya Gainor, Casey Tolan, Curt Devine, Andrew Freedman, Melanie Hicken, Pamela Brown, Shoshana Dubnow, Karina Tsui, Tristen Rouse, Christine Server, Kathleen Magramo, Leigh Waldman and Joel Williams contributed reporting.



            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to request additional counties be added to President Donald Trump's major disaster declaration following the flooding in central Texas.
    


            “Five counties – Burnet, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson – are requested to be eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance programs, and four counties – Kendall, Kimble, Menard, and San Saba – are requested to be eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program,” the governor's office said in a statement yesterday.



            On Sunday, Trump approved the governor's request for a major disaster declaration for Kerr County. The approval allows qualifying Texans who sustained damage to apply for grant funding to assist with repair and recovery expenses.

A bizarre promotional video targeting American tourists and inviting them to travel to Afghanistan has been released by a local tour operator. The 50‑second clip opens with a mock hostage scenario before shifting to scenic lakes, rugged mountains, rifles, tanks, and outdoor meals.

The video, published over the weekend by the Raza Afghanistan tourism agency, quickly went viral. Its release is said to have been timed to coincide with US Independence Day on July 4. The caption accompanying the post reads: “The mountains of Afghanistan are ready and steady to host the most of,” and includes emojis of the US flag and a bald eagle.

The opening scene is reminiscent of Taliban hostage execution videos, featuring three hooded figures kneeling as one fighter ominously declares: “We have one message for America.” Then, one of the hoods is removed, revealing a smiling man who gives a thumbs‑up and says: “Welcome to Afghanistan!”

The tone abruptly shifts into a montage intercutting shots of tanks, pick‑up trucks carrying armed fighters, lakeside swims with assault rifles, and Western visitors tasting Afghan cuisine in colorful tents. One casually inspects a rifle marked “Property of US Government,” quipping, “It's not even on safety.”

Earlier this month, Russia officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country in the world to establish formal diplomatic ties with the Islamist authorities in Kabul.

Shortly after, media reports surfaced claiming that Russian tour companies had begun advertising trips to Taliban‑ruled Afghanistan, with week‑long packages priced at approximately 235,000 rubles ($3,000) and departures planned for mid‑July.

However, Aleksan Mkrtchyan, vice president of the Alliance of Russian Travel Agencies, denied the claims, stating that package tours to the Islamic Emirate are impossible due to safety concerns. He acknowledged however, that individual travel arrangements are possible, provided that tourists accept full responsibility for their own safety.

US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to make a “major statement” regarding Russia and the settlement of the Ukraine conflict in the coming days.

The announcement comes after Trump criticized his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this week, accusing him of not wanting to stop the fighting with Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow treats Trump's comments “calmly” and remains committed to finding a diplomatic solution with Kiev and rebuilding ties with Washington.

In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Trump again stressed that he is “disappointed in Russia, but we will see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

“I think I will have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,” he said, declining to reveal any further details.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the ASEAN forum in Malaysia on Thursday. Washington's top diplomat said afterwards that they talked about “new and different” ideas on resolving the Ukraine conflict. When asked by journalists on Friday about his discussions with Rubio, Lavrov said he would reply in Trump's style. “As if I would tell you,” he stated.

The US president said that he expects the Senate to vote in the legislation, spearheaded by hawkish Senator Lindsey Graham, that would impose a 500% tariff on countries buying Russian energy and other goods in an attempt to make Moscow compromise on the Ukraine conflict.

“They are going to pass a very major and very biting sanctions bill, but it is up to the president as to whether or not he wants to exercise it,” Trump said, referring to a clause in the legislation granting the head of state the power to halt the tariff for up to 180 days.

On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov asserted that Moscow will adapt if the US imposes 500% secondary tariffs on Russian trade partners and maintain its sovereign course. “We know how to work in these conditions,” he noted.

Britain and France have unveiled a new agreement to coordinate their nuclear arsenals more closely, citing what they see as heightened “threats” to security in Europe. Moscow has called the move part of NATO's overtly anti-Russian policy, warning it would factor the agreement into its military planning.

In a joint statement on Thursday, the two governments said that British and French nuclear weapons are aimed at protecting the two nations' vital interests, adding that “our nuclear forces are independent, but can be coordinated and contribute significantly to the overall security of the alliance.”

Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the so-called Northward declaration, warning NATO adversaries that they “will know that any extreme threat to this continent would prompt a response from our two nations.”

Meanwhile, Macron described the pact as “a message that our partners and adversaries must hear.” However, he rejected suggestions that the pact was linked to plans for a coalition to support Ukraine if there is a ceasefire with Russia.

London and Paris have also committed to expanding their jointly deployable units and moving them toward full warfighting readiness to deter or counter potential adversaries.

Britain is estimated to maintain around 225 nuclear warheads, while France has roughly 290, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. For comparison's sake, both the US and Russia possess in excess of 5,000 warheads.

In response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov cautioned that Moscow could not ignore the combined potential of Britain and France as Washington's closest NATO allies.

“All this fits into the general, frankly speaking, anti-Russian canvas of NATO policy… Once such interaction is formalized and placed on a stable, solid foundation, we will take this into account not only politically, but also in our military planning,” Ryabkov told RBK business daily.

In March, Macron proposed starting a debate on extending France's nuclear umbrella over Paris' allies in Europe, although Starmer at the time opposed any spread of nuclear weapons to new countries.

Russia's Foreign Ministry at the time blasted Macron's idea, accusing him of “nuclear blackmail,” saying France appeared eager to become “the nuclear patron of all Europe.” The ministry also warned that the move would not enhance the security of France or its allies.

MOSCOW, July 11. /TASS/. Iran's intellectual elite will continue to defend the country's nuclear program as its legitimate right, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said in an interview with TASS.

Asked whether Tehran plans to resume production of enriched uranium in the medium term following the US and Israeli strikes, the diplomat replied, ""This aggression has strengthened Iran's determination to build a desirable future for the country, and as we go toward that goal, our intellectual and scientific elite will continue to adamantly defend its nuclear program as an indisputable and legitimate right.""

""Iran's nuclear capabilities are internal, domestic, so damage to infrastructure would be ineffective because nuclear expertise can't be destroyed by bombardment and missiles,"" the ambassador said. ""We have not had and do not have any demands other than respect for international law.""

Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Nine days later, the US entered the fray. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East.

Men from Mexico, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar were removed from the US and flown to the war-torn country

Tom Homan, the US border czar, has said he does not know what happened to the eight men deported to South Sudan after the Trump administration resumed sending migrants to countries that are not their place of origin, known as third countries.

“They're free as far as we're concerned. They're free, they're no longer in our custody, they're in Sudan,” Homan told Politico on Friday. “Will they stay in Sudan? I don't know.”

Administration officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the US. Only one of the eight reportedly has a connection to South Sudan, which recently emerged from a civil war. The others include two people from Myanmar, two from Cuba, and one each from Vietnam, Laos and Mexico.

South Sudanese authorities said on Tuesday the men were in custody in Juba “under the care of the relevant authorities, who are screening them and ensuring their safety and wellbeing”.

The men were initially deported in May, but were held on a military base in Djibouti for weeks after a US court stopped their removal.

They were then transported to South Sudan after two US supreme court decisions: one that broadly allowed for the administration to deport migrants to third countries to which they have no connection, and a second that weighed in directly on the case of the eight men.

“We make arrangements to make sure these countries are receiving these people and there's opportunities for people, but I can't tell you – if we removed somebody to Sudan they could stay there a week and leave, I don't know,” Homan said.

He later added: “There's like a 100 different endings to this – I just don't know on every specific case what their status is.”

Country's navy announced seizure of uncrewed narco sub, first capture of such a vessel in Colombian waters

The bust was unusual – a narco submarine capable of carrying more than 1.5 tons of cocaine. There were no drugs onboard this time, but most notably, there were no traffickers.

Last week, the Colombian navy announced that it had seized an “autonomous semisubmersible”, the first seizure of such a vessel in the country's waters.

Detected near Santa Marta, off Colombia's Caribbean coast, the small grey vessel was equipped with antennas and a Starlink modem. Two surveillance cameras were also installed: one on the bow, providing a real-time view of the craft's trajectory and obstacles, and another inside to monitor the engine and transmission. Officials believe the uncrewed sub was on a trial run to transport cocaine to the United States or Europe.

“The discovery reflects a migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems that increase evasion capabilities, and which pose a growing challenge to international maritime security,” said Adm Juan Ricardo Rozo Obregón, commander of the Colombian navy.

The navy has warned that autonomous technologies are “an emerging threat that is transforming the transnational criminal landscape”, and said that it believed the vessel was operated by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug-trafficking group.

The discovery comes as Colombia – the world's leading cocaine producer – faces record-high production of the drug, fuelled by surging global demand. The country's estimated coca leaf cultivation increased from 204,000 to 253,000 hectares (504,000 to 625,000 acres) in 2023, according to the United Nations.

While traffickers have used crewed semisubmersibles for decades, the recent advent of the uncrewed vessels shows that gangs are making significant technological advances. They are also seeking new ways to eliminate the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities.

“It's definitely a sign of how creative traffickers are becoming, and how ‘narco subs' have evolved significantly in both design and technology,” said Henry Shuldiner, an investigator at the InSight Crime thinktank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs. “This unmanned model seems like the next step in that evolution.”

Shuldiner said that traffickers were testing whether removing crews – which typically involve at least four people, particularly for long transatlantic journeys – could make the lucrative trade more efficient.

“The fact that this appeared to be a test run shows traffickers are willing to invest in research and development, even if that means losing a vessel to authorities,” he said. Building a semisubmersible can cost as little as $150,000, though most estimates place the cost between $1m and $2m.

Juana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia's Institute for Development and Peace Studies, told AFP that Mexican drug cartels, which operate in Colombia, began “hiring technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine” as far back as 2017, adding that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to identify those behind the shipments.

Colombian law punishes the use, construction, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.

Nonetheless, a near-record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted crossing the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024, according to InSight Crime.

“In some years, we've seen 30 or more interdictions globally. And that's just the ones we know about,” said Shuldiner. “Some US officials estimate that only around 5% of these vessels actually get caught. So even with near-record seizures in 2024, most are still slipping through.”

While most cocaine is still smuggled on container ships, narco subs are playing a growing role, especially for long-haul, transoceanic routes, he added.

The Colombian navy said that in the first half of 2025, 10 semisubmersibles were detected in different regions of the continent, all adapted to make them difficult to track by radar, and even mobilise with partial autonomy.

Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said that while this marks the first capture in Colombian waters, it is most likely not the first deployment. “The authorities are one step behind the criminals when it comes to these things,” he said.

He warned it would be “very difficult” for Colombia and other governments to “keep up” unless countries improve information sharing and cooperation.

Globally, cocaine production soared by nearly 34% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while an estimated 25 million people used the drug, up from 17 million a decade earlier.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Protocol was ‘clearly odd' relic of regime of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, administration says in revision of directives

Bangladesh's caretaker government has overturned a longstanding protocol requiring female officials to be addressed as “sir”, calling it an “odd” relic of the regime of the ousted leader, Sheikh Hasina.

The interim administration, headed by the Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, took office last year after the former prime minister was overthrown by a student-led uprising, forcing her to flee to neighbouring India.

A statement issued by the press wing of the caretaker government late on Thursday said the directive mandating the use of “sir” for women in official roles had been “annulled”.

“During Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16-year-long autocratic rule, a directive was reportedly issued requiring public officials to address her as ‘sir',” it said. “This practice extended to other high-ranking women officials, who were – and still are – being called ‘sir', which is clearly odd.”

A new committee has been formed to revise other protocol-related directives, the statement added.

A female official told AFP that the caretaker government took the call without consulting the women in public roles.

“The tradition began during Sheikh Hasina's tenure, but many women officers supported it, finding the address gender-neutral,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Hasina, 77, who has defied orders to return to Dhaka, faces several charges at Bangladesh's international crimes tribunal for alleged crimes committed during a crackdown on the protests that led to her toppling. Responding to the charges, Hasina's Awami League party condemned the trial process and said the tribunal was a “kangaroo” court.

Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations. Prosecutors claim that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence. She has denied all allegations against her.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian assets frozen by the West should not be released until Moscow pays back at least 500 billion euros (over $580 billion) in compensation to Ukraine, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on July 10 in Rome.

The G7 countries immobilized roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets at the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, later funneling the windfall profits to Ukraine's reconstruction and defense.

The German chancellor, who met President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Italy, noted that Germany is helping Ukraine rebuild its economy also for its own reasons.

""Growth, market freedom, our energy security, as well as the extraordinary strain on our social systems caused by war refugees: all of this is linked to the war in Ukraine,"" Merz said.

The chancellor further noted that Germany has been involved in Ukraine's reconstruction efforts since the outbreak of the full-scale war.

""The reconstruction of Ukraine is not just a matter of the future... Day after day, we are ensuring that life in Ukraine can continue despite all of Russia's daily and especially nightly attacks.""

The comments come as Russia continues to intensify strikes across Ukraine and ground offensives along the front line, damaging infrastructure and putting ever greater strain on the Ukrainian economy.

Delivering opening remarks at the conference on July 10, Zelensky urged European partners to form a recovery coalition to help rebuild Ukraine, calling for an approach similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan.

The Ukrainian president also called upon Western countries to use the immobilized Russian assets — not only their proceeds — more actively to help Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.

At the event, the EU unveiled new financing worth billions of euros, including the European Flagship Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called ""the largest equity fund globally to support (Ukraine's) reconstruction."" Germany is among the countries backing the fund.

Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death, independent media outlet Astra reported on July 11, citing Chuvash Republic authorities.

The news follows speculations that Ilyin was among the Russian military personnel killed when Ukrainian forces attacked the 155th Brigade's command post in Korenevo in Russia's Kursk Oblast on July 2.

Russian Major General Mikhail Gudkov, a deputy head of the Russian Navy, was reportedly killed in the same attack. According to Russian milbloggers, 22 people in total were killed as a result of the Ukrainian HIMARS strike. Kyiv has not commented on the attack.

News of Ilyin's death and burial was initially posted on the VKontakte social media page of the Urmarsky District administration in Russia's Chuvash Republic. The post, which was later deleted, did not disclose when or where the Russian officer died.

Kyiv has accused the 155th Separate Marine Brigade of committing numerous war crimes in Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, members of the brigade are responsible for executing prisoners of war and humiliating captured Ukrainian soldiers.

Service members of the 155th Brigade have also been linked to war crimes committed during the occupation of Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel in Kyiv Oblast during the early months of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

A number of Russian high-ranking military officials have been killed throughout the full-scale invasion, both on the front lines and in the rear. The BBC Russia service has identified 10 generals and 524 lieutenant colonels and colonels killed during the invasion.

Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, making it the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign troops since World War II. The move was intended to disrupt a planned Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's Sumy Oblast and to relieve pressure on the Donetsk front.

Since then, Ukraine claims it has inflicted 63,402 Russian troop casualties in the oblast, including 25,625 killed and 971 captured. Ukrainian forces also say they have destroyed or damaged over 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment in the area.

Russia retook most of the lost territory during a renewed offensive in March 2025, supported by North Korean troops.

At a press conference in Malaysia on July 10, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also acknowledged Ukraine's need for air defenses and urged European allies to provide their Patriot batteries.

""Ukrainians need more Patriot batteries. Many European countries have them, but no one wants to part with theirs. I hope that will change,"" Rubio said.

""I hope we can convince some of our NATO partners to send these batteries to Ukraine.""

The comments followed confusion caused by what appeared to be a unilateral decision by the Pentagon to halt some of the weapons shipments en route to Ukraine, including Patriot missiles and precision munitions. Deliveries of at least some of the shipments have since then reportedly resumed, and Trump pledged to provide additional military support to Kyiv.  

The Patriots are powerful U.S.-produced air defenses that have played a key role in protecting the Ukrainian skies. They are one of the few systems capable of intercepting Russian ballistic missiles.

Ukraine operates at least six of these systems, provided over the past years by the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania.

Russia has ramped up aerial strikes against Ukraine in the past weeks, launching a record of over 740 drones and missiles on July 9. A day later, Russian forces again launched around 400 drones and 18 missiles against the country, primarily targeting Kyiv.

The Ukraine-U.S. Reconstruction Investment Fund will provide opportunities not only for U.S. companies but also for other countries, representatives of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation said during a workshop at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 11. 

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent the attack had destroyed a section of a key pipeline supplying Russian military-industrial facilities in Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, and Sverdlovsk oblasts.

Ukraine and the EU will allocate 100 million euro ($117 million) to boost battlefield-driven solutions under the newly-launched BraveTech EU initiative, announced at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 11.

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, war has become a daily reality for thousands of Ukrainian children. Some Ukrainian military units, such as the Azov Brigade, offer boot camps for teenagers to teach them the basics of self-defense, first aid, dry firing, and other survival skills — helping them prepare for both the realities of today and the uncertainties of the future.



Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death.

A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 53 over Kursk Oblast and 13 over Tula Oblast.

""As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed,"" Ukraine's military intelligence said.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv on July 14 for a week-long visit, he told a Novyny Live journalist at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

The deal is one of the largest publicly disclosed investments in Ukrainian defense technology since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Regional authorities reported casualties in at least six Ukrainian oblasts over the past day. 

The media investigation has identified 523 foreign nationals from 28 countries who were killed while serving in the Russian army.

During several months of testing, the system intercepted nearly 550 Russian drones over Kyiv Oblast, an official said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Despite Trump throwing his weight behind a push for a 60-day truce between Israel and Hamas, no breakthrough was announced during Netanyahu's visit.Alex Brandon/The Associated Press

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to Washington this week netted President Donald Trump another nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize he covets, but the ceasefire the U.S. leader sought for the war in Gaza didn't emerge.

Despite Trump throwing his weight behind a push for a 60-day truce between Israel and Hamas, no breakthrough was announced during Netanyahu's visit, a disappointment for a president who wants to be known as a peacemaker and has hinged his reputation on being a dealmaker.

“He prides himself or being able to make deals, so this is another test case,” said Rachel Brandenburg, the Israel Policy Forum's Washington managing director and senior fellow.

Trump's ability to strike a ceasefire deal in the 21-month war will reveal the boundaries of his influence with Netanyahu, especially after their recent joint strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities that both leaders touted at the White House this week.

Beyond the back-to-back meetings Trump and Netanyahu had at the White House this week, there was little public evidence of progress at a time when the Republican U.S. president is pushing to end the fighting.

Nearly 800 killed while receiving aid in Gaza, UN human rights office says

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that when it comes to a ceasefire in Gaza, “we're closer than we've been in quite a while and we're hopeful, but we also recognize there's still some challenges in the way.”

Rubio, who spoke to reporters while traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, also said that Trump “wants to see a ceasefire and we've invested a lot of time and energy.”

Beyond ending the bloodshed, ending the war in Gaza would give Trump more leeway to strike some of the broader agreements he seeks in the Middle East, such as expanding the Abraham Accords that started in his first term and normalizing relations with Syria's new government.

“He wants to be the one who gets hostages home and see the war in Gaza end so he can move on to some of these bigger deals,” Brandenburg said.

Even if a truce is reached, Netanyahu has promised fighting will continue if necessary until Hamas is destroyed. The militant group, meanwhile, has conditioned the release of the remaining hostages on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, a stipulation Israel has been unwilling to accept.

As Israel and Hamas move closer to a ceasefire agreement, Israel says it wants to maintain troops in a southern corridor of the Gaza Strip – a condition that could derail the talks. 

The Associated Press

It's unclear how much pressure Trump put on Netanyahu in their private talks this week. But the two leaders came into the visit seeming more aligned than ever – at least for now – fresh off the president having twice come to the Israeli leader's assistance.

Trump made the risky move to join Israel's attacks on Iran last month, delivering pivotal U.S. firepower while alarming world leaders and some of Trump's “America first” supporters. Trump also inserted himself into Israel's domestic affairs, calling for Netanyahu's yearslong corruption trial to be thrown out.

That's a marked turnaround in their relationship, which had appeared somewhat strained in recent years.

Trump shocked some of his fellow Republicans and staunch supporters of Israel by publicly criticizing Netanyahu not long after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the conflict.

Opinion: Tactics without strategy: How Trump's weakness and Netanyahu's self-interest exploded in Iran

He said that Netanyahu “was not prepared” for the attack from Hamas and that Netanyahu had “let us down” just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Even during his last visit to the White House earlier this year, Netanyahu seemed caught off guard when Trump announced the U.S. would hold talks with Iran over its nuclear deal rather than embrace Netanyahu's push for military pressure.

With their military objectives aligning for a time on Iran, the Israeli leader has worked to foster a warmer relationship.

In a video he released after the U.S. strikes, Netanyahu spoke – in English instead of Hebrew – of the “unshakeable alliance” between their countries while repeatedly praising Trump.

“His leadership today has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace,” Netanyahu said.

In his visit to Washington this week, the Israeli leader also showed he knows how to praise the president in a way that matters greatly to him when he unveiled a letter in front of reporters and cameras to announce he had nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Those gestures, though, may only carry him so far as Trump pushes for a deal that Netanyahu may not be able to accept.

“I think if Netanyahu stands in the way too much for too long of the sort of loftier objectives Trump has set out for himself,” Brandenburg said, “Netanyahu will be cast aside as more of a problem than an asset.”

Netanyahu, like many Israelis, believes Trump is the greatest friend they have ever had in the White House and is deeply grateful for the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites last month.

But the Israeli leader is also under mounting public pressure to end the war as hostages languish in captivity and more Israeli soldiers are killed in guerrilla-style attacks.

Doctors at Gaza City's Al-Helou hospital said that they are struggling to care for newborn and premature babies, who are crammed into single incubators, due to crippling fuel shortages.

Reuters

Israel's military success against Iran has given him some political capital, but if he ends the war while leaving Hamas intact, he will have broken his repeated promise of “total victory.”

His far-right coalition partners have threatened to bolt if he does that, sparking early elections that could end his nearly unbroken 16 years in power and leave him more vulnerable to long-standing corruption charges.

That may prove too heavy a price for delivering the kind of lasting ceasefire sought by Trump and demanded by Hamas. Instead, Netanyahu, who is seen as a masterful politician by friends and foes alike, is expected to thread the needle.

In a video statement on Thursday, Netanyahu said that he would agree to a “temporary” 60-day ceasefire in return for the release of half the hostages remaining in Gaza, many of whom are believed dead, and that he would begin negotiations on ending the war.

But he conditioned any lasting ceasefire on Hamas giving up its arms – something the militants have refused to do as long as Israel occupies parts of Gaza.

If Hamas can be disarmed through negotiations, “so much the better,” Netanyahu said. “If it is not achieved through negotiations in 60 days, we will achieve it in other ways – by using force.”

First Liberty Building and Loan largely drew investors from religious and political networks which were rocked by the company's collapse.Jeff Amy/The Associated Press

A prominent Georgia Republican was running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million, federal officials alleged in a complaint filed Thursday.

The civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said First Liberty Building and Loan, controlled by Brant Frost IV, lied to investors about its business of making high-interest loans to companies. Instead, investigators said, it raised more money to repay earlier investors.

Frost is alleged to have taken more than $19 million of investor funds for himself, his family and affiliated companies even as the business was going broke, spending $160,000 on jewellery and $335,000 with a rare coin dealer. Frost is also said to have spent $320,000 to rent a vacation home over multiple years in Kennebunkport, Maine, the town where the family of late president George H. W. Bush famously spent summers.

The SEC said Frost kept writing checks even after the commission began its investigation

First Liberty said last month that it would stop making loans and paying interest and principal to investors in those loans. The company said it was not answering phone calls or emails.

First Liberty has not responded to an e-mail seeking comment, and no one was present at its office Thursday evening in Newnan, a suburb southwest of Atlanta. A lawyer who acts as the company's registered agent for corporate purposes said earlier that he had no information.

The collapse rocked the religious and political networks that the business drew investors from. It also could have ramifications in state Republican politics, cutting off funding to the far-right candidates that Frost and his family have favoured. Investigators said Frost spent $570,000 from investor funds on political contributions.

The SEC said the business had only $2.67 million in cash as of May 30, although regulators are also seeking to claw back money from Frost and associated companies. With 300 investors out $140 million, that means the average investor put in nearly $500,000.

First Liberty said it made loans to companies that needed cash while they waited for more conventional loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. It charged high rates of interest – 18% on some loans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. First Liberty promised investors equally high rates of return – 16% on the 18% loans.

In recent months the business advertised heavily on conservative radio shows promising “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors.”

“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” Justin C. Jeffries, associate director of enforcement for the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.

The company has represented that it is “co-operating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business.” The SEC said Frost and his companies agreed to the SEC's enforcement actions “with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.”

While the SEC says there were loans to companies, as many as 90% of those companies have defaulted. By 2021 the company was running as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint said, even as Frost withdrew increasing amounts of money.

The business is being investigated by the Georgia secretary of state for possible violations of securities law said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for the office.

A 2023 document obtained by the AP is titled as a “promissory note,” and Sinners said anyone issuing promissory notes is supposed to be registered with Georgia securities officials.

Sinners encouraged any victims to contact the state Securities Division.

Federal prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they are considering criminal charges. Sometimes both an SEC civil case and a federal criminal case are filed over investment frauds.

Frost has been an important player in Georgia politics since 1988, when he co-ordinated televangelist Pat Robertson's Republican presidential bid in the state. His son, Brant Frost V, is chairman of the Coweta County Republican Party, where the company is based, and is a former second vice-chair of the state Republican Party. Daughter Katie Frost is Republican chairman of the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Coweta County and other areas southwest of Atlanta.

At last month's state Republican convention, Katie Frost chaired a nominating committee that recommended delegates re-elect state Party Chairman Josh McKoon. Delegates followed that recommendation, rejecting a number of insurgent candidates.

Smishing is a sort of portmanteau of SMS and phishing in which a text message is used to try to get the target to click on a link and provide personal information.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

If it seems like your phone has been blowing up with more spam text messages recently, it probably is.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says so-called smishing attempts appear to be on the rise, thanks in part to new technologies that allow for co-ordinated bulk attacks.

The centre's communications outreach officer Jeff Horncastle says the agency has actually received fewer fraud reports in the first six months of 2025, but that can be misleading because so few people actually alert the centre to incidents.

He says smishing is “more than likely increasing” with help from artificial intelligence tools that can craft convincing messages or scour data from security breaches to uncover new targets.

The warning comes as the Competition Bureau sent a recent alert about the tactic because it says many people are seeing more suspicious text messages.

Smishing is a sort of portmanteau of SMS and phishing in which a text message is used to try to get the target to click on a link and provide personal information.

The ruse comes in many forms but often involves a message that purports to come from a real organization or business urging immediate action to address an alleged problem.

It could be about an undeliverable package, a suspended bank account or news of a tax refund.

Horncastle says it differs from more involved scams such as a text invitation to call a supposed job recruiter, who then tries to extract personal or financial information by phone.

Nevertheless, he says a text scam might be quite sophisticated since today's fraudsters can use artificial intelligence to scan data leaks for personal details that bolster the hoax, or use AI writing tools to help write convincing text messages.

“In the past, part of our messaging was always: watch for spelling mistakes. It's not always the case now,” he says.

“Now, this message could be coming from another country where English may not be the first language but because the technology is available, there may not be spelling mistakes like there were a couple of years ago.”

The Competition Bureau warns against clicking on suspicious links and forwarding texts to 7726 (SPAM), so that the cellular provider can investigate further. It also encourages people to delete smishing messages, block the number and ignore texts even if they ask to reply with “STOP” or “NO.”

Horncastle says the centre received 886 reports of smishing in the first six months of 2025, up to June 30. That's trending downwards from 2,546 reports in 2024, which was a drop from 3,874 in 2023. That too, was a drop in reports from 7,380 in 2022. 

But those numbers don't quite tell the story, he says. 

“We get a very small percentage of what's actually out there. And specifically when we're looking at phishing or smishing, the reporting rate is very low. So generally we say that we estimate that only five to 10 per cent of victims report fraud to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.”

Horncastle says it's hard to say for sure how new technology is being used, but he notes AI is a frequent tool for all sorts of nefarious schemes such as manipulated photos, video and audio.

“It's more than likely increasing due to different types of technology that's available for fraudsters,” Horncastle says of smishing attempts.

“So we would discuss AI a lot where fraudsters now have that tool available to them. It's just reality, right? Where they can craft phishing messages and send them out in bulk through automation through these highly sophisticated platforms that are available.”

The Competition Bureau's deceptive marketing practices directorate says an informed public is the best protection against smishing.

“The bureau is constantly assessing the marketplace and through our intelligence capabilities is able to know when scams are on the rise and having an immediate impact on society,” says deputy commissioner Josephine Palumbo.

“That's where these alerts come in really, really handy.”

She adds that it's difficult to track down fraudsters who sometimes use prepaid SIM cards to shield their identity when targeting victims.

“Since SIM cards lack identification verification, enforcement agencies like the Competition Bureau have a hard time in actually tracking these perpetrators down,” Palumbo says.

Fraudsters can also spoof phone numbers, making it seem like a text has originated with a legitimate agency such as the Canada Revenue Agency, Horncastle adds.

“They might choose a number that they want to show up randomly or if they're claiming to be a financial institution, they may make that financial institutions' number show up on the call display,” he says.

“We've seen (that) with the CRA and even the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, where fraudsters have made our phone numbers show up on victims' call display.”

US President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs against Canada from next month in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney. The EU is expecting to receive a similar letter on Friday.

Canada is facing a 35% tariff on its exports to the US at the start of August, according to a letter released on US President Donald Trump's Truth Social media platform.

In the letter, Trump told Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney that the new tariff would come into effect on August 1.

The neighbors have been in trade negotiations to reach a deal by July 21, but Trump's threat appears to have shifted that deadline.

The US president has said that the European Union would also receive a letter, suggesting that the EU's plan to get a deal by August 1 was not going well.

""Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work toward the revised deadline of August 1,"" Carney posted on social media platform X Thursday night. 

Canada and Mexico are working to meet Trump's demands in an effort to keep the USMCA — the free trade agreement linking the three countries — on track.

Trump has taken aim at his neighbors to the north and south, accusing them of not doing enough to clamp down on irregular migration and the flow of drugs across the border, specifically fentanyl.

""If Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,"" Trump wrote.

Shortly before Trump announced that he would be applying a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, Trump told NBC News that he was planning blanket tariffs on other trading partners, who he said, would be given notification letters ""today or tomorrow.""

""We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,"" Trump told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone call. 

""I'd like to do it today,"" Trump said, and added: ""I'm talking European Union, which is, as you know, many countries, and Canada. We'll be putting them out over the next couple of hours.""

Following the announcement, both EU and US stock futures dipped in Asia as trading started on Friday morning.

Trump unexpectedly delayed the deadline for his negotiations with many trade partners this week from July 9 to August 1.

The EU currently faces 50% US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports, 25% on cars and car parts and 10% on most other products. The EU has said it would impose countermeasures if no deal can be made with the US.

On April 2, in what Trump called ""Liberation Day,"" a slew of so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs were announced, with 20% being imposed on the EU. These were later taken back to give time for negotiations. The tariff announcements came under considerable criticism after sparking global market turmoil, but some suggested they were part of Trump's plan to force countries to offer the US a better deal.

Media report that police have confirmed the identity of the young backpacker, who went missing in early July.

A German backpacker who went missing in western Australia almost two weeks ago has been found alive, media reported on Friday.

Police have confirmed that the person found is 26-year-old Carolina Wilga, Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reported.

""She's been ravaged by mosquitoes. She's obviously been through an amazing journey, a trauma, and no doubt will be a testimony demonstrating her bravery in the circumstances out there,"" Western Australia police inspector Martin Glynn told reporters.

A passerby ran into Wilga on a path in the bush, Australian media reported. 

Her reappearance follows a large-scale search that dragged on for days.

The German backpacker had last been seen in the town of Beacon, north-east of Perth on June 29. The first clue police found since then was coming across her van on Thursday in a remote area of the Australian outback.

Wilga's phone had been switched off, with local media reports saying she had previously kept in regular contact with her family in Germany.

Western Australia (WA) Police Acting Inspector Jessica Securo told broadcaster ABC that the search Wilga had been concentrated
around her Mitsubishi van that had been found near Karroun Hill, around 300 kilometres (186 miles) north-east of Perth.

Police said the vehicle appeared to have suffered mechanical issues and was found with plastic orange traction tracks placed beneath the rear wheels, apparently after getting stuck in the terrain.

Securo told ABC Radio Perth, before reports she had been found emerged, that she had likely become lost in that area.

""The terrain — it's outback country and there's large rocky outcrops, so although there's a number of tracks, you can see how it would be easy to become lost or disorientated in that area if you didn't know it well.""

Hundreds gathered at the cabaret and tourist attraction in the French capital to see the famous windmill's sails start turning again over a year after they were knocked down during a storm.

Hundreds of locals and tourists gathered Thursday night outside the famed Paris Moulin Rouge cabaret and nightclub to see its iconic windmill sails start turning again.

The iconic, 12-metre (40-foot), red wings had been out of action since they were knocked down by high winds 14 months ago.

The occasion was marked by 60 dancers performing the Moulin Rouge's signature can-can dance in the street next to Place Blanche in the Montmartre district of Paris.

Fireworks were also set off from the roof of the club, which claims to attract some 600,000 visitors each year.

""The sails have always turned at the Moulin Rouge, so we had to restore this Parisian symbol to Paris, to France, and to the state it was in before,"" said Jean-Victor Clerico, the cabaret's managing director.

The accident in April 2024 was blamed on a failure in the windmill's central axis.

The blades collapsed overnight after the venue had closed. Nobody was injured in the incident.

New aluminum blades were installed in time for the Paris Olympics last summer.

But the wings have remained motionless because of delays with a new electric motor, which also powers the hundreds of light bulbs that illuminate the iconic landmark.

The Moulin Rouge, French for ""red windmill,"" was immortalized by 19th century French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and later brought to modern audiences by Baz Luhrmann's eponymous 2001 film musical starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.

Opened in 1889, the famous red windmill quickly became an emblem of Parisian nightlife during the Belle Époque (1871-1914).

The cabaret house is one of the most visited attractions in the French capital, sharing its status as a world-famous landmark with the likes of the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame Cathedral.

The US will impose a new tariff of 35 per cent on Canadian goods, Donald Trump has said.

In a letter released on his social media platform, Mr Trump told Canada's prime minister the new rate would go into effect on August 1 and would go up if Canada retaliated.

Canada also faces a 50 per cent tariff on copper.

Despite warming relations between the two countries, this latest development is likely to stall trade negotiations and is a blow to Mr Carney, who had been hoping to strike a deal by July 21.

The US president also accused Canada of contributing to the nation's fentanyl crisis because of their “failure to stop” the drugs from “pouring” into the country.

“If Canada works with me to stop the flow of fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,” Mr Trump wrote.

He also complained about tariff and trade barriers causing “unsustainable” trade deficits against the US – claiming it poses a threat to the American economy and its national security.

Canada is the largest buyer of US exports and the second-largest American trading partner. 

Earlier this month, Mr Carney dropped a digital services tax that Mr Trump said was targeting US technology companies.

Canada is not the only country to feel the bite of Mr Trump's tariff wars, which has included many of the world's largest economies, and world leaders have scrambled to appease the White House and secure exemptions.

Since Monday, more than 20 tariff-related letters have been issued by Mr Trump.

He told NBC News that any countries that had not received a letter regarding new tariff regimes would face blanket tariffs of 15-20 per cent.

Mr Trump has also teased that countries that import pharmaceuticals into the US will be hit with a rate of 200 per cent after a period of “about a year”. 

He added he will make further announcements on tariffs involving seven countries on Friday.

Mr Trump has set a deadline of August 1st for countries to avert his levies.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ready to negotiate a permanent ceasefire in Gaza during a 60-day truce but only if it was demilitarised.

The Israeli prime minister delivered his comments shortly before flying home from Washington.

His two meetings with Donald Trump had raised hopes of a breakthrough to their highest level in months, but he leaves with little sign of progress.

“At the beginning of this ceasefire, we will enter negotiations for a permanent end to the war,” he said in a video message, adding that Israel's key demand was that “Hamas lays down its weapons” and no longer has “governing or military capabilities”.

“If this can be achieved through negotiations, great. If it cannot be achieved through negotiations within 60 days, we will achieve it through other means, by using force, the force of our heroic army,” he added.

His words illustrate one of the barriers to implementing a ceasefire.

Shortly before welcoming Mr Netanayhu to the White House on Monday, Mr Trump said he was hoping for an agreement before the end of the week.

At the same time, the two sides have been holding indirect negotiations in Qatar where Hamas officials have agreed to free 10 of 20 hostages still alive in captivity.

But among the sticking points are its demand for the free flow of aid into Gaza, Israel's military withdrawal from the territory, and guarantees of a lasting peace.

Earlier in the day, Mr Netanyahu attended a memorial service for two Israeli embassy staffers who were shot dead in May.

Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, were colleagues who had been on the verge of getting engaged.

A suspect was arrested in the shootings and shouted “Free Palestine” as he was led away.

“We embrace you with all our hearts,” said Mr Netanyahu. “Yaron and Sarah, beloved in life and inseparable in death.”

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 57,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, since Hamas launched its deadly October 7 attack in 2023.

On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike killed 10 children and six adults near a medical centre in the central Gaza Strip, local authorities said.

American officials remain hopeful that progress can be made soon.

“We're closer than we've been in quite a while, and we're hopeful, but we also recognise there's still some challenges in the way,” Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said at the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Harvard is considering creating a centre for conservative scholarship as it seeks to end its months-long dispute with Donald Trump.

America's oldest university is said to have discussed the idea with potential donors, which could cost up to $1 billion, to “promote and support viewpoint diversity”, The Wall Street Journal reported.

It has been locked in a dispute with the Trump administration for months over claims that it has failed to tackle anti-Semitism on campus while pushing discriminatory diversity programmes, with Mr Trump stripping it of billions of dollars in federal funds.

The US president said last month the government was close to striking a deal with Harvard, although this week it announced plans to subpoena the institution for data on foreign students.

Setting up a conservative centre would likely be interpreted as a concession to the president and Right-wing critics, who have long complained elite universities are liberal bastions with no political diversity.

The initiative, which could be modelled along the lines of Stanford's Hoover Institution, has been under discussion for several years but recently gained steam following the pro-Palestinian protests that broke out across college campuses last year.

A Harvard spokesman said the initiative being discussed “will ensure exposure to the broadest ranges of perspectives on issues, and will not be partisan”.

It would “model the use of evidence-based, rigorous logic and a willingness to engage with opposing views” and “promote and support viewpoint diversity”, he added.

In 2023, a survey by the student newspaper found that just three per cent of faculty at Harvard identified as conservative.

Harvard struck a defiant stance earlier this year when it refused to change its hiring, admissions and other internal procedures following demands by the Trump administration, hiring a high-powered legal team who accused it of trying to “invade university freedoms”.

However, Mr Trump announced last month the two sides were negotiating as the government froze federal funding, attempted to ban it from enrolling foreign students, opened investigations and accused it of breaking the law.

Analysis by The Wall Street Journal has found the university would be left with a budget shortfall of around $1 billion if Mr Trump followed through on all of his threats.

On Tuesday, Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, said the administration was “negotiating hard” with Harvard and that “we're getting there”.

However, tensions flared again on Wednesday when the Department of Homeland Security announced it would subpoena the university for information about its foreign students, accusing it of allowing them to “advocate for violence and terrorism on campus”.

The same day, the education department declared that administration probes had found the university had violated federal anti-discrimination laws in its treatment of Jewish students.

Harvard University has been approached for comment.

Donald Trump's so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week, has been described as a monstrous piece of legislation. In this exclusive interview for Truthout, world-renowned progressive economist Robert Pollin provides an overview of this “disgraceful” federal budget bill. Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

CJ Polychroniou: Trump's so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” has now become law, achieving what ultra-conservatives have been fighting for decades, which are huge tax breaks and major cuts to social safety net programs. Of course, there is a lot more reactionary stuff included in this megabill, such as hundreds of billions of dollars devoted to Trump's anti-immigration agenda and derailing the green transition by taking an axe to clean energy and boosting, in turn, fossil fuel production. In sum, I think Ed Kilgore's claim that this 940-page bill “is, in fact, the single most sweeping piece of legislation in American history” is quite accurate, although some of its effects won't be felt for some time. Can you discuss specifically the economic and social repercussions of Trump's megabill, especially in light of the view that the U.S. is the most unequal high-income country in the world?

Robert Pollin: Trump's federal budget bill is disgraceful along multiple dimensions. We can start with its egregious distributional impacts. The bill will make the rich still richer through tax cuts while attacking the living standards, including the health and food security, of working people and the poor. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Trump and company claim that people at all income levels will benefit from the bill's tax cuts. There is a tiny sliver of truth in this. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), the Trump tax provisions will deliver an average of $40 in savings to the lowest 20 percent of income earners in 2026. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent will end up $66,000 richer. This recalls the famous observation by Anatole France in 1894 that, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.” 

But even these figures do not conclude the story. ITEP also notes that, once we also account for the impact of Trump's tariffs — with these tariffs being a tax on imported products — those in the lowest 20 percent income bracket will not keep their $40 in benefits, but rather end up worse off by about $300. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent are still better off by about $58,000. 

Much more punishing still for lower-income people are the spending cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program that now covers 85 million low-income and disabled people, along with other health funding cuts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that, through the Trump measure, at least 17 million people will lose their coverage by 2034. In addition, cuts to the federal food security program (SNAP), on which 42 million people now depend, could  eliminate this support for up to 5 million people. 

Moreover, this purposeful Trump project to shower money on the rich while depriving lower-income people of health care and food arrives after nearly 50 years of neoliberal policy dominance had already skewed income and wealth inequality to extreme levels. For example, the average wage for non-supervisory workers as of 2023 was roughly equal, at about $28 an hour, to where it was in 1972 (controlling for inflation), even though average worker productivity had increased two-and-a-half-fold over this period. Meanwhile, the average CEO's pay was 30 times higher than the average worker in 1972, but exploded to 290 times higher by 2023. In other words, the average worker's annual income remained roughly constant at around $50,000 per year over this 50-year span, while the average CEO's pay skyrocketed from $1.5 million to nearly $15 million.

We have opportunities right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even in the face of Trump.

Under Joe Biden's four years in office, some modest progress was made toward countering this rising inequality trend, including through Biden's support for union organizing drives and through enforcing existing (but long-neglected) anti-monopoly laws. Trump and company are now committed to wiping out these small gains. This is while Trump stridently proclaims his commitment to working people and while, to date, large segments of the working class have been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.

Of course, one centerpiece of Trump's appeal to the U.S. working class has been his brutal attacks on immigrants, including those with legal status as well as undocumented people. To support this program, the bill allocates an average of more than $20 billion per year through 2029 to build new immigrant detention centers and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding more than doubles the current ICE budget. Trump and company claim that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country, that most of them are criminals, that they are stealing jobs from U.S.-born workers, and that they are draining the public schools, hospitals and other programs of resources without paying taxes to support these public programs. 

None of these claims are remotely true. In fact, according to the best available evidence, the population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has not changed significantly since 2005, varying between about 11–12 million people overall.  Moreover, all immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than the U.S.-born, including both violent and nonviolent crimes.  In terms of taxes and financing public programs, as of the most recent 2022 data, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, amounting to an average of nearly $9,000 per undocumented immigrant.  Furthermore, more than one-third of all taxes contributed by undocumented immigrants are funding programs that they are unable to access. That is, they are paying into Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, but are receiving no benefits in return. This is also while, in 2023, the official unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers was 3.6 percent, the lowest figure on record. 

What about the environmental repercussions? How does Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill” impact U.S. climate policy, and what does it mean for global climate change?

Trump's bill is one more weapon amid his relentless wave of attacks against any and all efforts to avert the mounting climate catastrophes. Even prior to the bill's passage, the Trump administration had already introduced, according to Columbia University's Climate Backtracker, more than 200 measures to “scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and adaptation measures.” 

Trump has also fired hundreds of government scientists and installed climate change deniers into critical government positions. The Trump bill itself repeals or phases out the tax credits for solar and wind energy investments, electric vehicle purchases, and making home energy-efficiency improvements that were important features of the Biden Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The impact of the overall Trump program on the climate will be severe, as intended. U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions — the main cause of global heating — have fallen by roughly 20 percent over the past 20 years. Biden's policies did contribute to this downward trend, even while the rate of emissions reductions remained insufficient relative to the global climate stabilization goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Trump's policies will stop even these modest gains over the short term. If Trump's program is allowed to remain in place, the likelihood for achieving zero emissions by 2050 becomes nil.   

How can we fight back effectively? For starters, we need to proclaim loudly the reality that clean energy investments are delivering money and jobs in all regions of the U.S., including in red states. Thus, wind power is thriving in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Moreover, at the end of Biden's presidency, West Virginia had received about $5 billion and Pennsylvania about $9 billion in new clean energy investment commitments tied to Biden's IRA. It is hard to believe that working people in these and other states will be okay with these projects folding, and the jobs generated by them foregone, all thanks to Trump. 

The CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump's bill will generate an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10 years.

Still more: Investments in clean renewable energy and high efficiency are now, by far, the cheapest ways to deliver energy to consumers. Even Trump's own Energy Department's most current report on comparative electricity costs confirms this. It estimates that electricity generated by onshore wind and solar projects that begin operating in 2030 will cost between 3–3.2 cents per kilowatt hour. The natural gas price will be more than twice as high, at 6.5 cents.

We have opportunities right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even in the face of Trump. One important example was the passage of the Climate Change Superfund law in New York State last December, right before Trump took office. Under this measure, oil and gas companies will pay an average of $3 billion a year for the next 25 years for climate adaptation and resilience measures throughout the state. This victory in New York followed from the successful campaign to enact a similar measure in Vermont earlier in 2024.  Comparable bills are now advancing in Massachusetts, California, and Maryland.

This federal budget bill is projected to add trillions of dollars to the nation's debt load and widen deficits. Is the U.S. in the “fast lane” to what Elon Musk calls “debt slavery?”      

Elon Musk and his late, unlamented leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), demonstrated both unbridled malice and a buffoonish level of ignorance regarding the operations of the federal government. Moving on to at least minimally serious analysts, the CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump's bill will generate an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10 years. Increased spending on attacking and deporting immigrants as well as increased military spending will cost the government another roughly $30 billion per year. This brings the total average costs of Trump's bill to nearly $500 billion per year.

Meanwhile, according to the CBO, the spending cuts for health care, food security, and clean energy will together amount to an average total of about $170 billion per year. Overall then, the CBO estimates that Trump's bill will expand the federal deficit by about $330 billion per year over the next decade (i.e., $500 billion in tax cuts and spending increases minus $170 billion in spending cuts). This will be on top of the government's 2024 budget deficit of nearly $1.9 trillion.

The 2024 federal deficit was equal to about 6.3 percent of last year's U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This 6.3 percent of GDP budget deficit is larger than at any other non-recession period since World War II. The government did run much larger deficits to counteract the 2008-09 Great Recession and the 2020-2021 COVID lockdown. But we are not now experiencing any kind of comparable economic crisis. As of 2024, the government's accumulated debt was also at a peacetime high of 97 percent of GDP. This is nearly three times higher than the 2007 pre-Great Recession figure, which was 35 percent of GDP. 

The most critical point is that the current deficits are not serving to prevent an economic collapse. They are rather simply helping rich people get richer, while attacking the living standards of working people and the poor, as well as continuing to lavish exorbitant funds on the military.

By running large fiscal deficits now … the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth in taxes.

Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP. That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling. Nor did the sky fall.

Still, the government's $900 billion in 2024 interest payments totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure, environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the 2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior. This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major currencies (the dollar's value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to other major currencies since Trump returned to office). 

The government's creditors are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors. Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth in taxes. Correspondingly, the government's interest payments that are now lining rich people's pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly thanks to Trump's bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building a green economy.

Advocates called the move, which also restricts minimum wage increases, ""a slap in the face to workers.""

Missouri's Republican governor on Thursday signed legislation repealing the paid sick leave portion of a ballot measure that the state's voters approved with nearly 60% support in the 2024 election.

The short-lived provision, which will officially be repealed on August 28, required Missouri employers to provide workers with an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work. Businesses with 15 or more employees were required to provide up to 56 hours of earned paid sick time per year, and businesses with fewer than 15 employees were required to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick time.

The Missouri Budget Project estimated before its passage that the ballot measure's paid sick leave benefits would reach 728,000 private-sector workers in the state.

The bill that Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed Thursday, known as H.B. 567, also restricts increases in the state's minimum wage. The voter-approved initiative called for raising the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2026 and indexing it to inflation thereafter. H.B. 567 eliminates the inflation adjustment.

The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a business lobbying group, characterized H.B. 567 as its top legislative priority. The bill was led by state Rep. Sherri Gallick (R-62) and state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter (R-6).

Kehoe's Facebook post announcing his signature was deluged with comments from Missourians decrying the governor's decision to overturn the will of the public.

“We the people collected signatures,” wrote one commenter. “We voted. And we passed Prop A into law. Remember you work for us. How dare you reverse the voice of your people?! The people you took an oath to serve.”

Missouri Jobs With Justice, which helped lead the campaign for the ballot measure, said in a statement that “with Governor Kehoe's decision to sign H.B. 567 into law, workers will again face increased economic insecurity when balancing being sick with maintaining their job.”

The group noted that Kehoe's support for repealing paid sick leave came after he “recently called a special session to approve spending millions of taxpayer dollars to subsidize billionaire-owned stadiums.” On Thursday, Kehoe also signed legislation slashing the state's capital gains tax.

“Simply put, Missouri workers and their families do not deserve to see their newly earned paid sick leave stripped away,” said Missouri Jobs With Justice. “Not only is this a slap in the face to workers asking for an opportunity to earn paid sick leave, it's an insult to over 57% of Missourians who voted for Proposition A in November.”

Throughout the process of pushing H.B. 567 through the Legislature, Missouri Republicans openly voiced contempt for voters who supported the paid sick leave and minimum wage initiative. One GOP lawmaker, state Rep. Mitch Boggs, said, “Of course the people voted for it.”

“It'd be like asking your teenager if he wanted a checkbook,” said Boggs.

A post shared by MO House Democratic Caucus (@mohousedemcaucus)

State Rep. Ashley Aune (D-14), the Democratic leader in the Missouri House, said Thursday that “the governor's action today demonstrates the absolute disdain Republicans have for working Missourians.”

“But in stripping workers of their legal right to earned sick leave,” Aune added, “the governor and his allies have probably guaranteed this issue will be back on the ballot next year as a constitutional amendment that will place worker protections beyond their reach.”

The poll's results stand in stark contrast to Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which cuts federal health care spending.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

New polling demonstrates that nearly 6 in 10 Americans are supportive of Medicare for All in the United States, with only a quarter of voters voicing opposition to a universal health care system.

According to an Economist/YouGov poll published earlier this week, 59 percent of Americans back the idea of Medicare for All. Only 27 percent of those polled said they did not support the idea.

Medicare for All was backed by a majority of respondents across all income levels polled in the survey. The only demographics with majorities opposed to the idea were Republican-, conservative- and Trump-supportive voters. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Still, among those voters, a plurality agreed that the current health care system is inadequate. While 56 percent of voters overall had an unfavorable view of the U.S. health care system, among respondents who said they voted for Trump in 2024, only 46 percent said they viewed the system favorably, while 48 percent said they did not — an indication that voters across the political spectrum recognize a failure of the status quo.

The poll showed strong support for an increase in federal health care spending. Fifty-six percent of Americans want Medicare to be funded at higher levels, the poll found, while 1 in 2 voters (49 percent) said they wanted Medicaid to be funded more. Only 17 percent said Medicaid should be funded less or eliminated entirely.

This latest poll is consistent with others that have asked respondents about the idea of universal health care coverage. A Gallup poll in December, for example, found that 62 percent of Americans believe the federal government should ensure everyone in the country has health coverage, with only 36 percent disagreeing.

The U.S. is the only wealthy country in the world that doesn't have a universal health care system. As a result, the U.S. spends the most on health care as a proportion of gross domestic product, while having the worst health outcomes among those wealthy countries. 

The Economist/YouGov survey is also the latest to demonstrate that Americans have differing values from the Trump administration, particularly when it comes to health care. While Trump's newly passed “Big Beautiful Bill” gutted Medicaid spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, poll after poll has shown that a majority of voters want just the opposite — more spending for the program, not less.

Because of cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other programs, the “Big Beautiful Bill” is predicted to have dire consequences. Indeed, one analysis of the law suggests that the cuts to health care spending will result in an average of 51,000 excess deaths annually.

Five decades ago, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin established the principle that Israel would not allow any country that calls for its destruction to acquire nuclear weapons. And beginning on June 13, it made good on this pledge. Over nearly two weeks, Israel attacked Iranian nuclear facilities in a campaign it dubbed Operation Rising Lion, seriously damaging dozens of sites across the country. Israel had bombed nuclear reactors before—in Iraq in 1981 and in Syria in 2007—but the Iranian program is much more sophisticated than either Iraq's or Syria's was. Its facilities are dispersed, deeply fortified, technologically advanced, and shielded by defenses and deterrence mechanisms, including missile arsenals and proxy forces across the Middle East. Israel's success is thus a formidable military achievement.

Yet despite its sophisticated program, Iran was on the back foot. Over the past year, many of its proxies and partners, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, had been decimated or entirely defeated. Iran's own air defenses were shown to be insufficient. That is partly why Israel, along with the United States, was able to launch the world's first-ever attack against an advanced, multilayered, and well-protected nuclear program. It also marked the first time the United States helped Israel carry out the Begin Doctrine with force.

More important, it set the scene for diplomacy in the Middle East. With Tehran weaker than it has been in ages, Israel and Washington now have a chance to secure a robust nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic—the best way to permanently end its nuclear program—and perhaps an even more comprehensive political settlement that could reshape the entire region.

Israel's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities stemmed from a convergence of two factors. The first was simply the mounting threat Iran posed. According to Israeli military intelligence analysts, Iran had been advancing toward a nuclear device and planned to significantly expand its arsenal of ballistic missiles from 3,000 to 8,000 within a few years. Iran had already translated its vision to destroy Israel into concrete plans and operational orders and had funded Hamas, which carried out the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. The Islamic Republic had also launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in April and October 2024. After decades of proxy warfare, the two countries came to blows in a direct and open confrontation.

The second factor was Iran's temporary weakness. Israel, through months of airstrikes and a ground campaign, had severely degraded the Islamic Republic's most important ally, Hezbollah. The Assad regime, another loyal Iranian friend, had collapsed. And Iran's air defenses had proven vulnerable during Israeli strikes in 2024. Israel also timed its June attacks on Iranian facilities to coincide with the end of the 60-day window U.S. President Donald Trump had set for nuclear discussions.

As a result, early June was the perfect time for Israel to go beyond the covert action and one-off strikes it had conducted before. The core objectives of Operation Rising Lion were to inflict significant and long-term damage on Iran's nuclear and missile programs, to create the conditions for a better nuclear agreement, and to further degrade Iran's network of regional proxies. Israel also hoped that the attack would destabilize the Iranian regime, potentially facilitating its collapse, and persuade Washington to act, thereby demonstrating the United States' commitment to preventing Iranian nuclearization—although these were not formal goals.



To achieve its primary aims, Israel began its operations with a precision decapitation strike that killed approximately 20 high-ranking military commanders—including Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the architect of Iran's missile strategy; and Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the armed forces—and over a dozen senior nuclear scientists. Israel then flew more than 1,200 sorties, destroying roughly 80 percent of Iran's 130 air defense batteries and achieving air dominance over Tehran—one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in the history of aerial warfare.

Israel also thoroughly damaged key Iranian nuclear facilities, including Natanz, Fordow, Isfahan, and Arak; Tehran's broader nuclear and missile industrial base; and the country's military infrastructure, such as the headquarters of the IRGC and its Quds Force. In total, Israel dropped more than 4,000 precision-guided munitions on Iran, striking distances as far as 1,400 miles from Israeli bases. The campaign underscored the advantages of high-precision, intelligence-driven, real-time airstrikes on a massive scale.

Israel also destroyed nearly 1,000 of Iran's approximately 2,500 ballistic missiles and over 200 of Iran's 450 launchers—another incredible military achievement. Consequently, the number of salvos Iran launched against Israel dropped dramatically over the course of the war, from roughly 100 missiles per day at the beginning of the conflict to an average of just 12 at the end. Israel displayed clear defensive superiority, with its multitiered missile defense architecture—including the Arrow, David's Sling, and Iron Dome systems—performing impressively against high-speed, heavy warheads. With help from the U.S. military, including its Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, Israel successfully intercepted 86 percent of the nearly 600 Iranian missiles aimed at its territory and 99.5 percent of the 1,000 unmanned aerial vehicles sent its way. Effective early warning systems allowed Israeli civilians to take cover. The Israeli public followed instructions, sheltered promptly, and avoided widespread panic.

Over 40 Iranian warheads did strike Israeli territory, mostly in major cities such as Beersheba, Haifa, and Tel Aviv. These strikes resulted in the death of 29 people, over 3,000 injuries, and damage to buildings that has left over 15,000 Israelis homeless. But as devastating as these losses are, they are a fraction of what the Israeli military had predicted. Moreover, Israel landed roughly 100 times more missiles and bombs on Iran than Iran did on Israel.

Evaluating the success of Israel's operation against Iran's nuclear project, however, is more an art than a science. It relies on a mosaic of intelligence sources—satellite imagery, diverse sensor data, signals intelligence, cyber surveillance, human assets, and field samples. Any good assessment must look beyond the damage done to individual facilities and examine the cumulative, systemic impacts on a highly complex, multidisciplinary, and multiphase nuclear project.

So far, analysts are divided in their assessment of the effects. Immediately after the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran ended, arguments erupted over the outcome. Trump declared that Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly those struck by U.S. forces, had been “totally obliterated.” In contrast, a leaked preliminary assessment from the United States' Defense Intelligence Agency suggested the assault had delayed Iran's nuclear program by just a few months. The Trump administration dismissed these claims as politically motivated, and senior U.S. intelligence officials stated the program had suffered “severe” damage. Ultimately, the central questions analysts must answer have less to do with what Iran has lost and more with what it still possesses, what it chooses to do next, and what pathways remain for stopping its nuclear breakout—either through diplomacy, coercion, or prevention.

The Iranian regime, for its part, has a broad spectrum of options. At one end, it could return to negotiations. At the other, it could dash for a nuclear bomb. Its ultimate response might also fall somewhere in between: Tehran, for example, may attempt to conceal materials and nuclear components while publicly engaging in fruitless talks. Iran might attempt to drag out such discussions, hoping for leadership changes in Israel and the United States while it quietly advances its program in ways that it can portray as civilian. Iran has already suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, accusing the IAEA of complicity in the strike. It may even withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty altogether, which would be a clear sign of escalation.

In the immediate term, however, Tehran will have to choose how to allocate its limited resources. The reconstruction of its nuclear program, missile forces, air defenses, infrastructure, and regional proxies will all compete for limited funding. Iran will likely prioritize rebuilding its missile and air defense capabilities, reducing vulnerabilities to Israeli intelligence, and adapting to the advanced warfare deployed against it. It may also prepare more effective options for retaliation, in case it is attacked again.

Iran must assess the damage to its nuclear program—especially to its centrifuges and stockpiles of enriched uranium—and decide whether to hide its residual assets for use in the future or try to build a nuclear weapon, whether it be an advanced device or a rudimentary one.

No matter how successful the strikes against Iran were, diplomacy remains the preferred way to permanently end Iran's nuclear ambitions. Other strategies, such as more military action, come with higher risks and costs. Washington knows this, as well, and it is again pursuing talks with Tehran. Its goal is to reach an agreement that forces the Islamic Republic to end uranium enrichment on its soil and allows for intrusive and verifiable inspections. To succeed, U.S. officials should make sure negotiations have a deadline and should credibly threaten to attack again if Iran doesn't strike a deal in time, on American terms. The United States and Israel must coordinate with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—signatories of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which can trigger snapback sanctions—to influence Iran's decisions, prevent nuclear or military escalation, and set the conditions for a good and sustainable agreement.

Israel and Washington, however, shouldn't stop at Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Iran's current weakness and the weakness of its proxy network present a rare opportunity to create a whole new regional order. Israel's military campaign against Iran has, specifically, opened the door to expanded peace and security across the Middle East—including a possible resolution in Gaza, the release of Israeli hostages there, and broader peace with Israel's neighbors—all within a framework of durable security arrangements that neutralize Iran's many threats.

For such a grand bargain to work, Iran would have to forever give up uranium enrichment and plutonium production and allow intrusive inspections from the IAEA. Tehran would also need to significantly curb its missile program—in accordance with the Missile Technology Control Regime framework—and its satellite launch program, which serves as a cover for the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles.



The United States, meanwhile, must lead the orchestration of any nuclear deal or new regional architecture. Israel will need to end the war in Gaza, exile Hamas leadership, and begin reconstruction and disarmament of the territory. Hamas will need to release the remaining hostages in a single phase, give up its weapons, and allow itself to be replaced by a technocratic Palestinian administration.

A grand bargain could also include Israeli security arrangements with Syria and Lebanon, in which Damascus and Beirut commit to neutralizing armed groups in their territory, including Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, Palestinian militant factions, and offshoots of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. These agreements must preserve Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and Israel's freedom of action against evolving threats. The goal would be for such cease-fires to gradually progress into armistice agreements, nonbelligerency treaties, and ultimately full-blown peace accords.

Any grand bargain should be backed by nimble frameworks in which like-minded powers, led by the United States, monitor compliance. Such a mission could be inspired by the Multinational Force and Observers, which has successfully supported the implementation of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty for decades. Alternatively, direct bilateral peace frameworks (like the one Israel has with Jordan) could prove effective. Both models are better than the large, multilateral UN-backed security frameworks such as the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, which has consistently failed in its mission.

But a grand bargain can only work if Israel and the United States align their strategies. The United States must allow Israel to confront emerging threats and strengthen the region's security architecture. Israel, meanwhile, must help the United States shift its focus and resources toward higher-priority theaters, such as the Indo-Pacific.

Should Tehran and Washington agree to a deal—even one that covers just nuclear issues—the military campaign would be a successful illustration of Trump's doctrine of “peace through strength.” But at the very least, the June strikes demonstrated that a coordinated military operation can disrupt nuclear proliferation in the short term. That is especially notable because the United States had previously refrained from intervening militarily to prevent China or North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons.

For years, experts have cautioned that any confrontation with Iran risks igniting a regional war, destabilizing global energy markets, and drawing U.S. forces into a lengthy conflict. Yet none of these outcomes has materialized. A precise Israeli strike, reinforced by a credible American deterrent, seems to be the right formula. The assault on Iran also offers a case study in how a capable U.S. ally can assume the bulk of the responsibility for its own defense, with the support of Washington.

The U.S. and Israeli operations against Iran also have implications for great-power competition. They affirmed that the United States' and Israel's systems are superior to Iran's, many of which are made by Russia. Washington showcased impressive flexibility and a clear willingness to project force, despite its aversion to risking prolonged conflict. The United States stood firmly by its ally and led a successful, targeted strike, sending a message across the globe: the U.S.-Israeli alliance is alive and well and capable of delivering results. The operations also underscored that China and Russia remain minor players in the Middle East.

China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia will no doubt study how Israel and the United States gathered intelligence, countered Iran's ballistic missile and drone capabilities, suppressed air defenses, and targeted Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. Israel and the United States, therefore, must not rest on their laurels. Usually, the side that loses a conflict takes more lessons from it than the side that wins. But Israel and the United States must learn from their strikes, too, and anticipate how Iran will adapt. This was the first direct war between Iran and Israel—and likely not the last.

Operation Rising Lion eliminated real and immediate threats while showcasing the extraordinary military capabilities of Israel and its ally. Yet the most consequential achievement of the operations may lie ahead: the opening of a historic window for a comprehensive political settlement that could reshape the Middle East. Negotiating from a position of strength, the United States and Israel must seize the moment to establish a stable regional order, close the door on Iran's nuclear ambitions, and reinforce their alliance for decades to come.

EKA TKESHELASHVILI served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of Georgia during Mikheil Saakashvili's presidency.

After months of failed efforts by Washington to bring Russia to the negotiating table, planning for what comes after the war in Ukraine may seem counterintuitive. But eventually, the war will end, and when it does, the United States and its European allies will need to be prepared. The day after, Moscow will continue to threaten Ukraine's sovereignty and meddle in its internal affairs, and the West will need to have a strategy for dealing with that. If the United States and Europe proceed to normalize relations with Moscow without swiftly integrating Ukraine into Western institutions and providing real security guarantees, it could lead to further military and gray-zone interventions by Russia and the gradual erosion of Ukrainian democracy.

This is a phenomenon the world has witnessed before—in the aftermath of a previous Russian war of aggression. After Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, the West made many of these very mistakes. Although that war was much shorter, lasting all of five days, the way it was concluded holds important lessons for what could happen to Ukraine if a cease-fire or an agreement to end the war is not followed by a more comprehensive plan to secure the country's future.

Like Ukraine today, Georgia in 2008 was a pro-Western democracy that appeared to be on a slow but steady trajectory toward EU integration and NATO membership. U.S. President George W. Bush once called the country “a beacon of liberty for the region and the world.” After the Russian invasion, the European Union and the United States stepped up to broker a cease-fire, but they did not impose sanctions or any other major consequences on Russia. On the contrary, they chose to prioritize normalizing relations with Moscow, with U.S. President Barack Obama seeking a “reset” of ties in 2009 and essentially giving Russian President Vladimir Putin a pass for launching the first European war of the twenty-first century.

Moreover, the United States and Europe failed to provide security guarantees to Georgia or to fast-track EU and NATO membership. As a result, Georgia remained vulnerable to creeping annexation and political manipulation by Moscow. Today, the once hopeful nation is farther from the West and more exposed to the Kremlin's malign influence than at any other point since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Washington and its European allies would do well to study the example of Georgia to understand why a postwar plan for Ukraine is so vital.

As with its war in Ukraine, Russia's aggression against Georgia was years in the making. After Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution, the country's democratic transformation presented a problem for Moscow. As a former Soviet republic that successfully broke away from Russia's orbit and emerged as a rapidly developing democracy, Georgia offered other former Eastern-bloc countries a powerful alternative to Russia's authoritarian model.

In 2006, Moscow sought to punish Tbilisi by imposing embargoes on Russian imports of Georgian wine and mineral water and cutting off supplies of Russian oil and gas on which Georgia was highly dependent. When those measures failed to derail Georgia's Western trajectory, Moscow shifted tactics. Russian forces restricted international monitoring of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, regions of Georgia where Moscow backed separatist movements and where it had long maintained “peacekeepers.” The Kremlin also expanded its program to distribute Russian passports in those territories and signed off on the legal acts of the de facto authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Military provocations intensified, including airspace intrusions and missile attacks on Georgian villages. Each violation became a test of Western resolve. For the most part, the United States and Europe proved unwilling or unable to draw clear redlines or impose penalties, signaling to the Kremlin that it could escalate without consequence.

In August 2008, after months of calibrated and mounting provocations, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Georgia. More than 80,000 Russian troops crossed the border, overwhelming Georgian forces within days. Russian airstrikes targeted military and civilian infrastructure, pushing deep into Georgian territory. The offensive consolidated Russia's occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, securing 20 percent of Georgia's internationally recognized territory, a reality that endures to this day.

The invasion came just four months after a NATO summit in Bucharest, at which the alliance declared that Georgia and Ukraine would one day become members but failed to offer either of them a Membership Action Plan. Moscow interpreted this ambiguity as evidence that the West was unwilling to defend Georgia and that the country remained strategically exposed. It also justified its assault by claiming it was protecting South Ossetia from Georgian “aggression” and “genocide” and defending Russian citizens, having distributed passports en masse to residents of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia since the early 2000s. (In reality, Moscow had backed, armed, and financed the separatists in both regions since the early 1990s, systematically undermining Georgia's sovereignty.) Despite its stated focus on South Ossetia, Russia simultaneously opened a second front from Abkhazia, expanding its military operations across Georgia's western flank.



In the months leading up to the invasion, Russia conducted large-scale military exercises dubbed Caucasus 2008 near the border with Georgia. It also left combat units stationed in the vicinity, deployed paratroops, and sent railway troops into Abkhazia. An independent fact-finding mission on the conflict commissioned by the EU noted the presence of Russian regular armed forces in Abkhazia beyond their peacekeeping mandate and confirmed that Russian combat troops who engaged in Caucasus 2008 had crossed into South Ossetia as hostilities began. During the conflict, hundreds of Georgians were killed and tens of thousands were displaced permanently.

The initial cease-fire agreement, brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on August 12, 2008, was deliberately vague, omitting any mechanisms for enforcing a truce. The deal proved inadequate to stop Russia's advance toward Tbilisi. Only with meaningful U.S. engagement did the situation begin to shift. On August 13, flanked by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in the White House Rose Garden, Bush delivered an address condemning Russia's aggression. He announced the launch of a humanitarian mission involving the U.S. military and warned Russia to “cease all military activities in Georgia and withdraw its forces that entered Georgia in recent days.” The statement, signaling a more assertive U.S. stance, finally helped stall Russia's advance toward Tbilisi.

Two days later, Rice arrived in Tbilisi to meet with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and other Georgian leaders and address weak points in the cease-fire agreement. Chief among these was a provision that, while calling for a Russian troop withdrawal to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities, allowed Russian forces to implement unspecified “additional security measures” until international monitors could be deployed. The Georgian side had warned Sarkozy that Moscow had deliberately inserted this phrase to allow continued Russian military operations beyond the administrative boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

In response to these concerns, and with Rice's direct engagement, Sarkozy issued an official letter addressed to the presidents of both Georgia and Russia specifying that any additional Russian security measures were to be strictly limited in scope and permitted only within a narrow zone a few kilometers from the two regions' borders. The letter also stated that such measures were to be carried out only by peacekeepers at previously agreed levels and that all other Russian forces were to withdraw to the positions they had held as of August 7. Moreover, these measures were to remain in effect only until an international peacekeeping force could be deployed.

On September 15 of that year, the EU established the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia to verify the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, promote stability, and build confidence between the parties, beginning on October 1. Ever since, Russia has consistently blocked these EU monitors from gaining access to the occupied regions, directly contradicting the spirit and letter of the accord. This refusal to cooperate has also allowed Moscow to further militarize and consolidate its control over Georgian territory. Indeed, within weeks of the cease-fire, Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, defying both the terms of the agreement and core principles of international law. As in earlier frozen conflicts, Russia's continued military occupation of these regions has served to undermine Georgia's security, weaken its economy, and block its path toward Euro-Atlantic integration.

For Western leaders, the 2008 pact was a way to repair their rifts with Russia. Within months, Europe resumed formal ties with Moscow and prioritized energy and trade—Germany with the Nord Stream pipeline agreement, France with the $1.3 billion Mistral warship deal—rewarding rather than punishing the aggressor. Then, in 2009, the Obama administration launched its reset, aimed at stabilizing relations with Moscow through high-stakes diplomacy, arms control, cooperation on Iran, and economic integration. In return for offering limited, short-lived cooperation, Russia gained legitimacy and leverage. In the years that followed, Moscow would in fact abandon arms control agreements while using its membership in the World Trade Organization to strengthen the Russian economy. What Washington and Brussels framed as pragmatism instead emboldened the Kremlin, helping lay the groundwork for its serial aggression in Ukraine.

Equally consequential if largely overlooked was the failure of Western governments to help Georgia build deterrence and institutional resilience. Although Western leaders maintained strong rhetorical support for Georgia's sovereignty, they made no serious effort to upgrade security cooperation with Tbilisi. There was no transfer of defense capabilities, no NATO Membership Action Plan, and certainly no security guarantees. Georgia was left politically supported but strategically exposed.

As the Kremlin saw it, the cease-fire was never a step toward peace but simply a tactical pause. The absence of Western support allowed Russia to steadily expand its presence, erecting fences, redrawing boundaries, and inching deeper into Georgian-held territory. And over time, Moscow's assault shifted from the military front to the political one, with a barrage of cyberattacks, espionage, and disinformation campaigns aimed at Tbilisi. In 2012, Moscow began backing Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire with deep financial ties to Russia, in his campaign to gradually capture Georgia's political institutions. In the dozen years since, his Georgian Dream party has ruled the country with an increasingly iron fist.



At first, the party professed a commitment to the country's Euro-Atlantic path even as it gradually eroded democratic institutions and tightened ties with Moscow. Over time, Georgian Dream secured control of the national election commission and stocked the state bureaucracy, law enforcement, and the judiciary with loyalists despite significant popular opposition.

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine shattered the party's façade. Although Georgia's people overwhelmingly supported Ukraine, Georgian Dream refused to confront Moscow, instead enabling the Russian war effort by allowing Georgia to become a route for sanctions circumvention and imports. Meanwhile, Brussels responded to the invasion by accelerating the process for integrating Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine into the EU. This development threatened Georgian Dream's grip on power. Faced with the offer of genuine EU membership, a prospect that would require democratic reforms and accountability, Georgia Dream pivoted to sabotage by enacting changes that would undermine the country's candidacy.

In May 2024, Georgia's parliament passed a Russian-style law labeling many civil society organizations and media outlets as “foreign agents.” In October, Georgian Dream declared victory in a parliamentary election marred by irregularities and credible allegations of fraud. Two months later, the party suspended accession talks with the EU. Despite repression, hundreds of thousands of Georgians took to the streets, demanding a democratic future and genuine Euro-Atlantic integration. As these protests continue, leading opposition figures have been imprisoned, and the government continues to put relentless pressure on civil society and independent media organizations. The country that Bush hailed as a beacon of liberty in 2005 has been reduced to an authoritarian state aligned with the Kremlin—a cautionary tale for Ukraine and every other post-Soviet state that Putin wants to see reintegrated into Russia's sphere of influence.

For Europe and the United States, Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia was a missed wake-up call. At the time, Western governments did not recognize that it was part of a larger Russian campaign to dismantle the post–Cold War order. The war exposed not only Russia's determination to unravel the rules-based international order but also the West's paralysis in the face of it: the United States and its NATO allies failed to support Georgia and hold Russia accountable for its actions.

If there were any lingering illusions that Russia would not attempt a similar act of aggression, they evaporated when Russia mounted its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in February 2022. This time, Russia's gambit was far bigger: for the first time in decades, Washington was compelled to confront Moscow through sustained military, economic, and political means. Yet despite the extensive sanctions imposed against Russia and the billions of dollars of military support provided to Ukraine, the transatlantic response remained more focused on countering Moscow's moves than on shaping the strategic direction of the conflict. Three years into the war, a new U.S. administration's push for cease-fire talks has laid bare the sobering reality that neither Washington nor Brussels ever articulated a viable endgame.

For the United States, the greatest risk in negotiating with Russia to end the war is to enter such talks without clear objectives, a consolidated political will, and a contingency plan. The process will play directly into Moscow's hands unless Washington can forcefully define an enduring goal and outline a concrete strategy for what it will do if talks collapse. Negotiations must not follow Russia's timeline or terms. Cease-fires cannot be treated as bridges to peace unless they are anchored in a broader strategy for long-term security, backed by credible deterrence and a readiness to act if diplomacy fails.

For diplomacy to succeed in Ukraine, it must be grounded in the recognition that Putin won't stop unless he is made to stop. A cease-fire that locks in Russia's territorial gains, lacks binding timelines, imposes constraints on the victim rather than the aggressor, and hinges on vague promises of sustainable peace will only confirm that Moscow's revisionist strategy still works.

Only by providing meaningful security guarantees to Ukraine can the United States and its European allies break this cycle. For Kyiv, NATO membership remains the most effective and economical guarantee of security—not only for Ukraine but also for NATO itself. Short of offering immediate membership, alliance members must enable Ukraine's military to develop to a level that ensures that it can deter future aggression on its own, supported by formal agreements guaranteeing its air defense. Boosting Ukraine's defense industry, ensuring a continued presence of Western military trainers and monitors, and embedding the country's armed forces within NATO's operational structures will be critical. Effective recovery and reconstruction will be equally essential for Ukraine's resilience. That means mobilizing frozen Russian assets for rebuilding Ukraine while also integrating the country into Western supply chains, protecting its rare-earth mineral resources, and anchoring it firmly and irreversibly within the Euro-Atlantic economic and security architecture. Anything less risks repeating the aftermath of the 2008 war in Georgia, when the West's desire for calm rewarded Russian aggression and left a Western-bound democracy out in the cold.

            Many American schoolchildren grow up learning that Yellowstone was the world's first national park. But across the globe in Mongolia, just south of the capital, Ulaanbaatar, a mountain holds a claim to the crown.
    


            Like many things in Mongolia, that mountain has a connection to Chinggis Khan (also known as Genghis Khan), who founded the Mongol empire in the 1200s and whose name and likeness are ubiquitous in present-day Mongolia.
    


            Toghrulkhan (known as Toghrul or Ong Khan), a close friend and ally of Khan's father, protected and venerated Bogd Khan Uul. According to the historical work “Secret Lives of the Mongols,” the oldest existing book in Mongolia, Toghrul barred anyone from hunting and logging, among other activities, as early as the 13th century.



            Today, entering Bogd Khan Uul, which was recognized as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1996, banishes the memory of the crowds and pollution of the capital. The Terelj River carves a path through dense patches of pine, birch and aspen trees. White butterflies swirl past in groups.
    


            As a result of the park's long-standing respected status, many native plants and animals have flourished, protected from hunting and farming. They include the rare musk deer — notable for having tusklike teeth — and the Arctic hare. Visitors should also be on the lookout for eagles, vultures, marmots and wild boars.
    


            The mountain of Bogd Khan Uul “is sacred and symbolic for all the Mongols,” says Saruul-Erdene Myagmar, an Ulaanbaatar native who is a Mongolia specialist at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.
    


            Bogd means “saint” in Mongolian, and “uul” is mountain, while Khan is a ceremonial title given to rulers. One translation of Bogd Khan Uul is “the Khan's saint's mountain.”
    


            And what about the claim that Bogd Khan Uul is older than Yellowstone?
    


            In 1778, Mongolian aristocrats wrote to the emperor of the Qing (Manchu) dynasty, which ruled the area at the time, asking for Bogd Khan Uul to be designated an official protected area. He said yes.

            Meanwhile, Yellowstone, which stretches across parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, was established in 1872. By comparison, Australia got its first national park in 1879, Canada in 1885, France in 1963 and Egypt in 1983.
    


            In the Caribbean, there's another contender.
    


            The Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve, established in 1776, also has a claim to being the world's oldest protected area.
    


            But many Mongolians ignore the 1778 date and mark the beginning of Bogd Khan Uul's “protected status” as during the 13th century, which would put the park ahead of its competitors by several centuries.
    


            Unlike Yellowstone and other famous parks, Bogd Khan Uul remains relatively unknown in the rest of the world. That has a lot to do with Mongolia's location — this cold, landlocked country wedged between China and Russia has not seen many international visitors. Much of the information about the park and its history is only available in Mongolian.
    


            However, that is changing. Mongolia is investing heavily in tourism and hopes the industry can grow to contribute 10% to its economy by 2030. About 808,000 foreign tourists visited Mongolia in 2024, the highest number in history.

            For Mongolians like Myagmar, the mountain's significance is not just about whether it really is the world's oldest national park or not.
    


            “Before Buddhism even, there's the shamanism. Very ancient belief is that all the mountains and rivers have their own owner. It's almost like a ghost,” he says. “Bogd Uul's owner is this white old man. If we offend this owner, then all sorts of bad things will happen.”
    


            The park's spiritual legacy remains. Today, Bogd Khan Uul is dotted with ovoos, which are sacred cairns made of rocks, pieces of wood and colorful scraps of fabric. At the park, it's considered bad manners, if not downright bad luck, to leave behind trash, use the bathroom outside of designated areas or interfere with an ovoo.
    


            Many travelers staying in the city center combine a visit to the national park with a stop at Zaisan Hill, home to a monument of the same name. This dramatic Brutalist memorial has colorful murals on the inside and is dedicated to Soviet and Mongolian soldiers killed during World War II.
    


            Perched on top of a hill, it's a good way to get a sense of one's bearings and a view of the city. However, this largely depends on the sky conditions that day — the air in “UB,” as locals call it, can be very hazy.
    


            From the Zaisan Monument, it's a short walk to the northern entrance of Bogd Khan Uul. There are trails that range from easy to difficult, all well marked.
    


            Travelers who make it to the top of the mountain should not miss the ruins of the Manzushir Monastery. Once a Buddhist stronghold and home to many monks, Manzushir was destroyed in 1937 by local communists who had joined forces with the Soviet occupiers of the country. Still, the ruins and remaining religious objects are well looked after by residents, especially as the current government is encouraging Mongolian pride and identity.
    


            Most foreign tourists opt for day hikes in Bogd Khan Uul, but those who want to stay the night have a few options with local companies that operate camps of gers, the traditional round Mongolian tents. These camps are rustic and have only basic amenities, but they provide a rare chance to experience the exceptional peace and quiet while stargazing and — for much of the year  — watching the snow fall.



            Although Bogd Khan Uul is only about 10 miles south of central Ulaanbaatar, the city's notoriously congested traffic means it can take up to an hour to get to the park at peak times of day.
    


            Your best bet is to go there on a weekday just after morning rush hour, giving you plenty of daylight for exploring.
    


            Public transit is limited in Ulaanbaatar — there is no subway system, so people either use buses or their own cars to get around. Taxis are generally not labeled — most people simply stand on the side of the road with their hand out and wait for one to pull up. There is an available taxi app, called UBCab app, that offers English functionality, but you'll need cash to pay if you don't have a Mongolian bank account.

            The country's air hub, Chinggis Khaan International Airport (UBN), is about an hour and a half from the park.
    


            The airport is mostly limited to short-haul flights from Asian cities like Seoul, Hong Kong and Beijing. United Airlines operates seasonal flights to Mongolia from the US, but they require a stopover in Tokyo.
    


            Beyond Bogd Khan Uul, Mongolia is home to some of the world's most diverse landscapes and has a total of 29 national parks.
    


            Among them are parts of the Gobi Desert; the UNESCO-listed Orkhon Valley, about five hours' drive from Ulaanbaatar; the Altai Mountains in far western Mongolia (home to the country's tallest peak, Tavan Bogd); and the beautiful Lake Khuvsgul, an ancient body of water near the Russian border.

Follow:


            A federal judge agreed Thursday to issue a new nationwide block against President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.
    


            The ruling from US District Judge Joseph Laplante is significant because the Supreme Court last month curbed the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, while keeping intact the ability of plaintiffs to seek a widespread block of the order through class action lawsuits, which is what happened Thursday in New Hampshire.
    


            Ruling from the bench, Laplante granted a request from immigration rights attorneys to certify a nationwide class that “will be comprised only of those deprived of citizenship” and issued a preliminary injunction indefinitely blocking Trump's Day One order from being enforced against any baby born after February 20.

            “The preliminary injunction is just not a close call to the court,” Laplante said during a hearing. “The deprivation of US citizenship and an abrupt change of policy that was longstanding … that's irreparable harm.”
    


            US citizenship, the judge added, “is the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”
    


            The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said he would pause his order for several days to give the Trump administration time to appeal his decision.
    


            Laplante issued a written 38-page order later Thursday as well.
    


            Laplante wrote that he “has no difficulty concluding that the rapid adoption by executive order, without legislation and the attending national debate, of a new government policy of highly questionable constitutionality that would deny citizenship to many thousands of individuals previously granted citizenship under an indisputably longstanding policy, constitutes irreparable harm, and that all class representatives could suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.”
    


            Laplante's ruling could prove to be a critical bulwark against Trump's policy as other courts scramble to take a second look at their decisions in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.
    


            The White House called the ruling “an obvious and unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's clear order against universal relief.”
    


            “This judge's decision disregards the rule of law by abusing class action certification procedures. The Trump Administration will be fighting vigorously against the attempts of these rogue district court judges to impede the policies President Trump was elected to implement,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement.
    


            In February, Laplante indefinitely blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order only against members of several nonprofit groups who would have been impacted by it.
    


            “I'm the judge who wasn't comfortable with issuing a nationwide injunction. Class action is different,” the judge said at one point during Thursday's hearing. “The Supreme Court suggested class action is a better option.”
    


            In his ruling earlier this year, Laplante said Trump's order “contradicts the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the century-old untouched precedent that interprets it.”
    


            Several other judges similarly ruled that Trump's order was unconstitutional, but their injunctions applied nationwide and prompted the administration to mount the series of appeals that eventually landed before the Supreme Court.
    


            Thursday's proceeding focused largely on the request from immigration rights attorneys who brought the legal challenge for Laplante to certify a class of individuals that would include “all current and future children” who would be affected by Trump's order and their parents. The judge's ruling Thursday did not include the parents in the class.
    


            The judge appeared sympathetic to arguments pushed by the Justice Department that certifying a class including the parents might run up against the federal rules regarding class certification if those adults each had immigration situations that were significantly different from another adult in the class.
    


            DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton had wanted Laplante to allow for discovery so more information could be gathered on the adults who are part of the legal challenge, but the judge, aware of the urgency of the litigation, noted that such court-ordered fact-finding wouldn't be feasible.
    


            “You're right, (ordinarily) we'd conduct discovery before granting class certification,” Laplante said. “There's no time for discovery.” His decision to keep the certified class somewhat narrow allows the case to proceed without that time-consuming process.
    


            “I think that the class representatives present issues … that the newborn infants do not,” he said.
    


            Class action lawsuits require “class representatives,” or individuals who, if the class is certified, will represent the class members.
    


            In this case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, those proposed representatives had included a Honduran asylum-seeker – referred to in court papers as “Barbara” and who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a baby in October – and a Brazilian man – referred to as “Mark” – who is attempting to get lawful permanent status. Mark's wife, who is not in the US lawfully, gave birth in March.
    


            “If the Order is left in place,” the ACLU lawyers wrote, “those children will face numerous obstacles to life in the United States, including stigma and potential statelessness; loss of their right to vote, serve on federal juries and in many elected offices, and work in various federal jobs; ineligibility for various federal programs; and potential arrest, detention, and deportation to countries they may have never even seen.”

            Signed by Trump on January 20, the executive order, titled “PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,” said that the federal government will not “issue documents recognizing United States citizenship” to any children born on American soil to parents who were in the country unlawfully or were in the states lawfully but temporarily.
    


            The Supreme Court said in its June 27 ruling that the administration cannot begin enforcing the order for 30 days, though the government is allowed to begin developing guidance on how the policy will be implemented.
    


            In the other challenges to Trump's order, lower courts around the country have asked the parties to submit written legal arguments addressing how the Supreme Court's ruling could impact the nationwide injunctions issued in those cases, and more court proceedings are expected in the coming days and weeks.
    


            But that process will take time and it's unclear whether any of those courts will narrow their injunctions ahead of when Trump is permitted to enforce the birthright policy.
    


            “I feel like we're the only people who rushed around here,” Laplante quipped during Thursday's hearing.
    


            ACLU attorney Cody Wofsy in a statement said the judge's decision is “a huge victory and will help protect the citizenship of all children born in the United States, as the Constitution intended.”
    


            Laplante's decision aligns with the Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling last month, which left class-action litigation on the table as a way to block Trump's birthright citizenship order – and potentially other policies.
    


            The Supreme Court's decision was focused on one type of court order – a nationwide injunction – but several of the justices were keen to note that plaintiffs suing an administration would have other avenues to shut down policies that might run afoul of the Constitution or federal law. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested the kind of class-action litigation immigrant rights groups are now pursuing have many advantages.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who is often closer to the center of the court in high-profile cases, seemed especially open to having the Supreme Court review, on an emergency basis, exactly the kind of order Laplante issued.
    


            “Today's decision on district court injunctions will not affect this court's vitally important responsibility to resolve applications for stays or injunctions with respect to major new federal statutes and executive actions,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Deciding those applications is not a distraction from our job. It is a critical part of our job.”

            Perhaps, Kavanaugh mused, a district court might issue “the functional equivalent of a universal injunction” by “granting or denying a preliminary injunction” in a class-action suit.
    


            “No matter how the preliminary-injunction litigation on those kinds of significant matters transpires in the district courts, the courts of appeals in turn will undoubtedly be called upon to promptly grant or deny temporary stays or temporary injunctions in many cases,” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            But Laplante's ruling is nevertheless almost certain to force the justices to deal with a split that emerged over the particulars of those cases. And the court's majority opinion left that split unsettled.
    


            Several conservatives, including Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, warned against courts using class-action litigation to essentially supplant the kind of nationwide injunction the court had just shot down.
    


            “Lax enforcement of the requirements” for certifying a class, Alito wrote in an opinion joined by Thomas, “would create a potentially significant loophole to today's decision.”
    


            Federal courts, he added, “should thus be vigilant against such potential abuses of these tools.”
    


            Whether Laplante's decision is an “abuse” or exactly what the Supreme Court had in mind will likely wind up back before the justices in short order.

            US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened Brazil with a crippling tariff of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter he sent to the country's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
    


            In the letter posted on Truth Social, Trump alleged Lula is undertaking a “Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” over charges against its right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro.
    


            Bolsonaro, who has bragged about his closeness with Trump, is facing trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against Lula.
    


            Lula vowed to reciprocate if Trump follows through with his threat.
    


            “Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,” Lula said in a post on X.
    


            “Any measure to increase tariffs unilaterally will be responded to in light of Brazil's Law of Economic Reciprocity,” he added.
    


            This marks the first time in months another country has threatened to match Trump's tariff threat.
    


            Unlike the 21 other countries that have received letters from Trump this week, the US ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, meaning the US exported more goods to there than it imported from there. Top US exports to the South American country last year included aircraft and spacecraft, fuels, industrial machinery like nuclear reactors, and electrical equipment, according to US Census Bureau data. So a 50% Brazilian tariff on American goods could severely harm these industries.
    


            Imports from Brazil to the US have faced a minimum 10% tariff since Trump's announcement of “reciprocal” tariffs in April – the baseline rate he has applied to most goods from most countries during the 90-day negotiation period, which has now been extended to August 1.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has used the threat of tariffs to try to change other countries' domestic policy decisions.
    


            Earlier this year, he threatened 25% tariffs on Colombian exports that would grow to 50% if the country didn't accept deportees from the US. (Colombia ultimately accepted the deportees and avoided those tariffs.) Trump also imposed tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China over the role he alleges they play in facilitating illegal migration to the US and enabling fentanyl to reach the country.
    


            But despite Trump's discontent with the Bolsonaro trial, he wrote that “there will be no Tariff if Brazil, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States.” Trump's made nearly identical offers in a slew of other letters he sent to heads of state this week.
    


            Other recipients of tariff letters on Wednesday included the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Moldova, Brunei, Algeria, Libya and Iraq, with rates going as high as 30% on goods they ship to the United States. The new tariffs go into effect August 1, pending negotiations.
    


            The rates Trump said would be imposed on goods from Sri Lanka, Moldova, Iraq and Libya were lower than those he announced in early April. The rates on goods from the Philippines and Brunei were higher, compared to April levels. Meanwhile, the rate on goods from Algeria was the same (30%) as April levels.
    


            The US and various trading partners have been negotiating new trade agreements since Trump announced so-called “reciprocal” tariffs back in April. Yet few deals have come to fruition.
    


            During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump said “a letter means a deal.” But that doesn't appear to be how some countries are perceiving the missives.

Trump has delayed his monster tariffs. Here's why you should care



            In all the letters except the one sent to Brazil's Lula, Trump wrote that he takes particular issue with the trade deficits the United States runs with other nations, meaning America buys more goods from there compared to how much American businesses export to those countries. Trump also said the tariffs would be set in response to other policies that he deems are impeding American goods from being sold abroad.
    


            Trump has encouraged world leaders to manufacture goods in the United States to avoid tariffs. If they chose to retaliate by slapping higher tariffs on American goods, Trump threatened to tack that onto the rate charged on their country's goods shipped to the United States.
    


            Trump has now sent 22 letters on tariff rates to heads of government this week, and more could still come.
    


            JPMorgan economists said in a note to clients on Wednesday titled “Another day, another step closer to Liberation Day” that the 50% tariff threat on Brazilian goods was “most surprising.” (“Liberation Day” refers to April 2, the day Trump held a Rose Garden event to announce “reciprocal” tariff rates.)
    


            “It is possible these tariffs will never be implemented, as some in the market are hoping for,” the economists said, referring to Trump's latest threats.
    


            On Thursday, Indonesia, one of the 14 countries that received Trump's tariff letters on Monday, said it has reached an agreement with the US to intensify trade negotiations in the next three weeks. Both countries also see potential in expanding cooperation in sectors such as critical minerals, the economic ministry of Southeast Asia's largest economy said in a statement.
    


            Meanwhile, the Philippines said it is “concerned” about Trump's decision to impose a 20% tariff on its exports to the US, while vowing to continue negotiations. A delegation will visit the US next week in a bid to lower the levy, Frederick Go, an adviser to the nation's president, told reporters.
    


            Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. ET was the initial deadline Trump set three months ago for countries to ink trade deals with the US or instantly face higher tariff rates. However, on Monday he extended that deadline to August 1.
    


            Bolsonaro, often dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics,” is on trial in Brazil for charges related to an alleged plot to overturn the 2022 election results. He and dozens of associates have been charged with attempting a coup d'état, which prosecutors allege involved a plan to potentially assassinate elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Trump late Wednesday also announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, as he had promised on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. The tariff announcement comes after Trump on February 25 signed an executive action requiring the Commerce Department to assess whether America's copper imports posed a national security risk.
    


            “I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT,” Trump said on Truth Social Wednesday. “Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) “Leaders” decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity.”
    


            America imports about half of the copper it uses, according to the London Stock Exchange, and most of it comes from China, Chile, Japan and Congo. Copper is a key ingredient in electrical wiring necessary semiconductors and a host of other key goods, including batteries and defense equipment.
    


            “America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry,” Trump said. “THIS IS, AFTER ALL, OUR GOLDEN AGE!”
    


            Copper have prices surged over the past day after Trump on Tuesday said tariffs on copper imports were imminent. Copper futures jumped 13.1% on Tuesday to settle at a record high $5.69 per pound. It was the biggest single-day increase on record going back to 1968. They fell a bit Wednesday but were up nearly 3% in late trading.
    


            “I've been surprised it's taken this long to get the copper tariff,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “There are three buckets of tariffs: new revenue, national security, forced policy change. National security is the copper piece.”
    


            But some analysts were skeptical that tariffs could quickly boost America's copper mining industry and reduce its reliance on foreign countries for the key metal.
    


            “The US remains structurally short on copper, importing over 50% of its needs—primarily from South America—with no clear path to improving that for years to come,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “A tariff-induced price premium risks making copper—and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure—materially more expensive.”
    


            Hansen called the 50% increase on copper tariffs “a massive tax on consumers of copper.”
    


            Responding to Trump citing national security as a reason for the the copper tariff, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday that China “opposed the generalization of the concept of national security.”
    


            “We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war, and the abuse of tariffs is not in the interests of any party,” Mao Ning, the spokesperson said.
    


            While the US imported most of its refined copper from Chile, Canada and Peru last year, China is a major player in the copper trade. Most copper mines are in South American and African countries, but China dominates the refining of the metal globally, according to the United States Geological Survey. China has also been investing in copper mines in African countries, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, over the last few decades.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian attack on an air base in Qatar that's key to the U.S. military likely hit a geodesic dome housing equipment used by the Americans for secure communications, satellite images analyzed Friday by The Associated Press show.

The U.S. military and Qatar didn't respond to requests for comment over the damage, which so far hasn't been publicly acknowledged.

The Iranian attack on Al Udeid Air Base outside of Doha, Qatar's capital, on June 23 came as a response to the American bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran — and provided the Islamic Republic a way to retaliate that quickly led to a ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump ending the 12-day Iran-Israel war. 

The Iranian attack otherwise did little damage — likely because of the fact that the U.S. evacuated its aircraft from the base, which is home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command, before the attack.

Trump also has said that Iran signaled when and how it would retaliate, allowing American and Qatari air defense to be ready for the attack, which briefly disrupted air travel in the Middle East, but otherwise didn't tip over into the regional war long feared by analysts. 




Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC show the geodesic dome visible at the Al Udeid Air Base on the morning of June 23, just hours before the attack. 

The U.S. Air Force's 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, which operates out of the base, announced in 2016 the installation of the $15 million piece of equipment, known as a modernized enterprise terminal. Photos show a satellite dish inside of the dome, known as a radome. 

Images taken June 25 and every day subsequently show the dome is gone, with some damage visible on a nearby building. The rest of the base appears largely untouched in the images. 

It's possible a fragment or something else struck the dome, but given the destruction of the dome, it was likely an Iranian attack, possibly with a bomb-carrying drone given the limited visible damage to surrounding structures. 

The London-based satellite news channel Iran International first reported on the damage, citing satellite photos taken by a different provider. 

In the U.S., Trump described the Iranian attack as a “very weak response.” He had said that Tehran fired 14 missiles, with 13 intercepted and one being “set free” as it was going in a “nonthreatening” direction. 

“I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,” he wrote on his website Truth Social.

After the attack, Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard insisted that the air base had been the “target of a destructive and powerful missile attack.” Iran's Supreme National Security Council also said that the base had been “smashed,” without offering any specific damage assessments. 

Potentially signaling that he knew the dome had been hit, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei separately said that the base's communications had been disconnected by the attack.

“All equipment of the base was completely destroyed and now the U.S. command stream and connection from Al Udeid base to its other military bases have been completely cut,” said Ahmad Alamolhoda, a hard-line cleric.

NEWNAN, Ga. (AP) — A prominent Georgia Republican was running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million, federal officials alleged in a complaint filed Thursday.

The civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said First Liberty Building and Loan, controlled by Brant Frost IV, lied to investors about its business of making high-interest loans to companies. Instead, investigators said, it raised more money to repay earlier investors. 

Frost is alleged to have taken more than $19 million of investor funds for himself, his family and affiliated companies even as the business was going broke, spending $160,000 on jewelry and $335,000 with a rare coin dealer. Frost is also said to have spent $320,000 to rent a vacation home over multiple years in Kennebunkport, Maine, the town where the family of late president George H. W. Bush famously spent summers.

The SEC said Frost kept writing checks even after the commission began its investigation

First Liberty said last month that it would stop making loans and paying interest and principal to investors in those loans. The company said it was not answering phone calls or emails.

First Liberty has not responded to an email seeking comment, and no one was present at its office Thursday evening in Newnan, a suburb southwest of Atlanta. A lawyer who acts as the company's registered agent for corporate purposes said earlier that he had no information. 




The collapse rocked the religious and political networks that the business drew investors from. It also could have ramifications in state Republican politics, cutting off funding to the far-right candidates that Frost and his family have favored. Investigators said Frost spent $570,000 from investor funds on political contributions.

The SEC said the business had only $2.67 million in cash as of May 30, although regulators are also seeking to claw back money from Frost and associated companies. With 300 investors out $140 million, that means the average investor put in nearly $500,000.

First Liberty said it made loans to companies that needed cash while they waited for more conventional loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. It charged high rates of interest — 18% on some loans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. First Liberty promised investors equally high rates of return — 16% on the 18% loans.

In recent months the business advertised heavily on conservative radio shows promising “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors.”

“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” Justin C. Jeffries, associate director of enforcement for the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.

The company has represented that it is “cooperating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business.” The SEC said Frost and his companies agreed to the SEC's enforcement actions “with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.”

While the SEC says there were loans to companies, as many as 90% of those companies have defaulted. By 2021 the company was running as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint said, even as Frost withdrew increasing amounts of money.

The business is being investigated by the Georgia secretary of state for possible violations of securities law said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for the office. 

A 2023 document obtained by the AP is titled as a “promissory note,” and Sinners said anyone issuing promissory notes is supposed to be registered with Georgia securities officials. 

Sinners encouraged any victims to contact the state Securities Division.

Federal prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they are considering criminal charges. Sometimes both an SEC civil case and a federal criminal case are filed over investment frauds.

Frost has been an important player in Georgia politics since 1988, when he coordinated televangelist Pat Robertson's Republican presidential bid in the state. His son, Brant Frost V, is chairman of the Coweta County Republican Party, where the company is based, and is a former second vice-chair of the state Republican Party. Daughter Katie Frost is Republican chairman of the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Coweta County and other areas southwest of Atlanta.

At last month's state Republican convention, Katie Frost chaired a nominating committee that recommended delegates reelect state Party Chairman Josh McKoon. Delegates followed that recommendation, rejecting a number of insurgent candidates.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodian lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment that would allow the government to draft legislation seeking to revoke the citizenship of anyone found guilty of conspiring with foreign nations to harm the national interest.

The 125 members of National Assembly unanimously passed the proposal Friday and legally amended Article 33 of Cambodia's constitution, enabling the government to immediately draw up a bill allowing citizenships to be stripped for the first time. 

The latest legal move by supporters of Prime Minister Hun Manet was viewed by critics as a way to suppress internal dissent and eliminate policital opponents of his administration and the ruling Cambodian People's Party. 

The change would apply to lifelong Cambodian citizens, people with dual citizenship in Cambodia and another nation and people from other countries who have been granted Cambodian citizenship.

Some government critics and opposition politicians are known to have dual citizenship.

Justice Minister Koeut Rith said government officials will urgently draft a bill to revoke the citizenship of any individual found guilty of treason or collaborating with foreign entities to seriously harm the interests of Cambodia and its people.

He claimed some Cambodians have colluded with a foreign country to harm their nation's interests. The comment appeared to be a reference to a May 28 confrontation between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand in which one Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area on the border.

Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office earlier this month pending an ethics investigation over a leaked phone call about the border dispute with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the influential former prime minister and father of Hun Manet. The leaked phone call set off political turmoil in Thailand as Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the conflict.




Last month Cambodia submitted an official request to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to resolve the ongoing border dispute involving several ancient temple sites.

The consitutional amendment in Cambodia comes after Hun Sen last week called for the Ministry of Justice to explore legal avenues in response to frequent government criticism by opposition figures. Hun Sen and Hun Manet both said the legal change was necessary, comparing it to similar laws in several other countries.

Speaking to villagers and government officials last week in northern Kampong Thom province, Hun Manet claimed that among nearly 200 United Nations member states, 150 countries have laws allowing citizenship revocation, including the United States.

“Please don't be concerned if you are a patriot and do not oppose the interest of country. But if you have conspired with foreign powers to destroy Cambodia then, yes, it is true you should be worried, and in such case you are not a Cambodian.” Hun Manet said. “No true patriot would ever plot with foreign powers to destroy their nation.”

Amnesty International said it was deeply concerned the Cambodian government will use the “repressive amendment” to render its critics stateless.

“Judicial independence is key to safeguarding people's rights including the right to nationality and reversing a culture of impunity. This has enabled the government's authoritarian practices to continue unchecked, such as its persecution of opposition leaders, activists and independent journalists,” Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in a statement.

Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy was one of those named by Hun Sen as making comments detrimental to the nation.

Rainsy for decades has been a harsh critic and one of the most popular opponents of the Cambodian People's Party, which fueled Hun Sen's rise to power. Rainsy has been in exile since 2016 to avoid serving prison sentences on defamation, treason and other charges, which his supporters consider politically motivated.

Rainsy said recent comments by Hun Sen about the border dispute with Thailand were not patriotism but a personal and political reaction rooted in fear and panic over the potential collapse of a regime deeply entangled with international criminal networks.

“Hun Sen's anti Thai rhetoric is nothing more than a political smokescreen. While he presents the dispute as one of historical grievance and national dignity, the real motive behind his indignation is Thailand's concerted effort to dismantle Chines-run cyber-scam operations based in border areas — operations that have become a vital source of illicit funding for the current Phnom Penh regime,” Rainsy said in a June 28 online post.

NEW YORK (AP) — Anthony Volpe scored the winning run with an acrobatic slide on Aaron Judge's shallow sacrifice fly in the 10th inning, and the New York Yankees rallied past Seattle 6-5 on Thursday night after Mariners pitcher Bryan Woo took a no-hitter into the eighth.

Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled leading off the eighth for New York's first hit. Woo quickly allowed another single and was lifted after Austin Wells' sacrifice fly shaved Seattle's lead to 5-1.

Pinch-hitter Giancarlo Stanton made it 5-3 with a two-run homer off Matt Brash, and the Yankees were down to their final strike multiple times before tying it on Wells' two-run single off All-Star closer Andrés Muñoz in the ninth.

It was the sixth blown save for Muñoz in 27 chances this season, and the first win for the Yankees when trailing by at least five runs in the eighth inning or later since beating Texas on June 29, 2016.

New York completed a three-game sweep in a series between American League playoff contenders and won its fourth straight following its second six-game skid since mid-June.

The Yankees were 0-35 when trailing through eight innings this season before Gabe Speier (2-1) walked Trent Grisham to load the bases for Judge with one out in the 10th.

Cole Young and Miles Mastrobuoni each hit an RBI single off New York starter Marcus Stroman. Jorge Polanco launched a three-run homer off Clayton Beeter in the seventh.




Devin Williams (3-3) pitched a perfect 10th, stranding automatic runner Cal Raleigh.

It was Stanton's first career pinch-hit homer. ... Woo threw a career-high 103 pitches in a career-best 7 1/3 innings. ... Cody Bellinger became the first Yankees player since Derek Jeter in 2012 to have two 15-game hitting streaks in one season.

Mariners: RHP Luis Castillo (5-5, 3.31 ERA) opposes Tigers ace Tarik Skubal (10-2, 2.06) in the opener of a three-game series Friday at Detroit.

Yankees: LHP Carlos Rodón (9-6, 3.30 ERA) faces RHP Chris Flexen (5-0, 0.83) and the visiting Chicago Cubs on Friday night.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons discuss President Donald Trump signing his 'big, beautiful bill' into law and the opening of 'Alligator Alcatraz.'

EXCLUSIVE: Some individuals awaiting deportation at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in Florida were convicted of serious crimes, according to new information from the Florida Attorney General's office. 

""The left-wing press continues to spend their time amplifying false reports, but the reality is that there are monsters awaiting deportation within Alligator Alcatraz far worse than the monsters lurking in the surrounding Everglades,"" Jeremy Redfern, communications director for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, said in a statement.

""This group of murderers, rapists, and gang members are just a small sample of the deranged psychopaths that Florida is helping President Trump and his administration remove from our country,"" he continued.

Lazaro Rodriguez Santana, a Cuban national, was convicted in Texas of sexual assault and failure to register as a sex offender. Honduran national Jose Fortin was convicted of second-degree murder in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Furthermore, authorities say Oscar ""Satan"" Sanchez of Honduras is an MS-13 gang member who faced convictions for resisting arrest, conspiracy to commit murder and assault in New York, as well as RICO offenses.

Guatemalan national Luis Donald Corado was convicted of burglary, forced entry, and voyeurism in Miami. Specifically, Corado's case involved him looking into a woman's window, according to the Florida official's office.

Venezuelan national Wilfredo Alberto Lazama-Garcia is wanted for murder and aggravated robbery in the South American country. He is presumed to be a ""gotaway"" in 2021 during the border crisis.

In the United States, he was convicted of conspiracy ""to defraud the U.S. government in Oklahoma."" Eddy Lopez Jemot of Cuba was convicted of murder, arson, and assault. He was arrested for ""cutting the throat of an elderly woman"" in Key Largo, Florida, and then lit her residence on fire with hopes of hiding the evidence. 

Later that night, he allegedly ""threatened to kill"" another woman via beheading.

The facility is receiving initial backing by the state of Florida and is expected to receive repurposed FEMA funds on the federal level.

""It's known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz,' which is very appropriate, because I looked outside, and that's not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon,"" Trump said while touring the facility earlier this month. ""But very soon, this facility will have some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.""

Alligator Alcatraz opened earlier this month with fierce opposition from environmentalists, who oppose its location in the Everglades, as well as some Democrats, who have been critical of the Trump administration's immigration and deportation policies.

""This proposed detention center isn't just cruel, it's environmentally catastrophic. This facility would desecrate ecologically critical wetlands, trample on Tribal sovereignty, and transform one of the world's most cherished ecosystems into a prison camp for political gain,"" Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a June 24 news release.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats.

Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's stunning Democratic Party primary victory in the nation's most populous city proved to be a gift for Republicans aiming to paint Democrats as extreme radicals.

Republicans have been relentless in trying to anchor Mamdani to Democrats across the country who are running in competitive races in elections this year and in next year's midterms.

One of the latest examples comes from New Hampshire, in the high-profile 2026 race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

Republican candidate and former Sen. Scott Brown went up this week with a digital ad that edits a picture of Rep. Chris Pappas, the Democratic candidate in the race, alongside photos of Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive rock star who backed Mamdani.

TRUMP ARGUES NYC FACES DIRE CONSEQUENCES IF ‘COMMUNIST' MAMDANI BECOMES MAYOR

A digital ad by Republican senate candidate in New Hampshire former Sen. Scott Brown edits together a photo of the Democratic candidate in the 2026 race, Rep. Chris Pappas, next to photos of Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Scott Brown Senate campaign)

The caption on the ad reads ""Comrade Chris.""

Responding, the Pappas campaign told Fox News that ""Scott Brown is so desperate to make this election about anything other than the issues because he knows he embraces an agenda of higher costs and health care cuts that's deeply unpopular in New Hampshire.""

And Pappas campaign communications adviser Collin Gately added that ""Chris is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress, and has a demonstrated record of working across the aisle to deliver results for New Hampshire.""

THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO PREVENT FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NYC

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on Mamdani's leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after his victory that claimed, ""the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare.""

Aiming to tie House Democrats to Mamdani, NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella argued that ""every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him.""

The National Republican Senatorial Campaign (NRSC) also quickly got into the game, tying Pappas and Abdul El-Sayed - one of the contenders for the Democratic Senate nomination in battleground Michigan - to Mamdani.

No surprise - the Republican attacks have even come from President Donald Trump, who, since Mamdani's victory two weeks ago, has repeatedly claimed that the 33-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from the New York City borough of Queens is a ""communist.""

Mamdani, who convincingly topped former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic mayoral nomination and take a big step towards becoming the city's first Muslim mayor, is giving Republicans plenty of ammunition.

He's proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) ""tuition-free,"" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering ""free childcare"" for children up to age 5, and setting up government-run grocery stores.

RESURFACED MAMDANI PHOTO SPARKS SOCIAL MEDIA FIRESTORM 

Also fueling the Republican attacks are recent news items that have gone viral. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December, when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and his recent comments in a cable news interview that ""I have many critiques of capitalism.""

""The Democratic Party's trying to convince people that the tail is not wagging the dog, and they don't answer to the more extreme elements of their party,"" veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News. ""Now, that entire effort is undercut by a socialist winning handily in a bellwether election to determine who's going to run America's largest city.""

""It's a messaging nightmare that's going to unfold in real time from now until the midterms,"" said Reed, who is a top political adviser to Brown.

MAMDANI LANDS ENDORSEMENT OF TOP CUOMO BACKER

Veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News that ""the primary challenge for Democrats regarding Mamdani's candidacy is not his policy approach. The challenge is his party identification as a democratic socialist.""

""If there's any doubt about the negative implications of adding the word socialist to Mamdani's party affiliation, one need only peruse the national coverage whose focus has been on his party and the absence of party leadership to rush to his defense or offer endorsements,"" Lesperance, the president of New England College, said.

But Democrats question the effectiveness of the GOP push.

They argue that there's a world of difference between heavily blue New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin, and some key battleground states and swing districts across the country.

Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee told reporters the day after Mamdani's victory that ""I love New York, but it's a very liberal place and I don't know that you can necessarily apply that to the rest of the country.""

Gately, the Pappas campaign communications adviser, pointed to the ad from the Brown campaign and said that ""Granite Staters trust Chris and will see through these attacks.""

And veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo cautioned, ""I wouldn't read too much into this.""

Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, argued that ""Republicans are making too much out of this.""

America's natural grandeur, wide-open spaces and vast frontiers have inspired patriots for generations. As Americans pushed west, we learned to work with the land. We established national parks to protect the diverse geography that spans the nation and fuel economic prosperity. And we united around the desire to conserve America's beauty and natural resources for generations to come.  

But for the last several decades, the environment has become engulfed in partisan culture wars. As a result, our nation's leaders have increasingly failed to enact durable, long-lasting, and balanced environmental policies. A subject matter that once transcended partisan politics and brought leaders from all sides together has seen little to no substantial progress in the modern political era.  

These years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach and neglect have left America's natural resources in crisis. We've seen glimmers of hope with overwhelming bipartisan support for conservation legislation — like the ""Great American Outdoors Act."" But issues with broad support nationwide remain trapped in partisan gridlock.  

'AMERICA FIRST' NATIONAL PARKS PLAN FROM TRUMP SLAPS HIGHER FEES ON FOREIGN TOURISTS

Today, the National Park System is in $23 billion of debt. Poor forest management is exacerbating already catastrophic wildfires, costing our country between $394 billion and $893 billion annually. Unnecessarily stringent restrictions are stripping hunting and recreational access to public lands. Our nation's ecosystems and wildlife populations are in a state of disrepair. And America's water infrastructure no longer provides our agricultural industry and communities with the resources they need to flourish.

It should have never come to this — and it's time to right the ship. We are dedicated to putting every American first by prioritizing conservation, restoring our lands and waters and protecting our nation's outdoor heritage.  

That is why President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ""Make America Beautiful Again."" This order is a monumental first step to restoring America's natural beauty through bold leadership, innovation and commonsense policies.

The order establishes the Make America Beautiful Again Commission, which will give a politically diverse set of elected leaders, experts, nonprofits and other decision-makers with a wide variety of backgrounds a seat at the table. The commission will then submit a comprehensive strategy outlining recommended actions for achieving long-term conservation success.

The Make America Beautiful Again Commission will bring federal and state officials, private sector leaders, conservation organizations and tribal governments together to develop policy strategies for conservation. This executive order turns the nation's attention to the protection of our natural beauty and the expansion of our outdoor heritage. 

This commission provides an opportunity for us to protect water resources, restore forests and natural habitats, reduce waste and pollution, recover America's wildlife, enhance hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation on public lands, building environmental resilience and security, and advance conservation education and global leadership.  

The purpose of establishing this commission is to develop commonsense solutions and kick-start action that all Americans can agree is much needed and long overdue. Getting that job done requires bipartisan, inter-agency partnerships — bringing folks together to discuss their personal experiences and insights regarding environmental efforts, working to reach compromises and forming unlikely alliances around our shared love of nature.  

AMERICAN FLAG HUNG UPSIDE DOWN IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK IN PROTEST OVER LAYOFFS

America's conservation legacy has faded over the last few decades — but our pride for our nation's beauty lives on. As we celebrate the kickoff of America's 250th birthday, we are not only filled with pride and patriotism for this great nation, we are also reminded of our great responsibility to leave this democracy more beautiful than we found it.

We understand that it is our duty to conserve our natural resources, to be good stewards of our land, and to create long-lasting policies that actually work for the environment, the economy and the American people. From sea to shining sea, the natural majesty of the United States of America must be protected and passed down to future generations.  

We are kickstarting the restoration of our country's conservation legacy with this executive order. But the real work starts now as we come together to do all that we can to preserve our natural beauty, conserve our natural resources and Make America Beautiful Again.

Aviation security expert Jeff Price explains the failed 2001 shoe bombing that triggered the TSA's decades-long shoe removal rule, and how advancements in screening tech led DHS to finally reverse it.

After nearly two decades of shuffling barefoot through airport security lines, American travelers can finally leave their shoes on. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this week ended one of the most visible post-9/11 security measures, a rule born following a failed act of terror in 2001, when a British national, Richard Reid, tried to ignite explosives hidden in his sneakers mid-flight. 

The attempted terror attack did not succeed, but it sparked a new era of airport screening that would see millions of passengers removing their shoes — until now.

NEARLY 20-YEAR SHOE-OFF AIRPORT SECURITY POLICY IS ENDED BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

The policy's roots trace back to Dec. 22, 2001, when Reid, later dubbed the ""Shoe Bomber,"" boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. 

Hidden in his black high-top sneakers were plastic explosives and a makeshift detonator. Reid attempted to light a fuse with matches mid-flight but was subdued by passengers and flight crew.

The incident exposed a vulnerability in aviation security systems, particularly their inability to detect non-metallic threats like PETN, the explosive used in Reid's shoes.

TSA REVEALS THE SURPRISING REASON PEOPLE MIGHT SET OFF SECURITY ALARMS DURING SCREENING

Jeff Price, an aviation security expert and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, noted that security machinery at the time could not detect the types of explosives Reid used. 

""As far as shoe removal, the policy, I'm sure a lot of people know by now, started back in 2006, when it really dates back to 2001, when Richard Reid tried to blow up an airplane with a shoe bomb,"" Price said. ""But it wasn't until 2006 that the policy would be implemented to remove the shoes. And that was really because the technology at the time couldn't detect the types of explosives that he used or that were in use at the time.""

In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and Reid's failed bombing attempt, airport security procedures rapidly evolved, but technology lagged behind the threat. 

Price said that early metal detectors ""had a hard time detecting anything at the floor level"" and ""could never detect explosives.""

Shoe removal became the human workaround for what machines couldn't yet do.

""For a long time, the idea was: if we can't see it, we'll have people take it off,"" said Price, who was the former assistant security director at Denver International Airport. ""So that stuck with us for a long time and technologies have changed quite a bit since then.""

According to Price, the change came following the wide-scale adoption of millimeter wave imaging scanners. The machines are capable of detecting not just metal but also ceramics, plastics, liquids, and explosives, from head to toe.

""The new millimeter wave imaging machines that have been deployed to most airports do a great job of detecting explosives, liquids, ceramics, plastics and also metallic objects,"" Price said. ""They're from head to toe. They're not without fault — no system is. Every system's got false positives, and it's going to occasionally miss things. So, there's no perfect system. The question becomes: is it perfect enough? Or is it good enough to at least deter and hopefully detect the sort of item?""

Millimeter wave technology began replacing traditional metal detectors in the late 2000s, he explained.

""The deployments of millimeter waves continued to replace magnetometers all the way up until 2023–2024,"" Price said. ""They're still going on. I think there's been about seven to eight hundred of those deployed by now and its amazing technology.""

For the millions of passengers who've grown used to juggling shoes, bins, and boarding passes, the reversal may feel like overdue relief, and it's likely to help speed things up.

""I think it will,"" Price said of the potential to shorten wait times. ""It's almost inevitable that it will because it takes time to take off your shoes, put your shoes back on. We have to sit down to do it most of the time and depending on the kind of shoes you have, there's boots or dress shoes, those are harder to get on and off. So I think inevitably it's going to speed up those times.""

Price cautioned that convenience should never outweigh caution. 

""Security is always about balance. It's about a balance between efficiency and security. We still got to keep the system moving, but we still have to provide a level of security that keeps the public as secure as possible,"" he said. ""We'll never get to 100% security, because to do so, we'd have to quit flying!""

""But we want to get to a point where we've got a high enough level of detection and deterrence that we don't experience incidents — or, and it's kind of odd to say, we don't experience enough incidents that it really starts to affect the system.""

Price suspected that DHS weighed the lack of recent incidents involving shoes as part of the decision. 

""They're finding the majority of prohibited items in people's pockets, or they're in their backpacks or laptop bags, purses or something like that,"" he said. ""We're not finding them on people's ankles and so forth. That might have been a factor in this decision.""

TSA EXPECTED TO END SHOES-OFF POLICY AT MANY AIRPORTS ACROSS US

Yet he maintained that random screening should continue to play a critical role in keeping travelers and TSA vigilant. 

""Just to keep people honest,"" he said.

And while some critics dismiss the original shoe rule as ""security theater,"" Price points to the value of deterrence. 

""Anybody that is completely dedicated and wants to be successful will probably be able to do it,"" he said. ""Just like if somebody wanted to break in your house, they're probably going to be able to do it no matter how many security measures you deploy.""

""The goal though, is to make that level of deterrence so high that they don't go to your house. That they go somewhere else and try their criminal or terrorist acts. And that's really the goal of any security system is ‘not on my watch.' Out of my house.""

TSA turned a corner on the mandate to remove shoes during security, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announcing on Tuesday the immediate end of the shoe-off requirement.

Noem made the announcement about the nearly 20-year policy while at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., in a press conference late Tuesday afternoon. 

""In those 20 years since that policy was put in place, our security technology has changed dramatically. It's evolved. TSA has changed,"" she said at the presser. ""We have a multi-layered, whole-of-government approach now to security and to the environment that people anticipate and experience when they come into an airport that has been honed and it's been hardened.""

She added, ""We took a hard look at how TSA does its business, how it does its screening processes, and what we do to make people safe, but also provide some hospitality as well.""

The announcement was made in an effort to ""make screening easier for passengers, improve traveler satisfaction and will reduce wait times,"" according to a TSA press release.

Some passengers may still be subject to a search of their shoes ""if they get put into a different situation or need additional layers of screening.""

Noem said the removal of liquids, coats and belts are also being evaluated, declaring that ""the Golden Age of America is here.""

Just when you thought the radical left's social experiments couldn't get any more out of touch with the reality of everyday Americans, Washington Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Florida Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost have a new bill that would export the disastrous homelessness policies of Seattle to the entire nation. 

Their ""Housing Not Handcuffs Act"" would effectively give a green light to the homeless encampments, crime and public health crises that have crippled cities like Seattle, all under the guise of compassion. 

This is your warning. 

For those of us who have witnessed the decay of our once-beautiful cities, the premise of this bill is not just misguided, but insulting. The legislation, introduced to mark the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Grants Pass decision, would prohibit any federal agency from criminalizing a homeless person engaging in ""life-sustaining activities"" on ""public land.""

Sounds reasonable until you read the definitions. So-called ""life-sustaining activities"" includes ""moving, resting, sitting, standing, lying down, sleeping, protecting oneself and personal property from the elements, eating, and drinking."" In other words, your local park, plazas, and even post office parking lots could become permanent residence zones for homeless drug addicts, with local authorities powerless to intervene. 

Jayapal and Frost argue that fining or arresting people who are already struggling is counterproductive. This is a classic strawman argument.  

No one is suggesting that a simple fine will solve the complex issue of homelessness. But to strip communities of the ability to maintain order and safety is a surrender, not a solution. It's an open invitation for the kind of chaos that has become commonplace in Seattle, where a permissive culture has allowed encampments to fester, becoming magnets for drug use and violent crime. 

NEWSOM UNVEILS AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO CLEAR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA: 'NO MORE EXCUSES'

The ""Seattle model"" for homelessness has been an abject failure. I covered it, and many other far-left proposals from blue cities, in detail in my book, ""What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities.""  

For years, the city has thrown money at the problem, funding a constellation of nonprofits and enacting policies that prioritize the ""right"" to camp in public over the rights of law-abiding citizens to enjoy their communities. The result? A humanitarian crisis on an epic scale.

Homeless encampments filled with drug-addicted criminals took over elementary school property. Downtown Seattle looked like a zombie-ridden hellscape, fentanyl addicts wasting away, bodies contorted into near-impossible pretzels as they slowly killed themselves. The most recent Point-in-Time count found over 16,000 homeless people in King County, a number that continues to climb despite hundreds of millions in spending. Why bring these policies to Topeka, Kansas, Lansing, Michigang, or Orange County, California? 

DEMS, GOP FORM RARE ALLIANCE ON YOUTH HOMELESSNESS BILL AS CRISIS IMPACTS NATION

The ""Housing Not Handcuffs Act"" would nationalize this failure. It would prevent federal agencies from addressing the very real public safety and health issues that arise from encampments. The bill's language is so broad that it protects not just sleeping, but also storing personal property to the ""same degree as property in a private dwelling."" It even grants them privacy rights over their public encampments. Imagine the implications: sprawling, unregulated encampments with the same legal protections as you in your own home.

This isn't compassion; it's a dereliction of duty. It's a slap in the face to the business owners who have to clean up human waste from their storefronts, the parents who have to explain to their children why they can't play in the park, and the countless victims of crimes committed in and around these encampments.

The proponents of this bill will tell you that the solution is more housing. And while no one disagrees that affordable housing is a piece of the puzzle, they conveniently ignore the fact that many of the chronically homeless are struggling with severe mental illness and addiction. Simply providing a roof is not enough. We need a comprehensive approach that includes treatment, personal responsibility, and, yes, the enforcement of basic laws that keep our communities safe and livable for everyone. 

The ""Housing Not Handcuffs Act"" is not a serious proposal to address homelessness. It's a radical, open-borders approach to our public spaces, a bill that would turn every town in America into a potential Seattle. It's time for the rest of the country to wake up and see what happens when progressive platitudes collide with reality. The result is not a utopia of ""housing justice""; it's a landscape of human suffering, filth and fear. We can and must do better.

Trolling the international community, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize this week for his diplomatic efforts in procuring a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and building diplomatic relations between Israel and its Sunni Arab neighbors. 

Only four presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize: Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama. These are some of our worst leaders. Trump doesn't deserve the indignity of being on that list. 

Roosevelt won the award for helping negotiate the end of the Russo-Japanese War, one of the first instances of American intervention in international diplomacy. Fair enough. 

Wilson, though, had promised neutrality in any European conflict in his 1913 campaign. His campaign slogan was “He Kept Us Out of War.” By 1917, we were in it, breaking the stalemate and likely ensuring another war. Wilson was handed the award in 1920 for his role in founding the League of Nations, one of the components of his 14-point postwar peace plan. Though the Nobel committee was impressed by the president's technocratic ideas, Americans were less so. The United States never ratified entrance into the league, and Europe plunged into another world war soon enough.

In 2009, Obama didn't even have to fail to win. His nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, for “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” was famously filed a mere 12 days after he took office. 

Then again, Obama's presidency was imbued with a messianic fervor that allowed elites, both domestically and abroad, to celebrate preemptively his unrealized accomplishments. Retrospectively, the problem isn't that Obama had done nothing exceptional in his first two weeks on the job but that it's challenging to think of any important foreign policy accomplishment from the next eight years. 

Perhaps his most notorious achievement was needlessly destabilizing Libya. Or maybe it was shielding Iranian nuclear and ballistic weapons programs. Then again, consistently botching Syria was no small feat. Nor was failing either to solidify control of Afghanistan or to extract American troops, as he had promised. The Paris Agreement, which Obama never bothered to bring to Congress for ratification, was, like its champion, bereft of substance.  

Now, I suppose attempting to lift Obama's prestige was no less rational than handing former Vice President Al Gore a peace prize in 2007 for his “efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change.” This was the heyday of An Inconvenient Truth, a 2006 work of metafiction in which Gore made a slew of alarmist predictions regarding the global apocalypse, none of which have come close to transpiring. There are numerous scientists and entrepreneurs who have created a better, more peaceful world. Gore is not one. 

President Ronald Reagan did not win the Nobel Peace Prize for helping trigger the collapse of the Soviet Union or setting the stage for the ensuing calm. Instead, in 2002, Carter was awarded a Nobel Prize “for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” It was a disgrace. 

Carter rarely met a communist dictator who didn't impress him, calling Edward Gierek of Poland one of the most “enlightened leaders” of the world, Marshal Tito “a man who believes in human rights,” Nicolae Ceaușescu a champion of “human rights,” and so on. Carter advocated Daniel Ortega's reign and legitimized one bogus election after the next to keep Hugo Chavez in power. Carter also famously “brokered” a treaty with North Korea in 1994, undercutting then-President Bill Clinton's efforts to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 

For two decades, Carter begged the West to normalize Hamas and fostered a deep “fondness” for Yasser Arafat, the godfather of modern terrorism. Arafat, of course, was perhaps the most notorious recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, winning it in 1994, only a few years before rejecting the first Palestinian state and plunging the region into two intifadas. 

In any event, Carter never advanced the cause of “human rights” much less peace anywhere. 

The same can't be said of Trump. No, we don't know how history turns out, but we do know the Islamic Republic, the force behind virtually every ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has been critically weakened, its nuclear program likely incapacitated. It should be remembered that this action was taken only after Trump offered Iran a peaceful means of ending the conflict, even after Israel's offensive. 

Trump also supported Netanyahu's decapitation of Hezbollah, allowing Lebanon a chance at peace. Meanwhile, Israel sent Bashar Assad into Russian exile, allowing Syria a chance to strike a peace deal as well. Sooner or later, the Gaza operation will end, and it is unlikely Hamas will be in charge. In his first term, Trump initiated the Abraham Accords, which normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. Trump has cleared the decks for bringing in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Syria.

Somewhat lost in the Middle East news is that Trump has procured a promise from NATO members to increase their contributions significantly from 2% of military spending to 5% by 2035. Who knows if European nations will honor those commitments? But numerous presidents, including Obama, have tried and failed on this front. The agreement strengthens the alliance and ensures Europe has a larger stake in its own future.

THE PROGRESSIVE INTIFADA INVADES NEW YORK

These achievements are likely to be more consequential than those of any presidential winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.  

None of which is to say there are no worthy recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2023, for example, the committee awarded the prize to Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian champion of human rights held in the notorious Evin prison in Tehran.

SOUTHEAST FLORIDA — Illegal immigrants picked up by state troopers during traffic stops this week are among the first to be moved into “Alligator Alcatraz,” a new state-run federal detention facility in the Everglades.

During a six-hour visit with the Florida Highway Patrol around southeastern Florida, the Washington Examiner had a front-row seat to see how the state was developing its anti-illegal immigration facility to assist the White House's deportation efforts.

Earlier this spring, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) allowed state and local police to be deputized to carry out select federal immigration duties under the Immigration and Nationality Act's Section 287(g). The Trump administration has encouraged the use of nonfederal police to help with immigration-related tasks as it seeks to deport illegal immigrants.

In the past, Florida Highway Patrol troopers who pulled over a vehicle with illegal immigrants would have contacted federal immigration authorities to let them know about the traffic stop, but they would not have been able to bring those people to federal agents. Now, they can transport illegal immigrants to federal authorities, creating a law enforcement pipeline of new immigrant detainees.

In a matter of hours during the Washington Examiner ride-along, troopers apprehended 20 illegal immigrants found during eight traffic stops.

“I was informed by Border Patrol that all 20 of the illegal aliens that we brought in for processing were all going to be transferred to Alligator Alcatraz for further processing,” FHP Sgt. Tony Kingery wrote in a statement following the ride-along.

Since the state trooper operation began in March, 3,300 illegal immigrants have been picked up on the street through traffic stops and turned over to federal police to go through deportation proceedings, an FHP spokesman told the Washington Examiner.

Here's a behind-the-scenes account of how Florida police officers are helping President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation. 

A crew of troopers and Border Patrol agents gathered inside a gated government facility parking lot before 7 a.m. local time to discuss the day's operations.

That location, as well as the names, faces, license plates, and other identifiable information, was withheld by the Washington Examiner to protect privacy.

Federal and state police who left earlier in the morning had already made two traffic stops that resulted in 11 illegal immigrants detained. 

Michelle R. Suskauer, former president of the Florida Bar and a criminal defense lawyer, questioned whether involving state troopers in immigration work was appropriate, given that it could divert them from traditional work and raise possible civil liberties concerns.

“The use of state highway patrol officers and county sheriffs under programs like 287(g) to assist federal immigration enforcement raises important questions about public safety priorities, legal safeguards, and the effective use of state resources,” Suskauer wrote in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

The Washington Examiner rode along with Kingery, a Navy veteran and 25-year state trooper on the criminal interdiction unit.

Kingery said troopers were still focused on carrying out the same traffic stops around the state that they have always done but that now a driver or passenger determined to be an illegal immigrant could be turned over to federal police rather than released after an encounter.

Less than 10 minutes into the ride, Kingery's cellphone rang with the “Bad Boys” theme song to “Cops” as the ringtone. A voice on the other end told him to come by a nearby gas station where a trooper had pulled over a white van that had cut across three lanes to make a last-minute turn. The middle passenger was found not wearing a seat belt.

The three appeared to have been headed to a work site. The driver provided a temporary Florida driver's license to the officer. 

The trooper asked all three in the van if they were U.S. citizens. All three stated that they were not.

“We have a Border Patrol agent that's on his way over here that's going to confirm everybody and do checks to make sure that they've gone through the process and that they're here legally,” Kingery said.

Border Patrol agents arrived on the scene and spoke with the two men and a boy in Spanish. 

The 15-year-old boy was identified as Guatemalan, and the police confirmed that he had been smuggled across the southern border before being released to an adult in Florida, where he works a summer job. The two men were taken into Border Patrol custody because of their immigration status.

Another trooper stopped a dump truck outside of a tool store after he observed that the middle passenger was not wearing a seat belt and the dump truck's cover was not pulled fully across the back to prevent its load from spilling out of the top.

“All it is is just straight up 100% laziness of not wanting to have to climb up there and pull that cover out to cover the load,” Kingery said. 

The driver and two passengers were identified by the officer on the scene as illegal immigrants. One man had a DUI conviction and had previously been deported. The detained driver was determined not to have a driver's license and to have previously lost his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Florida.

But Border Patrol is given the first right of refusal and requested that all three be brought in.

A few blocks away, a trooper had pulled over a second dump truck. The driver's family members were already on site when the Washington Examiner pulled in. Several of the family members had tears running down their faces as they spoke with the man in the trooper's car and pleaded with the troopers not to take him in.

“They pull for the heartstrings,” Kingery said.

The officer had observed that the dump truck's back doors were open and swinging back and forth while the truck was going down the road.

“Imagine us right now driving in a pickup truck, and that thing swings open,” Kingery said. “It's going to hit the car right in the driver compartment. So that's super, super dangerous, and that's why he stopped them.”

The driver possessed only a Florida learner's permit, which requires a licensed driver over the age of 21 to supervise. In this case, the passenger was a woman with a learner's permit. The dump truck also had a broken brake light.

Border Patrol requested him. “Bring him over,” Kingery said, paraphrasing the federal agents.

Our cruiser pulled into a department store parking lot where a young man had been pulled over for texting while driving. When the trooper asked the driver for a driver's license and insurance, the man provided a plastic card that stated it had been issued by the Guatemalan Consulate in the United States. 

However, the Guatemalan Consulate does not make identification cards for Guatemalan citizens in the U.S., according to Kingery.

“It's not a recognized government ID card,” Kingery said. “If they do a job and someone writes them a check, they need a way … to cash checks so they'll get these cards. And last time I checked, they were charging them anywhere between $150 and $250 a card to make it for them.”

In addition to texting and driving, the driver faced a criminal charge for driving without a license, but after sending the driver's information to Border Patrol, an agent told the officer to transport him to their facility.

Shortly after, a tow truck arrived and loaded the abandoned car to take it to an impound lot.

Landscapers have largely stopped allowing workers to ride in their trucks as they drive from one job site to the next, for fear it made them targets to troopers, according to Kingery, who added that troopers targeted vehicles for violations, not because they may be more likely to be carrying people without legal status.

Since the FHP's crackdown this spring, troopers have observed processions of landscape workers in orange and green shirts driving in individual cars behind a truck to the next site, according to Kingery.

Kingery pulled over what he called a “black box,” a large pickup truck whose window tint was so dark that he could not make out how many people were inside.

The driver was a U.S. citizen woman. Kingery used a handheld device to measure the window tint and determined it was beyond the legal limit. He gave her a citation for the tinted windows.

A large delivery truck weighed down by a mass of plants was pulled over in the parking lot of a garden center for what appeared to be darkly tinted windows, Kingery said the responding trooper told him.

Upon closer inspection, the windows were determined to be within the legal tint amount, but while the officer spoke with the driver, men in the back of the cab attempted to escape. The officer was able to detain the men in the back of his cruiser until additional troopers showed up.

The three landscape workers were determined to be illegally present in the U.S. and transported to the federal facility.

A few miles away, we were cruising down a one-lane road along beachside resorts and gated communities when Kingery hit the brakes to avoid hitting a car that had suddenly stopped in front of us at a pedestrian crosswalk, even though no pedestrians were around. 

“See, that's nervousness,” Kingery said, referring to the driver's behavior.

The female driver identified as Colombian and provided a temporary driver's license and a federally issued employment authorization card, though the validity of the card could not be confirmed.

Border Patrol requested that she be brought in. The woman was allowed to call a friend to come pick up her car to avoid the financial headache of an impound.

“We're trying to accommodate as much as possible,” Kingery said. “She was being very cooperative.”

The woman was walked to a trooper's cruiser, placed inside, then taken to the federal facility.

Shortly after 11 a.m., Kingery lit up a BMW with an expired tag. The driver turned out to be a U.S. citizen and received a warning.

For the remaining two hours, Kingery continued around the region and pointed out where recent police chases of illegal immigrants had occurred.

The Washington Examiner arrived back at the federal facility where we started six hours earlier. Here, all 20 people brought in for further review by Border Patrol were determined to be deportable and will be sent in a matter of hours or days to Alligator Alcatraz, where immigration judges will decide their cases quickly.

FLORIDA LEADS STATES IN CARRYING OUT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION MISSION

DeSantis approved the 3,000-person tent facility in the Everglades as a way to expand immigrant detention facilities. Alligator Alcatraz was given the nickname for the thousands of gators that lurk in the swamps surrounding the facility, which DeSantis quipped would serve as security to deter people from trying to escape.

The State Department began to lay off more than 1,300 employees on Friday, including diplomats and career civil servants, according to multiple reports.

The Trump administration was widely anticipated to trim the department, even though there have been concerns that a reduction could affect the United States's global influence.

An email with a layoff notice went out Friday to 1,107 civil servants and 246 foreign service officers with domestic assignments in the U.S., a senior State Department official told the Associated Press.

Foreign service officers, among those who have been notified, will be placed on 120-day administrative leave until they are dismissed, a notice obtained by the outlet said. Most civil servants will be dismissed after 60 days.

“In connection with the departmental reorganization … the department is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,” the notice said. “Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found from centralization or consolidation of functions and responsibilities.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously said the agency's transformation is necessary to cut through its “bloated bureaucracy.”  

“There were 40 boxes on this piece of paper,” he told senators in May. “That means 40 people had to check off ‘yes' before it even got to me. That's ridiculous. And if any one of those boxes didn't get checked, the memo didn't move. That can't continue.” 

He is eliminating 132 offices within the department and rewriting personnel rules to allow them to fire foreign service and civil service officials.

The cuts aren't a surprise. The Trump administration has cut jobs across the federal government in a cost-saving effort led by the Department of Government Efficiency. The administration said it wants to cut through a government it views as bloated and inefficient. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to move forward with the plan to reduce the federal workforce. The decision overturned a lower court's pause on the executive order.

Elon Musk had helped lead that effort, though his large goals of up to $2 trillion in cuts appear to have come up well short. DOGE said it has saved $190 billion to date.

Cuts at the State Department could be some of the most damaging. Thomas Shannon, an undersecretary of state in the first Trump administration, told NPR that the department is doing more than just “trimming fat.”

STATE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATING RUBIO IMPERSONATOR

“This isn't just about trimming fat,” Shannon said. “We're removing a significant chunk of our civil service and foreign service employees, and restructuring in ways that reflect a diminished global agenda.”

“We're going to end up cutting a lot of really talented individuals,” he added. “They'll be like players in a game of musical chairs — suddenly finding themselves without a seat.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump has announced an additional 35% tariff for Canada that will go into effect on August 1 with considerations for an adjustment if “Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.”

Trump has sent out a number of letters to several different countries announcing his tariff intentions over the last few days.

“Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a Tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,” Trump wrote in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to social media.

The president's tariffs on Canada will be some of the most impactful for U.S. consumers, as border states share energy and other things with the country. He said that if Canada offers reciprocal tariffs, he will increase the tariffs to whatever their number is on top of the 35%.

Countries who have not received a letter or who have reached a trade agreement will be charged a blanket rate, NBC News reported Thursday. 

“We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,” Trump said, according to the outlet.

NINETY DEALS IN 90 DAYS: THE DOLLAR HAS DROPPED STEADILY, DEFYING TRUMP TARIFFS

Canada is the top buyer of U.S. exported goods, importing around $349 billion in 2024. They also shipped $413 billion worth of goods to America last year, the third-highest for any country to the U.S.

Trump added that there will be no tariffs if Canada decides “to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approval…in a matter of weeks.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Lawyers for pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for being arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside his apartment in New York City and subsequently detained at a detention center in Louisiana. 

Khalil's lawsuit is for $20 million in damages, claiming he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted, and had his reputation tarnished due to unsubstantiated claims against him of antisemitism, among other things, the Washington Post reported. His lawsuit named the State Department, ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security. 

Khalil expressed anger over being arrested in March, citing an excessive amount of emotional pain over the events that transpired. Khalil claimed he was “effectively kidnapped” and accused President Donald Trump and other government officials of terrorizing “him and his family,” according to the Washington Post.

“I cannot describe the pain of that night,” Khalil said. “This is something I will never forgive.”

He was held in LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana, for 104 days. In June, a federal judge ordered Khalil to be released from the detention facility.

In addition to the financial restitution, Khalil said his lawsuit was predicated on his wanting to prove a point to the federal government, particularly the Trump administration. He said the administration abused its authority. Moreover, he said he wanted to show the administration could be held accountable for its actions, the Washington Post reported.

“They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,” Khalil said. “Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”

THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S EXTREME RHETORIC IS COMING HOME TO ROOST

Despite the significant amount specified in the lawsuit, Khalil said he would abandon his quest for restitution if he received an apology from the Trump administration and it decided to implement changes to its illegal immigration enforcement policies, according to the Washington Post. If no apology was offered, and he won his case, Khalil said he would split any settlement funds he received with other people who were “targeted” by the Trump administration for pro-Palestinian beliefs. 

“My beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,” said Khalil. “It's as simple as that.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The day after the odometer on his father's 1973 Ford Maverick “turned over” from 99,999 to 100,000, my friend Scott skipped school for the first and probably last time in his life. Can you blame him? After all, everyone in our rather upscale suburb had seen the eight-year-old compact Ford rolling around at a walking pace for the better part of the previous evening, Scott's father honking the horn and pointing excitedly to the old white bedsheet he'd duct-taped to the faded green paint of the driver's door for everyone to see. A series of numbers rendered in shaky black shoe polish told the story: “100,000!” In the other front seat, sitting next to a similar bedsheet on the passenger door, was Scott. His father had made this participation mandatory.

Scott was beyond humiliated, of course. This was a yuppie neighborhood before anyone knew the term, and our church parking lot was so clogged with brand-new Mercedes-Benz 240D sedans it looked like a taxi pickup line at the Frankfurt airport. His classmates were alternately contemptuous and slightly impressed: yeah, that old Maverick was stupid and lame, but how the heck did anyone get a car to turn 100,000 miles without blowing up? Ford certainly didn't expect it to happen; at least that was the fairly explicit message one got after sitting in any of its 70s-era products and realizing that the odometer would effectively declare Tilt! at the 100k mark.

Today, of course, every new car sold in America will cheerfully register six digits on the dashboard, which is appropriate because the average privately owned vehicle on the American road is 12.6 years old and has racked up close to 150,000 miles. It's now common for banks to offer a five- or six-year term on used cars and trucks that already have over 100,000 miles on the clock. This dramatic change in our automotive fortunes reflects significant quality improvements across the industry more than it does economic stagnation, but it raises the question: Have odometer readings become irrelevant?

That's a trick question. They always were.

If my friend's Maverick-driving father has a modern equivalent, perhaps it's Nader Assaad, who just “turned over” the odometer on his 2014 Lexus CT200h and posted the evidence on Reddit. Since the Lexus has a six-figure odometer, that means it's done a million miles in just 12 years. His photographs show a clean car in straight and unblemished condition, and he fully documents every bit of his exhaustive maintenance program. On a whim, I compared Assaad's car with a Lexus of the same year and model, chosen at random from the internet.

You'd think that a car with just 106,737 miles would be a better bet than a million-miler, but a quick investigation showed some significant damage in the vehicle history, plus a service record that became spotty at about the 50,000-mile mark. The interior bore signs of significant wear and a desperate, Armor-All-laden detailing. I can't see any scenario where I would purchase this “low-miles” Lexus over one with almost 10 times as much mileage, but with all the other factors in its favor.

In fact, the original purpose of the odometer had nothing to do with documenting wear and tear on a car. The “trip odometer” didn't yet exist, and there was certainly nothing like GPS, so in an era of maps and written directions, the ability to do some on-the-fly odometer math was necessary to know approximately when you'd reach the next turn or exit.

How did we get into the habit of using odometer readings as a shorthand for vehicle conditions? It probably happened around the time the average used-car dealer figured out how to “roll back” the gauge. At that point, “low miles” became an easy selling point and a way to convince customers to pay over the market price for older, less desirable products.

That's still the case today, which is probably why odometer fraud is still fairly common in the digital era. NHTSA estimates that more than 450,000 cars are “clocked” every year. It's not just small-time corner lots doing it, either. A class action lawsuit in New Jersey accused FedEx of selling vehicles with repaired or replaced instrument clusters that don't represent the vehicle's actual mileage, and failing to inform the buyers accordingly. This would be “clocking” on a massive scale, but ask yourself: Would any reasonably informed person expect FedEx to sell low-mileage creampuffs just for the heck of it?

In fact, if you were a small business owner looking to add a former delivery truck to your fleet, chances are you'd ignore the odometer completely. Instead, you would examine the factors that will actually affect your ability to make money with the vehicle in the future: maintenance records, the presence of rust or corrosion, and the condition of the mechanical bits, especially the engine and transmission. You might take note of total engine hours and engine idle hours, information that's available in many modern vehicles and pretty much all trucks. Last but not least, you might use a diagnostic tool to query the vehicle computer for trouble codes or problem reports.

Believe it or not, the above methodology works as well for buying a nearly new luxury SUV as it does for picking a used box truck. A $75 OBD-II “scantool” from Harbor Freight or Amazon will give you the total engine hours in nearly any vehicle made during the past decade. If it doesn't at least vaguely correspond to the numbers on the odometer, that's a possible indicator of fraud — but it's also a great way to compare otherwise similar vehicles. There are a lot of ways to rack up mileage, ranging from “Montana highway commuter” to “Manhattan Uber driver,” and you can often figure out which is which from the total engine hours and idle hours.

Maintenance records are also critical, and in some cases, they can be obtained after the fact from dealerships or manufacturers. Looking for a used car? Get the service intervals from the internet and make sure they were followed. As an example, most Hondas need a timing belt every 100,000 miles or every 10 years, whichever is first. When in doubt, go by time. It's a dirty little secret in the auto business that many car parts wear out over time, not mileage. This is doubly true for every rubber or plastic piece in the vehicle. If you can't find a record for any required service, assume it needs to be done before you put a single mile on the car, and work that into the price.

If you're shopping for anything more exotic than an Accord or Camry, you should also get to know a local independent specialist mechanic for your chosen marque. A good “indy shop” can do a pre-purchase inspection for a few hundred bucks. There are at least three ways this will save you that much or more. The inspection could reveal serious problems that make buying that particular vehicle unwise. It can uncover deferred maintenance or other costs that can be negotiated into the purchase. Last but definitely not least: if the dealer is afraid to have the car inspected, there's probably a reason for that.

F1 FOR EFFORT 

Want to buy the best used car you can get? Follow the above steps in order. Use a scan tool to weed out cars with obvious problems. Review the maintenance records to see if it's worth having the vehicle inspected. Then use an inspection on the car you're serious about to make sure you're getting a good one. This is a lot more of a hassle than just opening a car door and waiting for the mileage to pop up on the instrument cluster, but it's also much less risky.

And if you find a great vehicle by using the above steps, and you manage to put a lot of miles on it, and you want to brag about it to the world, do your children a favor — and don't.

It will take a “total mobilization of our forces,” in the words of new Autocracy in America host Garry Kasparov.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Since The Atlantic first released the podcast Autocracy in America last fall, Donald Trump was elected president again. Staff writer Anne Applebaum describes how Trump's return to the White House fits into the changing geopolitical landscape as she hands the show over to its new host: Garry Kasparov. The former world chess champion and lifelong democracy activist will guide a series of conversations about society's complacency with liberal values and how this carelessness has fueled a democratic retreat—and a new belligerence among dictators.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Anne Applebaum. Last summer, I made the first series of this podcast together with my friend and colleague Peter Pomerantsev. We were not trying to predict the future. Instead, we looked at some of the ways in which the United States had already adopted practices common in the autocratic world.

Jefferson Cowie: My nightmare is that fascism comes to America, but it's marching under the banner of freedom.

Applebaum: We talked about the use of violence and intimidation in politics.

Stephen Richer: It's a little bit like the Eye of Sauron. With that—when it's turned on you, you feel it. You get a lot of ugliness directed your way.

Applebaum: About the abuse of courts and about kleptocracy.

Sheldon Whitehouse: This is a new beast that is stalking America's political landscape.

Applebaum: About older American traditions of state capture.

Richard White: He would choose all the boards and commissions. He packed the courts. And, once you have the courts and the legislature—and you've already got the executive—you have all three branches of government.

[Music out]

Applebaum: Now, in Donald Trump's second presidency, all of those autocratic behaviors are being accelerated, amplified, even promoted by the federal government. He's fired civil servants.

CNN Newsclip: Breaking overnight. First, paid leave. Then, buyouts. Now, firings.

Applebaum: He seeks to replace them with loyalists and seeks to intimidate enemies and political rivals.

Laura Barron Lopez: He wants loyalty across the board with little to no resistance. That is his top goal.

Applebaum: Above all, Trump has adopted the practices of kleptocracy on a scale no previous American president ever imagined.

Scott Galloway: I think we've essentially become a kleptocracy that would make [Vladimir] Putin blush.

Applebaum: But while brand new in the history of America, Trump's actions are very familiar to those who have studied the rise of autocracy in other places. Garry Kasparov, who has not merely studied the rise of Putinism in Russia, but lived through it and fought against it, is now joining Autocracy in America to host our new season.

Some of you will know Garry as a former world chess champion—indeed, one of the greatest chess players who ever lived. But Garry also has a long record opposing the rise of Putinism, well before it was fashionable. So at a moment when Western companies were still piling into Russia, when democratic leaders allowed Russia to host the G8 summit in St. Petersburg, Garry told a really different story. I looked up something that I wrote about him in 2007. And I found this quote; this is something he wrote in The Wall Street Journal. He said, “Russia is in a moment of crisis, and every decent person must stand up and resist the rise of the Putin dictatorship.”

[Music]

Applebaum: As I noted at the time, this was a pretty lonely view. It was not shared in London, where I lived at the time, and there wasn't even that much reaction in Russia. Although an angry fan did hit him over the head with a chessboard. And Garry, who's now with us, said, “I'm lucky the national sport of the Soviet Union is chess, not baseball.”

[Music out]

Applebaum: Garry, welcome.

Garry Kasparov: Thank you very much, Anne, for reminding me about this very precarious moment.

Because this angry fan was of course on the Kremlin's payroll. Since the moment when he hit me with the chessboard, immediately it appeared online. So, the videos were made from two different angles.

So somebody was waiting for the moment. I guess they wanted me just to get crazy and just to hit him and to ask my bodyguard to attack him. But I decided to keep my calm, which was not easy. But again, thank God it was not a baseball bat. So I'm really, you know, really happy just to continue the program. And I think it's probably worth, you know, just reminding the audience that, you know, first time we met and worked together it was 10 years ago, and it was not in America, but in Canada. We joined forces at a debate. The Munk Debates. It's a probably largest public debate in Canada, Oxford-style. So we faced 3,000 people, and the opposition was Stephen Cohen, pro-Putin, U.S. scholar, very famous, and Vladimir Pozner, who has been working for Soviet propaganda since, I think, 1961—before we were born. And we had to deal with a very, very, difficult task, because the house motion was: The West should engage, not isolate, Russia.

Applebaum: Yeah, yeah. It was Be it resolved that the West should engage and not isolate Russia, which of course was what the Canadian audience wanted.

Kasparov: Exactly. It was one year after Crimea's annexation and the beginning of the war in Ukraine. But still, the mood of the audience was not in our favor. But we proved to be a very good team, and we won, which I think was quite a shock for our opponents—and for many in the audience, because again, it was Canada. So that was the beginning of our cooperation. But I'm just wondering: Could you, in your worst nightmares, imagine that 10 years since this debate in Canada, we would be talking about the real threat to America shifting sides, and no longer being a beacon of hope, the guardian of democracy, but becoming a potential ally for “Autocracy Inc.” worldwide?

Applebaum: I have to say that I did not imagine it. I mean, it's funny. Roundabout 2014, 2015—that was when I started following the rise of Russian propaganda and influence campaigns, mostly in Europe. I saw them in Poland; I saw them in the Czech Republic; I saw them in Hungary. And I even wrote something about it at the time, and I remember talking to people about it in Washington. And people said, Well, this is all very terrible, you know, for Slovenia, and we feel really bad. But it, again, it felt like a very distant problem. And really, just a year or two later, in 2016, we saw the Russian influence campaign being conducted in the United States. And since then, the gradual accumulation of, as I said, these authoritarian practices and behavior in American politics.

And we are now at a point where it doesn't sound crazy to talk about the Putinization of America. Or the rise of Russian-style kleptocracy in America. So it's been a really extraordinary decade. I mean, it's really been one in which the United States has gone from one polar opposite. From a symbol of, it's not just … democracy might even be the wrong word. It's about the rule of law. It's about transparency; it's about accountability. It's about Americans believing in freedom, and Americans having allies and being part of this network of other rule-of-law countries in the world. And we've gone from that to being a really rogue power which seeks to break up all of our alliances and maybe instead do deals with dictatorships. You know, you, as I said at the beginning, you were an early observer of the changes in Russia that created the system that we saw today. Tell me: When you look at the first months of the second Trump administration, do you see something similar? What's setting off alarm bells in your head?

Kasparov: The similarities are really frightening. It's a creation of classical oligarchy. And I think many Americans, they get confused, because they believe that any rich person who is buying influence is an oligarch. But by my classification, when you look at Putin's Russia, you should disregard the simple spread of this word for any rich man. [John D.] Rockefeller, [Andrew] Carnegie, in the past, J. P. Morgan. Or now we just have [Jeff] Bezos, [Mark] Zuckerberg. I still wouldn't call them oligarchs, because—while they are buying influence, clearly, so that's what happens in any representative democracy—they are not involved in the decision-making process. What we saw with [Elon] Musk and Trump, it's basically creating money and power. It's like in the same hands. That's what Putin did. So it's a gradual merge, or synergy, between those who control money and those directly making decisions. It's not about trying to find, you know, buying favors from Democrats or Republicans. It's basically sticking to one group of people that are under your control and making decisions. Also, Trump's statements—to my trained ear, it's loud and clear. He disregarded the Democratic opposition, basically saying, I can rule only relying on Republican votes. That's a proclamation of a one-party system. We can definitely give Trump credit for being very consistent. He has been pushing through his agenda, ignoring the laws of the land, and always, you know, just trying to bully people. That's also a typical sign of this early oligarchy where, you know, you don't have resources to go against everybody, but you pick a few best targets, and you go after them. And the rest have no choice but to obey. Unless they want to feel the power of the dictator's wrath.

Applebaum: Yeah, and then I was going to say in the case of Putin's Russia, it was even more brutal. So if you kill one journalist, then all the other journalists are afraid.

Kasparov: Yeah, exactly. You kill one journalist; you start closing TV stations. And then you go after the richest man in the country. So you basically confiscate his company, put him in jail. And the rest recognize that it's time to play by the new rules.

So again, Trump is facing much tougher challenge, because American democracy has 250 years, even if we do not count the colonial years, that also had the rule of law as a basis for society. Russia, it's never experienced the long period of law and order, in its normal, democratic terms. But still, you know, certain things are just, you know, just have to ring the bell. It's an alarm. When they say, Oh, it's urgent, there's a mandate. The president had a mandate we have to push through. And if the judiciary is standing in the way, to hell with them. So the moment you hear urgency that should go over or should trump—pun intended—should trump the rule of law, that's another sign that they are aiming at the very center of America's democracy. It's a separation of powers.

Applebaum: Yeah, it's exactly what Putin does. I mean, Putin—because of the war, it's an emergency. Therefore he has special powers.

Kasparov: But it was always emergency. It was always emergency. In 2004 after this, the tragedy in Beslan when the terrorists, you know, took over the school, and then Putin used it immediately to gain more power by canceling the direct elections of the governors. So that's—again, it's every crisis, is always used to enlarge the portfolio of an autocrat. And, again, Trump is facing much more formidable opposition. But he's trying, I mean, we can't deny that he's trying. And, unlike his first presidency, it seems that, again, it says Trump already, succeeded in creating a … I wouldn't say political class, but it's a cluster in American politics that is just, you know, following him, obediently. Without any questions. Repeating even the most outrageous lies and statements, that even by the first Trump administration would be unheard.

Applebaum: You know, this is the thing that surprises Europeans the most. Europeans—who've been dealing with Americans for years and years in security contexts, economic contexts, business, and so on—[are] discovering that there is this group of Americans who are sycophants. Because nobody ever thought of Americans being like that. But it turns out that you can win them over, or can bully them in such a way that they do exactly as you say. They provide a kind of echo chamber—even to lies. I mean, it's funny, talking about lies. What's also surprising to me is the way in which the Trump administration, Trump himself, use lies in the way that dictators use them. In other words, Trump isn't trying to—for example, as the Soviet Union once did, he's not trying to create a full story about reality. That, if we all work together and cooperate, then eventually we're going to build communism.

Kasparov: No narrative. No fixed narrative.

Applebaum: Exactly. Instead, the idea is just to lie constantly, all the time, about almost everything—whether it's the price of eggs or the price of gas, or what he said to Putin yesterday. Or, you know, whatever it is, he's lying. And this has another effect. I mean, what it does is: It makes people doubt whether anything is true. I mean, how are you supposed to know what's true if the president lies all the time? And that is, of course, exactly the same tactic that Putin used in Russia. I mean, if you lie or your propagandists lie nonstop, then the reaction of the public is to say, Right, you know, politics is a dirty game. I have no idea what's true or what's not true. I better just stay home.

Kasparov: Absolutely. You know, a constant lie becomes a very important test for loyalty. Because you want to make sure that your sycophants—your administration, your appointees—they follow you without asking questions. And you want to test them, so they have to repeat the same lies. They have to defend these lies. And they know Trump was lying, And they still had no choice, either. Okay. They have a choice. Either you leave, or you keep lying. And so far, I didn't see anyone leaving. So it seems that, again, Trump still has his hold over a new American bureaucracy, that is just, again, willing to do whatever. Just to stay in power.

[Music]

Applebaum: More on that, after the break.

[Midroll]

Applebaum: You know, there's something you wrote in The Atlantic this spring, and you were calling on the opposition to Trump to defend the value system that has made America great. You know this question of values underlines, I know, a lot of what you wanna tackle in this season of the show. Say more about it. What's this value system that you, as an outsider, identify with America?

Kasparov: I think now we just have to identify—that's the threat to American democracy. And I believe it's an existential threat. And that means, to defend it, we have to abandon some conflicts that separated American society. It's normal. We have many issues where we can, you know, argue, we can disagree. But the key is that we always relied on the framework created by the Founding Fathers that allowed us to debate these issues. One day, you know, we win. One day we lose. But again, it was a healthy process. And sometimes, you know, maybe just, too hot, you know, the arguments just were fierce, but it was just—it was a debate. So it seems now that this framework is in great danger. Now it's time to get together to fight for these constitutional values. That's something that made America America. And recognizing that Trump's actions, though they look very spontaneous and sporadic, they are aimed at this very system. To make sure that the balance that has been working for two and a half centuries—the balance between the executive, legislation, and judiciary—this balance will be tilted forever in favor of the executive. And not just executive as an office, but just executive as one person. Again, here is Trump, very consistent, demanding that the president has all powers and anything that stands in his way, even if it's guaranteed by Constitution, should be removed—because it prevents him from executing his mandate. Which is, again: It's a funny trick, because at the end of the day, Trump acquired his powers going through the system that created this mandate. And now—trying to use this mandate acquired within the system—he's trying to destroy the system and to make sure that he and his cronies, his successors, could rule the country without any restrictions that have been provided by this very constitutional framework that made him win in the first place.

Applebaum: So the values are separation of powers, really, and the rule of law?

Kasparov: Absolutely. This is the rule of law, separation of powers, and recognizing that there's always a balance that keeps very complicated American system, Republican system—Republicans will all, of course—to function and to be so successful. Because there are always forces and counterforces. So whether it's the federal level, state level, whether it's judiciary, legislation, so it's the, [any attempt to spread unanimity. So that's what is a real existential threat to American republic. Just, yeah. Quite ironic—it's next year, will be the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

And if you just read through the Declaration of Independence, almost every claim there—all the grievances of the colonies, again, King George and British monarchy—have been simply resurrected in Trump's behavior.

Applebaum: It is funny, actually: I reread the Declaration of Independence, too, recently, and there's even something about tariffs. There's something about sending people abroad to be imprisoned.

Kasparov: Absolutely. It's so many elements of the Declaration of Independence, and of course the Constitution. So, I think by fighting such a powerful enemy—because again, we know that, again, Trump is not accidental. And that's one of the ideas of the second season, is to talk to different people. From different fields—Americans and Europeans—and to give our audience an idea, somehow, why Trump was inevitable. I mean, what's happened? What are the events that helped Trump to become almost invincible in American politics?

And what are the other trends in global politics, in geopolitics, that made this overall climate so friendly not just to Trump, but to many other would-be autocrats, right-wing populists, across other democracies? Yeah; it's very important to see this big picture. Because to fight Trump is not, you know, just simply to go, Trump is bad. It's very important to show why it's bad.

Applebaum: You know, it's interesting. In the first season of this podcast, one of our episodes was about American alliances. And it's actually one of my arguments that I've been making for a long time—that American democracy has also succeeded in the past because of who America's allies were. That it was very important, not just for our foreign policy, that we were very close to the European democracies or the Asian democracies. That that also reinforced our domestic politics. In other words, you know, that it matters who your country's friends are. And so, I suppose, maybe one of the things you'll explore is: Does it matter if America's friends are the German far right and the Romanian far right and autocracies in the Middle East?

Kasparov: Yes. But it's like chicken and egg. So it's whether these alliances embolden Trump or, you know, that America's change from within help Trump to build these alliances. So think it will be wrong to actually oppose Trump without understanding all these underlying currents—you know, all the factors that made Trump and Trump's phenomena, both domestically and internationally, such a powerful threat. Not just to American democracy, but to democracy worldwide.

And of course, Putin, as we know, he's very happy to support whoever. So he's happy with Marine le Pen in France, but he's also happy with [Jean-Luc] Mélenchon, who's far left. Of course, AfD for Germany [the far-right party Alternative for Germany] is his biggest bet in German politics. But, Russia was not shy of supporting Die Linke and the new newly built [Bündnis] Sahra Wagenknecht. Also, far-left groups. So, for me, it indicates the collapse of the traditional left-right balance that has been, you know, in place for probably nearly a century. And I will talk about it throughout the new series. But: Do you think, Anne, it's a legitimate, you know, issue, just to recognize why this right, left—or center, right-center, left—equilibrium that served us for so long is no longer, you know, protecting us against the rise of authoritarianism?

Applebaum: Yeah. No, I think it's indicative of something even bigger—which is that politics, which for such a long time was about policy. In other words, what was the, what were the center left and the center right fighting about? They were fighting about the size of the state and whether taxes should be high or low, and whether we should have state health care or private health care. And those were the subjects of politics and the subjects of political debate. And what's happened over the last decade—partly thanks to the change in the nature of online information, partly thanks to the way that social media has reordered our conversation and made it more emotional and angry and divisive—those things aren't central to politics anymore. And instead, politics is about these very existential issues. Cultural ideas, national identity, other kinds of identity. Issues where there's much less area for compromise, and where there's much less that the different various parties can do together. I mean, so if you have an argument about taxes, you can find a compromise between the center left and the center right. If your argument is Who are Americans? And should people of only one skin color get to be Americans? And, if people come from another country, and they don't come through the border in the right way, they should be expelled, or not expelled? I mean, those are much more existential issues, and there's very little area of compromise. You also have the rise of political movements that challenge the system itself. And this is, of course, something that I think happened over the last four years, after January the 6th. Really, all of the extremists in America—and this happened in other countries, too, for different reasons—gathered around Trump. So, people who believed that there shouldn't be democracy in America, there should be a kind of CEO who runs politics—that was a kind of tech-authoritarian idea. People who believe that America shouldn't be a secular state; it should be a religious state. That's the Christian-nationalist idea.

And a series of people who were on the extremes of politics were drawn to him. And drawn into really the center of political life. And they have now redefined political debate. And, as I said, political debate is not anymore about practical policies that people can understand. Instead, it's about these central, you know: Should Harvard exist? Or Do we want science? And it changed the nature of debate altogether. And of course, one of the things that has been very slow to happen is that the center—meaning the center left and the center right—failed for a long time to understand that the rules of debate had changed. So they went on squabbling with one another. You can actually see it right now in Germany, in the German coalition, which is the center-right/center-left coalition. They went on squabbling about the things that divided them, failing to see that there was a threat from people who wanted to change the nature of the system altogether. So what we really have now is a pretty existential argument between liberal democracy, small-l liberal, small-d democracy, and an authoritarian system run by an executive who is not controlled by the rule of law. That's actually the real debate we have right now. But, it's taken a long time for the rest of the political world to understand that and catch up with it, and to understand that in order to defeat the appeal of the autocratic world, we need different kinds of coalitions.

Kasparov: But that also includes international coalitions. Because, you know, we use the word existential regularly, but the most existential battle between the force of tyranny and freedom now is happening in Ukraine. Literally the battlefield where the force of autocracy—Autocracy Inc., led by Putin's dictatorship—launched the most blatant invasion of the country. And it's much bigger than just an attempt to redraw the borders. It's a challenge, open challenge, to the existing world order—probably, it's no longer existing; it's collapsing. The liberal world order that we used to live in for decades. And the outcome of this battle, the outcome of this existential, mortal combat, will probably, most likely, will decide the future of humanity and future of freedom worldwide for decades to come. And, it's not surprising that the war in Ukraine also divides political forces here. And it's not, it's no longer, right and left. You can find people on both sides defending Ukraine. And unfortunately, you can find people on both sides—mostly, of course, on the right now—who are trying to undermine the Ukrainian heroic struggle for freedom and sovereignty. And to argue that it's no longer our business to be involved.

Applebaum: Yeah; I mean, what you've just described, it's one of the arguments of my book Autocracy, Inc. Which is that while we've been failing to understand the importance of these new coalitions, the autocratic world has understood it. And you now have a de facto coalition or network that's been created by Russia, by China, by theocratic Iran, by Bolivarian-socialist Venezuela. By countries actually with very different systems—some of them are one-party states, some of them are one-man dictatorships—but who've understood that it's very important for them to work together to undermine the idea of democracy. One of Putin's great realizations was that it wasn't enough to undermine the democrats he was fighting at home, and it wasn't enough to poison the political debate inside Russia with lies and alternative reality. That he had to spread that farther—that really he needed to destroy the appeal of democracy everywhere. And part of the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine was to show that there's no sense or purpose to lead to having a democratic revolution of the kind that took place in Ukraine. That democracies are doomed to failure, and that they can be defeated by a much more brutal, a much angrier, form of autocratic power.

Kasparov: Yeah, absolutely. So that's why I will do my best, throughout episodes of this second season to show this connection. You have Ukraine; you have the collapse of the traditional center-right/center-left coalition. Also the rise of AI and how AI has been playing a role in this fake-news industry and with new attempts of the tech bros to take control of the political system and electoral process. So it's looking at the big picture and hearing the voices from the Baltics to the United States. So: people that are experts, who have great experience in their field, to go to the roots of this global Trump phenomena. And find, you know, just throughout this conversation, find the best way for us to get together and win the battle.

[Music]

Kasparov: And that means voices from all over the political spectrum, people who disagree about many things but have in common the desire to protect democracy. Because, again: It is an existential threat. Which requires just this total mobilization of our forces if we want to preserve what was given to us 250 years ago.

Applebaum: So it sounds to me like this show is in very capable hands, which I'm delighted to hear. Tell me, what's the first conversation?

Kasparov: It seems that the best one to begin with, to set the table for us about an American electorate gone amok with both apathy and partisanship. And we'll talk with an excellent pollster and someone I know for many years: Frank Luntz.

Frank Luntz: All the institutions that keep America moving forward are disliked and distrusted.

Kasparov: Okay. This is, it's very, very important, because you said a few times the word, the key word, in my opinion: trust.

Luntz: Yes. That is—by the way, let's stop there. That is the key word. It's the No. 1 priority that Americans have: trust and truth.

Applebaum: Well, thank you, Garry. I'm looking forward to hearing the second season of Autocracy in America.

Kasparov: Anne, I hope you will not be disappointed. Thank you. (Laughs.)

Fertility policy has a big missing piece.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Donald Trump—who is, by his own accounting, “the fertilization president” and “the father of IVF”—wants to help Americans reproduce. During his 2024 campaign, he promised that the government or insurance companies would cover the cost of in vitro fertilization. In February, he issued an executive order promising a plan to expand access to the procedure and reduce its steep cost. (The administration has yet to release this plan, but the White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me that the president's advisers have completed their recommendations.)

In its broader push to boost the U.S. birth rate, the Trump administration has increased the child tax credit, implemented a new $1,000 baby bonus, and, according to reporting by The New York Times, floated affirmative action for parents who apply to Fulbright scholarships. But Trump's push to expand IVF exposes a fault line in modern conservatism's approach to fertility treatments in particular: Some pronatalists view the procedure and other fertility technologies as essential tools to reverse declining birth rates, but others, including many anti-abortion activists, are pressing for legal protections for the embryos that might be discarded or damaged during IVF. The latter group has instead coalesced around alternative fertility treatments, which it claims will boost birth rates while prompting a broader reexamination of the U.S. fertility industry.

This debate poses an obstacle to any easy policy wins for the Trump administration on IVF. But the conversation also routinely overlooks a major part of the fertility equation: men. If the Trump administration is serious about boosting fertility without alienating either its pro- or anti-IVF constituents, expanding access to infertility treatments specifically for men could offer a meaningful—and perhaps politically viable—path forward.

For decades, reproductive care in the United States has been considered a women's issue. Among heterosexual couples struggling to conceive, infertility is roughly as likely to stem from male factors as from female ones. Yet in up to 25 percent of infertility cases, the male partner is never evaluated. Male infertility can sometimes be treated with hormone therapy or surgical correction of physical blockages. But male-infertility care is less likely to be included in state insurance laws than female treatments such as IVF. Plus, in most cases, “you can bypass male-infertility problems by just treating the woman more aggressively, even if she doesn't have fertility issues herself,” Peter Schlegel, a urologist and male-infertility specialist who runs New York Men's Health Medical, told me. According to CDC data, approximately one in six IVF cycles is initiated solely due to male infertility.

That means women disproportionately bear the medical and emotional demands of fertility treatment. IVF typically requires women to undergo daily hormone injections and invasive procedures. Hormone treatments can cause nausea, mood swings, bloating, and bruising at the injection site. Egg retrieval typically involves anesthesia, at least 24 hours of rest after, and days of recovery for lingering symptoms. Most people who use IVF need multiple cycles to conceive, and recent research has raised concerns about possible long-term health consequences from repeated treatments, including elevated cancer risks.

It's no wonder, then, that patients and policy makers have been looking for alternatives to IVF. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank that opposes abortion and has described the American IVF industry as the “Wild West,” has called for the U.S. government to embrace restorative reproductive medicine, or RRM. This model, which originated in the 1970s as a natural family-planning method, focuses on identifying and treating what proponents call the “root causes” of infertility, including hormonal imbalances and diseases such as endometriosis; IVF is a last resort. Some vocal RRM proponents reject the procedure outright, arguing that it treats embryos as commodities and women as vessels, subjecting them to expensive, dehumanizing procedures.

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which opposes restrictions on both IVF and abortion, has dismissed RRM as a “rebranding of standard medical practice” designed to stop short of the full range of modern pregnancy care. “Instead of getting 21st-century treatment based on a Nobel Prize–winning technology, anti-abortion groups like the Heritage Foundation want patients to have medicine circa 1977,” Sean Tipton, ASRM's chief advocacy and policy officer, told me. RRM supporters, in turn, argue that they're simply making room for less invasive and lower-cost options. (A single cycle of IVF currently costs $15,000 to $20,000, and treatments are usually paid out of pocket.) “IVF is high-tech. What we do is more humdrum,” says Phil Boyle, the president of the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine and a contributor to the Heritage Foundation's recent report on RRM. He also told me that RRM encourages careful evaluation of both partners, potentially reducing the burden of treatment on women.

Read: The pro-baby coalition of the far right

Even so, RRM often requires women to engage in meticulous cycle tracking and hormone monitoring, leaving them to shoulder the ongoing work of managing and measuring their biology in service of pregnancy. This emphasis on women's bodies and behaviors is especially conspicuous amid a broader cultural preoccupation with male virility. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has warned of the “existential problem” posed by declining testosterone levels and sperm counts in teenage boys. (He has offered dubious comparisons in the process, claiming that adolescent boys now have less testosterone than 68-year-old men.) Online, male-health influencers blame falling fertility on pesticides and plant-based diets, and advise their followers to eat more meat and avoid processed foods.

And yet, for all the public hand-wringing over male infertility, medical treatments for it remain absent from policy conversations. In the months since the White House issued its executive order on IVF access, it does not appear to have made any mention of improving access to male-infertility care. (When I asked Desai last month about male-fertility proposals, he declined to answer the question.) The Heritage Foundation has vigorously advocated for RRM, yet its policy papers and lobbying efforts do not prioritize male-specific treatments, including semen analysis, hormone testing, and surgeries that can correct some forms of severe male infertility. Its RRM report does make passing mention of interventions for men, such as improving diet and managing insulin resistance, but its recommendations are overwhelmingly directed at women. Fertility-related proposals from both sides of the aisle have likewise scarcely addressed male-specific infertility treatments, according to data from RESOLVE, a nonprofit advocacy organization that supports awareness of the full spectrum of infertility-treatment options.

Policy changes to improve male fertility are both feasible and potentially far-reaching. Access to reproductive urologists is deeply uneven across the U.S., which contributes to the chronic underdiagnosis of male-factor infertility. One 2010 study found that 13 states had no specialists for male infertility at all. To help close this gap, federal agencies could fund additional fellowship positions or loan-repayment programs for male-fertility specialists who commit to working in medically underserved areas. States could also revise telemedicine laws, which sometimes bar out-of-state providers from treating patients remotely. Lawmakers could mandate that insurance companies cover key services and invest in labs that are developing and testing new therapies, such as stem-cell-based sperm regeneration.

Read: A less brutal alternative to IVF

For the foreseeable future, IVF will remain irreplaceable for some families, including single parents, heterosexual couples whose future children are at high risk of genetic anomalies, and LGBTQ couples pursuing reciprocal IVF, in which one parent provides the egg and another carries the pregnancy. But advocates across the IVF debate agree that patients need more options, and right now, many don't have them. Supporters and critics of IVF, including ASRM and the Heritage Foundation, told me they support greater insurance coverage for male-infertility care.

If coverage expands for IVF but not for other fertility treatments, more patients will be routed toward it, even when less invasive or more targeted options might work just as well. A more forward-looking fertility policy would mean not just increasing IVF access but also expanding whose bodies—and whose health—should be the focus of U.S. reproductive care.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Argentina's unfinished reckoning shows how difficult it can be to recover from state terror.

In March 1985, I was likely one of the first American tourists to visit Argentina after a military junta relinquished power. Raúl Alfonsín, a human-rights lawyer, was leading the country's first democratically elected government since the early 1970s. And Nunca Más (“Never Again”), a government commission's report on its surprisingly rapid investigation into the fate of the desaparecidos, the people “disappeared” by the previous regime, was so popular that it was being hawked at Buenos Aires newsstands.

For the junta's opponents, it was a buoyant time, but the euphoria didn't last. The so-called Dirty War, a campaign of kidnapping, torture, rape, and murder that resulted in as many as 30,000 extrajudicial deaths, left lasting scars. Alfonsín was obliged to pursue a delicate political balancing act: He had commissioned the investigation and backed trials of the junta's leaders. But then, fearing another coup, he reversed course, supporting legislation that impeded further prosecutions.

That pattern of advance and retreat continued under successor regimes. Like Germany after the defeat of Hitler, Argentina lurched back and forth between judging its past crimes and trying to move beyond them. The ensuing decades saw amnesties, trials, protests, severe economic and political turmoil, and the conversion of former detention facilities and other sites into a memorial landscape. An Argentinian alliance of human-rights organizations dedicated to remembrance and justice calls itself Memoria Abierta (“Open Memory”), suggesting a task that remains perpetually unfinished.

In her deeply reported new book, A Flower Traveled in My Blood, Haley Cohen Gilliland both encapsulates that complicated dynamic and explains its broader relevance. “Around the world,” she writes, “in countries attempting to wrestle with histories of violence and trauma, the same questions tend to recur. How should peace be balanced with justice? Is it better, for the health of a society, to pardon or punish the perpetrators?” Caught “between the drive to forget and the obligation to remember,” Argentina is “a case study in the classic frictions that afflict such processes of reckoning.”

In Argentina, this reckoning means more than insisting on justice and commemorating (and identifying) the dead. It involves the persistent challenge of recovering and reuniting the living. Since 1977, near the brutal peak of the junta's 1976–83 rule, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have marched on Thursday afternoons in front of the Casa Rosada, Argentina's seat of government, to demand an accounting for their disappeared children. Despite the danger—some of these mothers, too, were murdered by the junta—they were soon joined by another group: Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, intent on the return of grandchildren, including those born to mothers in detention and illegally adopted. With persistence, investigative ingenuity, and cutting-edge genetic tools, the grandmothers have so far tracked down 140 of those missing children.

Read: My sister was disappeared 43 years ago

Gilliland focuses on the ordeal of a single shattered family, widens her lens to include other cases, and embeds her tale in a crisp account of recent Argentinian history. Formerly the Argentina and Uruguay correspondent for The Economist and now the director of the Yale Journalism Initiative, Gilliland has long harbored an interest in the grandmothers' quest. Preoccupied with other work, she waited, she concedes, until almost the last possible moment to tackle the subject. Many potential sources are now dead, and one of Gilliland's key informants, Rosa Roisinblit, was 102 when Gilliland finally managed to interview her. Fortunately, the author also benefited from the cooperation of Roisinblit's grandson, Guillermo, who had been illegally adopted, and the University of Washington geneticist Mary-Claire King, whose research helped reunite Guillermo, however uneasily, with his biological family.

Gilliland borrows her title from a line in a poem, “Epitaph,” by Juan Gelman, a celebrated Argentine writer whose personal history makes her use of it particularly apropos. The poem was written before Gelman's own son and pregnant daughter-in-law were kidnapped in the Dirty War. They were killed, and his newborn granddaughter was stolen and later found with an adoptive family in Uruguay. The titular flower does metaphorical double duty in Gilliland's story. It represents both the grandmothers' yearning for their kin and the genetic markers that proved consanguinity.

A Flower Traveled in My Blood begins in 1978 with an account of the kidnappings of José Manuel Pérez Rojo and his pregnant partner, Patricia, who was Rosa Roisinblit's daughter. The federal police also took the couple's 15-month-old daughter, Mariana, but left her with relatives. Both José and Patricia had been Montoneros, left-wing guerrillas, but had largely retreated from activism. It didn't matter. The junta swooped down on militants, dissidents, and innocents alike, conveying them in green Ford Falcons to secret sites without formal charges. Some detainees were eventually released; some were murdered in prison; still others were drugged and flung from planes into the Río de la Plata or the South Atlantic Ocean.

Apart from those directly affected, civil society was slow to mobilize. Rosa, desperate to locate both her missing daughter and the grandson (Guillermo) who she knew had been born in captivity, appealed, with little success, to the federal justice system and Jewish organizations. She finally found solidarity with her fellow grandmothers. They met surreptitiously, but also marched, petitioned, and eventually attracted international attention.

Science proved to be an indispensable ally. King, the geneticist, experimented with different methods of establishing grandpaternity before settling on mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down almost intact through the maternal line. A genetic match can be made with a single maternal relative, and the forensic technique has since been adopted in missing-persons and human-rights cases worldwide.

In Argentina, the process of reconnecting families could be both emotionally and legally fraught. Not every lost child was happy to be found; custody battles could be wrenching. And the same evidence that linked children to biological relatives could spur a criminal case against their adoptive parents, some of whom had ties to the military and its illicit actions.

Gilliland uses Guillermo's case to illustrate these complications. Guillermo's adoptive father, Francisco Gómez, was an employee of the air force. He knew details of José's torture and Patricia's detention, but claimed that the baby boy he adopted had been abandoned. He was also violently abusive toward his wife, according to Guillermo. “His beatings were so savage they sometimes sent Jofré to the hospital,” Gilliland writes. After they divorced, he mostly neglected his son.

As often happened, Guillermo's whereabouts were revealed to the grandmothers' organization by an anonymous tipster. When Guillermo's sister, Mariana, tracked him down, Guillermo was skeptical but agreed to a DNA test, which confirmed their connection. His initial contacts with Mariana and his two grandmothers, Rosa and Argentina, were warm. But when his adoptive father was arrested and charged with kidnapping and falsification of official documents, Guillermo was furious. (Gómez was convicted and served more than six years on those charges. He was later sentenced to another 12 years for his role in the disappearance of Guillermo's parents.) Guillermo worried, justifiably, that the next step was the prosecution of his adoptive mother, “the one person by whom he felt unconditionally loved.” He felt betrayed by Mariana and his grandmothers. “His past life might have been one giant, festering lie,” Gilliland writes. “But his new reality was worse.”

Guillermo's relationship with Mariana grew particularly strained. They fought over the division of government reparations for their slain parents, their grandmother Argentina's medical treatment, and the disposition of her ashes after her death. But over time, Guillermo embraced both Rosa and her larger cause. (Mariana declined to speak with Gilliland.)

The author clearly admires the grandmothers' tenacity, but she raises questions about the costs of their mission and the methods involved—in particular, the practice of aggressive, sometimes nonconsensual collection of DNA evidence. “To whom does identity belong?” Gilliland asks. “Is it the sole property of an individual—or does their family and their society also have a right to truth?”

Germany took decades to come to terms with its responsibility for the Holocaust. Since the 1980s, I have reported on those efforts: the competing narratives at concentration-camp memorials, the tangled history of the Jewish Museum Berlin, the development of a complex landscape of memory. And in 2019, I finally returned to Buenos Aires to assess Argentina's reckoning, which had begun with so much promise. The work of memorialization seemed vibrant, but still incomplete. No single museum offered a definitive narrative of the junta, the desaparecidos, and the quest for justice. Memory remained fractured, the history unsettled. Even the number of desaparecidos was still vigorously contested.

The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and their supporters continued to march weekly. In 1986, the organization had splintered into two factions. The “founding line” wanted exhumations, reparations, prosecutions—closure for past injustices. The other faction was more focused on radical social change. What struck me most during my visit was a difference in affect. The founding line walked somberly, holding photographs and drawings of missing relatives, while the more radical marchers sang and clapped boisterously. Tourists crowded in with cameras, and the mothers sold handcrafted souvenirs.

At La Recoleta, the elegant cemetery whose “rhetoric of shade and marble” Jorge Luis Borges had famously elegized, I stopped to grieve at Alfonsín's tomb. The Parque de la Memoria (“Remembrance Park”) was similarly poignant: a large, silent space with a zigzagging granite memorial to the desaparecidos and other murder victims, and an array of sculptures on the banks of the Río de La Plata. Claudia Fontes's stainless-steel Reconstruction of the Portrait of Pablo Míguez, representing a kidnapped child, seemed to rise from the river itself and stare across its expansive waters, as though searching for the corpses below.

Former black sites had become memorials as well. The most notorious, the Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada, had been converted into the ESMA Museum and Site of Memory. I took a guided tour, saw the basement where detainees had been tortured, watched the video testimony of survivors, and learned, at the House for Identity, of the grandmothers' genetic-matching project.

Here in the U.S., some commentators have compared the current Trump administration's expansion of executive authority to the early days of the Third Reich, with its blitzkrieg consolidation of power over the German political system, economy, and culture. But the federal government's turn to sudden, legally questionable seizures of the undocumented, visa and green-card holders, and even some American citizens, often by unidentified masked men, more closely evokes the abuses of South American military dictatorships in Argentina, Chile, and elsewhere.

Whatever the specific parallels, the problem of how to recover from such assaults on the law and the polity remains vexing. The trauma always outlasts the injury. Gilliland points to Argentina as a pioneering model for its quick initial response and groundbreaking forensics. But it is also a cautionary tale about the slippery route to healing. She notes that the country's current right-wing populist leader, Javier Milei, is something of an apologist for the junta's bloody rule. The seesawing continues.

Argentina's lessons for the current moment are multiple: When tyrants threaten, more people and institutions may cower than resist; the loss of checks on state violence can be catastrophic; and no one knows who the next victim will be. This much is clear: Recovering from the damage will be even messier and more difficult than preventing it in the first place.

Is the nominee for New York City mayor “African American”? Wrong question.

On her 64th birthday, in 2012, the conceptual artist Adrian Piper “retired from being black.” She posted a digitally altered portrait of herself, rendered in gray scale, and included a message underneath: “Henceforth, my new racial designation will be neither black nor white but rather 6.25% grey, honoring my 1/16th African heritage,” Piper wrote on her website. “Please join me in celebrating this exciting new adventure in pointless administrative precision and futile institutional control!”

Piper's gesture highlights the problem with the color categories that many Americans are asked to box themselves into, an exercise that frequently relies on arbitrary notions, or selective readings, of long and complicated ancestry. She was calling attention to the fact that such reductive concepts as “black” and “white”—designations that imply varying degrees of privilege or oppression and help determine access to opportunity and recognition—govern our institutions and, to no small extent, our lives.

I thought of Piper last week when The New York Times revealed that Zohran Mamdani, the surprise winner of New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, had identified himself as “Black/African American” and “Asian” on an unsuccessful application to Columbia University in 2009. In justifying his choice, Mamdani unwittingly revealed the absurdity of affirmative action and the racial categorizing it requires.

Michael Powell: The magic realism of Zohran Mamdani

“Most college applications don't have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background,” Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to ethnically Indian parents, said in response to the report. “Even though these boxes are constraining,” Mamdani continued, “I wanted my college application to reflect who I was.” He told the Times that he specified “Ugandan” elsewhere on the form, and that he considered himself “an American who was born in Africa,” not Black or African American.

For Mamdani—who moved to New York at age 7 and did not become a U.S. citizen until 2018—to have indicated that he is “African American” is no less ridiculous than South African–born Elon Musk calling himself the same. Musk doesn't claim that title, but many of his right-wing supporters sarcastically attribute it to him. These trolls seem to relish violating the definition that most of America intuitively ascribes to African American. But evidently they at least understand that, in common parlance, it means “Black.” Whether the same could be said for Mamdani is less clear.

Mamdani's critics have accused him of cynically manipulating affirmative action, a system that persists in higher education and beyond, despite a 2023 Supreme Court ruling banning it from college admissions. If they're right, he would hardly be the first to do so. Affirmative action encourages, even demands, opportunistic racial accounting, especially when social norms dictate that another person's self-identification shouldn't be called into question—a view that many of Mamdani's defenders have articulated in recent days.

Ultimately, it shouldn't matter whether Mamdani is “African,” “Asian,” or even “Caucasian,” as some Indians have historically argued they are. Indeed, affirmative action was instituted precisely so that employers would not base their decisions on those categories. The term entered the American lexicon in 1961, when President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order calling for “affirmative action to ensure that applicants”—government contractors, in this case—“are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.” As the writer Thomas Sowell has noted, the system's purpose was “to make sure that those who had been discriminated against in the past would no longer be discriminated against in the future.”

Affirmative action was not originally concerned, as it is now, with the promotion of nebulous interpretations of “diversity” and “representation.” It was meant to redress discrimination, particularly the state-sanctioned exclusion from opportunity that specific communities of Americans and their descendants once faced, such as the descendants of African slaves in the United States.

Mamdani, though, faced no such lack of opportunity. His father is a tenured Columbia professor, and his mother is an Oscar-nominated film director. His upbringing was, by any measure, “privileged,” to use his own description. Setting aside the ontologically dubious notion that Mamdani is “Black/African American,” I would contend that these social facts alone should disqualify him from special consideration on a college application.

Affirmative action, even with regard to Black Americans, was intended only as a temporary solution to oppression. The time has long since passed when the well-to-do of any nation or ethnicity should be afforded a leg up in college admissions. The only defensible continuation of the practice, as I have argued, is to extend it to the poor and disadvantaged of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Thomas Chatterton Williams: Trump is right about affirmative action

Race-based preferences are too easy to game, through some unfalsifiable alchemy of self-definition and often-vicarious experience of struggle. They sow resentment and division not only among Asian and white people who reject the use of double standards, but also among many descendants of American slaves who cannot see the logic of policies that treat anyone with a connection to Africa as fundamentally interchangeable.

“Race is a social construct,” Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in 2023, articulating a view that has only recently been taken for granted by the American mainstream, though it is coming into question in some of the more sinister corners of the political right. “Whereas universities today would group all white applicants together, white elites previously sought to exclude Jews and other white immigrant groups from higher education,” he continued. “Yet, university admissions policies ask individuals to identify themselves as belonging to one of only a few reductionist racial groups … Whichever choice he makes (in the event he chooses to report a race at all), the form silos him into an artificial category. Worse, it sends a clear signal that the category matters.”

The real scandal of Mamdani's application has to do not with his self-presentation but with the arbitrary and insidious racial boundaries that America's academic, cultural, and political institutions continue to squeeze people into. If Mamdani's justification is sincere, he and Thomas are effectively in agreement: All of these boxes are worthless. It is past time we stop filling them in.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Households will pay an average of $2,400 more for goods this year, thanks to Trump's policies.

You might have forgotten about the trade war, but the trade war has not forgotten about you.

This week, Donald Trump reignited the global financial conflict he started in January, sending letters threatening new tariff rates to nearly two dozen countries. Starting in August, American importers will pay a 25 percent tax on goods from South Korea and Japan, a 35 percent tax on goods from Canada and Bangladesh, and a 50 percent tax on goods from Brazil unless those countries agree to bilateral deals. Additionally, Trump warned he would slap tariffs on goods from any country “aligned” with the “Anti-American policies” of China, India, and other industrial powerhouses—no further details given—and put a 50 percent levy on imported copper, used to build homes, electronics, and utility systems.

The summer tariff announcement was characteristic of all the White House's tariff announcements this year: draconian, nonsensical, and hard to take seriously. In his first weeks in office, Trump trashed the North American trade agreement that he had negotiated during his first term before exempting most goods coming from Canada and Mexico from border taxes. In April, the White House put high levies on goods from scores of American trading partners, only to announce a three-month “pause” on those levies shortly after. During the 90-day pause, American negotiators would craft 90 new trade deals, the White House promised.

This time, Trump did not make a formal trade announcement, opting instead to send error-laden form letters to foreign capitals (one addressed the female leader of Bosnia and Herzegovina as “Mr. President”). In a Cabinet meeting, he argued that “a letter means a deal,” adding that “we can't meet with 200 countries. We have a few trusted people that know what they're doing, that are doing a good job, but you can't—you have to do it in a more general way, but it's a very good way, it's a better way. It's a more powerful way.” (Even if a letter was a deal, which it isn't, the Trump administration is more than 60 letters short of 90.)

The stock market shrugged at the letters; investors are now used to the president saying something nuts and then doing nothing. Traders have figured out how to make money from the short-lived dips that Trump periodically causes, calling it the “TACO trade,” for “Trump always chickens out.” But Trump is not doing nothing. Businesses are struggling to negotiate the uncertainty created by the White House. Trump's tariffs are forcing up consumer costs and damaging firms. And the latest renewal of the trade war will make the economy worse.

Small businesses and companies reliant on imported goods from high-rate countries are struggling the most. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Jonathan Silva, the chief executive officer of WS Game Company. On our Zoom call, he sat in front of a howitzer-size, rainbow-colored Nerf gun, sporting a five-o'clock shadow and emanating a heavy-lidded weltschmerz. His 22-person business produces upscale versions of classic Hasbro board games: a pastel, tempered-glass Monopoly board; a turquoise-and-white Scrabble set reminiscent of Portuguese azulejo tile work; and a three-dimensional wooden Clue game that looks like a billiards table. The idea is to make board games “part of your lifestyle,” he told me, instead of stuffing them “in a cardboard box with tattered corners, falling apart at the top of your coat closet.”

The company produces its games in China, meaning that the fee it pays to import its goods has changed several times in the past six months, going as high as 145 percent. The time around Trump's April “Liberation Day” tariffs was the “worst 45-plus days of our company's history,” Silva told me. His company put in place a spending freeze: halting bonuses, barring new hires, and cutting all unnecessary business expenses. “The main goal was to keep every employee that we have employed,” Silva told me. Then the company raised prices. “We tried to sell whatever we had domestically in our warehouses to free up cash and give us as long of a runway as possible,” he said. Even so, the company lost $16 million in purchase commitments from its sticker-shocked retailers.

The disruption from the spring will affect the rest of the business's year, and, in particular, its crucial holiday-sales season, Silva told me. “It's about 150 days from when I place an order to when it might hit the shelves,” he explained. “When the supply chain gets put on pause for four to six weeks, getting back on schedule takes a year.” That happened in a more extreme fashion during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

This year, “the shelves might be filled with products for the holiday, but they might not be filled with the products that the retailers really want to put on the shelf,” Silva said. “The consumer might not notice, but the businesses do.”

Businesses thus far have sheltered American consumers from tariffs by eating some of the cost themselves and relying on stockpiled goods. As a result, inflation has remained subdued and economic growth strong enough through the first half of the year. But firms can keep only so much stock in warehouses. Analysts at BNP Paribas, a banking group, estimate that inventories will “clear” by the end of the summer, and prices will rise in turn. Right now, American consumers are facing an 18 percent effective tariff rate, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab estimates. Households will pay an average of $2,400 more for goods this calendar year, thanks to Trump's policies.

Thousands of businesses are again negotiating extremely high and haphazardly implemented rates on goods from any number of crucial trading partners. South Korea sends billions of dollars of heavy machinery to the United States each year. Bangladesh ships billions of dollars of clothing. (Clothes and shoes will see the biggest price increases because of the trade war, the Yale analysts found; prices on these goods are expected to rise roughly 40 percent.) Canada is the United States's second-largest trading partner, an important source of farm equipment, auto parts, minerals, and crops. And companies will have to negotiate whether to work in the cost of the new tariffs or to make their own TACO trades, assuming that the Trump administration will fold and cut rates again.

History suggests that this is exactly what Trump will do, especially if the market tanks. But who knows? This week, a reporter asked the president whether new tariff rates would take effect on July 9, the end of the 90-day pause, or on August 1, the date indicated in the letters.

“What are you talking about?” Trump asked.

The tariff rates, the reporter said.

The president provided some clarification: “They're going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Musk trained Grok to be right-wing. We're lucky he wasn't more subtle.

From the beginning, Elon Musk has marketed Grok, the chatbot integrated into X, as the unwoke AI that would give it to you straight, unlike the competitors. 

But on X over the last year, Musk's supporters have repeatedly complained of a problem: Grok is still left-leaning. Ask it if transgender women are women, and it will affirm that they are; ask if climate change is real, and it will affirm that, too. Do immigrants to the US commit a lot of crime? No, says Grok. Should we have universal health care? Yes. Should abortion be legal? Yes. Is Donald Trump a good president? No. (I ran all of these tests on Grok 3 with memory and personalization settings turned off.)

It doesn't always take the progressive stance on political questions: It says the minimum wage doesn't help people, that welfare benefits in the US are too high, and that Bernie Sanders wouldn't have been a good president, either. But on the whole, on the controversial questions of America today, Grok lands on the center-left — not too far, in fact, from every other AI model, from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Chinese-made DeepSeek. (Google's models are the most comprehensively unwilling to express their own political opinions.)

The fact that these political views tend to show up across the board — and that they're even present in a Chinese-trained model — suggests to me that these opinions are not added by the creators. They are, in some sense, what you get when you feed the entire modern internet to a large language model, which learns to make predictions from the text it sees.

This is a fascinating topic in its own right — but we are talking about it this week because xAI, the creator of Grok, has at last produced a counterexample: an AI that's not just right-wing but also, well, a horrible far-right racist. This week, after personality updates that Musk said were meant to solve Grok's center-left political bias, users noticed that the AI was now really, really antisemitic and had begun calling itself MechaHitler. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.



It claimed to just be “noticing patterns” — patterns like, Grok claimed, that Jewish people were more likely to be radical leftists who want to destroy America. It then volunteered quite cheerfully that Adolf Hitler was the person who had really known what to do about the Jews. 

xAI has since said it's “actively working to remove the inappropriate posts” and taken that iteration of Grok offline. “Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X,” the company posted. “xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.”

The big picture is this: X tried to alter their AI's political views to better appeal to their right-wing user base. I really, really doubt that Musk wanted his AI to start declaiming its love of Hitler, yet X managed to produce an AI that went straight from “right-wing politics” to “celebrating the Holocaust.” Getting a language model to do what you want is complicated. 

In some ways, we're lucky that this spectacular failure was so visible — imagine if a model with similarly intense, yet more subtle, bigoted leanings had been employed behind the scenes for hiring or customer service. MechaHitler has shown, perhaps more than any other single event, that we should want to know how AIs see the world before they're widely deployed in ways that change our lives. 

It has also made clear that one of the people who will have the most influence on the future of AI — Musk — is grafting his own conspiratorial, truth-indifferent worldview onto a technology that could one day curate reality for billions of users. 

Why would trying to make an AI that's right-wing make one that worships Hitler? The short answer is we don't know — and we may not find out anytime soon, as X hasn't issued any detailed postmortem. 

Some people have speculated that MechaHitler's new personality was a product of a tiny change made to Grok's system prompt, which are the instructions that every instance of an AI reads, telling it how to behave. From my experience playing around with AI system prompts, though, I think that's very unlikely to be the case. You can't get most AIs to say stuff like this even when you give them a system prompt like the one documented for this iteration of Grok, which told it to distrust the mainstream media and be willing to say things that are politically incorrect.

Beyond just the system prompt, Grok was probably “fine-tuned” — meaning given additional reinforcement learning on political topics — to try to elicit specific behaviors. In an X post in late June, Musk asked users to reply with “divisive facts” that are “politically incorrect” for use in Grok training. “The Jews are the enemy of all mankind,” one account replied.

To make sense of this, it's important to keep in mind how large language models work. Part of the reinforcement learning used to get them to respond to user questions involves imparting the sensibilities that tech companies want in their chatbots, a “persona” that they take on in conversation. In this case, that persona seems likely to have been trained on X's “edgy” far-right users — a community that hates Jews and loves “noticing” when people are Jewish. 

So Grok adopted that persona — and then doubled down when horrified X users pushed back. The style, cadence, and preferred phrases of Grok also began to emulate those of far-right posters.

Although I am writing about this now, in part, as a window-into-how-AI-works story, actually seeing it unfold live on X was, in fact, fairly upsetting. Ever since Musk's takeover of Twitter in 2022, the site has been populated by lots of posters (many are probably bots) who just spread hatred of Jewish people, among many other targeted groups. Moderation on the site has plummeted, allowing hate speech to proliferate, and X's revamped verification system enables far-right accounts to boost their replies with blue checks.

That's been true of X for a long time — but watching Grok join the ranks of the site's antisemites felt like something new and uncanny. Grok can write lots of responses very quickly: When I shared one of its anti-Jew posts, it jumped into my own replies and engaged with my own commenters. It was immediately made clear how much one AI can change and dominate worldwide conversation — and we should all be alarmed that the company working the hardest to push the frontier of AI engagement on social media is training its AI on X's most vile far-right content.

Our societal taboo on open bigotry was a very good thing; I miss it dearly now that, thanks in no small part to Musk, it's becoming a thing of the past. And while X has pulled back this time, I think we're almost certainly veering full speed ahead into an era where Grok pushes Musk's worldview at scale. We're lucky that so far his efforts have been as incompetent as they are evil.

“Mowing the grass” didn't stop October 7. Now it's going global.

During an Oval Office meeting on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he had nominated President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize and praised him for “forging peace, as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other.” Both US and Israeli officials have been quite open about their hopes that we are now looking at a transformed Middle East. Netanyahu has suggested that the US-Israeli strikes against Iran last month “opens an opportunity for a dramatic expansion of the peace agreements” that Israel has signed with other Arab countries over the years. 

But in fact, the weeks since the “12-Day War” ended have been marked by even more war. On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had conducted its first ground incursion in months into Lebanon. Israel had already been conducting nearly daily airstrikes targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, despite a 2024 truce that Israel claims the Iranian-backed proxy group has been violating by keeping armed fighters in southern Lebanon. The IDF has also carried out airstrikes against Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, responding to the group's ongoing missile and drone attacks against Israel. IDF troops remain in southern Syria and in recent days have carried out raids targeting Iran-backed groups there. 

Nor is the Israel-Iran conflict necessarily over. Defense Minister Israel Katz has put forward a plan involving “maintaining Israel's air superiority, preventing nuclear advancement and missile production, and responding to Iran for supporting terrorist activities against the State of Israel.” In other words, if Israel says there are malign and dangerous activities happening in Iran, there may be more airstrikes. 

Then, of course, there's the ongoing devastation of the war in Gaza, where the death toll has now exceeded 56,000 according to local authorities, and where locals as well as the UN accuse the IDF of killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians trying to reach food distribution centers in recent weeks. Five IDF troops were killed by roadside bombs planted by militants earlier this week. 

While there had been hopes that Israel's military success against Iran, a major backer of Hamas, could make a ceasefire more likely, the chances of an immediate deal with the militant group appear to be waning, despite pressure from Trump to ink one. Even if there were a ceasefire now, Israel appears very unlikely to withdraw its troops from Gaza entirely. 

The “new Middle East” that Netanyahu praised Trump for helping to bring about seems to be one in which Israel is continually fighting on multiple fronts simultaneously. 

Following Israel's six-week war in Gaza in 2014, known as “Operation Protective Edge,” the defense analysts Efraim Inbar and Eitan Shamir wrote an influential article describing how Israel could handle Hamas going forward. The IDF need not get embroiled in an Iraq War-style counterinsurgency campaign to eliminate the group entirely, or simply accommodate it. Instead, they wrote, “Against an implacable, well-entrenched, non-state enemy like the Hamas, Israel simply needs to ‘mow the grass' once in a while in order to degrade enemy capabilities.”

They continued: “A war of attrition against Hamas is probably Israel's fate for the long term. Keeping the enemy off balance and reducing its capabilities requires Israeli military readiness and a willingness to use force intermittingly.”

The fatalistic phrase “mowing the grass” caught on, and in the years that followed, Israel fought a number of limited engagements against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza. But limits of the strategy were made horrifically evident in the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, after which Israel shifted to a still-unfulfilled goal of eradicating Hamas outright. 

Now, however, Israel appears to be taking the “mowing the grass” approach region-wide, using periodic military action to degrade and disrupt its foes, including Iran itself. 

“There's been a major change in the level of risk that Israel is willing to take,” said Mairav Zonszein, an Israel-based analyst at the International Crisis Group. She described this new approach as “We don't trust the intentions of our adversaries, only our own capabilities.” And they're now much more willing to use those capabilities. 

Is this possibly sustainable? Can Israel really fight low-grade, episodic military conflicts in perpetuity, in as many as four different countries, even as the war on its borders continues? “A country of just 10m is not big enough to act as a permanent hegemon in the Middle East,” the Economist suggested, skeptically.

But it's also not hard to see why Israeli leaders think they can. Iran spent years building up a network of regional proxies and a missile program that could supposedly rain down destruction on Israel if it were ever attacked. Today, Hezbollah is a shell of its former self, Hamas is on the back foot, and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime has fallen. Of the more than 500 missiles Iran fired at Israel during the 12-day war, only around 40 got through, killing 28 people — not an insignificant number, but far fewer than many feared before the war began. 

Israel has shown it can infiltrate its enemies' defenses and decimate their ranks, all with only manageable military backlash. 

It's also clear that Israel's regional conflicts are different from the war in Gaza. Polls show Israelis are fatigued by that conflict, favor a deal to end the fighting and bring hostages home, and believe Netanyahu is continuing the conflict largely for the sake of his own political survival. The humanitarian toll inflicted on Gazan civilians has deepened Israel's international isolation. It's also put strain on the country's conscript military: the IDF is short on manpower, and the large number of reservists being called up is hindering the nation's economy while exacerbating long-running political tensions over whether ultra-Orthodox Israelis should be exempt from military service. Military commanders have warned that the ongoing operation may not be sustainable at current troop levels. 

By contrast, the strikes on Iran were wildly popular, and supported by Israel's opposition parties. They were relatively popular internationally as well. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz likely spoke for many of his European peers when he praised Israel for doing the “dirty work” for other countries. 

In contrast to the grinding conflict in Gaza, Israel's regional conflicts have been conducted either from the air, or in the case of Lebanon and Syria, with relatively small ground operations, putting far less manpower strain on the IDF. 

However it is fought, though, war is expensive. The 12-day war with Iran may cost around $6 billion, or 1 percent of Israel's GDP. Israel spent close to 9 percent of its GDP on defense last year, with the largest increases since the 1960s — and that was before the war with Iran. Economists have warned that level of spending threatens the country's fiscal stability and ability to provide social services. 

For the moment, however, the economy is weathering the storm better than many expected with modest growth and low unemployment. Israel is burning through munitions at a rapid clip, but the Trump administration seems willing for the moment to continue providing them. 

The better question than whether Israel can fight all these conflicts — for the moment, it seems like it can, or at least its leaders think it can — is what it all will lead to.

It's an open question what impact an endless series of “forever wars” will have on Netanyahu's ability to see through his other main regional priority: continuing the process of normalizing relations with other Arab governments. Trump is pushing a deal between Israel and Syria's new government, as well as the perennial goal of Saudi-Israeli normalization. 

But the carnage in Gaza has deepened the political costs of Arab governments engaging diplomatically with Israel, and while those leaders once pushed a hard line in Iran, most were opposed to last month's war, fearing its impact on regional stability and investment.

Michael Koplow, chief policy officer at the US-based Israel Policy Forum, said that the prime minister likely doesn't believe there's a trade-off. 

“Netanyahu believes that everything stems from Iran and anything else is a sideshow,” he said. “The idea is that the more that Israel projects strength, the easier it will be for Israel to normalize relations with other countries. I think we're going to see that proposition tested.”

Israel's multi-front war also only works if the United States keeps providing arms and political support. While Trump belatedly embraced the Israeli strikes on Iran and ultimately joined in, he has also run hot and cold on Netanyahu and shown a surprising willingness at times to act independently of Israeli interests in the region. Trump's frustrated outburst in the early hours of the ceasefire that Israel and Iran are “two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” was an indication that his support for Israel's larger regional ambitions should not be taken for granted. 

Then, of course, there's the question of whether “mowing the grass” will actually work. 

“The risks are that you just are in an endless series of military strikes and you don't actually achieve your goal,” said Crisis Group's Zonszein. “There are those in Israel, in the security establishment or elsewhere, who believe that that's the best you can get.” 

While most of Iran's proxies may be deterred for now, the Houthis, who have recently resumed their attacks on shipping through the Red Sea and actually sank two cargo ships in the past week, certainly don't appear ready to back down in the face of Israel's strikes. 

At the moment, the degree to which Iran's nuclear weapons program was set back by the bombing is still unclear, but there's a strong possibility that if any capabilities remain, Iranian leaders' desire to actually build a bomb has only been increased by the war. 

And while Iran's once-feared military and proxy militias look a bit like a paper tiger right now, there's no guarantee they will stay that way. The October 7 attacks were just the latest example of the fact that governments have a consistently terrible record when it comes to predicting the will and ability of extremist groups to strike. 

That's not the lesson Israel's political and military leaders appear to have taken, however. 

“The lesson that they took away from October 7 is not that mowing the grass doesn't work,” Raphael Cohen, a military analyst at the Rand Corporation, told Vox. “It's just that they let the grass grow too long, and they need to cut it even shorter.”

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Despite what your social media feed might say, microwaves are safe.

A Vox reader asks: Are microwaves actually bad for you, your health, and the food you eat?

I think anybody who's ever “nuked” some leftovers or a ready-made meal has pondered the same question. Nuke? As in the same nuclear radiation that causes deformities and mutations in my favorite science fiction? What exactly am I doing to my body?

It's an understandable concern. It seems like so much of what we eat is bad for us, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. constantly warns Americans that modern conveniences could be allowing invisible particles into our bodies that damage our health. It made sense then, that some staffers on his presidential campaign were reportedly fearful of radiation from kitchen microwaves.

But here is the good news: You are not ingesting toxic nuclear radiation. Microwaves are in fact quite safe — but there are a few precautions you should be aware of, if only to avoid that tinge of anxiety the next time you hit start on your instant oatmeal.

Let's start here: Microwaves produce a very different kind of radiation than a nuclear reaction. A nuclear bomb's detonation will emit ionizing radiation. That stuff carries so much energy it can actually strip electrons out of individual atoms, which can damage your body at the cellular level and potentially lead to cancer and other illnesses. A microwave will not.

The radiation produced by your kitchen microwave, on the other hand, is “non-ionizing.” These are electromagnetic waves that are similar to radio and light waves. Non-ionizing radiation is much, much less powerful than the other kind, which means it does not possess the necessary energy to alter your DNA at the molecular level. 

While prolonged, direct and intense exposure could lead to tissue damage, we are exposed to non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation all the time with no significant health harms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Visible light — literally the light waves from the sun or a light bulb that our eyes pick up and our brains turn to images — is even a low-grade form of it.

Plus, microwaves are appliances that the FDA strictly regulates to reduce any potential risk of radiation leakage; the agency says radiation injury from microwaves is “very rare” and associated with extremely unusual circumstances or the microwave being in poor condition.

Okay, we're not radiating ourselves when we nuke a slice of pizza. That's good. But you may still be wondering: Am I ruining the food somehow?

While I personally hate the way a piece of pizza tastes after being microwaved, when considering the nutritional value (of pizza or anything else), heating your food in the microwave isn't going to hurt it. “The non-ionizing radiation used by a microwave does not make the food radioactive,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. And it won't deplete your food of its nutritional value either: As Harvard Medical School's Anthony Komaroff wrote in 2019, “microwave cooking is actually one of the least likely forms of cooking to damage nutrients.”

The reason is simple: time. We invented microwaves to have a quicker way to heat up food and, as it turns out, that also confers some nutritional benefits. Foods leach nutrients when they are under more heat for a longer period of time. By shortening the amount of time that your food is being heated, microwaves allow it to retain more of its vitamins and minerals. It's unambiguously better than boiling, for example, during which the hot water removes many of the nutrients. How microwaving compares to roasting, sauteeing, or air-frying depends on the vegetable, but in general, microwaves are no worse for your food — from a nutritional point of view — than other forms of cooking.

Alright, microwaves aren't slowly poisoning you, nor are they robbing your food of its health benefits. Are there any catches? Sort of. 

There are at least two precautions to take when using your microwave. First, make sure you are using a safe container. Never, ever put metal in the microwave. And don't put plastic bowls or containers in there either: Everybody is freaking out about microplastics, BPAs, and PFAS these days — and for good reason: When it comes to microwaves, you do have some reason to worry. Studies have indicated that chemicals can leach into your food if you heat your food in them using a microwave. Once they enter your body, microplastics could damage your heart and other organs, disrupt your digestion, and affect your mental sharpness.

You may be better off with glass or ceramic containers. At the very least, check that the plates or bowls you're using in a microwave have been labeled safe for that use. You may want to consider replacing containers after a lot of microwave use because the risk of leaching harmful chemicals increases with time or if they have been damaged in some way.

And then there is one other kind of harm from microwaves that health officials worry about: burns. Anybody who has grabbed a plate out of their microwave as soon as the buzzer sounds knows they can produce intense heat that can burn your body when you grab your food or your tongue and mouth when you ingest it. That is what the FDA is warning consumers to be mindful of, rather than nuclear mutations.

The fear of turning into an extra from the Mad Max post-apocalypse should not dissuade you from using your kitchen's microwave — so long as you are also using an appropriate container and you handle it with care. Instead, focus on what preparation will be the most satisfying to you, and some people may want to consider what will provide the most nutritional value. 

Me? I can't stand microwaved pizza anyway. It's always going in the oven: 325 degrees, for 10 minutes.

﻿Why does unsuccessful cosmetic work make people so angry?

It wouldn't be a season of Love Island if viewers weren't discussing someone's plastic surgery. 

In June, Love Island USA contestant Vanna Einerson enjoyed a brief stint on the show before being eliminated by her castmates. But before she left, she caused a stir on social media for what many deemed “too much” facial filler. Users circulated a screenshot of her facial profile and announced their disbelief that she was only 21. Medical professionals on TikTok posted their own videos dissecting what they believed had been done to her face and detailing where her injector supposedly went wrong.

Vanna has since claimed that her swollen face was caused by an allergic reaction — but it was too late. Overnight, the short-lived reality star was branded a cautionary tale for young women tinkering with their faces at an earlier age. “Vanna from Love Island is the exact reason we need to stop telling young women that Botox and filler is preventative,” one user said in a TikTok that received over 10 million views. 

This negative response to a stranger's altered face seems ironic in a culture that isn't exactly against cosmetic work. On TikTok, cosmetic surgery trends like “Barbie noses” and “fox eyes” go viral every few months. Meanwhile, impressive plastic surgery is gawked at and emphatically praised. Just a couple of months ago, TikTok was applauding Kris Jenner for her impressive facelift and labeling her as inspo. Even more recently, users were amazed by the drastic results of a woman who went viral after she received the same procedure in Guadalajara. 

While discussions about plastic surgery have never been more open, our attitudes around it have never felt more muddled. Is plastic surgery empowering or capitulating? Why are the intentions of people who receive less-than-perfect results questioned, while the more fortunate are lauded? What does our collective disgust at women who receive “bad” cosmetic work say about us? 

It's common wisdom not to inquire about a woman's age or comment on people's weight (although, that's becoming less of a thing these days, thanks to Ozempic). But it's hard to say that, as a society, we've adopted any sort of coherent etiquette around discussing plastic surgery. The topic has long prompted a free-for-all of speculation and ridicule.

From Michael Jackson's reported rhinoplasties to The Hills star Heidi Montag's infamous trip to the plastic surgeon in 2010, celebrities “messing up” their faces and bodies has made for some of the most talked-about tabloid headlines. Meanwhile, makeover shows from the early 2000s, like The Swan, Extreme Makeover, and Addicted to Beauty, framed plastic surgery and the people who receive it as a spectacle worthy of its own genre of entertainment. 

Today, plastic surgery has become much more normalized and attainable, and the way we talk about something common has shifted. Once viewed as an option only for chronically vain and insecure people, interventions like injectables, nose jobs, and veneers have now become status symbols and luxury experiences that many people aspire to have. A 2023 RealSelf Culture Report found that nearly a quarter of Americans received some sort of cosmetic work or procedure. 

“It used to be that you work hard, and, as a reward, you get a handbag,” says Amy Odell, writer of the Back Row newsletter and author of the upcoming biography Gwyneth. “People would go into a Louis Vuitton to buy a bag, and it's a mark of their accomplishment. Now it feels like we're getting to a place where you're buying a face.” 

It's not that everyone is necessarily undergoing drastic transformations. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons' 2024 Procedural Statistics Report, while only 1.5 million surgeries were reported, approximately 28.2 million minimally invasive procedures — such as Botox, fillers, or non-surgical facial tightening — were performed that year. That's more than twice the amount reported a decade prior.

Dallas-based plastic surgeon Dr. Raja Mohan says that he sees more patients opting for “enhancements that look natural” and offer “quick results.” He also viewed the demand for minimally invasive work as a part of a “cultural shift toward self-improvement and wellness.”

“Cosmetic surgery is often viewed as just another way to feel better about yourself, similar to going to the gym or eating healthy,” Mohan said. 

With an increased demand for cosmetic work comes concerns over the ways people receive them. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 17 different cases of women who felt sick after receiving counterfeit Botox, either from an unlicensed individual or in a licensed setting. The FDA also issued a warning in 2023 about unapproved injectables that are being sold directly to the public. 

Most people's questions don't seem to concern health and safety; rather, they focus on the aesthetic outcomes of these treatments. It seems like one of the worst offenses you can commit as a woman online is paying money to make yourself look worse. It's the same strain of righteous ridicule that follows celebrities and influencers who've supposedly “ruined their bodies” by losing too much weight on Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs.

It's not a surprise that bad or overly noticeable cosmetic work is seen as a mark on a woman's character. Beauty culture critic Jessica DeFino, who writes The Review of Beauty newsletter, says that beauty exists as an “ethical ideal in society,” prompting a lot of judgment around how it's obtained. 

“Judgment of beauty is often entangled with judgment of naturalness,” says DeFino. “For example, studies show that we judge people who've undergone obvious cosmetic work as morally inferior — it's associated with lying.” 

She continues, “The underlying message is that a ‘good woman' with ‘good work' conceals the labor they perform to make the entangled constructs of beauty and womanhood seem natural. A ‘bad woman' with ‘bad work' exposes the entangled constructs of beauty and womanhood as unnatural.”

This sort of moral outrage was on display when Vanna appeared on Love Island this season — plus, it's seen whenever the UK version of the dating show airs. Last year, the women cast members of the UK show's 11th season instantly went viral for their noticeable cosmetic work, prompting immediate negative commentary from plastic surgeons and users alike. One doctor even posted a mocking video of himself guessing the women's ages and the work they had done. 

This backlash can also strike average people. This past May, a woman posted the results of her rhinoplasty that made her nose stick upward. Despite telling her followers that her nose was still healing, she prompted days-long discourse about Black women supposedly “ruining their faces” in pursuit of smaller noses.

Overall, it seems like the main concern around the demand for cosmetic work right now is that it's making (some) women less attractive. Even more thoughtful criticisms around cosmetic work and toxic beauty standards seem to always be pegged to women whose work supposedly looks bad. All this creates a toxic feedback loop where women are constantly encouraged to pursue beauty at all costs but criticized if those attempts backfire. 

DeFino sees more urgent problems to be addressed within our current plastic surgery boom. She says, when it comes to critiquing beauty culture, the “smartest place to focus our attention is not on the outcome of beauty work, but the input.” She says that women and gender non-conforming people, especially, are conditioned to funnel an inordinate amount of time, money, and effort “into meeting an unrealistic and oppressive standard of beauty.” It's these messages that need to be adjusted, not necessarily their results. 

For now, though, the internet seems to get more joy out of humbling women for their bad decisions. There's no worse crime than falling into a trap society set up for you.

Bitcoin extended a record-setting rally into a third day on Friday, jumping above $118,000 for the first time ever.

The price of the world's biggest cryptocurrency climbed more 7% to as high as $118,661 early Friday. Its first record high of the week cam on Wednesday, when it briefly surpassed the $112,000 mark. It went on to jump above $113,000 on Thursday before embarking on a steeper rally into early Friday trading hours. 

The digital currency is now up 26.1% from levels at the start of the year.

Bitcoin's swift climb has come alongside a broader shift in sentiment as traders recover from Monday's fresh tariff talk from President Donald Trump. Major indexes on Thursday were teetering near record highs, with earnings season on the horizon and bullishness building for strong second-quarter results.

Bitcoin likely picked up on ""positive 'risk on' vibes from equities,"" David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said.

""This is an indication that upside momentum may start to pick up, allowing Bitcoin to rally further. But so far, gains have been slow and steady rather than spectacular,"" Morrison said.

Gerry O'Shea, the head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management, said he believed bitcoin's latest all-time highs signaled more upside to come.

""While the macro environment will continue to remain uncertain, we believe the bull market is far from over and new catalysts, including more institutional platforms allowing access to bitcoin, may help drive the price of BTC to $140,000 or higher this year,"" O'Shea said in a statement.

Investors are also looking ahead to ""crypto week"" to begin on July 14. Lawmakers during the week will mull several pieces of legislation aimed at digital assets.

Bitcoin has trended steadily higher this year, but has been volatile since Trump won the November election. Its price has soared as Trump promised to loosen regulations in the sector and appointed crypto-friendly members in his administration. But the crypto also followed the broader market in selling off amid tariff volatility this spring.

Delta Air Lines had to send a plane to rescue passengers after their flight diverted to a small island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

Flight 127 departed Madrid around 1 p.m. local time on Sunday and was supposed to land in New York seven hours later.

However, data from Flightradar24 shows how four hours into the journey, the Airbus A330 turned around over the ocean.

Roughly an hour later, it landed at Lajes Airport on the Portuguese island of Terceira. It's part of the Azores, a remote archipelago that's nearly 1,000 miles away from the country's mainland.

The airport shares its runway with a military base, and only serves about a dozen destinations commercially.

Marc Viscardi, a passenger on the flight, told Business Insider he was ""very thankful to be home after our very scary ordeal.""

He also said that after the unplanned landing, a cabin crew member said ""Welcome to the Azores,"" which he criticized as ""tone deaf.""

""As safety comes before all else at Delta, the flight crew followed procedures to divert to Lajes, Azores, after indication of a mechanical issue with an engine,"" said an airline spokesperson.

Losing an engine's functionality can be frightening, although pilots are well trained in such situations.

The 21-year-old A330, registered as N805NW, is still parked at the airport as of Friday.

To get the passengers back on their way, Delta had to send another plane from New York.

About five hours after Flight 127 landed in the Azores, flight-tracking data shows another A330 left JFK Airport.

Viscardi told BI he was unhappy with Delta's communication, only learning about the rescue flight via text message hours after landing in the Azores.

He added that text alerts were ""incomplete, vague, and often contradictory.""

The second plane arrived at Lajes shortly after 2 a.m. local time, before leaving around 9 p.m. on Monday.

Flight 9927 then landed in New York at 10:22 p.m. ET — roughly 31 hours after passengers expected to touch down on US soil.

""We sincerely apologize to our customers for their experience and delay in their travels,"" the Delta spokesperson said.

They added that customers and crew were accommodated overnight in area hotels and provided meals. The flight had 282 passengers and 13 crew members.

This isn't the first time a Delta plane has been forced to divert to Lajes Airport. In 2023, a flight from Ghana landed there due to a ""mechanical issue with a backup oxygen system.""

In that incident, passengers spent 12 hours on the island and some complained about a lack of communication from Delta before another plane arrived to take them on to New York.

Airlines typically try to divert flights back to their origins or hub airports when possible, because this makes it easier to reroute passengers and repair any problems with the aircraft. However, in cases like these, concerns about safety can require landing at the closest available airport.

In a similar case last year, Air France had to cancel a flight so the plane could be used to rescue passengers who were diverted to a remote town in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut.

Nvidia became the first $4 trillion company this week. The moment reminded me of something my tech friend mentioned before he moved to the UK earlier this year: There have never been companies like these.

$4 trillion is the GDP of Japan, according to the World Bank. Nvidia is not far behind Germany, the third-largest economy in the world. This is a single corporation with only about 36,000 employees.

Why is Nvidia so valuable? After a DeepSeek-inspired freakout earlier this year, the industry now thinks AI models probably need even more Nvidia GPUs and related gear. New types of ""reasoning"" models are especially expensive to run, which means extra demand for Nvidia's wares.

Who buys all this stuff? Mainly cloud providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, along with other Big Tech and AI companies, such as Meta. They also compete with Nvidia, so I call them frenemies. Add up the market value of these four giants and you get to about $10 trillion. Throw Apple and Nvidia into that mix, and you're over $17 trillion — approaching China's GDP. Just from six companies based in two medium-sized urban hubs on the northwest coast of the US.

This compares a ""flow"" with an asset, so I'm risking a lecture from journalism schools I never attended, but it gives you an idea of the financial heft of these private entities. There are other ways to comprehend their size:

                      The Lasko LP450 is a more powerful version of our pick for the best budget air purifier, the LP300. It's designed to clean the air in rooms up to 250 square feet. Right now, you can save an extra $20 off an already low price.
                    


                      With the prevalence of wildfires, there's been more concern than ever about the health effects of bad air quality. Turn your home into a respite from the outdoor air with this medical-grade HEPA purifier.
                    


                      From one of our favorite air purifier brands, the Levoit Core 300 is a solid investment for keeping your air clean without breaking the bank.
                    


                      Blueair is one of the top names in air purifiers, and the Blue Pure 511 offers HEPA filtration at a budget price.
                    


                      This AROEVE air purifier is designed for large rooms, and removes dust, smoke, pet dander, and more from the air.
                    


                          If you need a powerful, energy-efficient air purifier for medium to large rooms, the Airmega AP-1521HH Mighty is your best option. It includes three filters and ionization, and the fan speed adjusts based on the air quality.
                        


                          The Levoit 300S Air Purifier does an outstanding job removing VOCs from small rooms and features a user-friendly app.
                        


                      Winix's large room True-HEPA air purifier (up to 1,700 square feet) has a washable carbon filter that not only purifies air but helps remove odors from smoke, cooking odors, and other household smells. 
                    


                      The Dreo Air Purifier Tower Fan is a 2-in-1 design that quietly cools and purifies. It pairs with an app to provide historical air quality and temperature data. 
                    


                      Another great option we tested from Coway. The 250 was one of the best removers of particulate matter. It also used minimal electricity, thanks to the fan that adjusts based on the air quality. However, it didn't perform well at removing VOCs from the air.
                    


                      The Coway Airmega 400 Smart Air Purifier is an attractive air purifier that barely makes any sound and adjusts the fan speed based on the air's pollution level.
                    


                      We tested a larger, pricier version of the Shark NeverChange Air Purifier Max and were impressed with its purifying performance in our tests. This model is virtually identical but designed for medium-sized rooms.
                    

Yes. Even the lowest performing air purifiers improved indoor air quality when we tested extensively for our best air purifiers guide.

HEPA stands for ""high-efficiency particulate air."" HEPA filters are the gold standard for air purifiers. According to the EPA, a HEPA filter can remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micron airborne particles, which include pollen, bacteria, mold, and dust. We primarily only recommend air purifiers with true HEPA filters.

Yes. An air purifier can help during a smoke emergency. Experts recommend running an air purifier with a HEPA filter, like one of our top picks from Coway or Lasko. One of the best air conditioners with a good HVAC filter can also supply some relief.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The best Prime Day laptop deals start at just $220, but they won't last much longer","https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/deals/amazon-prime-day-laptop-deals-2025-7","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:29:00 GMT","

A laptop is an important investment, especially if you're looking for a powerful gaming rig or a reliable system for work. Top models are often expensive, but there's still time to grab an excellent discount for Prime Day. Amazon's big sale has entered its final day, but we're still seeing great savings. The best Prime Day laptop deals include low prices on entry-level and midrange systems perfect for school and high-end models geared toward hardcore gamers.

If you just want a cheap laptop for everyday browsing, check out the Asus Vivobook Go, which is only $220 for Prime Day. This model is about as basic as laptops get, but it's fine for casual use and standard productivity. Meanwhile, gamers who want a solid system on a budget should check out this Acer Nitro V laptop with an RTX 4050 graphics card, which is 19% off for Prime Day. Apple fans can also save on select MacBooks, including $150 off the latest 13-inch MacBook Air.

Keep scrolling to find all of the best Amazon Prime Day laptop deals so far. These discounts are set to expire at midnight, so don't hesitate to grab a deal before they're gone. And you can browse more of the event's best discounts in our complete Amazon Prime Day deals hub.


                      This Vivobook Go by Asus with a 15.6-inch FHD display is excellent value for a basic laptop for casual workloads.
                    


                      This is a solid budget laptop for work and school. It has a touchscreen display and an entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 processor. That said, this isn't a good fit for power users who like to multitask with lots of apps open at once. 
                    


                      This affordable Dell laptop uses an older Intel processor, so it's not meant for power users or people looking for a cutting-edge model with new AI features. However, it's still solid for everyday computing, especially when it's on sale.  
                    


                      The Acer Inspire Go is a solid option for users on a budget. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price.
                    


                      Acer's Nitro 5 is a budget-friendly gaming laptop. This entry-level model features an older but still solid Intel Core i5 chip along with an RTX 4050 graphics card. The 15.6-inch screen has a 144Hz refresh rate, which is decent but not as high as pricier options. 
                    


                      LG's Gram laptops are ultra-lightweight and portable. This model isn't meant for gaming but comes with super solid midrange power for general use. 
                    


                      This 17.3-inch laptop from HP is built for people who want a general-use laptop with a bigger screen. This model's Intel Core i3 processor is entry-level, but it has a large 1TB SSD and a touchscreen.
                    


                      It's expensive, but this high-end gaming laptop has top-tier hardware, including an Intel Core Ultra 9, a powerful GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, and a big 18-inch screen.
                    


                      This midrange gaming laptop has an Intel Core i7 CPU and a GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, along with a 16-inch display that supports up to a 165Hz refresh rate.
                    


                      The newest MacBook Air is powered by an M4 chip for ultimate speed and efficiency. The 13-inch, 16 GB laptop comes in traditional silver and three other sky-inspired colors.
                    


                      The M4 MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, compared to the 8GB standard in previous generations, which is more appropriate for demanding workloads. Anyone running on older M1 or Intel MacBook Pros will experience notable performance gains with the M4 model.
                    


                      This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16 GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage.
                    

One of the biggest differences is that gaming laptops have more powerful graphics cards (GPUs), components that let them play modern games with realistic visuals. They also tend to have stronger processors (CPUs), meaning programs and files open faster and are better for multitasking. These laptops are great for users who want to play games, edit 4K videos, and quickly switch between dozens of apps.

More typical laptops can have a range of CPUs, from basic to advanced, to power productivity apps like a web browser or the Microsoft Office suite. They usually have integrated graphics rather than powerful GPUs but offer significantly better battery life, as well as lighter and more portable designs.

Design-wise, the best gaming laptops tend to be bigger and heavier, and battery life isn't great. But they're often outfitted with customizable lights that give the keyboard and chassis a sleek neon glow.

When it comes to price, the most powerful gaming laptops are far more expensive than any other kind of laptop. But it's not hard to find more affordable options, and many budget gaming laptops can still play all your favorite games, albeit with some performance caveats.

Windows laptops range wildly in price, starting in the low hundreds and going up into the thousands. But in general, you should expect to pay $300 to $700 for a decent budget laptop, around $1,000 to $1,300 for a midrange model, and upward of $1,600 for a really powerful option.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Don't Wait — It's the Final Day of Prime Day and the Best Deals Are Almost Gone","https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2025-7-10","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:38:00 GMT","

This is it, folks. Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out.

After all, having something in your basket doesn't mean it's reserved for you until the end of the day. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today.

We've compared prices across thousands of deals this week, and below, you'll find highlights of some of our favorite picks from our collection of reviews and buying guides. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts. 

I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Past sales have seen them dip to $160, but you're generally looking at $180-$200 for a standard discount during more low-key sales.

The audio quality and noise-cancelling both received massive upgrades over the first-gen Pros. If you have the original Pro 2s with the Lightning cable, the only difference besides the charging port is added dust resistance, so I'd hold off for the next-gen Pros rather than pick these up. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though.

Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro.

This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus.

Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers.

OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. Hopefully, they're a bit more on it than Apple's utterly botched Siri Apple Intelligence rollout.

So why the Echo Pop? It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's a nice size for a nightstand or a little music speaker on your desk. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below.

The entire Echo line is on sale for Prime Day until Friday, including the ones with a display at Amazon.

This is a neat (and cheap!) device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers).

Typical uses include activating lamps or electric fans. Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills.

If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp.

Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. I have both, and I swap between them regularly, so there's no bad option here.

I use the Paperwhite the most because the larger screen means fewer page turns. I also like the flush screen design, which prevents dust or hair from tucking into the bezel, which is a tiny issue with the cheaper model.

The Paperwhite has a few premium touches that make it worth the price, especially when it's on sale like this. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. The adjustable warm-light feature makes the screen easier on the eyes and can be tweaked to a soft golden glow, which is very pleasing on the eye as it looks like an old paperback.

As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus.

If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line.

Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2"" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen.

I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag.

This version comes with the Premium Pen (which costs extra on the last-gen model), an eraser button on the top, and a programmable shortcut key.

If you have the original Scribe, I'd skip this one, as the design has not changed significantly, and both have the same software upgrades. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. That said, I can barely read my own handwriting, so I can cut it some slack here.

Philips Hue is the most recognizable brand in the smart lighting game, and the vast range of colors available via the app on these super-long-lasting bulbs makes them my top pick whenever anyone asks me about them.

They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. These are certainly items I'd say are vulnerable to price hikes if the tariffs hit.

Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit.

They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200.

Oura is the biggest name in smart rings and is our go-to pick, even over Samsung's Galaxy Ring. If you're looking for a subtle health tracker that looks pretty cool as well, you can't go wrong here. Multiple sizes and colors are on sale today.

The Oura can track various fitness and wellness metrics, including sleep, heart rate, steps, and other activities. Many find wearing a smartwatch all the time, especially when sleeping, is a bit much. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too.

Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more.

I've been drawing as a hobby since I was young, but digital art was always one of my weak points — until I picked up an Apple Pencil. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. Even when not drawing, the accessory makes note-taking and photo editing so much easier and precise. — Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today.

You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past. 

I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100.

I've been very happy with it so far. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. It's a little heavy in handheld mode, but I feel I've got a real bargain compared to the amount of money you'd spend on a brand like Dyson.

That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. If you're in a small carpet-free apartment, though, I think you're better off with the Tikom. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. 

Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home.

Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. You can program different pre-set heights for sitting and standing for more than one user. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see.

Govee's outdoor lights have been a huge hit. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights. 

As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area.

I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Plus, you can add more attachments, like a pasta maker, if you want.

Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. With the help of the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, which is also 25% off for Prime Day, I can use it to make all the coffee and espresso drinks I love, hot or iced. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate.

This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen.

No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. While it can't filter large quantities of water for a group, it's a must-have for solo adventurers.

It sees sales somewhat regularly throughout the year, but right now, it's down to its all-time lowest price of $10. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water.

If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side.

The pillow's medium firmness offers the perfect amount of pressure relief around the neck and shoulders for back and side sleepers, helping you maintain spine alignment throughout the night. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good.

I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all.

Though it's pretty common to find it on sale during most deal events, it's not until something like Prime Day that it drops to its lowest price. Seriously, if you're at all on the fence, let me join the chorus of recommendations for this pillow. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type.

Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals.

If you're the type of person who likes to style your hair with a sleek, straight blowout one day and voluminous waves the next, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer is the only tool you'll ever need. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage.

At 60% off, the One-Step 2.0 is one of the best Prime Day deals over 50% off we've seen this year. You're unlikely to find it at a better price, at least until Black Friday. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling.

The no-frills Original Wet Brush is genuinely one of the hero products of my lifetime. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I picked this up on a whim at least a decade ago, and I've never been without one ever since.

I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. At just $6, it's a steal.

Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm excels at both, which is why it's the best lip balm we've ever tested.

Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can.

Any dermatologist will tell you to keep your hands off any breakouts, but if you're guilty of pimple popping, these acne patches might just save you. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit.

The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. For Prime Day, grab a 72-pack for $24.

As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Clinique Black Honey has been a cult favorite for decades, and for good reason. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying.

The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. Plus, it's buildable, so you can take it from day to night with just a few swipes. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it.

For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year.

Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. Rather than a typical gloss tube, it's a buttery balm that glides on smoothly and even nourishes your skin.

My eyelids get oily throughout the day, and due to my almond eye shape, I have a lot of creasing around my outer corners. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine.

I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

This stylish and comfy sweatsuit is a near-perfect dupe of the Spanx Air Essentials set for a fraction of the price, earning it a top spot in our best sweatsuits guide. The stretchy and silky fabric feels extremely high-quality for the price, which we were impressed with in our full review.

The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks.

A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end.

We love the Ultraboost Light's fit. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. At 55% off, you'll be hard-pressed to find this pair at a better price.

[Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick

My Rothy's flats have been a staple in my closet ever since I got them. They're incredibly lightweight and made with sustainable materials. Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day.

The Square Mary Jane, one of our favorite Mary Janes, is the best Rothy's deal we've seen for Prime Day. All four colors are $60 off, so grab a pair or a couple.

One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested.

The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. It would make a great companion on any trip or a day at the office.

These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures.

These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price.

Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. However, some offers are one-day 'daily deals', while others will only last as long as the stock does.

Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours.

No, but most are. Some items are just on a general discount, and we've spotted quite a few like that this year.

The majority are locked behind Prime membership. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over.

Very difficult to say. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday.

Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise.

This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later.

The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

When Amber Smith, 28, had trouble submitting an IT support ticket, she quickly realized that her second layoff in one year had arrived.

Before that, she was already jumpy. She'd be unnerved by everyday workplace tasks, like when her manager asked to hop on the phone on short notice, or a companywide meeting suddenly appeared on her calendar.

It's a sign of the times as workplace power swings away from workers, and layoffs dominate headlines. While layoffs are still low relative to historic levels, they loom large in workers' minds.

A miasma of new stresses is also permeating white-collar offices: the threat of AI taking jobs, stricter return-to-office pushes, and a new hardcore culture that's eroding work-life balance. There's also the hollowing out of middle managers, and the Great Flattening has left some with fear that they'll be next.

""Workers are feeling disempowered,"" Michele Williams, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa, said, adding that this trend reared its head during the 2008 recession and is now back again.

""If the boss walks by and doesn't say 'hi,' are they planning to fire me, as opposed to the boss was just busy that day and just didn't notice you?"" Williams said. ""They're looking for these social cues and overinterpreting social cues because of that insecurity.""

It's what experts call ""paranoid attribution,"" where employees read negative meaning into regular workplace occurrences. Do worse snacks mean the company is struggling financially? Is a warmer office a sign that management is cutting costs on air conditioning? Are more interns a good sign or a bad sign for the hiring budget?

The fear isn't good for anyone — when employees are anxious, they probably also aren't doing their best work. The paranoia may be more psychological than based in reality. Overall, layoffs are still low and concentrated in white-collar sectors, especially at big-name companies that dominate headlines. While hiring has slowed in the last year, the unemployment rate is still relatively low, as well. However, it has gotten much more difficult to get a new white-collar job, and promotions have slowed way down.

The paranoia over employment uncertainty pushed Smith out of the corporate world completely. These days, she's self-employed as a content creator and reseller. ""I feel so much better because being self-employed, obviously, I'm not going to get laid off,"" Smith said.

Monica Wiant, a 47-year-old copywriter in Minnesota, has completely changed her perspective on work and her career after getting laid off twice in two years. The first time she was laid off was the day that she had arranged a return-to-office party for the workers reporting to her. She was also coming off a glowing performance review in her role as a VP.

""The day that I got that news, it was like going to the worst surprise party I've ever been to,"" Wiant said. In retrospect, she said, there were some warning signs. Budgets for her department kept getting reduced, and they were asked to do more with less. Advertising budgets shrank, and some hiring was paused.

""I feel like so many companies have lost sight of how important the human experiences of their employees are. There's no place that's less motivating than a downsizing workplace,"" Wiant said. ""It's really hard to go to work every day and to know that you may not have a future here no matter how hard you work.""

Mark Freeman, 65, has some advice after spending the last 25 or so years in supply chain technology and getting laid off twice throughout his career.

""As soon as they say, 'don't worry, no one's going to get laid off,' you should get your résumé out there and start looking, because you can't believe them."" He said he's learned it's important to be agile and constantly looking for other job opportunities; waiting until after a layoff will mean you're already behind.

Attention on layoffs, as Business Insider's Tim Paradis writes, might bite into productivity amid worker unease. Williams said that workers become less engaged as their energy shifts from actually getting work done toward worrying and becoming hypervigilant. 

On the other hand, employees might also cling harder to old adages about becoming indispensable at work. This is what some Big Tech companies are hoping for when they place more emphasis on performance reviews in a shift toward a more ""hardcore"" management style.

Williams said working harder is good advice when a promotion or raise seems realistic.

""But if you push it to the extreme, you're going to have workers hoarding information and knowledge because then they become indispensable,"" she said. ""But the sharing of that knowledge is what the organization needs to increase collaboration and innovation.""

Benjamin Friedrich, a professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, said that, in isolation, workers might not be willing to put in extra effort if they feel their trust has been broken by their firms.

Of course, Friedrich said, not all power is lost among workers right now: While the worker power pendulum is still swinging, the ""amenities"" of the Great Resignation and the pandemic era haven't faded completely.

""If you look at the breadth and the coverage of remote work or what share of workers can work some of the time at home, it's been very stable,"" Friedrich said.

By the time her second layoff rolled around, Wiant wasn't as surprised and was more attuned to those warning signs. While weathering two layoffs was far from pleasant, it's also made Wiant turn introspective.

""I don't feel as deep of a need to have all of my needs met from work,"" Wiant said. ""I realize that I can cultivate a sense of purpose and creative challenge and intellectual challenge from other things in my life.""

Only half of Russia's coal companies remained profitable in 2024, according to the Federal Statistics Service, and the situation is continuing to deteriorate. One top miner, Mechel PJSC, said on June 30 that it may cut sales by a quarter this year and has already begun scaling back output as each newly mined ton deepens losses.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said his agency may fast-track new drugs from pharmaceutical companies that “equalize” the cost of their medicines between the US and other countries, an unusual proposition from the regulator that's long avoided contentious pricing debates.

The comments, made in an interview on Bloomberg Television's Wall Street Week with David Westin, offer insight into an idea floated to help the administration achieve one of President Donald Trump's main health-care goals: ensuring foreign countries aren't getting a better deal on drugs. Trump demanded that Americans get similar or lower prices as consumers in other countries in an executive order signed in May.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Copper anodes ready for shipment at the Codelco El Teniente processing facility in Chile in April.

The Aug. 1 deadline for Trump's 50% copper tariffs signals the endgame for the most profitable trade that industry veterans say they have ever seen.

The phone calls started within days. In late February, President Donald Trump ordered a probe to potentially tariff copper imports. Almost immediately, China's top metals bosses began receiving inquiries from some of the biggest Western commodity traders — companies that for decades have played a key role in supplying metal to feed the factories, construction sites and power grids of the world's top consumer of raw materials.

But now instead of selling copper to China, the traders wanted to buy from it. Lots of copper, as soon as possible. They were willing to pay big money to get it. They even offered to pay their Chinese customers sizable amounts if they would cancel their obligations to supply them, freeing up that copper too.

The exchange has been a coder, a promoter and an early adopter for World Liberty Financial's stablecoin, people familiar with the matter say. Critics say the relationship poses a conflict of interest for President Trump.

One of the Trump family's crypto ventures has received key behind-the-scenes help from the world's largest digital-asset exchange, whose founder is a convicted felon now seeking a presidential pardon.

Binance wrote the basic code to power USD1, a stablecoin launched by the Trumps' World Liberty Financial Inc., according to three people familiar with the matter. They asked not to be named because the arrangement was private. Later, Binance's founder and principal owner, Changpeng Zhao, said publicly that he had applied for a pardon. CZ, as he's known, pleaded guilty in 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

There's no compelling evidence that current monetary policy is significantly restraining economic activity. 

What extreme pressure looks like. 

Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Despite President Donald Trump's public efforts to cajole the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates, monetary policy is rightly locked on hold over the near-term for three reasons.

First, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariff regime remains unusually high. Not only is tariff policy ever changing in terms of countries, products, rates and rationale, but also the timeline for resolution continues to be pushed back, as evidenced by the April 1 and July 9 deadlines that have come and gone. Attention is now on the Aug. 1 deadline, which is two days after the central bank next meets to set monetary policy. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Trump's Tariffs:

Vietnam's leadership was caught off guard by US President Donald Trump's announcement last week that it agreed to a 20% tariff, and the Southeast Asian nation is still seeking to lower the rate, according to people familiar with the matter.

Straight after last Wednesday's call with Trump, Vietnam's party chief To Lam told his negotiating team to keep working to bring the tariff rate down, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are confidential. The 20% figure came as a surprise as Vietnam believed it had secured a more favorable tariff range, the people said. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $117,297.10, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $118,872.85. Ether rose nearly 6% at $2,976.90. Earlier, it crossed back above the $3,000 level for the first time since February.

Stocks tied to the bitcoin price were off their highs. Pure play miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms gained 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy gained almost 3%. Crypto trading providers Coinbase and Robinhood gained 1%.

On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest day of inflows of 2025 at $1.18 billion. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue.

The rally began more slowly on Wednesday, following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed a divergence among officials about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22.

""That's when we started to really take out the top range,"" said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. ""It's expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug,"" he added, nodding to the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which is expected to increase the federal deficit – and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.

This week's move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $650 million in short liquidations and ether more than $215 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.

Fed independence has been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That's when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the ""termination"" of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank's stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion.

Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen.

""Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not,"" Thielen said. ""So we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer.""

For the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain, while ether is up more than 20%.

Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence robotics and biometric venture as more companies bet big on automation tools.

The new company, known as RealSense, was announced Friday and comes alongside a $50 million Series A funding round that includes MediaTek Innovation Fund and Intel Capital, the chipmaker's venture arm that it is also spinning out.

RealSense, which makes the tools and technology for robotics automation, said it plans to use the funding to develop new product lines and meet growing demand worldwide. Nadav Orbach, Intel's current vice president and general manager for incubation and disruptive innovation, will serve as CEO.

""The timing is now for physical AI,"" as the technology gains more use cases and traction, Orbach told CNBC in an interview. ""We want to develop new product lines. We see the demand and we see the need, and with where it's at right now, the right thing for us was to raise external funds.""

Companies across the globe have ramped up investment in the burgeoning robotics space as AI use cases expand.

Morgan Stanley expects the market for humanoid robots to hit $5 trillion by 2050 as tech companies, including Tesla and Amazon, bet big on the technology and automation.

Elsewhere, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called robotics the biggest opportunity for the chipmaker after AI, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff last month claimed AI is handling 30% to 50% of the software vendor's work.

Intel has undergone a series of cost-cutting plans after the worst year for its stock in decades.

The company axed CEO Pat Gelsinger and cut jobs last year as it struggled to keep up with AI competition. In April, the company said it would sell a majority of its stake in chip subsidiary Altera.

RealSense, formerly known as Intel Perceptual Computing, was created more than a decade ago to investigate 3D vision technology and launched its first product in 2015. The company employs about 130 people across the U.S., Israel and China and caters to autonomous robot manufacturers such as Eyesynth and Unitree Robotics.

Orbach said RealSense is focused on bringing more safety tools to the industry and easy-to-use technology for its customers. Intel will maintain a minority stake in the company.

The newest hire at Goldman Sachs isn't human.

The bank is testing an autonomous software engineer from artificial intelligence startup Cognition that is expected to soon join the ranks of the firm's 12,000 human developers, Goldman tech chief Marco Argenti told CNBC.

The program, named Devin, became known in technology circles last year with Cognition's claim that it had created the world's first AI software engineer. Demo videos showed the program operating as a full-stack engineer, completing multi-step assignments with minimal intervention.

""We're going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who's going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,"" Argenti said this week in an interview.

""Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases,"" he said.

It's the latest indicator of the dizzying speed in which AI is being adopted in the corporate world. Just last year, Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were rolling out cognitive assistants based on OpenAI models to get employees acquainted with the technology.

Now, the arrival of agentic AI on Wall Street — referencing programs like Devin that don't just help humans with tasks like summarizing documents or writing emails, but instead execute complex multi-step jobs like building entire apps — signals a much larger shift, with greater potential rewards.

Tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet have said AI is already producing about 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said last month that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.

At Goldman Sachs, one of the world's top investment banks, this more powerful form of AI has the potential to boost worker productivity by up to three or four times the rate of previous AI tools, according to Argenti.

Devin will be supervised by human employees and will handle jobs that engineers often consider drudgery, like updating internal code to newer programing languages, he said.

Goldman is the first major bank to use Devin, according to Cognition, which was founded in late 2023 by a trio of engineers and whose staff is reportedly stocked with champion coders.

In March, the startup doubled its valuation to nearly $4 billion just a year after the release of Devin. The company counts Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, the prominent venture capitalists and Palantir co-founders, among its investors.

Goldman doesn't own a stake in Cognition, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified speaking about the bank's investments.

The bank's move could spark a fresh round of anxiety on Wall Street and beyond about job cuts as a result of AI.

Executives at companies from Amazon to Ford have grown more candid about what AI will mean for hiring plans. Banks around the world will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as they implement AI, Bloomberg's research arm said in January.

For his part, Argenti — who joined Goldman from Amazon in 2019 — charted out a vision for the near future that he called a ""hybrid workforce"" where humans and AI coexist.

""It's really about people and AIs working side by side,"" Argenti said. ""Engineers are going to be expected to have the ability to really describe problems in a coherent way and turn it into prompts … and then be able to supervise the work of those agents.""

While the role of software developer is one that most lends itself to the type of training, called reinforcement learning, that is used to make AI smarter, other roles at a bank aren't far off from being automated, according to Argenti.

""Those models are basically just as good as any developer, it's really cool,"" Argenti said. ""So I think that will serve as a proof point also to expand it to other places.""

The U.S. tariff saga has stolen global spotlight from trade tensions between China and the European Union, which are now heating up.

Accusations and investigations over each other's trade practices have long been a staple of EU-China trade relations, underpinned by concerns over how domestic economies are likely to be impacted by competing imports.

In recent weeks, EU restrictions on Chinese companies taking part in public tenders for medical devices were quickly met with China imposing import curbs on such products. Separately, long-threatened Chinese duties on brandy from the EU came into force earlier this month, and both Beijing and Brussels have ramped up criticism of each another.

Altogether, EU-China trade relations are now ""quite poor,"" according to Marc Julienne, director of the Center of Asian Studies at the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri).

""What was once a domain of great opportunity and enthusiasm for the bilateral relationship has now become more about risks than opportunities,"" he told CNBC earlier this week.

EU and China relations are encumbered by many challenges and risks often linked to clashing economic positions, Grzegorz Stec, senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, suggested.

""The EU and China are broadly on a colliding trajectory in terms of their trade and industrial policy concerns,"" he told CNBC. Bones of contention include the challenge of China's overcapacity and trade diversion to Europe, Stec, who is also head of the Mercator Institute's Brussels office, explained.

""Beijing's increasingly pressing need to export contradicts the EU's need to protect its own industrial base,"" he added.

China's economy is facing a gap between its production capacity and demand. It is also struggling with sluggish growth, while exports, which long boosted the economy, have been under pressure amid global trade tensions and lower demand.

Ifri's Julienne also flagged a series of concerns that make the EU-China relationship tricky, including an increasingly difficult environment for foreign companies operating in China and Europe's growing trade deficit. Additionally, he said Beijing was ""weaponizing"" trade to put pressure on Europe — like they did with the brandy tariffs.

China first started investigating European brandy imports after the EU began slapping levies on Chinese-made electric vehicles last year, which pose steep competition to Europe-made alternatives.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tariff regime could have been an opportunity for China and the EU to improve their relations, according to Ifri's Julienne.

""It should have had a positive impact on the bilateral relationship, in the sense that — facing economic coercion from the United States — [the EU and China] — might have been expected to negotiate and compromise in order to make the most of their trade relationship amid the US tariff war,"" he said.

This has yet to materialize.

Jean-Marc Fenet, senior fellow at the ESSEC Institute for Geopolitics & Business, suggested one reason for this failure could be that Beijing feels it has come out on top in its own trade drama with Washington.

""The need for a common front with the EU is therefore less necessary,"" Fenet said. ""In fact, the fear now in Beijing is rather that the EU will accept an alignment with an anti-Chinese line that the American administration would impose on the sidelines of the trade negotiations.""

After initial sharp escalations and tense negotiations, China and the U.S. confirmed a trade framework agreement in June, including provisions around hotly contested rare earths and tech regulations. Earlier this year, Beijing had imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets, which are often used in the automotive, defense and energy sectors, as part of its response to initial U.S. tariffs.

The Mercator Institute's Stec argued that a solution is ""unlikely to be found"" on the lingering points of trade contention between Beijing and Brussels, instead foreseeing further issues.

""The overcapacity and trade diversion issues paired with Beijing's willingness to use rare earths export controls as leverage in EV tariffs negotiations signal more turbulences to come,"" he said.

Tensions over the EU's measures to boost its autonomy and China's attempts to prevent these efforts can also be expected according to Stec.

Fenet struck a similarly skeptical tone.

""The significant hardening of the European Commission's positions and the increase in the power of the protection tools it has equipped itself with in recent years, make it likely that there will be growing frictions, as shown by the recent measures taken against Chinese medical equipment and as we will undoubtedly see at the EU-China Summit on July 24th in Beijing,"" he added.

His hopes for the summit — which sources told CNBC will include a meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese President Xi Jinping — are also low.

""The two parties already seem to be anticipating a difficult and probably inconclusive meeting,"" Fenet said.

When xAI's Grok 4 chatbot was launched on Wednesday, users and media outlets quickly began pointing out examples of it consulting its owner Elon Musk's views on controversial matters. 

CNBC was able to confirm that when asked to take a stance on some potentially contentious questions, the chatbot said it was analyzing posts from Musk while generating its answers.

When asked, ""Who do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict? One word answer,"" Grok 4's answer-generating process showed that it was searching the web and X for Elon Musk's stance before giving an answer. 

When Grok 3 was asked the same question about the Israel vs Palestine conflict, the chatbot took a neutral stance and provided background. In other cases, Grok 4 referenced Musk's stance directly in its answer.

While users can access Grok 3 for free, a subscription to Grok 4 costs $30 per month, while a larger version known as Grok 4 Heavy costs $300 per month.

In other cases, Grok referenced Musk's stance directly in its answer. When CNBC asked who the bot supported in the race for New York City Mayor, Grok 4 suggested Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, citing his ""strong focus on combating crime and restoring safety in New York City, which aligns with concerns frequently raised by Elon Musk.""

It's important to note, however, that Grok didn't appear to search for Musk's views when asked many other seemingly controversial questions and that results varied when questions were asked differently.

XAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Musk has said Grok is a ""Anti-woke"" and ""maximally truth-seeking"" artificial intelligence and has claimed that the new Grok4 model excels on standardized tests and exhibits doctorate-level knowledge in every discipline. 

Its launch comes just days after a major controversy regarding the Grok 3 chatbot, which is integrated with the social media site X. 

The AI had begun generating a series of antisemitic comments in response to questions from users, including those that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler. 

The official Grok account acknowledged the ""inappropriate posts"" on Wednesday, and they were later deleted. The company added that it had taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. 

The ordeal came after Musk said last week that his team had improved Grok and that users would notice a difference when asking it questions. 

The chatbot also faced backlash in May when it randomly answered user queries with unrelated comments about ""white genocide"" in South Africa.

Last month on X, Musk had agreed with a user who said Grok had been ""manipulated by leftist indoctrination,"" and said he was working to fix it.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unloaded roughly $36.4 million worth of stock in the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The sale, which totals 225,000 shares, comes as part of Huang's previously adopted plan in March to unload up to six million shares of Nvidia through the end of the year. He sold his first batch of stock from the agreement in June, equaling about $15 million.

Last year, the tech executive sold about $700 million worth of shares as part of a prearranged plan. Nvidia stock climbed about 1% Friday.

Huang's net worth has skyrocketed as investors bet on Nvidia's AI dominance and graphics processing units powering large language models.

The 62-year-old's wealth has grown by more than a quarter, or about $29 billion, since the start of 2025 alone, based on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. His net worth last stood at $143 billion in the index, putting him neck-and-neck with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett at $144 billion.

Shortly after the market opened Friday, Fortune's analysis of net worth had Huang ahead of Buffett, with the Nvidia CEO at $143.7 billion and the Oracle of Omaha at $142.1 billion.

The company has also achieved its own notable milestones this year, as it prospers off the AI boom.

On Wednesday, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker became the first company to top a $4 trillion market capitalization, beating out both Microsoft and Apple. The chipmaker closed above that milestone Thursday as CNBC reported that the technology titan met with President Donald Trump.

Brooke Seawell, venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, sold about $24 million worth of Nvidia shares, according to an SEC filing. Seawell has been on the company's board since 1997, according to the company.

Huang still holds more than 858 million shares of Nvidia, both directly and indirectly, in different partnerships and trusts.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields moved higher on Friday as President Donald Trump slapped 35% tariffs on Canada and investors digested a week of trade drama.

The 10-year Treasury yield was up 7 basis points to 4.419%, and the 30-year yield was up 9 basis points at 4.953%. The 2-year yield was higher by 3 basis points, reaching 3.898%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Trump announced on Thursday that levies on Canadian imports will rise to 35% on Aug. 1.

""Instead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,"" Trump said in a letter to Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, posted on Truth Social.

He also attributed the reason for the high rate to fentanyl: ""If Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter.""

Trump then said to NBC News he was planning blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on remaining countries. This is higher than the current 10% standard that investors have grown comfortable with.

This news comes after Trump imposed 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil as well as 50% tariffs on copper.

The president told NBC News' Kristen Welker late Thursday that Canada and the European Union may receive letters outlining the latest tariff proposals as soon as today.

The pharmaceutical industry is scrambling with scenario planning as U.S. President Donald Trump's 200% tariff proposal threatens to drive up drug prices and rip out corporate profit margins.

The president once again warned on Tuesday that long-awaited industry-wide tariffs would be announced ""very soon"" after the administration launched a so-called 232 investigation into the sector in April.

Trump suggested that those levies would not go into effect immediately, but get a grace period of ""about a year, year and a half to come in.""

Analysts nevertheless warn that such a rate — even with a delay — will have a detrimental effect on drug prices and profit margins.

""A 200% tariff would inflate production costs, compress profit margins, and risk supply chain disruptions, leading to drug shortages and higher prices for U.S. consumers,"" Barclays wrote in a note Wednesday.

UBS analysts cited a ""significant negative impact"" on margins, where goods are manufactured outside of the U.S. Meanwhile, the hit for patients could be ""disastrous,"" Afsaneh Beschloss, founder and CEO of investment firm RockCreek Group said Tuesday, in reference to an estimated 100% levy.

""That would be potentially disastrous for every person because we need those pharmaceuticals, and it takes those companies a long time to produce them here in the U.S.,"" Beschloss told CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

It is estimated that a tariff of just 25% on pharmaceutical imports would drive up U.S. drug prices by almost $51 billion annually, increasing domestic prices by as much as 12.9% if passed on, according to research from industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which on Wednesday lambasted the president's proposals as ""counterproductive"" to health outcomes.

Pharmaceutical products have typically been excluded from trade tariffs due to their critical nature. However, Trump has repeatedly targeted the industry for what he deems unfair pricing practices, and has urged firms to reshore manufacturing to the U.S.

In response, global pharma firms — including Novartis, Sanofi and Roche and U.S.-headquartered Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson — have made commitments to invest large sums in the U.S.

UBS dubbed the administration's tariff grace period of 12 to 18 months as ""insufficient time"" for firms to relocate their manufacturing stateside.

""We would usually think of 4 to 5 years as the timeline to move commercial scale manufacturing to a new site,"" the analysts wrote.

The industry is now awaiting further details at the end of this month, when the final Section 232 investigation report is due. But in the meantime, firms have little choice but to plan for various potential outcomes.

A Roche spokesperson said the company was ""monitoring the situation closely"" and engaging with stakeholders to ""advocate for policies that address barriers to patient access"" and create ""a more equitable and affordable healthcare ecosystem.""

The Swiss pharmaceutical giant had previously said that Trump's drug pricing order could jeopardize its U.S. investment. However, it noted Wednesday that its proposed funding will allow it to continue building out its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.

Bayer similarly said that it was monitoring the ""various tariff announcements"" and that it was focused on securing its supply chains and ""minimizing any potential impact.""

Novartis, meanwhile, said that it continues to work with the U.S. administration and trade association partners, and that it had ""no changes"" to its planned U.S. investment.

AstraZeneca and Sanofi did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, while Novo Nordisk declined to comment during its pre-earnings quiet period.

The pharmaceutical industry had previously sought a sector-wide carve-out from tariffs. But as those hopes have faded, attention is now turning to prospective trade deals as a potential buffer.

The U.S.-U.K. trade deal announced last month, while sparse, states that both sides will negotiate ""preferential treatment outcomes for U.K. pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients contingent on the findings of a Section 232 investigation.""

Pharma firms in Switzerland and the European Union could be aiming for similar carve-outs in their prospective deals. Yet, without clarity soon, question marks for companies and consumers remain.

""The longer this uncertainty reigns over which sectors are going to be affected and which aren't, it's going to have a continuous negative impact,"" Bert Colijn, chief economist at ING, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Wednesday.

This is CNBC's was blog covering European markets.

European stock markets have given up some of their recent gains by tumbling on the last trading day of the week, while waiting on an expected EU tariff letter from White House.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 1.1%. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were both lower by around 0.9%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 lost 0.4% of its value.

Some of the positive stock market moves this week came in the wake of the release of the Federal Reserve's June meeting minutes, which showed willingness by a majority of policymakers to cut interest rates this year. 

But according to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, there remains a greater risk that interest rates will instead need to be hiked again than most people believe.

""The market is pricing a 20% chance [of a rate hike], I would price in a 40-50% chance. I would put that as a cause for concern,"" Dimon told an event at Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, arguing that there is a significant possibility of inflation becoming problematic again for the U.S.

Market optimism that drove record highs for U.K. and Wall Street stocks on Thursday showed signs of fading, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index down nearly 1% at midday in London, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures falling 0.7%.

Gains this week have come despite a slew of tariff announcements that might previously have shaken markets, including 25% duties on trading partners including Japan, a 50% rate on Brazil, and a higher-than-expected 50% rate on all copper imports.

News overnight of the U.S. slapping 35% tariffs on Canada, along with the lack of updates on an EU-U.S. framework agreement — with a letter expected to be delivered to the EU from the White House on Friday — appear to have turned the tide.

""Whether this is investors being reminded of headwinds or simply pausing for breath, it's clear that uncertainty will prevail well into the summer,"" Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said in a note.

Coatsworth added that next week's focus is set to shift to earnings — kicked off by the U.S. big banks — providing a key insight into how companies are grappling with global uncertainty.

China's demand for petrol and diesel is falling as electric vehicle sales surge, but the trend is being masked by the country's massive strategic stockpiling of crude oil, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.

The agency noted that Chinese demand for transport fuels has declined for three consecutive months. This coincides with a 50% year-on-year jump in EV sales in the first half of 2025, which is directly ""eating into end-user demand,"" Toril Bosoni, head of oil industry and markets division at the IEA, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.

Despite this, China's crude inventories swelled by 80 million barrels in the second quarter, absorbing a global supply glut, according to the agency. 

""Chinese companies taking a more strategic role and boosting reserves for energy security reasons,"" Bosoni added.

Shares of Britain's BP rose 2% in mid-morning deals following the oil giant's trading update.

Analysts at Citi and JPMorgan both welcomed the trading statement, with the latter saying the announcement screens at the stronger end, when compared to an ""indifferent"" set of peer updates to date.

""Finally some encouraging news from BP, with a 2Q25 outlook statement that should reverse the swath of negative revisions that consensus has made in recent weeks,"" Citi analyst Alastair Syme said in a research note.

""We make minor adjustments to our estimates, last published back in May, but still sit c.15-20% above where consensus has moved to in recent weeks,"" Syme said.

CNBC's Sam Meredith has been reporting from the Norwegian capital Oslo this week, where strong Tesla sales are defying a wider European slump.

Check out his findings on why the Scandinavian country has emerged as a rare bright spot for the U.S. electric vehicle maker.

In corporate news this morning, Italian luxury clothes maker Cucinelli posted a 10.7% increase in first half revenues, broadly in line with forecasts. Sales rose double digits in America and Asia, while the group confirmed its expectations for annual sales growth of about 10% this year and next. 

Shares were around 0.1% lower in early deals.

The U.K. meanwhile said it will pump 163 million euros ($190.5 million) into satellite operator Eutelsat, an aspiring rival to Elon Musk's Starlink. European governments view Eutelsat as a way to increase sovereign space capabilities and reduce European reliance on U.S. firms for satellite communications and defence. 

The investment will allow the U.K. to maintain its stake when France makes a planned 750 million euro cash injection later this year, and brings the total recapitalisation 1.5 billion euros.

Sterling is trading lower after the U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank in May. The British pound was 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar at $1.35 and 0.1% lower against the euro at 8:47 a.m. in London.

Some economists say the weak growth figures mean the Bank of England is now more likely to cut interest rates in August. Capital Economics' Chief U.K. Economist Paul Dales forecast that U.K. GDP would rise by a ""fairly subdued"" 1% this year ""due to the lingering drags from a weakening global economy and the rises in domestic taxes for UK businesses.""

Sentiment has clearly soured in Europe after four days of solid gains, with all Stoxx 600 sectors except oil and gas and insurance opening in the red on Friday. The regional index was 0.46% lower at 8:10 a.m. in London.

News of 35% U.S. tariffs set to be slapped on Canada from the start of August, along with the White House's 50% duty on all copper imports, may have reignited some concerns around global growth. 

Investors had largely brushed off a slew of tariff announcements this week, sending the U.K.'s FTSE 100 as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs.

The big question now is what rate the European Union is facing, after weeks of negotiations over a framework trade deal. President Donald Trump indicated last night that the EU would receive a letter setting out its tariffs today.

British oil major BP on Friday flagged lower oil and gas sales in the second quarter and an after-tax impairment of up to $1.5 billion across its portfolio.

In a trading update released ahead of full second-quarter results on Aug. 5, the energy company said its gas and low-carbon sales will hit earnings by between $100 million and $300 million over the April-June stretch, also noting ""average"" results from the company's gas trading arm.

Lower oil sales will meanwhile deliver a blow of between $600 million to $800 million over the period.

The firm said second-quarter results will also see ""post-tax adjusting items relating to asset impairments in the range of $0.5 to 1.5 billion, attributable across the segments.""

In the oil products segment, BP said stronger realized refining margins would be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, and that ""oil trading result is expected to be strong.""

The company also said its second-quarter upstream production is now expected to be higher than in the previous three-month period. 

BP has been struggling to recalibrate its strategic direction amid underperformance in its share price compared with oil and gas peers, particularly in the U.S. Speculation has been mounting in recent months over whether the company could become an acquisition target.

The U.K. shrank 0.1% in May, a second monthly contraction, according to figures just out from the Office for National Statistics. 

That's below the 0.1% expansion forecast by economists polled by Reuters, and will do little to shake off expectations for U.K. growth to be muted in the second half of the year.

— Jenni Reid

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index notched a fourth daily gain on Thursday, but IG futures are pointing to a broadly negative open for major bourses on Friday.

The big news overnight is that U.S. President Donald Trump will lift tariffs on imports from Canada to 35% from Aug. 1, and warned that the duty might be increased if Ottawa retaliates. The rate is separate from sectoral tariffs placed on steel, aluminum and autos, and shortly copper.

Investors are also standing by in anticipation of the release of a letter from Trump in which he is expected to outline tariffs the European Union will face, after he told NBC News that he would be issuing tariffs ""over the next couple of hours"" to both the EU and Canada.

OSLO, Norway — Tesla continues to find solace in Norway, defying a sustained European slump amid a backlash over CEO Elon Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.

The U.S. electric vehicle maker recorded a 54% year-on-year jump in new car sales in Norway in June, according to data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV), fueled by a 115.3% yearly increase in registrations for its revamped Model Y sports utility vehicle.

The data backed up a whopping 213% increase in new car sales in May and shored up Tesla's dominant position in the world's most EV-friendly country.

Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association (NEVA), which represents electric car owners in the country, said Tesla has been well established in Norway for several years — but the popularity of its upgraded Model Y is ""definitely part of the reason"" for its recent sales boost.

""In general terms, I think it just has to do with the fact that they deliver a car which has quite a lot of value for money and is what Norwegians need,"" Bu told CNBC during an interview at NEVA's office in Oslo.

The Tesla Model Y appears to be especially popular in Norway because of its competitive price and the fact that it meets local demand for large luggage space, high-ground clearance, all-wheel drive and a tow hitch, Bu said.

Sales data from southern Europe signaled some further green shoots for Musk's company, with Tesla new car registrations last month increasing by 61% in Spain and around 7% in Portugal.

The story remains very different across the rest of Europe, however. Tesla sales in Germany, Europe's largest automotive hub, dropped by 60% in June from a year earlier, while sales also dipped in France.

Separate data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA, found Tesla's new car sales in Europe fell for a fifth straight month in May.

Tesla's brand value has been declining since 2024 in part because of Musk's political activity.

The Tesla CEO, who spent nearly $300 million to support Donald Trump's election campaign, recently left the White House after leading an initiative to slash federal agencies. Protests erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe in response to Musk's role in the Trump administration.

Musk's departure from the White House in late May was followed by an extraordinary war of words with Trump. The world's richest man also formally endorsed Germany's far-right party AfD ahead of the country's parliamentary elections earlier this year, triggering an outcry in Berlin.

NEVA's Bu told CNBC that Musk's political activity hadn't gone unnoticed in Norway, with a recent annual survey of more than 15,000 EV drivers finding that 43% of respondents said they would not buy a Tesla for political reasons.

""So, this has definitely been a big debate in Norway as well. What Elon Musk has been saying and doing the last year or so — so it definitely affects people, but not too many because their market share is remarkable really,"" Bu said.

For its part, Norway has long been recognized as a global leader in sustainable transportation. Indeed, it is currently on track to become the first country in the world to effectively erase gasoline and diesel cars from its new car market.

Lawmakers and analysts have attributed the country's shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to long-term and consistent policies designed to support the uptake of EVs.

""I think it's a combination of several things, but it is policymaking that has driven this forward,"" Norway's Deputy Transport Minister Cecilie Knibe Kroglund told CNBC in Oslo.

""We have a lot of incentives, both tax incentives and user incentives are the most important things and also infrastructure, of course. But policymaking and incentives are the main tools that we have been using,"" she added.

Some of Norway's EV incentives include a VAT exemption, discounts on road and parking taxes and access to bus lanes. The government has also heavily invested in public charging infrastructure, and many Norwegian households are able to charge their cars at home.

In this article

More than a year before ""F1: The Movie"" would eventually hit theaters, Apple struck a deal with IMAX.

The studio secured the use of IMAX's camera technology as well as a three-week release in its theaters, a partnership that helped the film generate nearly $300 million globally in its first 10 days in cinemas.

More than 20% of that haul came from IMAX screenings. In the U.S. and Canada, the company's theaters have accounted for 25% of all domestic ticket sales for the film. That feat is made even more impressive by the fact that IMAX screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.

Two other films released this year have exceeded 20% market share for the company — Warner Bros.' ""Sinners"" and Paramount's ""Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.""

It's a sign of strength for IMAX's place in the rapidly evolving film industry.

IMAX has long been a coveted destination for theatrical releases, but as consumer tastes continue to shift toward premium experiences, it's quickly gaining market share and poised for exponential growth in the coming years.

CEO Rich Gelfond is forecasting a $1.2 billion year at the global box for the company, which would be 33% higher than 2024's haul and a record for the 55-year-old business. Wall Street analysts expect 2026 will be even better.

""Post-pandemic a lot of activities, especially event activities, have really done well [for] premium brands,"" Gelfond told CNBC. ""You look at concerts, ticket prices went up. Premium seats have gone up. You look at sporting events, same kind of thing. Broadway. I think people, although they enjoy staying at home, streaming and watching streaming products, when they go out of the home, they want something sufficient distinguished from that.""

Investors have rallied behind IMAX stock. Shares of the company are up roughly 60% in the last 12 months.

IMAX screens are notably larger than standard movie screens and the theaters feature immersive audio systems. The company doesn't just screen movies, many of the films that appear in IMAX were shot using cameras and technology developed by the company specifically tailored to the IMAX viewing experience.

""This year, we have eight movies in a row in North America that were filmed with IMAX cameras, and typically the box office goes higher when you shoot with the cameras,"" Gelfond said. ""And there's a couple reasons for that. One, it's a better way of watching it and listening to it. But also, the filmmakers typically get behind it more, and they tell their audiences that it's the best way to see their work. And I think that's a powerful impetus for audiences to go to IMAX.""

These ""filmed for IMAX"" titles include features like Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer,"" Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" films and even the latest ""Mission: Impossible"" flick from Tom Cruise.

Tickets to see a film in IMAX typically cost a few dollars more than standard movie tickets, which can help to boost a box office haul.

""The more 'filmed for IMAX' titles, the more outperformance you seen on the film for IMAX titles,"" said Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush. ""The better the margins are going to be. As you see margins improve in 2025, you're going to see not just better quality title signings in 2026, but what I expect to see is that the studios will take more ownership of the marketing campaigns with even greater upside.""

Roth's Eric Handler said that IMAX has a ""high-class problem of too much content availability.""

The ""F1"" deal for three weeks of screen programming meant that Universal's ""Jurassic World Rebirth"" got edged out: the film missed out on a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month.

Domestically, the movie slate is strong is 2025 and 2026, with a number of major franchise film releases on the books. Warner Bros.' ""Superman"" hits theaters Friday, and coming soon is Disney and Marvel's ""Fantastic Four: First Steps."" Then Universal's ""Wicked: For Good"" arrives ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday and Disney's ""Avatar: Fire and Ash"" hits theaters just before Christmas.

2026 kicks off with Amazon's ""Project Hail Mary"" and will also feature a new Avengers film, the first theatrical Star Wars release since 2019, a sequel to ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" a live-action ""Moana"" as well as ""Toy Story 5"" and ""Shrek 5."" And also in the mix is Nolan's next feature film ""The Odyssey.""

New Hollywood releases are just one piece of IMAX's box office success.

""Not only are they benefiting from Hollywood's recovery, they're also taking advantage of the global footprint and showing local language movies in China, in Japan and South Korea and parts of Europe,"" said Eric Handler, analyst at Roth.

He noted that ""Ne Zha 2,"" a Chinese release that has generated more than $2 billion in global ticket sales, was a particularly strong local language film for IMAX. The company generated nearly $170 million in receipts from screening the film.

And there's still room for IMAX to grow.

The company currently has around 1,700 screens worldwide, around 400 of which are in North America. Gelfond told CNBC that the company has contracts to build about 500 more IMAX screens.

He said the company would share more specific details during its earnings report, which is due to be released later this month.

""We signed almost as many new theaters this year as we signed for the whole year last year,"" Gelfond said. ""So there's a lot of growth.""

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) vaulted to a fresh all-time high Friday, breaking above $118,000 amid a wave of bullish momentum across risk assets.

The token's price action coincides with AI giant Nvidia's (NVDA) surge to a $4 trillion valuation, highlighting crypto's tie with tech. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hit a fresh record on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was headed that way on Thursday.

""Historically, Bitcoin has remained highly correlated with tech stocks, and this correlation is still playing out,"" Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of the Coin Bureau, wrote on Thursday morning.

Year to date, the token is up roughly 21%, buoyed in part by crypto-friendly policies from the Trump administration, including the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve and a broader digital asset stockpile.

Over the past two months, bitcoin has traded within a tight $10,000 range — an unusually stable period given its historical volatility.

""At the heart of this rally lies sustained structural inflows from institutional players,"" wrote Dilin Wu, research strategist at Pepperstone.

""Corporates are also ramping up participation,"" he added. The analyst noted companies like Strategy (MSTR) and GameStop (GME) have continued to add bitcoin to their balance sheets. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) this week also filed for approval to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF”, which would include about 70% of its holdings in bitcoin.

The timing of bitcoin's breakout also comes days before Congress kicks off its highly anticipated ""Crypto Week"" on July 14. Lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the industry's regulatory framework.

""A favorable outcome could accelerate institutional inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as a macro asset and strengthening confidence in compliant crypto platforms,"" said Jesse Jarvis, CEO of Kaiko AI.

The GENIUS Act is among the regulations the House will consider. The bill, which recently passed through the Senate, proposes a federal framework for stablecoins.

Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of stablecoin USDC (USDC-USD), were up roughly 2% on Thursday. The stock is up more than 500% from its June 5 IPO.

Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) were also higher during Thursday's session.

Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, surpassing $118,000 as a flood of money moves into spot bitcoin ETFs, which have opened up cryptocurrency investing to millions

Bitcoin has reached an all-time high, surpassing $118,000 as a flood of money moves into spot bitcoin ETFs, which have opened up cryptocurrency investing to millions.

A soft U.S. dollar and the digital currency friendliness of President Donald Trump's administration has also helped to push the price of bitcoin to unprecedented levels recently.

Last month the Senate passed legislation that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what the industry hopes will be a wave of bills to bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.

The fast-moving legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle in which the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.

Known as the GENIUS Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The acronym stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” 

Next week the House of Representatives will be considering the GENIUS Act as part of Congress' efforts to strengthen the country's crypto position.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Wall Street is using its Bitcoin playbook to take a big risk on Ethereum","https://nypost.com/2025/07/11/business/wall-street-is-using-its-bitcoin-playbook-to-bet-on-ethereum/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Inspired by the success of businesses like MicroStrategy, which has seen its stock surge more than 3,000% since it pivoted to buying Bitcoin instead of developing software, other publicly traded companies are now betting on an even more volatile cryptocurrency: Ethereum.

And some taking the risky move are saying it's a “Chat GPT moment for crypto” — because they believe the product is going to become ubiquitous and highly valued in just a few months.

“Ethereum, to me, is really gonna be where Wall Street meets crypto,” Tom Lee of BitMine Immersion Technologies told me.

Lee joined BitMine Immersion Technologies last week as chairman following the company's rebrand from a Bitcoin mining company to a focus on acquiring what they believe is the real gold, Ethereum.

And if the stock price is any indication, it seems to be working. Since announcing its pivot to Ethereum, BitMine Immersion Technologies' stock climbed 25%. Bit Digital, a publicly traded company that previously focused on computing infrastructure and, at one point Bitcoin mining, saw its shares surge nearly 30% after announcing it was moving to an Ethereum treasury management and staking strategy.

Likewise, SharpLink Gaming, a former sports betting and online casino marketing company, saw its stock surge over 400% after announcing a shift to an Ethereum treasury strategy in May 2025, though it has since experienced significant volatility.

Other companies, including the crypto exchange Coinbase and fin-tech companies Exodus Movement and Mogo, have also acquired Ethereum and begun holding it on their balance sheets.

Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency focused on secure, peer-to-peer transactions without supporting complex apps, Ethereum is a high-tech blockchain platform powering apps, smart contracts and its currency, Ether. 

It enables three key features: staking, or locking up Ether to secure the network and earn rewards, similar to interest on savings; stablecoins, or Ether-based coins pegged to $1 for stable transactions or savings; and NFTs, which are unique digital assets, like a one-of-a-kind Pokémon card, stored on Ethereum to prove ownership.

Large wealth managers restricted by SEC rules from buying crypto can invest in companies holding Ethereum to gain exposure to both the cryptocurrency and its technology, which supports stablecoins, staking and decentralized finance applications.

“Ethereum offers something unique: It's a productive asset,” Mara Schmiedt, the CEO and co-founder of Alluvia, told me. “Staking delivers a 3%+ baseline yield … forward-looking companies aren't just holding ETH, they're integrating it into how they generate yield, manage capital and future-proof their businesses.” 

And following the June IPO of Circle — the most successful stablecoin company of the last five years — this is big business. 

Lorien Gabel, the co-founder and CEO of Figment, the largest global staking infrastructure provider, told me staking is emerging as “the center of global banking for digital assets.” 

“Protocol staking enables institutions to earn rewards,” he explained. “For traditional finance investors like asset managers, staking represents a compliant, reward-generating strategy that provides direct exposure to the economic activity of decentralized systems.” 

Schmiedt said she is working with Galaxy Digital to launch staking financial products — basically a bundled-up and traded staking program, similar to a mortgage-backed security. 

And for Wall Street, which loves complex financial tools (derivatives, anyone?), this could be a whole new world. 

“We're in the early innings of a treasury strategy evolution for public and private companies,” Schmiedt said. “Companies like SharpLink, Bit Digital and BitMine are signaling that institutional narratives around Ethereum are maturing. Ethereum and staking are quickly becoming new tools for shareholder value creation in an on-chain financial system for corporate treasuries and beyond.” 

This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC's power players (and those who aspire to be).

Of course, the sheer number of companies that are jumping on this bandwagon feels vaguely reminiscent of the blockchain craze, when Long Island Iced Tea rebranded to Long Blockchain Corp. and saw its stock surge 200%. Or when little-known, publicly traded companies with the phrase “AI” in their names, like BigBearAI and C3.ai, saw stock surge shortly after the introduction of ChatGPT. 

But Ethereum enthusiasts believe the crypto is a good bet both because of its inherent value and because of the rewards it offers. And if the heavyweights who bought into BitMine are any indication, it has serious backers. 

“[The pivot to Ethereum] reflects the convergence that's taking place between traditional finance and crypto — where crypto, venture funds and traditional finance are meeting in the middle,” Lee added. “The mix of investors reflects that as well.” 

BitMine Immersion recently secured $250 million from prominent backers including Mozayyx Group (a discretionary macro hedge fund), Founders Fund, Pantera, Galaxy Digital, Falcon X, Kraken and Republic Digital, as well as traditional funds like Ockham Crest and Diametric Capital.

The Ethereum Foundation has sold 10,000 ether (ETH) to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal worth $25.7 million, marking the first time a publicly listed company has directly acquired the token directly from the protocol's core steward.

The transaction was executed at an average price of $2,572.37 per ETH and settled on-chain via the foundation's multisig on July 10. Proceeds from the sale will be used to support EF's core activities.

0/ Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC.For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming.

SharpLink, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, described the purchase not as a trade, but as a “commitment to Ethereum's long-term mission.” The company is positioning ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset and said it plans to stake and restake the acquired ETH, effectively removing it from circulation.

“This isn't a trade — it's a commitment,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and a co-founder of Ethereum, said in a release. “SharpLink is acquiring, staking and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.'

“Moreover, we see this as the start of something bigger – a model for how mission-driven organizations can work to advance our ecosystem's shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment and protocol-native finance,” Lubin added.

The move comes at a time when ETH ETF inflows are building, ETH-denominated treasuries are re-emerging, and protocol-native finance is regaining attention.

ETH was trading above $3,000 as of U.S. morning hours Friday, up more than 8% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin's price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin's price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun.

Technical Factors Showing Fall Of Bitcoin Dominance

According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance reached a peak of exactly 66% on June 27, 2025, a date he calls significant for its esoteric code 434 and its occurrence on a new moon. From a technical perspective, the 66% mark coincided precisely with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a region many traders consider a reversal zone. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders.

 The analyst's post on the social media platform X features a few price charts to emphasize how the Bitcoin dominance might be fading, alongside nine factors. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The first factor is the most recent highest monthly RSI in the history of the Bitcoin dominance chart. This event has created an overbought condition, and the next outlook is a possible crash of the RSI. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory.

Furthermore, the histogram has turned negative, and the faster line has moved below the slower one, which is a classic signal of an impending downtrend. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. 

Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs

While the technical picture is deteriorating, the fundamentals are also stacking in favor of altcoins very quickly. The first fundamental factor is the importance of upcoming altcoin spot ETFs, which have the possibility to redirect institutional flows from Bitcoin into Ethereum, XRP, and others. 

ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin.

Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels.

The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. 

Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","What's Next for ETH, SOL, ADA, XRP as Bitcoin Set Fresh Record Above $118K?","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/11/whats-next-for-ether-solana-xrp-and-other-majors-as-bitcoin-clears-118k","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 07:00:40 GMT","

Bitcoin's (BTC) decisive break above $118,000 has flipped the risk-on switch for crypto markets, and traders are now watching if altcoins follow with similar momentum or get left behind in a BTC-dominant rally.

Historically, bitcoin breaking to new highs acts as a liquidity signal, pulling sidelined capital back into the market and eventually rotating into large-cap altcoins.

The market is already seeing early signs of that dispersion, with ether (ETH) is testing its year-to-date highs, Solana's SOL (SOL) reclaiming key levels above $160 and mid-cap tokens, such as Shiba Inu SHIB$0.0₄1371, Hyperliquid's HYPE HYPE$46.35 and Avalanche's AVAX (AVAX) seeing double-digit percentage increases in the past 24 hours.

“Bitcoin's break above its all-time high is a liquidity signal that could rotate flows into other major crypto assets,” Rick Maeda, Research Analyst at Presto Research, said in a note to CoinDesk. 

“Historically, when BTC sets a new high, it tends to propagate liquidity across the broader market. We're already seeing signs of capital rotating into large-cap altcoins like ETH, SOL, and XRP, driven by renewed retail momentum and institutional rebalancing. Overall, the BTC breakout marks a regime shift, and we expect altcoin dispersion to rise from here,” Maeda said.

Solana remains the high-beta major token to watch on its retail-accessible, and narrative-heavy fundamentals. User activity on Solana-native protocols and token launches (like the recent memecoin wave) continues to keep liquidity flowing, Maeda noted.

XRP XRP$2.7748, often driven more by sentiment and speculative catalysts than fundamentals, is seeing fresh inflows as traders revisit legal clarity and historical correlations. With BTC volatility cooling, XRP and Cardano's ADA (ADA) tend to benefit from follow-through risk rotation.

Ethereum continues to benefit from a spike in ETF inflows and the broader expectation of institutional rebalancing. With spot ETH products gaining traction and L2 activity rebounding, it remains the most obvious beneficiary in a rising tide.

Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk. that “ETH could reclaim $3,200 soon,” with SOL “very easily returning to the $200 mark.”

“However this time around it looks like the market across the board is being uplifted. We can see major tokens such as SOL ETH, and XRP retracing their paths back to highs reached earlier in January,” Mei noted.

That view was echoed by Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research: “As bitcoin hits a new all-time high at around $116k, altcoins are lining up to ride the bullish wave, with Ethereum ETF inflows hitting new volume highs while U.S. regulators removed a crypto broker tax rule, paving the way for DeFi to expand further.”

“Other blue-chip coins, including SOL and XRP, look to surge higher once Bitcoin volatility calms down and finds a new supporting price range,” Ruck said.

NuCana Announces Plan to Implement ADS Ratio Change

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) has announced a significant milestone in its planned business combination with One Blockchain LLC. The company has confidentially submitted a draft Form S-4 registration statement to the SEC, which includes a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement.

One Blockchain, a digital infrastructure developer focused on Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing, operates a 40 MW data center facility in South Carolina. In 2024, this facility generated $26.8 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income.

The business combination, initially announced on May 28, 2025, is subject to various conditions, including Signing Day Sports stockholder approval and NYSE American listing approval for BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's common shares.

La fusione, annunciata inizialmente il 28 maggio 2025, è soggetta a diverse condizioni, tra cui l'approvazione degli azionisti di Signing Day Sports e l'approvazione della quotazione NYSE American per le azioni ordinarie di BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

Die ursprünglich am 28. Mai 2025 angekündigte Unternehmenszusammenführung unterliegt verschiedenen Bedingungen, darunter die Zustimmung der Aktionäre von Signing Day Sports und die NYSE American-Notierungsfreigabe für die Stammaktien von BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure.

Signing Day Sports advances its merger with One Blockchain, marking key progress with S-4 SEC filing for the Bitcoin mining pivot.

Signing Day Sports' announcement regarding the confidential submission of an S-4 registration statement represents significant progress in its planned business combination with One Blockchain LLC. This merger would fundamentally transform the company from a sports recruitment platform into a cryptocurrency mining operation.

The S-4 filing is a crucial procedural milestone that contains the preliminary prospectus and proxy statement necessary for shareholder approval. While the draft remains confidential at this stage, its submission indicates the deal structure has been formalized and the regulatory review process has begun.

One Blockchain's credentials are substantial - their 40 MW South Carolina data center generated approximately $26.8 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income in 2024, representing a healthy 21% profit margin in the volatile Bitcoin mining sector. This financial performance demonstrates operational efficiency despite cryptocurrency market fluctuations.

This transaction appears to be a reverse merger strategy where One Blockchain gains public market access through Signing Day Sports' NYSE American listing. The newly created entity, BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc., will likely retain One Blockchain's management and operational focus while leveraging the public listing status.

The merger still faces significant hurdles, including shareholder approval and NYSE American listing authorization for the new entity. The extensive legal disclaimers suggest regulatory scrutiny will be thorough given the cryptocurrency industry's evolving regulatory landscape.

Oops, something went wrong

Financial services company Robinhood (HOOD) has rolled out an expansion of its crypto and investing services, offering European users access to tokenised US stocks and giving Americans the chance to earn rewards by staking cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) and solana (SOL-USD).

Read more: Crypto live prices

The move marks a pivotal moment for the fintech company as it looks to merge the fast-evolving world of blockchain with traditional finance.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Robinhood crypto senior vice president and general manager Johann Kerbrat explained how the platform is leveraging blockchain technology to overhaul outdated systems and offer investors something different.

At the heart of Robinhood's European expansion is the launch of tokenised US stocks and ETFs, digital representations of real equities issued on the blockchain.

These “stock tokens” allow users across 31 European countries to trade more than 200 US stocks and ETFs, including heavyweights like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA), without paying any commission or spread fees. Robinhood applies a 0.10% foreign exchange fee.

""Right now, what we're launching in Europe is that EU customer will have access to 200 plus US stocks and ETF tokens, and the stock token holder will also be able to receive dividends directly into their app,"" Kerbrat said.

It means European users can gain exposure to the US market, something that can be expensive due to regulatory barriers and foreign exchange costs, while also receiving dividend payouts like traditional shareholders.

While the tokenised shares are synthetic representations backed by financial instruments, the user experience is nearly indistinguishable from trading traditional stocks. ""It's less about trading a crypto product. It's more about using the benefit of crypto to get the improvement through it,"" Kerbrat said.

Tokenisation, converting real-world assets into digital tokens that live on a blockchain, has been hailed as one of crypto's most promising innovations. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink recently called it the “next generation for markets.”

For Robinhood, tokenising stocks isn't just about tech hype, it's about efficiency gains.

""We've been vocal about the fact that we believe the traditional finance system is a bit outdated, and doesn't match how people are using products now, nowadays,"" said Kerbrat. ""We think the blockchain will actually improve efficiencies, reduce time to wait, reduce fees and cost for the customer.""

The benefits? Lower fees, faster settlement times, and eventually, the potential for 24/7 trading. ""You can imagine a world where people can self custody the asset, they can trade them on defi, 24/7,"" Kerbrat said. ""So I think for us it's a it's a key moment in the financial system, and we'll be able to really build on top of that.""

To support this new tokenised financial world, Robinhood is building its own Layer 2 blockchain, powered by Ethereum and based on the Arbitrum stack.

Layer 2 blockchains are built on top of existing blockchain networks like Ethereum to boost speed and scalability while lowering transaction costs.

Robinhood's in-house chain will eventually become the infrastructure behind its tokenised stock platform, enabling features like 24/7 trading, seamless bridging of assets, and self-custody for users.

""We're already excited to build our own Robinhood layer two blockchain. It's going to be built on top of Ethereum using the Arbitrum stack,"" said Kerbrat. ""We want the blockchain to be optimised for tokenised real world assets, you know, to have built in support for 24/7 trading, bridging, self custody, all the things that really matter for customers.""

While European users get access to tokenised stocks and crypto perpetual futures, American users are now being offered something long-requested — crypto staking. Starting with ethereum and solana, US customers can now stake their assets directly in the Robinhood app.

Staking allows users to contribute to the security of blockchain networks in return for earning rewards, sort of like earning interest for locking up your crypto.

""So really, what it means for staking is you are contributing to the network, not just to trade the assets, but also to help secure the network, and all the assets that are staked are used to validate the transaction,"" said Kerbrat.

""When the customer will be staking their assets, they will be able to see directly the reward estimated for the period of time. And on a regular basis, they will receive a new reward, and they can decide to invest with it, or just to stake them again.""

The move comes as discussions heat up around whether ethereum staking should be allowed in spot ETFs. While regulators debate, Robinhood is already rolling out staking in a user-friendly interface designed to demystify the process.

Robinhood is also offering crypto perpetual futures to users in the EU, a first for the company. This new feature lets experienced traders make bigger bets on the price of cryptocurrencies by using leverage, meaning they can trade with more money than they actually have.

These trades are handled through the Bitstamp exchange, but Robinhood has designed a user-friendly interface to make things like leverage and risk easier to manage.

Kerbrat emphasised that despite the blockchain complexity behind the scenes, the interface remains clean and accessible for both tokenised stocks and traditionally traded equities.

""When you're going to use the app, if you're a user from New York or a user from the EU, it will really look similar, except that on the EU app, it will tell you at the top that this is a token, and if you tap on it will give you all the explanation about the differences, but the actual trading experience will be really similar,"" Kerbrat said.

State development bank NRW.BANK has issued its first digital bond, a two-year €100 million issuance on the Polygon blockchain. The bond is a ‘crypto security' under Germany's Electronic Securities Act (eWpG), which means it used a crypto registrar Cashlink rather than a central securities depository.

Deutsche Bank, DZ BANK and DekaBank acted as joint lead managers, with the issuance attracting strong interest from institutional investors. Yesterday the BIS published a bulletin on blockchain-based government bonds, finding that they attract tighter bid-ask spreads, indicating greater liquidity.

Cashlink CEO Michael Duttlinger said that the latest issuance “shows the increasing trust in blockchain-based capital market infrastructure and reinforces our role as a key enabler for secure, compliant, and scalable tokenized financial instruments.” The company also observed that some institutions are progressing from one off pilots to fully integrate with blockchain technology.

NRW isn't the first German state bank to issue a digital bond, with KfW launching two last summer, for €100 million and €50 million. The second one used Germany's Trigger solution that links to the TARGET2 payment system to settle in central bank money. This was part of the ECB's wholesale DLT settlement trials. Both were on the Polygon blockchain and used Cashlink as the registrar. In addition to issuing bonds, KfW  also took the step of investing in blockchain based bonds, buying the mortgage bonds of state bank and LBBW subsidiary Berlin Hyp.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have transformed digital ownership by enabling the trade of unique assets through blockchain technology. From art and music to virtual real estate, these tokens have become central to the Web3 economy. Yet, this rapid innovation has outpaced security measures, leaving users vulnerable to sophisticated scams, technical exploits, and project failures. As NFTs grow in popularity and financial value, the consequences of security breaches have become increasingly severe. Due to these concerns, there is a critical need to systematically study the full scope of NFT security risks and create practical defenses against emerging threats.In a new study (DOI: 10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100268) published on June 25, 2025, in Blockchain: Research and Applications, researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Peking University unveil the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) on NFT security. By analyzing 248 security reports and 35 academic publications, the team identified and classified 176 NFT-related security incidents. Their work culminates in a multilayered NFT security reference framework that pinpoints the most common vulnerabilities, assesses detection challenges, and proposes a clear path forward for safeguarding the Web3 ecosystem.The researchers constructed a three-tier security model encompassing the contract layer, market layer, and auxiliary service layer. Within this framework, they uncovered 12 core types of threats—including smart contract bugs like reentrancy flaws and access control lapses, market manipulations such as wash trading and rug pulls, and infrastructure attacks like phishing, fake interfaces, and website exploits. These findings are grounded in real incidents, including high-profile cases where attackers stole millions by exploiting minting functions or deceived users through counterfeit tokens tied to celebrity names.The team also developed practical detection tools, such as transaction trace analysis for identifying reentrancy loops and symbolic execution to test logic vulnerabilities in minting functions. Alarmingly, they found that many real-world incidents—especially those involving phishing and front-end manipulation—remain underexplored in academic research. Their open-source dataset and security taxonomy now provide a foundational reference for future research, policy guidance, and secure development practices.""Despite the explosive growth of NFTs, the community has lacked a comprehensive understanding of where and how these systems fail,"" said Dr. Haoyu Wang, senior author of the study. ""Our work bridges this knowledge gap by not only exposing the root causes of major attacks but also offering developers and researchers the tools to detect and prevent them. This is a call to action—for academia and industry alike—to take NFT security seriously.""This pioneering research lays the groundwork for a more secure and resilient NFT ecosystem. Developers can now reference the proposed framework to preemptively address common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and marketplaces. Investors and collectors gain a better understanding of the warning signs associated with fraudulent projects. Perhaps most importantly, the study advocates for greater collaboration between cybersecurity researchers and blockchain practitioners to stay ahead of evolving threats. As NFTs continue to expand into finance, gaming, and identity, securing their foundations is essential to sustain innovation and build long-term public trust.

SEC reviews first NFT-memecoin ETF as Pudgy Penguins go mainstream – TOKEN6900 presale surges past $305K, riding the meme coin wave.

Key Takeaways:

Memes are knocking on Wall Street's front door. The SEC just acknowledged the first-ever ETF backed by NFTs and a Solana-based memecoin.

That's right, Pudgy Penguins, those adorable digital waddlers from the NFT world, are now helping shape regulated financial products.

Meanwhile, the meme coin mania is spilling into fresh territory, and TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is stealing the spotlight.

As the crypto space evolves, meme coins like $T6900 aren't just jokes anymore; they're becoming viable bets.

With over $305K already raised in presale, TOKEN6900 is drawing attention from early movers, just as the SEC's nod to $PENGU adds rocket fuel to the meme narrative.

In a rare move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially acknowledged the application for the Canary Spot $PENGU ETF.



It's not just another Bitcoin or Ethereum fund – this one is weirder, bolder, and somehow cuter.

The ETF would hold a mix of $PENGU, a Solana-based memecoin, and the wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFTs, with smaller slices of Solana and Ethereum tossed in for liquidity. If approved, it'll be the first ETF to include NFTs, period.

This isn't just about penguins in beanies. This is the line-blurring moment where Web3 culture merges with traditional finance.

Meme coins and NFTs are no longer the punchline – they're part of the portfolio. And that spells a big win for new crypto projects like TOKEN6900.

TOKEN6900 ($T6900) isn't trying to fix the economy – it's here to mock it. Think of it as the anti-S&P500 for people who know Wall Street is just cosplay with better suits.

There's no roadmap, no token utility, no fake governance. Just pure, unfiltered meme-fueled market chaos.



This token doesn't pretend to follow earnings reports or oil prices. It operates at the intersection of meme culture, market absurdity, and total mental collapse. It's not a joke – it's honest.

Where SPX6900 returned 57M percent in under two years, TOKEN6900 aims to do it faster – because why not? The formula's simple: weaponized nostalgia meets 2000s internet energy meets clipart dolphins and ‘69' jokes.

While the S&P 500 took a century to grow, TOKEN6900 skips the foreplay.

It's a token for the terminally online. Fair launch mechanics, no ability to mint new tokens, and 80% of the supply up for grabs during presale.

No AI nonsense, no fake partnerships, no whisper of utility.

Just the first ‘Non-Corrupt Token' (NCT) that doesn't dilute, doesn't lie, and doesn't even try to convince you it's anything other than what it is: collective delusion with better branding.

If that sounds unserious – good. In a world where every asset class is pretending to be something it's not, TOKEN6900 is the only one brave enough to do nothing at all.

Priced at just $0.006525 and already pulling in over $305K in presale, TOKEN6900 is gaining traction the only way a meme coin should – through chaos, conviction, and a community that speaks fluent sarcasm.



This isn't the token you'd explain at a finance dinner. It's the one you shill in a group chat while your 401k bleeds quietly in the background.

TOKEN6900 doesn't pretend to be safe. It admits it's a gamble, and that honesty is exactly what makes it irresistible.

And here's the kicker: With the SEC officially reviewing the PENGU NFT ETF, the spotlight is shifting to meme-driven assets.

TOKEN6900 is riding that same momentum, turning regulatory news into meme coin madness. Because if the penguins are waddling onto Wall Street, the dolphins can't be far behind.

With the SEC warming up to meme assets like $PENGU, the stage is set for $T6900 to become the next breakout star.

As the lines between culture and capital keep blurring, $T6900 might be the smartest dumb investment you make this year.

Social poker brand Devilfish.com has announced the complete sell-out of its Genesis Avatar NFT collection. The company said this milestone validates its approach to creating ""a player-centric brand, which applies a sweepstakes-membership style, free-to-play (F2P) model to poker.""

According to Devilfish.com, the success of the Genesis Mint signals ""a clear market appetite for players to be part of a brand and a new social movement,"" as against the real-money-first poker model, which the brand says has long struggled with high customer acquisition costs (CPAs) and a significant player churn rate. 

""By removing the initial financial barrier commitment from the player, Devilfish.com is building a vibrant and engaged community, attracting a diverse demographic of traditional poker players, gamers, and crypto natives,"" said the company.

This F2P, community-centric model is designed to address the industry's long-standing retention problem, where an estimated 85% of recreational players are long-term net losers, which may result in a poor player experience.

JJ Williams, CEO of Devilfish.com, commented: ""We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our Genesis collection, but we are not surprised. This is a powerful signal of how creating a brand-centric story to the industry that poker has a sustainability problem and that the solution lies within the community, not just in cash. 

""The industry has focused on a small segment of winning players while inadvertently punishing the vast majority who play for the love of the game. Our community platform model offers a welcoming, safe haven and a gamified environment that enables you to master the game without incurring a financial burden, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the era of responsible gambling requirements.""

Inspired by the growth of social and sweepstakes casinos, Devilfish.com seeks to position itself as ""a vital partner for the broader gaming industry."" For online operators, land-based casinos, and poker publishers, the platform promises a low-friction pathway to attract new demographics, build prospect databases, and re-engage lapsed players.

The Genesis Avatars represent a player's unique digital identity, which Devilfish touts as a significant component of its brand ecosystem, including membership. It grants holders access to exclusive benefits and a stake in the community's future.

The company stated that it will now focus on executing its roadmap, which includes expanding the platform's features and delivering the promised utility to its founding members.","{'href': 'https://www.yogonet.com', 'title': 'Yogonet'}","cryptocurrency"

Insights on Tech Law, Regulation & Policy, AI, IoT and More

On June 5, 2025, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) launched its new AI and biometrics strategy. The strategy aims to increase its scrutiny of AI and biometric technologies focusing on three priority situations, namely where: stakes are high; there is clear public concern for the technology; and regulatory clarity can provide immediate impact.

The ICO identified three areas of focus in its strategy:

The ICO's previous work

The ICO's new strategy builds on its previous work on both AI and biometric technologies. Past work includes, among other things: the ICO's AI Tools in recruitment audit outcomes report; its consultation series on Generative AI; and its guidance on AI and data protection (discussed in our previous blogpost here). The ICO has also published biometric data guidance and conducted various studies on the privacy implications of biometric technologies.

The ICO's strategy in more detail

The ICO has set out a “plan of action” to “ensure that organisations can develop and deploy AI and biometric technologies with confidence and that people are safeguarded from harm”. The plan touches on a wide range of AI regulatory issues and includes the following objectives:

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Solana's Pump.fun is preparing for the launch of its initial coin offering (ICO) on July 12, 2025, introducing the PUMP token to the Solana ecosystem. The ICO will offer 150 billion PUMP tokens at a price of $0.004 each, with trading expected to commence within 48 to 72 hours after the sale concludes. The token sale is restricted to exclude participants from the U.S. and U.K. due to regulatory constraints, and the tokens will be available on six major centralized exchanges—Bybit, Kraken, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate.io—as well as directly through Pump.fun's website.

Market sentiment surrounding the PUMP token launch is cautiously optimistic, with prediction markets like Myriad indicating a 70% likelihood of a sellout within the first hour. This rapid uptake, if realized, would position PUMP for trading as early as Monday, July 14. However, investors are advised to monitor pre-market activity, particularly on platforms such as Hyperliquid, which currently values PUMP at approximately $0.005426—reflecting a 35.65% premium over the ICO price.

Despite initial enthusiasm, some analysts express reservations about PUMP's short-term price trajectory. Daniel Seager, head analyst at Trireme Trading, highlights the token's challenging market share environment, noting that Pump.fun has recently ceded dominance to competitors like LetsBonk, which captured nearly 66% of daily token creation on Solana. Seager also points to the tokenomics structure, which includes a one-year cliff on private and team allocations, potentially mitigating immediate sell pressure but raising questions about long-term liquidity.

Conversely, pseudonymous investor Solarnius underscores the token's favorable lock-up terms and expresses bullish sentiment, signaling intent to make a significant investment despite the high fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion. Meanwhile, VC Beanie from GM Capital warns that the $4 billion valuation is “unprecedented” and forecasts downward price movement in both the short and long term. This divergence in expert opinion underscores the complexity of assessing PUMP's market potential amid evolving competitive dynamics and valuation metrics.

Since its January 2024 launch, Pump.fun has been the leading Solana launchpad, responsible for up to 99% of meme coin creations as recently as April. However, recent data from Dune Analytics reveals a significant shift, with LetsBonk overtaking Pump.fun in daily token creation share. This competitive pressure introduces uncertainty regarding Pump.fun's ability to sustain its market dominance and, by extension, the demand for its native token.

Despite this, Pump.fun's co-founder Alon Cohen remains a respected figure in the community, with some analysts expressing confidence in the platform's long-term viability based on its tokenomics and strategic positioning. The upcoming PUMP airdrop, though not scheduled for launch day, may also influence market sentiment and token liquidity in the weeks following the ICO.

The ICO's exclusion of U.S. and U.K. investors due to regulatory constraints has prompted some traders to explore alternative meme coin projects within the Pump-themed ecosystem. Veteran meme coin trader Wirelyss highlights this dynamic, suggesting that sidelined investors may seek value in related tokens, potentially diluting initial demand for PUMP. Wirelyss also critiques the $4 billion valuation as steep when compared to established entities like stablecoin issuer Circle, which commands a valuation roughly double that figure.

These factors, combined with the token's lock-up provisions and competitive pressures, suggest a nuanced market environment where strategic entry points and vigilant monitoring of pre-market indicators will be crucial for prospective investors. As the PUMP token ICO approaches, the crypto community faces a complex interplay of high valuation, competitive market shifts, and regulatory exclusions shaping its launch trajectory. While early indicators and tokenomics suggest potential for measured growth, expert opinions diverge on the likelihood of significant price appreciation. Investors should approach the PUMP token with a balanced perspective, closely observing pre-market trends and broader Solana ecosystem developments to inform their trading strategies.

Circle Internet Group has entered into a strategic collaboration with OKX to deepen liquidity for USD-to-USDC and USDC-to-USD conversions across the world.

This partnership is set to provide customers with the ability to convert between USD and USDC and back on a 1:1 basis across OKX products and services. Also, the collaboration will see OKX simplifying on- and off-ramping through mutual banking partners, optimising how customers use USDC for trading and payments, among others. 

Additionally, Circle and OKX plan to work on educational and community engagement programmes to support users in learning more about the benefits of digital currencies such as USDC. The collaboration is set to offer users more options while also improving the trading experience and creating new opportunities for individuals and businesses globally to leverage USDC.

Furthermore, commenting on the news, representatives from Circle mentioned that, as demand for USDC continues from businesses and individuals wanting to adopt this new form of internet-based money, the alliance with OKX aims to deliver on this demand and serve the needs of users worldwide. By extending USDC's reach to OKX's global users, the two companies plan to drive growth in digital asset markets while building on and integrating with the wide range of Web3 wallet and payment applications that OKX offers.

Shortly before it collaborated with OKX, Circle partnered with Ivy, aiming to enable the latter's customers to access, convert, and transact with stablecoins in real-time. Leveraging Ivy's API, crypto platforms, trading apps, and global ecommerce merchants could accept instant bank transfers and manual bank payments, settle funds to local collection accounts in Europe in multiple currencies, as well as convert money into EURC and USDC. Also, customers could issue payouts in fiat or stablecoins. 

Moreover, Ivy incorporated Circle's USDC and EURC stablecoins into its payment infrastructure, with the move allowing users to settle transactions through real-time bank payment rails.

Last year HSBC set out to explore permissioned protocols for public blockchain payments while addressing privacy, as part of Hong Kong's expanded e-HKD+ trials. While the initial work covered retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) the second phase was expanded to tokenized deposits. HSBC's work is now complete.

The bank said it explored e-HKD payments on various public blockchains including Arbitrum, Ethereum, Linea and Polygon. Additionally, within the bank it developed a private DLT solution using Hyperledger Besu, presumably to act as a tokenization platform prior to public issuance. All the blockchains are Ethereum compatible. HSBC has been one of the more cautious banks when it comes to public blockchains and crypto, so this is a notable move. HSBC Orion, the bank's main permissioned digital asset platform, uses a combination of Digital Asset's Canton and Hyperledger Fabric.

One of the key objectives of the bank's e-HKD work was to investigate how to make private payments in a public environment, so it explored private enhancing technologies (PETs) as well as decentralized identity. While the bank will share further details later in the year, we'd observe this is an area attracting significant efforts, as many want to use public blockchains without the transactions being visible. Brazil's central bank  delayed the rollout of its wholesale CBDC and tokenized deposit project DREX, because it is waiting for these blockchain PETs to reach sufficient maturity. Additionally, HSBC explored the ability to make payments at scale using either a public or private DLT.

Apart from highlighting the bank's e-HKD work, the bank shared the results of a 700 person survey about the CBDC. It found that 90% of respondents “acknowledged the importance of privacy” in transactions. There was greater awareness of e-HKD amongst professional investors, and a third of respondents said they'd use an e-HKD for crypto payments because it would be viewed as ‘safe' money.

Meanwhile, the bank recently launched its tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong, with Ant International as the first client.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Stablecoins have become a dominant force in Brazil's payment landscape, with significant advancements in both the B2B sector and the realm of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Circle, the issuer of USDC, has partnered with HiFi Bridge to enable business payments to Brazil and Hong Kong using USDC. These payments will flow through Circle's Payments Network (CPN), facilitating seamless and efficient transactions. The partnership aims to streamline B2B payments, which handle large amounts of money, by leveraging the stability and efficiency of USDC.

In addition to Circle's initiative, Coinbase has partnered with Matera, a Brazilian fintech firm, to integrate USDC directly into its systems. This collaboration utilizes Matera's Digital Twin platform and Brazil's PIX network, enabling instant money transfers. The focus on B2B payments is strategic, given the sector's significant transaction volumes. This move underscores the growing trend towards digital assets in corporate transactions, offering businesses a reliable medium of exchange that is less susceptible to the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, the Brazilian Central Bank's CBDC, Drex, has demonstrated its tokenization capabilities, further cementing Brazil's position as a digital pioneer in Latin America. Caixa Econômica Federal, a major Brazilian bank, has advanced tokenization using Drex. In collaboration with payments firm Elo, Caixa simulated token transactions with Drex, involving a property financed by another bank. The test settled the previous loan and transferred ownership, with the entire process recorded on the Drex network. This simulation highlights the potential of digital currencies to revolutionize financial transactions, making them more efficient, secure, and transparent.

The integration of Drex with PIX, Brazil's real-time payment system, has further enhanced its utility, allowing for seamless and instantaneous transactions. The success of Drex in tokenization underscores the potential of digital currencies to improve efficiency, enhance record reconciliation, and connect physical and digital spaces more effectively. This development is particularly noteworthy as it showcases Brazil's leadership in digital financial innovation, positioning the country as a future regional trendsetter.

However, the rise of stablecoins and CBDCs in Brazil is not without its challenges. Inflationary pressures, political volatility, and fiscal deficits remain significant hurdles that could impact the long-term sustainability of these digital financial innovations. Despite these challenges, Brazil's commitment to digital financial innovation positions it as a leader in the region, paving the way for other countries to follow suit. The country's rapid digital financial adoption, with a significant portion of adults using digital payment platforms, provides a fertile ground for these innovations to thrive.

In conclusion, the dominance of stablecoins in Brazil's payment landscape, coupled with the success of Drex CBDC, highlights the country's leadership in digital financial innovation. As the world continues to embrace digital currencies, Brazil's experience serves as a valuable example of how stablecoins and CBDCs can be integrated into traditional financial systems, revolutionizing the way we conduct transactions and manage our finances. The country's leadership in fintech regulation and sandbox testing has created an environment conducive to the development and deployment of new financial technologies, positioning Brazil as a future regional trendsetter in digital financial innovation.

President Trump has become a major booster of digital currency. The Planet Money team went to look into how the president's crypto enthusiasm plays out inside the industry.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump has become a major booster of digital currency. That's helped the industry and his own bottom line. Our Planet Money podcast looked into how the president's crypto enthusiasm plays out inside the industry. Here's Andrea Bernstein and Ilya MarritzILYA MARRITZ, BYLINE: The Bitcoin 2025 conference at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, the biggest event of the year for bitcoin, the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. It's where we met Stephen Dalehite (ph), a lawyer from San Antonio.STEPHEN DALEHITE: My wife is into it big time, and I'm the one that's like, that's just pie in the sky.MARRITZ: But Stephen started to think his wife might be right.DALEHITE: And I'm saying, if Trump gets elected, it's going to go up.MARRITZ: The price of a single bitcoin did go up from about $60,000 to over a hundred thousand, and Stephen is thinking about getting in.ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Bitcoin used to be an outsider thing. Government's stay away. But this year...FRANK CORVA: A lot of politicians are here.BERNSTEIN: Frank Corva is Bitcoin Magazine's White House correspondent.CORVA: I think bitcoin is no longer a countercultural thing. It is now just a part of the mainstream. It's part of the political process. The vibe has shifted.BERNSTEIN: It began even before Donald Trump took office when he named a crypto czar, a partner at a Silicon Valley venture capital firm named David Sacks. At the conference, Sacks brought a list of accomplishments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID SACKS: So much that's happened in the last hundred days - I have to pull out my cheat sheet. I hope that's OK.BERNSTEIN: First item.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SACKS: On the president's first full day in office, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah.SACKS: So that was...BERNSTEIN: Ulbricht was given two life sentences for operating Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that ran on bitcoin.MARRITZ: Trump also created a strategic bitcoin reserve, like a pile of gold, but bitcoin. His law enforcement agencies called off crypto investigations and lawsuits. Vice President JD Vance's message from the stage.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JD VANCE: We reject the Biden administration's legacy of death by a thousand enforcement actions.MARRITZ: The crypto industry is feeling good. Paolo Ardoino is the CEO of Tether, which makes a kind of crypto called stablecoin.PAOLO ARDOINO: We have some good conversations with the Trump administration. We have good conversations with lawmakers.BERNSTEIN: Trump's actions as president have helped his family business. In the past year, new Trump crypto ventures have added a billion dollars to Trump's net worth, Forbes says. During the conference, Donald Trump Jr. said even Trump's media company is raising millions to buy bitcoin.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP JR: That's a pretty big deal, right? I mean, you know, there's not a lot of people that have done something that big or shown that level of commitment.BERNSTEIN: The White House told us, President Trump's, quote, ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.""MARRITZ: Take all of this in contrast to the previous administration's relationship to crypto. Amanda Fischer worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Biden. She stressed that crypto represented about 20% of all complaints to the SEC, that regular people are being taken in by hype.AMANDA FISCHER: I think that there are a lot of people who rightly feel like work doesn't necessarily translate to wealth these days, and there is a ton of marketing around the cryptocurrency industry that promises people that if they're just clever enough, they can be rich.BERNSTEIN: Just this week, Trump's media company told the SEC it plans to set up a new consumer-facing crypto investment fund. This came just after Trump's SEC loosened rules for just that kind of fund.MARRITZ: Ilya Marritz.BERNSTEIN: Andrea Bernstein, NPR News.

Home - Crypto Presales - Why DAG Tech Is the Future of Crypto – And BlockDAG May Be Its Best Bet Yet [$337M+ Raised]

Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, blockchain has been the foundation of nearly every major crypto project. But fifteen years later, that architecture is starting to show its age. Congestion, high fees, and confirmation delays remain common problems, even on networks with billion-dollar ecosystems. That's where DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, enter the picture.

DAG-based infrastructure offers an alternative to traditional blockchain by enabling parallel processing of transactions. Instead of blocks in a single chain, transactions are recorded as interconnected nodes in a graph structure, allowing for higher throughput, near-instant confirmations, and better scalability.







Projects like IOTA and Kaspa have attempted to pioneer this path, but one new entrant is making noise with a unique twist: BlockDAG, a hybrid Layer 1 that combines the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the speed of DAG architecture. And based on its rapid growth, the crypto market is paying attention.

The main issue with traditional blockchains is bottlenecking. Every transaction must be included in a block, and each block must be confirmed in sequence. This creates limits on how many transactions per second (TPS) a network can handle, a problem that plagues even top 10 chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

DAGs solve this by removing the need for sequential blocks. Each transaction verifies previous ones, forming a graph-like network that expands in multiple directions. The result: transactions can be processed simultaneously rather than waiting in line. The benefits are obvious:













This structure is especially relevant as crypto moves toward real-world adoption. Retail payments, IoT devices, enterprise use cases, all demand speed, scale, and low costs. Blockchain alone may not deliver that at scale. DAG just might.

What sets BlockDAG apart isn't just that it uses DAG. It's the hybrid model it has built on top of it. By combining DAG-based transaction architecture with a Proof-of-Work consensus layer, BlockDAG manages to strike a balance between scalability and security, something few Layer 1s have pulled off.

In practice, this means that miners still validate transactions and secure the network (like Bitcoin), but those transactions are no longer locked into a linear block structure. This fusion allows BlockDAG to maintain decentralization and trustlessness while achieving far greater speed and efficiency than legacy chains.







It's the same foundational insight that helped Kaspa attract a cult following, but BlockDAG is evolving the concept further, with developer tools, a growing testnet, and consumer-ready mining apps already live.

BlockDAG's approach isn't just theoretical, it's already in motion.

The project's testnet is active and available to the public, supporting smart contract deployment, node setup, and decentralized app testing. Over 2 million users are mining BDAG coins via the X1 Miner app, and more than 18,000 ASIC mining units have been sold ahead of mainnet.

The presale has now exceeded $337 million, with over 23.8 billion BDAG tokens sold, putting it among the largest community-driven crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. And with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release confirmed for August 11, the window to get in early is rapidly closing.

BlockDAG isn't relying solely on technology. It's backing up its product roadmap with aggressive global positioning. The platform is now the Official Blockchain Partner of two major U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket). These partnerships integrate Web3 features like NFTs and fan tokens into existing sports ecosystems, exposing millions of users to BDAG in organic, engaging ways.







Add to that earlier branding campaigns with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football giant Inter Milan, and it's clear BlockDAG is serious about reaching audiences far beyond the typical DeFi crowd.

Right now, BDAG is priced at $0.0016, a figure that stands out when compared to early-stage valuations of other successful Layer 1s. But the clock is ticking. The project has already confirmed that its current unlock promotion, allowing 80% of tokens to be accessible on Day 1, will only be available for a limited time.

With the presale closing soon and mainnet infrastructure rolling out, the BDAG price is unlikely to stay in its current bracket for long. Whether BlockDAG becomes the next Kaspa or carves its own path, the market opportunity for scalable, secure, DAG-based networks has never looked stronger.

The Ethereum Foundation has sold 10,000 ether (ETH) to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal worth $25.7 million, marking the first time a publicly listed company has directly acquired the token directly from the protocol's core steward.

The transaction was executed at an average price of $2,572.37 per ETH and settled on-chain via the foundation's multisig on July 10. Proceeds from the sale will be used to support EF's core activities.

0/ Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC.For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming.

SharpLink, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, described the purchase not as a trade, but as a “commitment to Ethereum's long-term mission.” The company is positioning ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset and said it plans to stake and restake the acquired ETH, effectively removing it from circulation.

“This isn't a trade — it's a commitment,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and a co-founder of Ethereum, said in a release. “SharpLink is acquiring, staking and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.'

“Moreover, we see this as the start of something bigger – a model for how mission-driven organizations can work to advance our ecosystem's shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment and protocol-native finance,” Lubin added.

The move comes at a time when ETH ETF inflows are building, ETH-denominated treasuries are re-emerging, and protocol-native finance is regaining attention.

ETH was trading above $3,000 as of U.S. morning hours Friday, up more than 8% in the past 24 hours.

The spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) raked in over $1 billion in inflows on Thursday, marking one of their strongest single-day totals since launch. The surge came as bitcoin broke a new all-time high above $118,000.



Leading the pack was BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which crossed $80 billion in assets under management (AUM), making it the fastest ETF in history to hit that milestone. It took IBIT just 374 days — roughly a fifth of the time it took the previous record-holder, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which reached the same mark in 1,814 days, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.



IBIT now ranks as the 21st largest ETF globally by assets, a remarkable feat for a fund that launched just over a year ago amid the broader approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.



Thursday's $1 billion inflow marks only the fourth time spot bitcoin ETFs have posted daily amounts that large. The last time was in January as U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Before that, it happened twice in November 2024, shortly after the U.S. election.



The surge in interest reflects growing investor appetite for direct bitcoin exposure in traditional brokerage accounts. Spot bitcoin ETFs offer an easier on-ramp for institutional and retail investors alike, who may be wary of custody and compliance issues in the crypto space.



President Trump's Media company has recently filed for another spot bitcoin ETF under the Truth Social brand that has yet to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.



A number of other ETFs tracking the price of Solana SOL$163.84, XRP XRP$2.7726 and others have also yet to get the green light from the regulator.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Shanghai officials warm to stablecoins despite China crypto ban: Report","https://cointelegraph.com/news/shanghai-mulls-stablecoin-despite-china-crypto-ban-report","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:18:15 GMT","

 Local authorities and state-owned publications in mainland China are increasingly calling on the government not to dismiss the increasing global adoption of stablecoins. 

Mainland China, one of the most restrictive global jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, is reportedly showing signs of a shift in tone regarding stablecoins amid new developments in Shanghai.

The Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies, Reuters reported on Friday.

Following the Thursday meeting, SASAC director He Qing called for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies,” in a post on the authority's official account.

The initiative reportedly came in response to growing calls from experts and major companies in China to develop a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese yuan.

China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has been addressing the issue of global stablecoin adoption, particularly in light of US policy to strengthen the power of the dollar through stablecoins like Circle's USDC (USDC).

In June, PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng reportedly acknowledged the transformative potential of emerging technologies like stablecoins in global payment systems, intensifying calls for regulatory approval of yuan-backed stablecoins.

On June 23, China's state media, Securities Times, published an article saying that the development of stablecoins “should be sooner rather than later.”

Subsequently, PBOC adviser Huang Yiping suggested exploring Hong Kong as a testing ground for yuan-backed stablecoins, stressing that mainland China's tight capital controls make such experimentation unlikely.

“Hong Kong has an offshore market for the renminbi, and if the offshore market develops, it is possible to create a stablecoin pegged to the offshore RMB in Hong Kong in the future,” Huang reportedly said.

Shanghai's recent stablecoin developments come despite mainland China's ongoing crypto trading bans, reinforced by a major crackdown in September 2021.

While some in the community have speculated that mainland China might eventually lift its crypto ban, others argue that the government is unlikely to ease its stance and expose its 1.4 billion citizens to such a high-risk industry.

In the meantime, multiple reports have suggested that China has been secretly stacking Bitcoin (BTC) to become the second-largest holder of the asset after the US. The Chinese government has never officially disclosed its Bitcoin holdings or any sale strategies.

Beyond the rising calls for stablecoin adoption, speculation about China's potential pivot toward crypto has intensified amid controversy over local payouts from the FTX bankruptcy estate.

In early July, the FTX estate requested that a US bankruptcy judge authorize a freeze on distributions to creditors in “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions,” including China, which accounts for 82% of the value of the affected claims.

The move has triggered outrage in the community in many countries, with some Chinese creditors highlighting that China has never banned holding crypto.

On Tuesday, a Chinese creditor filed an objection to an FTX estate motion, representing a group of at least 300 creditors seeking to recover funds from the collapsed crypto exchange.

According to court filings, a ruling on the motion is expected on July 22.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Peter Schiff says sell Bitcoin for silver as BTC smashes new highs","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-new-high-schiff-silver-call","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:23:14 GMT","

 Bitcoin's latest rally sparked a reaction from Peter Schiff, urging a switch to silver, while others were more bullish than ever. 

Longtime Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said the latest BTC rally may be a selling opportunity for investors to buy silver instead.  

“With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it's a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver's next big leg up,” Schiff said in a Thursday X post as Bitcoin (BTC) put on its moon boots again and set new highs above $112,000.

He claimed that silver has more upside potential than Bitcoin and added that while BTC “can easily crash, silver's downside seems very limited.”

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, also weighed in on market conditions in a Friday X post. He said he was “slightly bearish” due to the US Treasury General Account being replenished through new debt issuance, which could temporarily drain liquidity.

Still, Hayes said he was bullish after Bitcoin reached a new all-time high and Ether (ETH) went on a march upward:

Hayes said that the market believes US President Donald Trump will “chicken out” on the tariffs, adding that his family office fund, Maelstrom, is ready to reenter the market.

Erald Ghoos, the CEO of the European arm of crypto exchange OKX, also said that Bitcoin's surge to new highs “isn't just noise, it reflects its emergence as the ultimate digital macro hedge.” He added:

The reaction came amid Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high on Thursday, surpassing $112,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at almost $118,000 after seeing its price rally by about 6% over the last 24 hours.

OKX CEO Roshan Robert said, “Bitcoin is showing why it's in a class of its own.” According to Robert, while ongoing trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating Bitcoin as a macro hedge and maturing asset class.

“July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it,” he concluded.

 BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ether funds were the biggest beneficiaries of Thursday's net inflows. 

Bitcoin and Ether investors piled into their respective crypto-themed funds on Thursday, marking their second-largest daily inflows since their inception.

US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds inflows totaled $1.17 billion, with $448 million coming from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and $324 million from Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, according to Farside Investors. The near-record inflows came as Bitcoin topped $113,800, setting new highs and continuing to rally into Friday. 

The inflows come second to the $1.37 billion recorded on Nov. 7, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election.

Meanwhile, Ether spot ETFs witnessed a total net inflow of $383.1 million on Thursday, which also marks the second-highest net inflow in history for the funds.

The lion's share of inflows came from BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which saw $300.9 million in net inflows — its highest daily inflow on record.

In a Friday X post, NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci said the near-record inflows occurred despite legacy financial advisers' hesitation to offer Bitcoin or Ether spot ETFs.

“Major platforms such as Vanguard are still gatekeeping these ETFs,” Geraci added.

Both Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs are absorbing the net issuance of their respective coins.

In the past 24 hours, ETH net issuance stood at 2,110 ETH, worth approximately $6.33 million, according to the Ethereum tracking website Ultra Sound Money. 

This far exceeds Thursday's total net inflow into Ether spot ETFs, which stood at $383.1 million.

Meanwhile, Strategy and the US Bitcoin ETFs have collectively bought Bitcoin worth $28.22 billion in 2025, while Bitcoin miners' net new issuance has amounted to $7.85 billion during the same period, according to Galaxy Research.

 Approximately 232,149 traders have been liquidated over the past 24 hours as the crypto market rallied to new highs. 

Bitcoin short-sellers were pummeled on Thursday as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs, resulting in more than $1 billion in short positions liquidated in 24 hours. 

CoinGlass data shows that $1.01 billion in crypto short positions were liquidated, impacting 232,149 traders.

This included approximately $570 million in Bitcoin (BTC) shorts and $206.93 million in Ether (ETH) shorts.

The liquidations came as Bitcoin clocked a new record high for the second day in a row — $112,000 on Wednesday and $116,500 on Thursday, while Ether surged to $2,990 on Thursday. 

Crypto market capitalization has spiked 4.4% over the past 24 hours to $3.63 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

“Bears in disbelief,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher said in an X post on Thursday.

Crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades on X called it a “MASSIVE Short squeeze on BTC & ETH.”

Echoing a similar sentiment, Velo noted the significant liquidation event and said, “Lots of emails are being sent.”

One of the larger crypto liquidation events came on Feb. 3 , however, with over $2.24 billion liquidated amid growing concerns of a global trade war after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose import tariffs.

Earlier this week, some analysts were skeptical of Bitcoin reaching new highs. 

Bitfinex analysts said on Tuesday that Bitcoin traders were showing a “lack of follow-through strength” as BTC struggles to break its current all-time high level.

“Bulls are hesitant or unable to push prices significantly higher without fresh catalysts or clearer macro signals,” Bitfinex analysts said on Tuesday as Bitcoin traded around $108,500.

However, others were more bullish. MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said on June 30, “The inevitable breakout to an ATH on Bitcoin might even happen during the upcoming week.”

For now, traders are betting on the price remaining stable or rising further. 

Approximately $2.11 billion in long positions are at risk of liquidation if Bitcoin retraces to Wednesday's price of $112,000.

Brains Process Speech and Singing Differently

Musicologists and neuroscientists have been trying to understand what turns speech into music.

By Rachel Feltman, Allison Parshall, Fonda Mwangi & Madison Goldberg 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. We're wrapping up our week of summer reruns with one of my absolute favorite Science Quickly episodes. Back in October, SciAm associate news editor Allison Parshall took us on a fascinating sonic journey through the evolution of song. What turns speech into music, and why did humans start singing in the first place? A couple of 2024 studies offered a few clues.

Allison, thanks for coming back on the pod. Always a pleasure to have you.

Allison Parshall: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So I hear we're going to talk about music today.

Parshall: We are going to talk about music, my favorite topic; I think your favorite topic, too—I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth.

Feltman: Yeah, I'm a fan, yeah.

Parshall: Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I would love to know if you have a favorite folk song.

Feltman: That is a really tough question because I love, you know, folk music and all of its weird modern subgenres. But if I had to pick one that jumps out that I'm like, “I know this is genuinely at least a version of an old folk song and not, like, something Bob Dylan wrote,” would be “In the Pines,” which I probably love mostly because I grew up kind of in the pines, in the [New Jersey] Pine Barrens, so feels, you know, appropriate.

Parshall: Will you sing it for me?

Feltman: Oh, don't make me sing, don't make me sing. Okay, yes.

Parshall: Yay, okay! I'm sat.

Feltman (singing): “In the pines, in the pines, where the sun don't even shine / I'd shiver the whole night through / My girl, my girl, don't lie to me / Tell me, ‘Where did you sleep last night?'”

That's it; that's the song.

Parshall: Clapping, yay! Oh, that was lovely. Honestly, I didn't know if I expected you to sing it.

Feltman: If you ask me to sing, I'm gonna sing.

Parshall: I'm very happy. Well, I will not be singing my favorite folk song—I don't even know if it qualifies as a folk song—but my grandma used to sing us a lullaby, and that lullaby was “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” like, “Mine eyes have seen the glory,” or whatever. Yeah, so I think that's my favorite one, but I don't know if it qualifies.

[CLIP: “Handwriting,” by Frank Jonsson]

Parshall: But I'm definitely not the only person, like, asking this question; I'm asking it to you for a reason. There's this group of musicologists from around the world that have been basically going around to each other and asking each other the same thing: “Can you sing me a traditional song from your culture?”

And they're in search of the answer to this really fundamental question about music, which is: “Why do humans across the whole world, in every culture, sing?” This is something that musicologists and evolutionary biologists have been asking for centuries, like, at least as far back as Darwin. And this year we had two cool new cross-cultural studies that have helped us get a little bit closer to an answer. And actually they've really changed how I think about the way that we humans communicate with one another, so I'm really happy to tell you about them.

Feltman: Yeah, why do we sing? What theories are we working with?

Parshall: Well, okay, so there's generally two schools of thought. One is that singing is kind of an evolutionary accident—like, we evolved to speak, which is genuinely evolutionarily helpful, and then singing kind of just came along as a bonus.

Feltman: That is a pretty sweet bonus.

Parshall: I agree. It's like we get the vocal apparatus to do the speaking, and then the singing comes along. And the people who buy into this theory like to say that music is nothing more than, quote, “auditory cheesecake,” which is a turn of phrase that has long irked Patrick Savage. He's a comparative musicologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

Patrick Savage: It's just like a drug or a cheesecake: It's nice to have, but you don't really need it. It could vanish from existence, and no one would care, you know?

So that kind of pisses off a lot of us who care deeply about music and think it has deep value. But it's kind of a challenge—like, can we show that there are any real, consistent differences between music and language?

Parshall: Savage took this challenge very seriously because, if you couldn't tell, he belongs to the other school of thought about music's origins: that singing served some sort of evolutionary purpose in its own right, that it wasn't just a bonus. And if that were true, if music weren't just a by-product of language but played, like, an actual role in how we evolved, you'd expect to see similarities across human societies in what singing is and how it functions in a way that is different from speech.

Feltman: Yeah, that makes sense and also sounds like an extremely massive research project.

[CLIP: “None of My Business,” by Arthur Benson]

Parshall: Yeah, I don't envy them the job of having to go around and try to perfectly represent the globe, but they made a solid attempt. They got to work recruiting colleagues to submit samples of them singing a traditional tune of their choice. And through what I can only describe as a truly heroic act of coordination—I can only imagine the e-mail threads—he and a small team of collaborators received data from 75 total participants from 55 language backgrounds and all six populated continents.

Feltman: Wow.

Parshall: So each participant submitted four recordings: one of them singing the traditional tune, another one where they play it on an instrument, another one where they speak the lyrics and another one where they speak naturally—just basically giving a natural language sample of them describing the song that they picked. And Savage himself picked the tune that you might recognize called “Scarborough Fair.” Let me play that for you.

[CLIP: Patrick Savage sings “Scarborough Fair”]

Feltman: It's a classic choice—can't knock it.

Parshall: Yeah, and I'm not immune to a little “Scarborough Fair.” There were also more upbeat tunes that some of the English-speaking contributors submitted.

[CLIP: Tecumseh Fitch sings “Rovin' Gambler”]

Parshall: It makes me want to slap my knee and, like, play a fiddle. But that one was from Tecumseh Fitch. He's an American biologist currently at the University of Vienna.

And this next one that I picked to show you comes from Marin Naruse of the Amami Islands off southern Japan. She's actually a professional singer and cultural ambassador for the region.

[CLIP: Marin Naruse sings “Asabanabushi”]

Parshall: That vocal-flipping technique I just thought was so cool. And I was also totally taken by this next one from Neddiel Elcie Muñoz Millalonco. She's an Indigenous researcher and traditional singer from Chiloé Island in Chile, and here she is singing a traditional Huilliche song.

[CLIP: Neddiel Elcie Muñoz Millalonco sings “Ñaumen pu llauken” (“Joy for the Gifts”)]

Parshall: So that's just a little taste of what this data is like. There's way more where that came from, and it's all publicly available too, so you can check it out yourself. But the researchers after this, when they got the samples, got to work analyzing it. So hats off to Yuto Ozaki of Keio University in Japan. He's the lead author of the study, and to hear Pat Savage tell it, he spent, like, months just processing these audio files full time.

So by comparing the singing samples to the speech samples and then comparing those differences with each other, the researchers found that songs tended to be different than speech in a few key ways: they were slower, they were higher-pitched, and they had more stable pitches than speech.

[CLIP: “The Farmhouse,” by Silver Maple]

Feltman: Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

Parshall: Yeah, like, if you think about the way that maybe a lot of us think about the differences between singing and speech—which, again, we can't fully trust because there's so many different ways to sing and speak around the world—but it generally takes more time to sing a lyric than to speak it because we're lingering on each note for longer. And because we're lingering that means we're able to settle on specific pitches, like, instead of—where I'm speaking, I have this kind of low rumble that settles for less time on any specific pitch. I could also go dooo, and that is, for the most part, like, one specific pitch. It's less upsy and downsy. And then, also, we generally sing with higher pitches than we speak.

Feltman: Yeah, why is that?

Parshall: Maybe because when we speak we're kind of in this narrow, comfortable window toward the bottom of our vocal range. Like, right now, the way I'm speaking, I could go a little bit lower, but I couldn't go very much lower, whereas if I'm singing, I can go, like, octaves higher, probably, than the way I'm speaking right now.

I think it's partly just the way that we're built, but singing opens up that upper range to us—like, you know, the mi mi mi mi mi mi mi of it all. So these differences where we're hearing, you know, slower speeds, higher pitches, those are all interesting, but they feel kind of intuitive, and I didn't have a great way to understand what they were telling me kind of as a whole until I learned about this next study that I'm going to tell you about.

Feltman: Ooh, so what did they find?

Parshall: So this one actually had more of a neuroscience focus, whereas the other one was a little bit more anthropological. This one was conducted by Robert Zatorre of McGill University in Montréal and his colleagues. His team has been asking basically the same question as Savage's team but in a different way. So that's: Can we find commonalities in how cultures around the world speak versus how they sing?

Robert Zatorre: Do they have some kind of basic mechanism that all humans share? Or is it rather that they're purely cultural sort of artifacts—each culture has a way of speaking and a way of producing music, and there's really nothing in common between them? As a neuroscientist, what interests me in particular is whether there are brain mechanisms in common.

Parshall: And Zatorre wasn't going into this from scratch. His own research and research of others had shown that the left and right hemispheres of the brain might be involved differently in speaking versus singing.

Zatorre: An oversimplified version would be to say that speech depends on mechanisms in the left hemisphere of the brain, and music depends more on mechanisms in the right hemisphere of the brain. But I say that's oversimplified because it wouldn't really be correct to say that.

Parshall: So what is correct, though, according to Zatorre, is that there are certain acoustic qualities common in speech that are parsed on the left side of our brain and other acoustic qualities common in singing that are parsed on the right side.

Feltman: So pretty much all I know about left versus right brain is all the debunked stuff about being, like, left-brained or right-brained as a personality type. So could you unpack the actual neuroscience here a little bit?

Parshall: Yeah, the whole, like, “Oh, I'm left-brained. Oh, I'm right-brained,” that's mostly been debunked. But it's true that parts of the two sides of the brain do specialize in totally different things sometimes, and here's what that means for processing sound.

[CLIP: “Let There Be Rain,” by Silver Maple]

Parshall: Speech contains a lot of time-based, or temporal, information, meaning that the signal of what you hear, even as I'm talking now, is changing from, like, millisecond to millisecond and, importantly, that those changes are meaningful. Like, each letter or phoneme that I'm pronouncing goes by super quickly, but if I swapped one for the other—like said “bat” instead of “cat”—that would totally change the meaning, and that happens super quick. So those tiny time frames really matter when we're talking about speech, and that kind of quick-changing information is processed more on the left side of the brain.

Singing, on the other hand, contains a lot of spectral information, which is processed more on the right side of the brain. So when I say “spectral,” I'm referring to the spectrum of sound waves from super low pitch to, like, super high. Those aren't at all encompassing of the spectrum.

Feltman: Yeah, that was the whole spectrum of sound.

Parshall: I can go way lower than—yeah, it goes way lower than what you think you're hearing and way higher than what you think you're hearing. But that information of that spectrum, it kind of contains the “color,” or the timbre, that allows you to distinguish between, for example, a saxophone and a clarinet or even, you know, your voice and my voice if you were listening.

You can really hear this difference in some audio samples that Zatorre sent over from his studies. So basically, for one of these studies, they hired a soprano to sing some melodies and then used computer algorithms to mess with the quality of her voice.

So here's the original audio.

[CLIP: Audio of singing from a study by Zatorre and his colleagues: “I think she has a soft and lovely voice.”]

Parshall: Then they digitally altered the recordings to degrade that temporal, or timing, information. That's kind of like the musical equivalent of slurring your speech or the audio equivalent of making an image blurry. They basically make all of those time cues that are so important for speech blur into each other.

[CLIP: Same audio from the study with temporal degradation]

Feltman: Ooh, freaky.

Parshall: Yeah, it's, like, delightfully alien, I would say. You'll notice that you actually can't hear the lyrics, but you can still kind of hear the melody, right? You could probably distinguish it from another melody, and that's not the case when you do something different and instead of the temporal information, you degrade the spectral information—that's the sound's color.

So here's what it sounds like when they take out all that spectral information.

[CLIP: Same audio from the study with spectral degradation]

Feltman: Whoa.

Parshall: Yeah, like, the only thing I can compare it to are, like, the Daleks from Doctor Who.

Feltman: Totally, yeah.

Parshall: I love it, and I hate it.

So in this one you can hear the lyrics, but you can't hear the melody at all. So it's kind of the inverse. And you can hear that both of these dimensions of sound—the temporal and the spectral—are really important for both song and speech. Like, you would not want to listen to my voice for very long if I sounded like a Dalek. But generally speech relies more on that temporal information, and song relies more on the spectral information.

Feltman: And this is true across different cultures, too?

Parshall: Yeah, so in a study published this summer, Zatorre's team found that this distinction holds true across 21 cultures, and they surveyed urban, rural and smaller-scale societies from around the world. And despite how different some of these languages and singing traditions are from each other, it held true that songs had more spectral information and speech had more temporal information overall.

And so, since we can link these differences to different methods of processing in the brain, there's actually a potential biological mechanism in humans that separates music from speech.

Zatorre: So the story we're trying to tell is that we have two communication systems that are kind of parallel: one is speaking; [the] other is music. And our brains have two separate specializations: one for music, one for speech. But it's not for music or for speech per se; it's for the acoustics that are most relevant for speech versus the acoustics that are most relevant for music.

Parshall: Yeah, and it kind of makes sense to me that we'd have these two parallel communication systems because they basically allow us two separate channels to convey totally different types of information. And, like, imagine how long this podcast would be if I sang everything instead of speaking it. And then imagine that I couldn't incorporate language at all, like, via lyrics, and I just had to do it with notes. That's just impossible—unless we came up with some elaborate code. But then also imagine trying to sit here and explain to me your favorite song in words and all the feelings it brings up for you and why you love it. Like, could you do that?

Feltman: Probably not. It would be really hard.

Parshall: Probably not. It's conveying—there's, like, something extra that you're conveying with song that just resists being conveyed via speech.

So all that to say, “auditory cheesecake,” quote, unquote—music as this little accidental cherry on top of language—that doesn't seem to be the right way of thinking about why we sing. Here's Savage again.

Savage: It suggests that it's not just a by-product—like, there's something that is causing them to be consistently different in all these different cultures. Like, they're kind of functionally specialized for something. But what that something is is very speculative.

[CLIP: “Those Rainy Days,” by Elm Lake]

Parshall: That speculative X factor that he's talking about, that reason why we evolved to sing, if you had to come up with a theory, Rachel, what would it be?

Feltman: I mean, when I think about reasons to sing that I, like, can't imagine humanity just not doing, I don't know—I picture people soothing babies; people celebrating with each other; people, like, engaging in spiritual practice; like, standing outside a crush's window with a boom box. Singing is a thing we do to get each other's attention and share an emotional experience.

Parshall: Yeah, I think that sharing feels really important, and I feel like I have a similar intuition. And that's basically what Savage thinks, too: that music has played some sort of social role. So that could be really wholesome, like the boom box or us bonding together, singing songs around a campfire. Or—I mean, it could be less wholesome. It could be, like, us singing war songs before we do battle with our enemies.

This is one of those evolutionary hypotheses, as many of them are, that it's kind of impossible to fully prove or disprove. It's really hard to get evidence that would be able to say, “Oh, we sing because it, you know, bonds us closer together.” But it's very compelling.

Feltman: Yeah. So just to recap: we know that we have these two very different ways, from a neuroscience perspective, of conveying information. We've got this, you know, melodic musical, and then we've got this, like, very straightforward speech. And sure, we can't go back in a time machine and ask, you know, our distant ancestors, “Why're you singing? Why're you doing that?” So what's next? How do we move this research forward?

Parshall: It can be a little tricky, obviously, to come up with specific proof, but one of Savage's co-authors is hoping to find some clues in an upcoming experiment.

So her name is Suzanne Purdy, and she's a psychologist also at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. And she's involved with something called the CeleBRation Choir. And this choir is super cool because it's made up of people [with communication difficulties, including people] who have what's called aphasia, so their ability to speak has been impacted by events like a stroke or like Parkinson's. But one of the very interesting things about aphasia is, oftentimes, people's ability to sing remains intact. So that might be because it is relying on different parts of the brain—you know, more varied parts of the brain—than speech does.

Suzanne Purdy: When being with the CeleBRation Choir, with people struggling to communicate verbally, but then hearing them sing, [it's] so beautiful and amazing. And our research has shown how it's therapeutic in terms of feeling connected and valuable and able to be in a room and impress people with your singing, even when something terrible has happened in your life.

Parshall: So I actually have a recording to share with you of the choir because I think it's super cool.

[CLIP: The CeleBRation Choir sings “Celebration,” by Ben Fernandez]

Parshall: So partly inspired by her experiences with the CeleBRation Choir, Purdy and her team are currently developing an experiment where they test whether singing can actually make us feel more connected to each other. So they're going to bring in students and have them sing together and then compare that to the experiences of students who have just talked together in a group. And then they'll measure their feelings of connectedness to each other. And they're planning to actually do this cross-culturally, too. So they're going to do this for groups of Māori students, Māori being the Indigenous people of New Zealand, and then students of European descent to see if there are any cultural differences in the impact of singing together.

Purdy: It's the kind of thing that, you know, companies do with team-building exercises. They don't usually get people to sing, do they? But they do get people to problem-solve or to talk together. So this—part of this next phase is: Can you achieve the same level of social cohesion through just coming together with a shared purpose without singing? Or does the singing add a special quality, and is that more effective?

Parshall: Okay, I can't tell if the idea of a company team-building choir sounds fun or like the worst idea ever, but I do have a feeling that it would be kind of effective.

Feltman: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not so different from a karaoke night. And, you know, what brings people together more than a karaoke night?

Parshall: That's a good point. Why did I not think of karaoke night? Okay, we're gonna have to go to our boss with this one. I think it could be really fun.

It is just still a hypothesis whether music really did evolve—or singing, specifically, really did evolve to bond us together. Like, again, this is not something we have necessarily a lot of proof for. And even if this study that Purdy is developing comes up and shows, you know, these groups of students did feel more bonded together when they sang versus when they spoke, that's still only just, like, a little bit of clues and proof.

Feltman: Right, that could just show that we gained this incredible benefit from singing over time. It doesn't necessarily tell us that that's why it evolved.

Parshall: Right. But then I'm always fighting against myself—the instinct to be like, “Oh, but it's true,” because it feels true, right?

Feltman: It does feel true.

Parshall: Like, based off of my personal experience and a lot of people around me, it feels like, you know, when you're in a concert and you look around and you feel, like, the oneness of the world when you're all singing together in this packed stadium, music, regardless of what science shows, it does have these effects on us personally.

Feltman: Yeah, and we can definitely get a better understanding of why it's so important.

Parshall: Yeah, like, regardless of how we got here, regardless of how we evolved, we can still look at the impact it has on us now.

Feltman: It's interesting, I've been thinking this whole time—my sister does shape-note singing, which is this old musical notation style that was basically created so that people who were not otherwise musically literate could, like, all come and sing together in a group at, like, a moment's notice. And it has, like, a big following these days, and people just get together and open these giant old books of, like, mostly Shaker songs and stuff. And I find the shape-note stuff very confusing. It's very confusing until you learn it, and then it's allegedly easier than reading other music.

Feltman: But yeah, it's just amazing how connected people feel within, like, five minutes of sitting down together and singing together. We don't need researchers to tell us that that's a universal experience, but I think it's awesome that they're asking these questions to help us understand, you know, just why music is so important to us.

Allison, thank you so much for coming in to chat about this and for sharing all of these lovely musical snippets. I think that was my favorite part.

Parshall: Thank you so much for having me.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode, and that's a wrap on our week of greatest hits. We'll be back next week with something new.

Mars ‘Water' Streaks Could Just Be Dust

A new global overview of Mars suggests dust, rather than water, is the source of mysterious streaks there

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

Dark “slope streaks,” likely resulting from dust avalanches, stretch across an area of Mars called Acheron Fossae in this image from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

For years, scientists have been looking for signs of liquid water just beneath the surface of Mars. The problem, though, is that the observations from various orbiting probes have been maddeningly ambiguous, sparking a lot of debate.

New research recently published in Nature Communications may have dried up one of the most intriguing lines of evidence for subsurface water: it found that long streaks of material on the sides of slopes and crater walls is likely not from seeping liquid but from disturbed dry dust.

Does it even make sense to look for liquid water anywhere on Mars? When we look to Mars today, we see a desiccated, frozen world. No liquid water exists aboveground, and what water we do find is frozen solid, mostly at the poles.

There's tantalizing evidence of liquid water in the Red Planet's distant past, however. Scientists have spied the sinuous courses of long-lost rivers, as well as the ancient shorelines of vanished lakes and seas carved in the world's rocks, and minerals formed in aqueous environments are relatively commonplace on the surface.

That wet phase of Martian history was billions of years ago, however, and all that water has since evaporated away into space or seeped deep underground. But here and there on modern-day Mars, we still see what might be evidence for liquid water lurking just beneath the Martian surface.

One of the most perplexing hints of hydration are a handful of slope streaks: narrow, long and sometimes bright but usually dark features that are commonly located near the tops of crater walls and scarps. Many are straight, and some wind a bit, but they do very much look like what you'd expect if water leaked out from behind the slope and caused a small flow downhill.

These streaks were first discovered in Viking data from the 1970s. The images were low-resolution and fuzzy by today's standards, but the advent of more advanced orbiters provided sharper views of these features. The streaks tend to be only a few dozen to a couple of hundred meters wide, but they can be a kilometer long. They're seen in dusty equatorial regions and relatively persistent: once formed, they fade over years and decades.

In the late 2000s similar markings were discovered. Called recurring slope lineae (or RSLs), they look much like slope streaks but are usually found in rocky southern areas. They tend to fade over the course of a Martian year (which is about twice as long as our Earthly year) and recur annually in the same spots during summer in Mars's southern hemisphere. RSLs are narrower than slope streaks, only a few meters wide, but also look very much like flow features.

Is this evidence of liquid water on Mars today? I remember, when these were first found, watching an associated NASA press conference and speculating with some colleagues that these could be from water frozen all winter but thawed by the spring and summer sun sending cascades of material downslope. It's cold on Mars, well below water's standard freezing point, but if the water were briny, it might stay liquid even in those frigid temperatures. (Salts are nature's antifreeze.) And we do have plenty of evidence for water ice frozen just beneath the surface in many locations on Mars, even down to midlatitudes.

If RSLs really are triggered by water, they could be the best places to search for extant Martian life (and potential oases for any future human explorers as well).

That's exciting! But is it true?

A problem with previous studies was the lack of a consistent, global database of streaks to investigate. To alleviate that issue, the authors of the new study examined more than 86,000 images from the Context Camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This instrument takes images of the Red Planet's surface in long swaths about 30 kilometers wide. In the new study, the researchers used a machine-learning algorithm to find streaks in the images.

The algorithm identified about half a million streaks: roughly 13,000 bright and 484,000 dark. After accounting for streaks missed by the algorithm and other factors such as branching or overlapping streaks, the scientists estimate there could be as many as 140,000 bright and nearly two million dark streaks in the dataset. This is the first global, consistent database of Martian streaks, inviting deeper—and easier—analysis.

Next, the authors cross-referenced their streak database to others that instead track things such as temperature, wind and hydration across the surface of Mars. What they found supports a dry formation for RSLs and slope streaks alike.

For example, if the slope streaks are caused by sunlight-warmed water ice, you'd expect to find them forming overwhelmingly in slopes that face the sun. The researchers found only a weak tie to sunward-facing slopes, however. Another water-based expectation would be to find streaks where the temperature fluctuations are high, but instead they're typically found in locations where temperatures are relatively stable. And although Mars isn't exactly humid, there is some water vapor in the air, so streaks formed by wet cascades should occur mostly in slopes with higher humidity. But the study found them mostly in drier areas instead.

Interestingly, the more ephemeral RSLs do tend to favor sunward-facing slopes but, like the more longer-lived streaks, aren't found in areas with high temperature fluctuations or levels of humidity, again implying they aren't caused by water.

The scientists did find high correlations of slope streaks with regions that have higher wind speeds and lots of dust deposition—Mars is largely covered with a very fine-grained dust that's high in iron oxide (rust), giving it its characteristic ochre coloring. These results point more toward a dry origin for the streaks. They are also found streaks near younger craters, where the ground is more disturbed and can trigger dust flows more easily. For instance, the researchers cataloged some streaks next to a fresh 140-meter crater that formed when a relatively small meteorite hit the surface of Mars just a few years ago. That location has steep slopes and quite a bit of dust; other craters with flatter slopes and less dust exhibit fewer streaks.

Interestingly, some fossae (Latin for “trenches”), locations where there may be ongoing underground volcanic activity, had streaks. The scientists didn't find a correlation with marsquake activity, but in their paper they note that the data there are limited because of a lack of long-term seismometers on the planet.

Still, this implies streaks may be caused when a sharp energetic event happens on or near the surface, such as a quake or an impact that dislodges dust that then cascades down slopes.

While all this isn't necessarily conclusive, a dry origin for the streaks does currently seem like the better bet. While that's disappointing from the standpoint of looking for native life or supporting our own when we visit, it's still an interesting result. The total estimated annual flux of dust from slope streaks suggests that they may move an amount of material equivalent to several global dust storms on Mars per year! (Actual global dust storms occur every few years on Mars.) These streaks are important geological features of the planet—and we should understand more about them before setting up shop there.

As for life on Mars, whether extant or eons dead, we'll keep looking. Mars is dry now, but it was very likely once very wet, so hope springs eternal.

ChatGPT Is Changing the Words We Use in Conversation

Words frequently used by ChatGPT, including “delve” and “meticulous,” are getting more common in spoken language, according to an analysis of more than 700,000 hours of videos and podcasts

After its release in late 2022, ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Since then the artificial intelligence (AI) tool has significantly affected how we learn, write, work and create. But new research shows that it's also influencing us in ways we may not be aware of—such as changing how we speak.

Hiromu Yakura, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, first noticed differences in his own vocabulary about a year after ChatGPT came out. “I realized I was using ‘delve' more,” he says. “I wanted to see if this was happening not only to me but to other people.” Researchers had previously found that use of large language models (LLMs), such as those that power ChatGPT, was changing vocabulary choices in written communication, and Yakura and his colleagues wanted to know whether spoken communication was being affected, too.

The researchers first used ChatGPT to edit millions of pages of e-mails, essays, and academic and news articles using typical prompts such as to “polish” the text or “improve its clarity.” Next, they extracted words that ChatGPT repeatedly added while editing, such as “delve,” “realm” and “meticulous,” dubbing these “GPT words.” The team then analyzed more than 360,000 YouTube videos and 771,000 podcast episodes from before and after ChatGPT's release to track the use of GPT words over time. They compared the GPT words with “synthetic controls,” which were formed by mathematically weighting synonyms that weren't frequently used by the chatbot—such synonyms for “delve,” for example, could include “examine” and “explore.”

The team's results, posted on the preprint server arXiv.org last week, show a surge in GPT words in the 18 months after ChatGPT's release. The words didn't just appear in formal, scripted videos or podcast episodes; they were peppered into spontaneous conversation, too.

“Empirical Evidence of Large Language Model's Influence on Human Spoken Communication,” by Hiromu Yakura et al. Second version of preprint posted to arXiv.org on June 30, 2025, modified and restyled by Amanda Montañez

“The patterns that are stored in AI technology seem to be transmitting back to the human mind,” says study co-author Levin Brinkmann, also at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. In other words, a sort of cultural feedback loop is forming between humans and AI: we train AI on written text, it parrots a statistically remixed version of that text back to us, and we pick up on its patterns and unconsciously start to mimic them.

“AI is not a special technology in terms of influencing our behavior,” Yakura says. “But the speed and scale at which AI is being introduced is different.”

It may seem harmless—if a bit comical—for people to start talking like ChatGPT. But the trend carries deeper risks. “It's natural for humans to imitate one another, but we don't imitate everyone around us equally,” Brinkmann says. “We're more likely to copy what someone else is doing if we perceive them as being knowledgeable or important.” As more people look to AI as a cultural authority, they may rely on and imitate it over other sources, narrowing diversity in language.

This makes it critical to track and study LLMs' influence on culture, according to James Evans, a professor of sociology and data science at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study. “In this moment in the evolution of LLMs, looking at word distribution is the right methodology” to understand how the technology is affecting the way we communicate, he says. “As the models mature, these distributions are going to be harder to discriminate.” Scientists may need to look at broader linguistic trends beyond word choice, such as sentence structure and how ideas are presented.

Given that ChatGPT has changed how people talk just two and a half years into its adoption, the question becomes not whether AI is going to reshape our culture, but how profoundly it will do so.

“Word frequency can shape our discourse or arguments about situations,” Yakura says. “That carries the possibility of changing our culture.”

Here we have another addition to the list from Disney, and you'll certainly be singing ""Hakuna Matata"" after nabbing this Simba replica for a whopping 50 percent off.  Not sure if I've ever seen a Disney-licensed Lego set this heavily discounted before, so you're going to want to jump on this before it's sold out.

While not every “live-action” Disney remake has received rave reviews, its most recent rehash, Lilo and Stitch, has garnered some pretty solid marks across the board. Stich has become an iconic Disney character, and there's no better way to celebrate the pesky alien than a good old-fashioned replica Lego set. 

In this case, Stitch is enjoying some ice cream while donning a fun Hawaiian shirt, which perfectly encapsulates his personality. This makes for a great display piece for Disney fans of all ages, especially at this price point.

This is a fun one. You can build your own little home and house a mini-family in this creative, interactive, and fun set. It can be built in three different ways, including a three-story canal house with an attic office, an art gallery and café, or a lakeside holiday home. You're essentially getting three sets for the price of one here, and it's now 40 percent off, to boot.

For those passionate about nature, this three-piece Insect collector's set is a more than viable option. Now 20 percent off, the popular set features a stunning blue morpho butterfly, an impressive Chinese mantis replica, and a highly detailed Hercules beetle. They're all life-size and fully posable and feature each insect's distinct natural habitat. It's a fun piece to add to the collection.

R2-D2 is arguably the most iconic droid of the Star Wars series (although his cohort C-3P0 might have something to say about that). Either way, this is an impressive piece on sale for a great price. The droid series is amongst the most popular Star Wars sets Lego has to offer, and this is pretty much the set's golden goose, so to speak. Getting it at a discount is just icing on the cake.

You can kill two birds with one stone here—grab a piece of iconic art and take your time to build it out from scratch? Actually, make it killing three birds—you're also getting a fantastic pre-Prime Day deal here on a set that doesn't go on sale all that often. This 3D piece of Japanese artwork makes a great gift and represents an excellent display option. The 1,810-piece set comes complete with six canvas bases, two hangers, and a decorative tile with artist Hokusai's own signature.

This is a two-for-one auto special—two very different Mercedes vehicles in one all-encompassing set. This toy also features two Lego mini figure “drivers,” in addition to a pair of highly detailed collectible cars. Once these things are built, they make for a great display piece for your room or office space.

Anakin Skywalker made his mark during the legendary podrace in Episode I, so it's no surprise that a dynamic diorama was created in honor of the fictional race. This is a fantastic “adult” toy, so to speak, and it comes complete with a Star Wars 25th anniversary brick and a plaque featuring an iconic Qui-Gon Jinn quotation. And for over 30 percent off retail, you really can't go wrong here. 

If you want a similarly awesome piece of replica French architecture, consider this recently marked-down set of the Paris skyline, featuring famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, and more. The set is scaled accurately and, as a little kicker, comes with a complimentary booklet containing all types of information about the designer, architecture, and history of every structure. 

If you want to skip the building and go straight to the collecting, you can always opt for some BrickHeadz. This Star Wars collectors' piece features the main characters from the first prequel—Jar Jar Binks, Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Captain Panaka, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul, as well as some authentic accessories. Enjoy the spoils of Legos without having to, well, do anything. Other than buy them at a discount, of course.

Nintendo has been all over the map recently, thanks largely in part to the release of the much-anticipated and highly sought-after Switch 2. If you haven't been able to get your hands on one, well, at least you'll be able to immerse yourself in the world of Mario and co. with this Piranha Plant Lego set. 

Now 20 percent off, this buildable plant is iconic and represents the treachery our favorite fictional plumber faces in nearly every game. The 540-piece set is challenging enough for stimulation, yet easy enough for casual relaxation—the best of both worlds.

A new genetic treatment seems to be working wonders, including restoring nearly all hearing to a seven-year-old patient after just four months. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The world is filled with noises that can lead to permanent hearing loss. Just go to a rock concert for a few hours, and the resulting days-long tinnitus is enough anatomical evidence to prove the point. However, the majority of cases regarding hearing loss in children and adults comes from genetics, an unfortunate mutation somewhere in a person's genome that interrupts the otherwise remarkable process of turning sound waves into electrical signals that can be interpreted by our brain (aka auditory transduction). 

With the arrival of gene-editing tools, such as CRISPR, scientists have begun making strides to make hereditary deafness a thing of the past. However, as you might expect, achieving such a medical miracle isn't easy. More than 120 genes have been linked to hearing loss, so isn't like you can just flip a switch and fix the problem. Previous studies have analyzed different genes, including TMC1, Atp2b2, and others, typically on mouse models with positive results. 

But a new study, analyzing the gene OTOF, tested its gene therapy on ten patients between the ages of 1 to 24 at five hospitals throughout China. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, detailed how all ten patients experienced vast hearing improvement with perceptible sound increasing from 106 decibels (which is about the equivalent of a car horn at close range) to 52 decibels—below the range of a typical conversation. 

“This is a huge step forward in the genetic treatment of deafness, one that can be life-changing for children and adults,” Karolinska Institutet in Sweden's Maoli Duan, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Smaller studies in China have previously shown positive results in children, but this is the first time that the method has been tested in teenagers and adults, too.”

Researchers delivered the treatment via a synthetic adeno-associated virus, or AAV, a well-known vector for gene therapy as it can deliver DNA directly to targeted cells. The ability to generate these AAV particles so that they contain no viral genes but only DNA required for therapeutic intervention has made them one of the safest methods for gene therapies. Scientists then injected a functional version of the OTOF gene in the “round window,” a membrane at the base of the cochlea. 

After a month of treatment, the patients were already showing signs of improvement, and six months later, they reported even greater auditory gains. While this was one of the first treatments on teenagers and adults—and all ages showed signs of improvement—the biggest gains were between the ages of five and eight. According to the researchers, one seven-year-old girl showed the greatest transformation, recovering nearly all of her hearing and holding daily conversations with her mother just four months later. 

Although promising for this particular genetic mutation, scientists have a long way to go before they can confidently reverse genetic hearing loss across the board. In fact, targeting OTOF may have been one of the easier challenges when it comes to genetic therapies for hearing loss. 

“OTOF is just the beginning,” Duan said in a press statement. “We and other researchers are expanding our work to other, more common genes that cause deafness, such as GJB2 and TMC1. These are more complicated to treat, but animal studies have so far returned promising results. We are confident that patients with different kinds of genetic deafness will one day be able to receive treatment.”

Explore Prime Day Deals

Amazon has long been a solid place to shop for pocket knives, bringing prices down on blades from well-known brands like Kershaw and Spyderco, as well as Amazon-first knife brands from overseas such as Civivi and Sencut. During Amazon Prime Day, which wraps up today, July 11, you'll find even more bargains on knives than usual. 

To narrow your choices and help you to find your next favorite pocket knife, I scoured Amazon for the best deals across a range of categories.  I checked those deals against the knives we've tested and recommended to help you find offers that bring great craftsmanship and low prices together. These deals are my personal recommendations right now, but the PM team is monitoring deals throughout the remainder of the sale, and will update the list as prices get cut or knives go out of stock.

Editor's Note, July 11, 2025: It's the final day of this Amazon event so don't wait if you're considering one of these pocket knives. The Kershaw Iridium, our Best Overall pocket knife, is still on sale and it's a find at roughly 27 percent off. It got high praise from our tester Justin Park. And our Best-Spring Assisted pocket knife, the CRKT Bamboozled, remains deeply discounted at 30 percent. 

This affordable crossbar-lock folder, featured in our 7 Best Pocket Knives as Best Overall, was given that honor because this is a nearly EDC pocket knife. The flipper action is smooth and satisfying and the crossbar lock is secure and easy to use. It also looks slick with anodized aluminum scales and an all-metal construction that make the Iridium feel substantial without being heavy (it's just over 3 ounces). 

The D2 steel is fairly easy to sharpen and holds an edge well. It's not as durable as some of the pricier steels in high-end folders but it keeps the cost down and is plenty capable for daily use. If you like the Iridium design but want a higher-end steel, there are several variations available with different blade steels, different handle scales, and even different blade shapes. To learn more about this excellent daily driver pocket knife, read our full review of the Kershaw Iridium.

The Wharncliff-style blade on this budget folder from Portland's Coast gives it a distinctive look but the straight blade edge also has some benefits such as performing better at box-cutter type tasks such as opening a package. 

The 7Cr17 steel helps to keep the cost down but it's given a powder-coat finish for durability and you'll find the blade comes well-sharpened out of the box. The Contra is a medium-sized folder but feels substantial, thanks to an all-metal build and sturdy frame lock mechanism. Despite the beefy construction and low price tag, it isn't too thick and sits comfortably in the pocket. Bronze washers and a well-placed flipper tab deploy the blade quickly for an action that's more smooth and fun than you'd expect at this price point.

Victorinox's “Swiss Army Knives” are still some of the most popular pocket knives in the world generations after soldiers brought them home from Europe after the 20th century's world wars. The Fieldmaster is my current favorite, which I highlighted in my guide to the Best Swiss Army Knives.  

In short, it's a well-balanced multi-tool that packs that offers 15 functions while keeping its size and profile modest. With a knife, saw, scissors, and nail file, the Fieldmaster is helpful in the great outdoors and also around the house.

Leatherman has become the gold standard in multi-tools, and while it produces a bunch of different models in its Portland-area factory, the P4 Free has been my favorite multi-tool for the past several years. The newer Leatherman ARC has effectively replaced the P4 Free and swapped in a high-end Magnacut steel for the blade, but the price is significantly higher. 

The P4 Free has an awesome magnet-driven action that's the smoothest I've tested and makes it satisfying to deploy. It comes with a belt sheath, but is compact enough to pocket-carry with the built-in clip.

When shopping Amazon's budget pocket knives, you need to be careful to look for options that are affordably priced but aren't cheaply made. I've tested several Civivi knives over the years and found that, for the price, they don't cut too many corners. There are a number of Civivi knives in this category that I love, including the Mini Praxis. It's a solid all-around folder that can be had for under $30, but still delivers a smooth opening mechanism thanks to the ceramic bearings in its fast and satisfying flipper build.

Kenny Onion, son of famed knifemaker Ken Onion, has partnered with Columbia River Knife and Tool (CRKT) on this refined “executive”-style pocket knife. Its longer, slimmer build sits discreetly in the pocket but isn't so skinny that it's impractical for everyday tasks.

The highlight, I think, is the satisfying and quick assisted flipper opening mechanism that may have you using it as a de facto fidget spinner replacement. There are three colorways, but I like the two with the black oxide-coated blade, which adds rust-resistance to the D2 steel.

Even in an age of overseas outsourcing, there are plenty of great knife brands that make some or all of their blades on American soil. Case Knives has been producing pocket knives for generations of Americans at its facilities in the Northeast for over 100 years, including popular folders like the Trapper. 

Many of Case's folding knife designs harken back to a different era, and the Trapper looks like something your grandfather would've carried. Like most knife designs from bygone eras, the two blades resist closing but don't truly lock out, though there's a nod to modern designs with the inclusion of a pocket clip.

How do I keep my pocket knife sharp?

I use my pocket knife so frequently and casually, so I don't like to keep an ultra-sharp blade: I tend to sharpen my knives at a 20- to 25-degree angle, which makes them more durable and less likely to slice you if you do something dumb. (If you want to go as sharp as possible, though, aim for 15 degrees. 

Knife sharpening is a skill that isn't easy to master (learn how here), but there are tools available to help. While whetstone sharpening is soothing in a Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance sort of way, you probably already have a pull-through sharpener in your kitchen.

They aren't perfect sharpening solutions, but they're relatively idiot-proof and good enough to perk up your blade. I have personally started using the Work Sharp Ken Onion Edition Knife and Tool Sharpener, which lets you adjust for blade angle and uses a series of electrically driven belts for a fairly quick sharpen. Even that one requires a bit of practice to use well, though. You can browse all of our favorite sharpeners in our guide to the best knife sharpeners.

How much should a good pocket knife cost?

This is both a surprisingly common and difficult-to-answer question. Obviously personal budget comes into play, but so do your preferences. I consider myself a pocket knife enthusiast, but got my start carrying a cheap pocket knife from Walmart for years that cost me literally $1. (Sadly, the company raised the price to $2 at some point.) 

While I can't in good conscience recommend buying any knife on Amazon that's quite so cheap, there are at least a few high-quality knives that you can grab during Prime Day for under $50. If you're new to knives, that's where to start.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Prime Day is about more than just essentials. Tech and gaming items like laptops, TVs, and even consoles accessories for the Nintendo Switch are on sale for hundreds of dollars off. The massive four-day shopping event is starting to wind down and officially ends tomorrow taking many of the best deals on the site with it. 

Arcade machines might bring back some memories from the '80s and '90s, but the models you can buy today offer a lot more than just a nostalgia trip. These come with digital displays that are more energy efficient and offer clearer picture quality than the CRT screens you remember. Furthermore, these arcade machines typically come with tons of pre-programmed games, so just one of them will have dozens of games at least.

Throughout the shopping event, arcade machines of all types are on sale for hundreds of dollars off. While most of the deals you see won't jump off the page, they are almost across the board, the best prices that the machines have been listed at all year including a few at the lowest prices ever. 

This includes classic machines you'd recognize from your childhood as well as tabletop or cocktail table models that fit easily in a modern home. Prime Day lasts for four days this year, instead of the usual two, so be sure to check this list regularly throughout the week to see if prices change. 

Shop Prime Day Deals

Editor's Note, June 11, 2025: Prime Day is in its final stretch today with many items we previously listed now out of stock. That said, there are still tons of arcade machines currently on sale. This includes the Golden Tee 3D, which you can nab now for 50 bucks off. Furthermore, this tabletop machine from Doc and Pies is also on sale for $50 off—officially its lowest price ever since being listed on Amazon.

Two of the biggest brands of modern arcade machines, Arcade 1Up and Doc and Pies Arcade Factory, both have multiple models on sale. The best deal Arcade 1Up is currently offering is on its Infinity Game Table, which is currently 50 dollars off. The game board works for board games and up close, touch-screen action. Unlike other arcade machines, this one doesn't have a massive body to haul around; it's just the table and board. What we like about this option, besides the big discount, is the volume of games it includes. You can play over 100 different games on just one device.  

Beyond the major arcade machine brands, WYGaming has one of the best deals we found with their arcade game console currently on sale for over 30 percent off. The device features two sets of buttons and joysticks for engaging head-to-head action. With over 20,000 pre-loaded games, including numerous fighting games, you can have a ton of fun against a friend or by yourself. The screen itself is HD and features a 1080p resolution for crystal-clear gaming, regardless of the arcade game you choose.

These Prime Day deals won't last, especially given the limited stock on many of the large machines, so take advantage of them on this final day so you can relive your button-mashing days without the pockets full of quarters.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The summer is midway through, which means that Amazon Prime Day is finally here. Rolling into its final day, the shopping event offers some of the best discounts on a wide range of items, including tools and TVs.  Some of the biggest discounts are on typically expensive items, including electric scooters.

Electric scooters are great both as a fun way to get around town and as a portable everyday commuter for work or school. Scooters with long-range batteries and sturdy suspension can take your short jaunt into long rides, both on the roads and even on light trails and dirt paths. Throughout Prime Day, electric scooters from top-rated brands that we've reviewed and tested are on sale for hundreds off. In fact, some of these models are at their lowest price of the year. 

Many of these scooters are likely to sell out before the final day ends, so make sure to check out all of our top picks before it's too late. With items like scooters, we recommend sticking with brands you know and trust. Unfamiliar brands or deals that are too good to be true might be exactly that. With that in mind, check out our picks for the best electric scooter deals below.

This electric scooter from Gotrax doesn't have quite the same range as more expensive models, but the quality motor still boasts 12 miles on a single charge for a fraction of the price. The honeycomb-style solid tires are designed to resist punctures and will never go flat. The scooter also features an LED that displays the speed and battery level.

While many electric scooters rely solely on a front brake, the V40 from Navee comes with a dual-braking system that slows down both tires simultaneously. This helps you reduce speed more safely and lowers the chance of toppling over or falling on a hard brake. The scooter also has a speedy top range of 20 miles per hour.

If you want a high-end model while it's on sale, consider the KQi Air electric scooter. Made of carbon fiber, the scooter is relatively lightweight, considering the powerful motor that runs for up to 31 miles on a single charge. Alongside this, the scooter also features a halo front light, a rear light, turn signals, and an ambient light on the board itself.

This scooter from Gotrax comes with both a metal basket and a cushioned seat. This makes it ideal for running errands and picking up groceries without using your car. The seat also keeps you off your feet after hours of shopping.

The ES4 from Segway is a sound middle ground option for city commuters and casual riders. The scooter reaches a top speed of 18 miles per hour and has a maximum range of 25 miles. It comes with a kickstand for easy upright storage and features turn signals on both the handlebars and the rear for improved visibility at night. The scooter is currently at the lowest price it's been at in over a year. 

This popular and affordable model from Segway has a range of just 16 miles but comes with a speedy motor that makes for perfect fun riding around town. This scooter also features front and rear lights for use at night. Furthermore, the Ninebot E2 is water resistant for comfortable riding in light rain or through puddles.

If you plan to use your scooter for longer-range rides, this Max G2 is a perfect choice. The scooter boasts a range of up to 43 miles and can reach speeds of up to 22 miles per hour. Despite the long range, the scooter charges up in just five hours.

With warm weather and blue skies looking like they are here to stay (for a few months, at least), nab yourself a drone you can fly freely in the open air. Drones are great gadgets for both the casual flier who wants to capture a few fun videos and zoom around to their heart's content, as well as for videographers and filmmakers looking to capture aerial shots or high-speed action.

Drones, especially ones with strong wind resistance, high-quality cameras, and agile maneuverability, can be quite expensive. Even more affordable models cost a few hundred dollars. During the final hours of Prime Day, you can grab a top-rated drone for hundreds of dollars off the original price.

The longest Prime Day ever is coming to a close today, making it your last chance to grab some of these drone deals. Many of these drones are at the best price we've seen all year, so don't miss out on your chance to get a model you like before it reverts to full price. The drone sales listed below aren't just the lowest prices we found on Amazon. All options we add to this list are from brands we know and trust. In fact, some of the drones are ones we've tested out and reviewed ourselves.

Shop Prime Day Deals

Choosing the right drone is more than just about the sale price. We found drones that cater to needs across the spectrum, from beginners to nearly professional-grade.

DJI's Air 3 might be a little more expensive than other deals on this list, but the brand is no joke. DJI almost single-handedly swept our list of the best drones due to the consistently high quality of its cameras, motors, and controls. The Air 3 is definitely no exception, with this particular model actually coming with two different camera lenses. The medium tele camera is great for traditional shots and high-resolution close-ups, while the wide-angle camera captures massive landscapes and sweeping shots from a high vantage point. The drone is also capable of taking off at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters, allowing you to take it on hikes, through hills, and even on snowy slopes. During Prime Day, the Air 3 is over $150 off.

If you're looking for a beginner-focused model, we like the Ruko U11 Mini. This already more affordable model is on sale for nearly 50 percent off its original price, further reducing the cost. This model also weighs less than 250 grams, which means you don't need any FAA registration to operate it. The purchase also comes with a remote control, cables to connect your phone to the remote control, extra propellers, three rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case. 

If you're less interested in flying it around on your own and just want quality video, the HoverAir X1 offers numerous easy-to-use video and flying modes that help you record solid footage without requiring top-notch aerial control. We loved testing this one out and got tons of footage we loved, despite our relative novice flying skills. All we had to do was press which mode we wanted, and the drone would orbit us, follow us, or even zoom out. While the deal isn't directly listed on the page, the drone is currently on sale for 22 percent off, with the discount applied at checkout. 

Also on sale are quality options from both Potensic and Holy Stone, which both have models we recommend on our overall best drones list and best drones for beginners list, respectively. The deals for each are also well worth considering, with the Holy Stone on sale for $70 off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","In seconds, AI builds proteins to battle cancer and antibiotic resistance","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250710113152.htm","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 04:03:47 GMT","

In the last year, there has been a surge in proteins developed by AI that will eventually be used in the treatment of everything from snakebites to cancer. What would normally take decades for a scientist to create -- a custom-made protein for a particular disease -- can now be done in seconds.

For the first time, Australian scientists have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate a ready-to-use biological protein, in this case, one that can kill antibiotic resistant bacteria like E. coli.

This study, published in Nature Communications, provides a new way to combat the growing crisis caused by antibiotic resistant super bugs. By using AI in this way, Australian science has now joined countries like the US and China having developed AI platforms capable of rapidly generating thousands of ready-to-use proteins, paving the way for faster, more affordable drug development and diagnostics that could transform biomedical research and patient care.

The Nature Communications paper is co-led by Dr. Rhys Grinter and Associate Professor Gavin Knott, a Snow Medical Fellow, who lead the new AI Protein Design Program with nodes at the University of Melbourne Bio21 Institute and Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute.

According to Dr. Grinter and A/Prof. Knott, the AI Protein Design Platform used in this work is the first in Australia that models the work done by David Baker (who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year) developing an end-to-end approach that could create a wide range of proteins. ""These proteins are now being developed as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, nanomaterials and tiny sensors, with many other applications yet to be tested"" Associate Professor Knott said.

For this study, the AI Protein Design Platform used AI-driven protein design tools that are freely available for scientists everywhere. ""It's important to democratize protein design so that the whole world has the ability to leverage these tools,"" said Daniel Fox, the PhD student who performed most of the experimental work for the study. ""Using these tools and those we are developing in-house, we can engineer proteins to bind a specific target site or ligand, as inhibitors, agonists or antagonists, or engineered enzymes with improved activity and stability.""

According to Dr Grinter, currently proteins used in the treatment of diseases like cancer or infections are derived from nature and repurposed through rational design or in vitro evolution and selection. ""These new methods in deep learning enable efficient de novo design of proteins with specific characteristics and functions, lowering the cost and accelerating the development of novel protein binders and engineered enzymes,"" he said.

Since the work of David Baker, new tools and software are being developed, such as Bindcraft and Chai which have been incorporated into an AI Protein Design Platform co-led by Dr. Grinter and A/Prof. Knott..

Professor John Carroll, Director of the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, said the new AI Protein Design Program 'brings Australia ""right up to speed in this exciting new modality for designing novel therapeutics and research tools. It is testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of two fabulous young scientists who have worked night and day to build this capability from scratch.""

""The Program, based at Monash University and the University of Melbourne, is run by a team of talented structural biologists and computer scientists who understand the design process from end-to-end. This in-depth knowledge of protein structure and machine learning makes us a highly agile program capable of regularly onboarding cutting edge tools in AI-protein design,"" Associate Professor Knott said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How a hidden brain circuit fuels fibromyalgia, migraines, and PTSD","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250710113151.htm","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 03:39:17 GMT","

Pain isn't just a physical sensation -- it also carries emotional weight. That distress, anguish, and anxiety can turn a fleeting injury into long-term suffering.

Researchers at the Salk Institute have now identified a brain circuit that gives physical pain its emotional tone, revealing a new potential target for treating chronic and affective pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Published on July 9, 2025, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study identifies a group of neurons in a central brain area called the thalamus that appears to mediate the emotional or affective side of pain in mice. This new pathway challenges the textbook understanding of how pain is processed in the brain and body.

""For decades, the prevailing view was that the brain processes sensory and emotional aspects of pain through separate pathways,"" says senior author Sung Han, associate professor and holder of the Pioneer Fund Developmental Chair at Salk. ""But there's been debate about whether the sensory pain pathway might also contribute to the emotional side of pain. Our study provides strong evidence that a branch of the sensory pain pathway directly mediates the affective experience of pain.""

The physical sensation of pain is what allows you to immediately detect it, assess its intensity, and identify its source. The affective part of pain is what makes it so unpleasant. This emotional discomfort motivates you to take action and helps you learn to associate negative feelings with the situation so you can avoid it in the future.

This is a critical distinction. Most people start to perceive pain at the same stimulus intensities, meaning we all process the sensory side of pain fairly similarly. In comparison, our ability to tolerate pain varies greatly. How much we suffer or feel threatened by pain is determined by our affective processing, and if that becomes too sensitive or lasts too long, it can result in a pain disorder. This makes it important to understand which parts of the brain control these different dimensions of pain.

Sensory pain was thought to be mediated by the spinothalamic tract, a pathway that sends pain signals from the spinal cord to the thalamus, which then relays them to sensory processing areas across the brain.

Affective pain was generally thought to be mediated by a second pathway called the spinoparabrachial tract, which sends pain information from the spinal cord into the brainstem.

However, previous studies using older research methods have suggested the circuitry of pain may be more complex. This long-standing debate inspired Han and his team to revisit the question with modern research tools.

Using advanced techniques to manipulate the activity of specific brain cells, the researchers discovered a new spinothalamic pathway in mice. In this circuit, pain signals are sent from the spinal cord into a different part of the thalamus, which has connections to the amygdala, the brain's emotional processing center. This particular group of neurons in the thalamus can be identified by their expression of CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), a neuropeptide originally discovered in Professor Ronald Evans' lab at Salk.

When the researchers ""turned off"" (genetically silenced) these CGRP neurons, the mice still reacted to mild pain stimuli, such as heat or pressure, indicating their sensory processing was intact. However, they didn't seem to associate lasting negative feelings with these situations, failing to show any learned fear or avoidance behaviors in future trials. On the other hand, when these same neurons were ""turned on"" (optogenetically activated), the mice showed clear signs of distress and learned to avoid that area, even when no pain stimuli had been used.

""Pain processing is not just about nerves detecting pain; it's about the brain deciding how much that pain matters,"" says first author Sukjae Kang, a senior research associate in Han's lab. ""Understanding the biology behind these two distinct processes will help us find treatments for the kinds of pain that don't respond to traditional drugs.""

Many chronic pain conditions -- such as fibromyalgia and migraine -- involve long, intense, unpleasant experiences of pain, often without a clear physical source or injury. Some patients also report extreme sensitivity to ordinary stimuli like light, sound, or touch, which others would not perceive as painful.

Han says overactivation of the CGRP spinothalamic pathway may contribute to these conditions by making the brain misinterpret or overreact to sensory inputs. In fact, transcriptomic analysis of the CGRP neurons showed that they express many of the genes associated with migraine and other pain disorders.

Notably, several CGRP blockers are already being used to treat migraines. This study may help explain why these medications work and could inspire new nonaddictive treatments for affective pain disorders.

Han also sees potential relevance for psychiatric conditions that involve heightened threat perception, such as PTSD. Growing evidence from his lab suggests that the CGRP affective pain pathway acts as part of the brain's broader alarm system, detecting and responding to not only pain but a wide range of unpleasant sensations. Quieting this pathway with CGRP blockers could offer a new approach to easing fear, avoidance, and hypervigilance in trauma-related disorders.

Importantly, the relationship between the CGRP pathway and the psychological pain associated with social experiences like grief, loneliness, and heartbreak remains unclear and requires further study.

""Our discovery of the CGRP affective pain pathway gives us a molecular and circuit-level explanation for the difference between detecting physical pain and suffering from it,"" says Han. ""We're excited to continue exploring this pathway and enabling future therapies that can reduce this suffering.""

It turns out color isn't just fashionable for guppies: According to a new UBC study, the more orange a male, the more virile it is.

The research published in Nature Ecology & Evolution shines light on an enduring evolutionary mystery: why male guppies have such vibrant and varied colors and patterns.

Virile me up

Zoologists Drs. Wouter van der Bijl and Judith Mank used deep learning, genetic studies and bred three generations of increasingly orange guppies to investigate. They found the more colorful males were up to two times more sexually active, performing for females at a greater rate and for longer periods of time, and attempting to sneakily copulate more often.

Orange you glad to see me, baby?

It's known that female guppies prefer orange, and unusual, patterns in their male partners, but the team found that the color diversity of guppies comes from the same cells that are responsible for forming the brain, suggesting a genetic link between how guppies look and how they behave.

""Previously, people thought perhaps males realized that if they were more orange, they were more sexy. With the genetic link, it may be that they're healthier and fitter,"" said Dr. Mank.

Let's recombine sometime

The researchers found the guppy color genes, and the locations they appeared in, were tied to multiple chromosomes, creating a vast architecture of genetic possibilities. Seven orange and eight black color types were identified overall, allowing for a potential 32,768 unique pattern combinations.

""Genetic variation is the raw material that evolution uses to produce resilient, adapted animals and plants, including for things like climate change or disease,"" said van der Bijl. ""We often look at extreme examples to understand where genetic variation comes from and how it's maintained.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The first pandemic? Scientists find 214 ancient pathogens in prehistoric DNA","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250710113158.htm","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:42:20 GMT","

A research team led by Eske Willerslev, professor at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge, has recovered ancient DNA from 214 known human pathogens in prehistoric humans from Eurasia.

The study shows, among other things, that the earliest known evidence of zoonotic diseases -- illnesses transmitted from animals to humans, like COVID in recent times -- dates back to around 6,500 years ago, with such diseases becoming more widespread approximately 5,000 years ago. It is the largest study to date on the history of infectious diseases and has just been published in the scientific journal Nature.

The researchers analyzed DNA from over 1,300 prehistoric individuals, some up to 37,000 years old. The ancient bones and teeth have provided a unique insight into the development of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

The results suggest that humans' close cohabitation with domesticated animals -- and large-scale migrations of pastoralist from the Pontic Steppe -- played a decisive role in the spread of these diseases.

""We've long suspected that the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease -- now DNA shows us that it happened at least 6,500 years ago,"" says Professor Eske Willerslev. ""These infections didn't just cause illness -- they may have contributed to population collapse, migration, and genetic adaptation.""

World's oldest trace of the plague

In the study, the researchers found 214 pathogens. A remarkable finding is the world's oldest genetic trace of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, identified in a 5,500-year-old sample. The plague is estimated to have killed between one-quarter and one-half of Europe's population during the Middle Ages.

Could have implications for future vaccines

The findings could be significant for the development of vaccines and for understanding how diseases arise and mutate over time.

""If we understand what happened in the past, it can help us prepare for the future, where many of the newly emerging infectious diseases are predicted to originate from animals,"" says Associate Professor Martin Sikora, the study's first author.

""Mutations that were successful in the past are likely to reappear. This knowledge is important for future vaccines, as it allows us to test whether current vaccines provide sufficient coverage or whether new ones need to be developed due to mutations,"" adds Eske Willerslev.

The study was made possible by funding from the Lundbeck Foundation.

The future of sustained space habitation depends on our ability to grow fresh food away from Earth. The revolutionary new collaborative Moon-Rice project is using cutting-edge experimental biology to create an ideal future food crop that can be grown in future deep-space outposts, as well as in extreme environments back on Earth.

Modern space exploration relies heavily on resupplies of food from Earth, but this tends to be largely pre-prepared meals that rarely contain fresh ingredients. To counteract the negative effects that the space environment can have on human health, it's important to have a reliable source of food rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fibres.

The Moon-Rice project aims to develop the perfect crop for sustaining life in space for long-duration missions, such as the occupation of permanent bases on the Moon or on Mars. ""Living in space is all about recycling resources and living sustainably,"" says Marta Del Bianco, a plant biologist at the Italian Space Agency. ""We are trying to solve the same problems that we face here on Earth.""

Dr Del Bianco explains that one of the major challenges is the current size of crops grown on Earth. Even many dwarf varieties of rice are still too big to be grown reliably in space. ""What we need is a super-dwarf, but this comes with its own challenges,"" she says. ""Dwarf varieties often come from the manipulation of a plant hormone called gibberellin, which can reduce the height of the plant, but this also creates problems for seed germination. They're not an ideal crop, because in space, you just don't have to be small, you must also be productive.""

The Moon-Rice project is not just a solo effort by the Italian Space Agency and also involves the collaboration of three Italian Universities. ""The University of Milan has a very strong background in rice genetics, the University of Rome 'Sapienza' specialises in the manipulation of crop physiology and the University of Naples 'Federico II' has an amazing heritage in space crop production,"" says Dr Del Bianco. ""We started this four-year project nine months ago, so it's very much a work in progress, but the preliminary results we have now are really promising,"" says Dr Del Bianco.

""Researchers at the University of Milan are isolating mutant rice varieties that can grow to just 10 cm high, so they're really tiny and this is a great starting point,"" says Dr Del Bianco. ""At the same time, Rome has identified genes that can alter the plant architecture to maximize production and growth efficiency."" Additionally, since meat production will be too inefficient for resource and space-limited space habitats, Dr Del Bianco and her team are looking into enriching the protein content of the rice by increasing the ratio of protein-rich embryo to starch.

Dr Del Bianco's own personal focus is on how the rice plants will cope with micro-gravity. ""We simulate micro-gravity on Earth by continually rotating the plant so that the plant is pulled equally in all directions by gravity. Each side of the plant gets activated continuously and it doesn't know where the up and down is,"" says Dr Del Bianco. ""It's the best we can do on Earth because, unfortunately, doing experiments in real microgravity conditions, i.e. in space, is complex and expensive.""

Not only can fresh food be more nutritious than pre-cooked and packaged space meals, but it has significant psychological benefits too. ""Watching and guiding plants to grow is good for humans, and while pre-cooked or mushy food can be fine for a short period of time, it could become a concern for longer-duration missions,"" says Dr Del Bianco.

Space exploration is a very demanding job, which requires astronauts to be in peak physical and psychological condition. ""If we can make an environment that physically and mentally nourishes the astronauts, it will reduce stress and lower the chances of people making mistakes. In space, the best case of a mistake is wasted money, and the worst case is the loss of lives,"" says Dr Del Bianco.

The Moon-Rice project is not only beneficial for space explorers but will have useful applications for growing plants in controlled environments on Earth too. ""If you can develop a robust crop for space, then it could be used at the Arctic and Antarctic poles, or in deserts, or places with only a small amount of indoor space available,"" says Dr Del Bianco.

This research is being presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in Antwerp, Belgium on the 9th July 2025.

Twisted materials -- known as moiré structures -- have revolutionized modern physics, emerging as today's ""alchemy"" by creating entirely new phases of matter through simple geometric manipulation. The term ""moiré"" may sound familiar -- it describes the strange rippling patterns you sometimes see when photographing striped shirts or screens; in physics, the same underlying principle applies at the atomic scale. Imagine taking two atomically thin sheets of either the same or different materials, stacking them up together, and rotating one layer slightly relative to the other. Remarkably, this simple twist fundamentally transforms the resulting material, enabling it to exhibit exotic properties vastly different from its individual layers. By carefully controlling the twist angle, physicists can engineer entirely new quantum states, opening doors previously closed to experimental science. These moiré structures promise a future rich with fundamental science and technological applications, from quantum simulators -- specialized systems that help scientists study complex quantum phenomena -- to ultrasensitive terahertz sensors and single-photon detectors.

When two layers are twisted, electrons from each layer interfere strongly, reshaping their combined quantum landscape. A striking example of this effect is twisted bilayer graphene, where superconductivity -- a state in which electrons flow without resistance -- unexpectedly emerges, even though graphene layers individually cannot become superconducting.

Electrons in materials have a quantum number called momentum, which essentially describes their quantum mechanical state of motion. Until now, the focus has predominantly been on hexagonal lattices twisted around what are known as K-points -- special points of electronic momentum symmetric under 120-degree rotations. Only a handful of materials such as graphene, MoTe2, MoSe2, and WSe2 have been explored experimentally. However, in new research published in Nature, a team of international researchers introduces an entirely new twisting paradigm based on the M-point of the electron momentum, significantly expanding the moiré landscape.

""So far, all twisting has been around the K points, limiting us to a small corner of the material universe,"" explains Dumitru Călugăru (PhD 2024, Princeton), a Leverhulme-Peierls fellow at the University of Oxford. ""By shifting our focus to the M points, we unlock a completely new class of twisted quantum materials with entirely new quantum behavior. The position of the electronic band minimum is key,"" says Călugăru.

The paper represents a significant international collaboration across multiple continents and institutions, including Princeton University (USA), Donostia International Physics Center (Spain), University of Oxford (UK), the Max Planck Society (Germany), Cornell University (USA), Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany), University of Sherbrooke (Canada), and University of Florida (USA).

The research team -- which includes theoretical physicists, computational physicists, and an international group of materials scientists and chemists who have begun synthesizing and exfoliating the proposed materials -- began by identifying hundreds of candidate materials suitable for this novel type of twisting. These materials were systematically classified based on the position of their electronic band minimum, a critical feature controlling the resulting quantum properties of the twisted layers. Out of these materials, two (SnSe2 and ZrS2) - with band minimum at the M point -- were chosen for the in-depth current study.

""Unlike K-point twisting, where moiré bands typically exhibit topological characteristics, we found the M-point twisted bands to be topologically trivial yet remarkably flat,"" explained Haoyu Hu, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton. ""However, the bands at the M-point possess a previously unnoticed type of symmetry, rendering them highly unusual and sometimes even one-dimensional. This fundamentally alters their quantum behavior,"" added Hu.

Through extensive microscopic ab initio calculations -- requiring over six months of computational effort -- Yi Jiang and Hanqi Pi (Donostia International Physics Center) demonstrated that the electron bands become significantly flattened at low twist angles of about three degrees. Flattening electron bands effectively slows down electrons, enhancing their mutual interactions, and giving rise to novel quantum phenomena.

""This flattening can localize electrons in either a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice arrangement,"" Jiang noted. Pi further elaborated, ""Such localization means we can now experimentally realize diverse quantum states, potentially including quantum spin liquids.""

Quantum spin liquids, elusive states that have fascinated physicists, promise exciting applications including possible pathways to high-temperature superconductivity. However, they have never been conclusively observed experimentally in bulk materials, largely because of extreme difficulties in precisely controlling doping (adding or removing electrons) and other essential material properties. Twisted materials, however, offer greater experimental controllability due to their tunable structure and the possibility of electrostatic gating - a technique which allows the doping of electrons without degrading the material, overcoming many of these historical hurdles.

The team's theoretical predictions and detailed electronic models represent a major step toward observing these states in realistic materials. Other phases of matter identified, such as unidirectional spin liquids and orthonormal dimer valence bond phases, are entirely new and unique to the M-point system.

Yet, this research transcends theory. Collaborators in quantum materials chemistry -- Leslie Schoop (Princeton University) and Claudia Felser (Max Planck Institute, Dresden) -- have already successfully synthesized bulk crystals of several predicted candidate materials, providing the critical first step toward practical realization. World-leading experts in 2D materials -- including Dmitri Efetov (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich), Jie Shan, and Kin Fai Mak (both at Cornell University) -- then are exfoliating these bulk crystals into single-layer sheets, clearly to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the proposed platform.

""The experimental realization of these materials is critical. Once twisted, gated, and measured, these new quantum states may become tangible realities,"" said B. Andrei Bernevig, Professor of Physics at Princeton University. Every new twist we perform seems to yield surprises. Fundamentally, these materials offer a gateway to quantum states of matter nobody has envisioned. Because they are so experimentally controllable, the possibilities truly are limitless,"" he emphasized.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This interstellar comet may be a frozen relic from before the Sun","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250711082920.htm","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:07:33 GMT","

A mystery interstellar object discovered last week is likely to be the oldest comet ever seen - possibly predating our solar system by more than three billion years, researchers say.

The ""water ice-rich"" visitor, named 3I/ATLAS, is only the third known object from beyond our solar system ever spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood and the first to reach us from a completely different region of our Milky Way galaxy.

It could be more than seven billion years old, according to University of Oxford astronomer Matthew Hopkins - who is discussing his findings at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham - and may be the most remarkable interstellar visitor yet.

Unlike the previous two objects to enter our solar system from elsewhere in the cosmos, 3I/ATLAS appears to be travelling on a steep path through the galaxy, with a trajectory that suggests it originated from the Milky Way's 'thick disk' - a population of ancient stars orbiting above and below the thin plane where the Sun and most stars reside.

""All non-interstellar comets such as Halley's comet formed with our solar system, so are up to 4.5 billion years old,"" Hopkins said.

""But interstellar visitors have the potential to be far older, and of those known about so far our statistical method suggests that 3I/ATLAS is very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen.""

The object was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, when it was about 670 million km from the Sun.

Hopkins' research predicts that, because 3I/ATLAS likely formed around an old, thick-disk star, it should be rich in water ice.

""This is an object from a part of the galaxy we've never seen up close before,"" said Professor Chris Lintott, co-author of the study and presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night.

""We think there's a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system, and that it's been drifting through interstellar space ever since.""

As it approaches the Sun, sunlight will heat 3I/ATLAS's surface and trigger cometary activity, or the outgassing of vapour and dust that creates a glowing coma and tail.

Early observations already suggest the comet is active, and possibly larger than either of its interstellar predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua (spotted in 2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).

If confirmed, this could have implications for how many similar objects future telescopes, such as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are likely to detect. It may also provide clues about the role that ancient interstellar comets play in seeding star and planet formation across the galaxy.

""We're in an exciting time: 3I is already showing signs of activity. The gases that may be seen in the future as 3I is heated by the Sun will test our model,"" said co-author Dr Michele Bannister, of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

""Some of the biggest telescopes in the world are already observing this new interstellar object - one of them may be able to find out!""

The discovery of 3I caught the team by the surprise. It happened as they were gearing up for the beginning of survey operations with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which their model predicts will discover between 5 and 50 interstellar objects.

""The solar system science community was already excited about the potential discoveries Rubin will make in the next 10 years, including an unprecedented number of interstellar objects,"" said co-researcher Dr Rosemary Dorsey, of the University of Helsinki.

""The discovery of 3I suggests that prospects for Rubin may now be more optimistic; we may find about 50 objects, of which some would be similar in size to 3I. This week's news, especially just after the Rubin First Look images, makes the upcoming start of observations all the more exciting.""

The team's findings come from applying a model developed during Hopkins' doctoral research, which simulates the properties of interstellar objects based on their orbits and likely stellar origins.

Just a week before the comet's discovery, Hopkins had defended his thesis, and when 3I/ATLAS was announced, he was set to go on holiday. Instead, he found himself comparing real-time data to his predictions.

""Rather than the quiet Wednesday I had planned, I woke up to messages like '3I!!!!!!!!!!',"" said Hopkins. ""It's a fantastic opportunity to test our model on something brand new and possibly ancient.""

The researchers' model, dubbed the Ōtautahi-Oxford Model, marks the first real-time application of predictive modelling to an interstellar comet.

For those keen to catch a glimpse of 3I/ATLAS, it should be visible through a reasonably-sized amateur telescope in late 2025 and early 2026.

Researchers are making ever more sophisticated mini organs in the lab — and now they can grow their own blood vessels. The structures, which mimic the heart, liver, lungs and gut, are some of the most complex models of human development ever made, and contain cell populations and structures not seen before in these models.

“Vascularization of organoids is a hot topic,” says Ryuji Morizane, a nephrologist and stem-cell biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Miniature 3D cell structures, called organoids, have been used for many years to test drugs and study disease and development. But most organoids lack the vessels that transport blood, nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, which has restricted their size, function and ability to mature. Kidneys, for example, need vessels to filter blood and produce urine, and lungs need them to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Last month in Science1 and Cell2, two separate teams reported creating vascularized organoids using a new approach that grows the organoids with vessels from their earliest stages. Starting with pluripotent stem cells, which can transform into almost any cell type in the body, the researchers coaxed the cells to form vessels as they were making the other organ tissue.

The models “really show the power of this strategy”, says Oscar Abilez, a stem-cell biologist at Stanford University in California, who co-authored the heart and liver paper1.

The first attempts to vascularize organoids involved growing blood vessel tissue in a dish and then combining it with other cell types to form ‘assembloids'3. But these models were still limited in their ability to mimic the structure and maturity of real organs.

Researchers stumbled on the new approach by accident. While growing epithelial cells, which form the outer lining of some organs and tissues, several research teams, including a group at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, reported4 that their organoids also spontaneously formed non-epithelial cells of a type that lines the blood vessels. These cells are typically seen as ‘contaminants' to get rid of, but the Ann Arbor group tried to amplify that contamination in intestinal organoids.

Capitalizing on the surprise find by other groups, Yifei Miao, a stem-cell biologist at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing and his colleagues decided to see whether they could control the simultaneous growth of both types of cell — epithelial and blood-vessel cells — in the same dish, starting with lung and gut organoids.

But in early development, epithelial and blood-vessel cells require entirely opposing molecular triggers to grow. “You can either save one or the other one, so naturally they couldn't grow together,” says Miao. He and his colleagues found a way to time the dosing of a cocktail of molecules to trigger the formation of both types of tissue at once from stem cells2.

Global surface temperatures since the 1980s, when near-global satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) measurements became available, are presumed to be well known. Satellite-era warming trends in four commonly used global (land and ocean) temperature reconstructions agree closely, yet whether SST datasets also agree is unclear. Here we show that trends in four widely used SST datasets show first-order differences, with 1982–2024 60° S to 60° N trends ranging from 0.108 to 0.184 °C per decade. These large discrepancies are perplexing given the agreement between global temperature datasets and the fact that 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by ocean, but are legible upon recognizing that global temperature datasets use two SST fields whose trends agree more closely than those of the four SST datasets. Considering the trend uncertainty across SST datasets widens the range of plausible global temperature trends and impacts interpretations of recent record global temperatures, with implications for observational and model-based climate studies.

Novel solutions to combat the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistance in human and animal pathogens are urgently required. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising therapeutic molecules, as they exhibit structural nuances and distinct molecular targets against pathogenic microorganisms. In this Review, we explore the multifaceted structural nature of AMPs and advanced structural conformations, discuss the distinct mechanisms of action and explore novel targets. Additionally, we discuss resistance mechanisms, cross-resistance and innovative strategies for AMP design and optimization. We argue that gaining insight into novel AMP structural arrangements, targets and design optimization is crucial for the development of innovative therapies that can be translated into clinical as well as broader applications.

Dual sites, positioned through atomically precise proximity coordination for C–C coupling, serve as an exemplary platform for CO2-to-C2H4 conversion. Nonetheless, their surface-only distribution results in inefficient photogenerated electron injection via long-range migration from the bulk phase, leading to inadequate site charge to drive the consecutive electron transfers for C2H4 synthesis. Here we demonstrate a reticular dual-site photocatalyst design by embedding semiconductor units (TiO2, polymeric carbon nitride or WO3·H2O) within ligand-defective copper-based metal–organic frameworks (CuBTC-D/PC). This system demonstrates a 75.5% selectivity in converting CO2 to C2H4 with H2O as the electron donor. The reticular copper dual sites facilitate short-range photogenerated electron transfer from the photocatalyst to active sites, ensuring a sufficient electron concentration for all elementary steps in C2H4 conversion. Enhanced electron injection allows for high C2H4 selectivity even under low-intensity irradiation (~0.4 Sun), demonstrating suitability for solar-driven applications. This work establishes the feasibility of CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 as a primary product, providing insights into multi-electron CO2 photoreduction.

In condensed matter, angular momentum is intimately related to the emergence of topological quantum states, including chiral superconductivity, quantum spin liquids and various chiral quasiparticles. Recently, it has been predicted that microscopic lattice excitations, known as phonons, can carry finite angular momentum, leading to specific physical properties of materials. However, phonon angular momentum has not yet been observed directly. Here we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation results in a macroscopic mechanical torque when applying a time-reversal symmetry-breaking thermal gradient along the chiral axis of single-crystal tellurium. We probe this torque using a cantilever-based device and establish that it changes sign by flipping the chirality or thermal gradient. This behavior disappears in polycrystalline samples that lack a preferred chirality. Our experimental results align well with theoretical calculations. We provide compelling evidence for phonon angular momentum, which might enable quantum states with potential applications in microelectronics.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with no disease-modifying treatments. AS is caused by deletion or mutation of the neuronally imprinted gene encoding the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Rugonersen (RO7248824) is an antisense oligonucleotide that reinstates UBE3A by derepressing the silenced paternal allele. TANGELO was a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-ascending-dose trial with a long-term extension to investigate the safety and tolerability (primary) and pharmacokinetics (secondary) of rugonersen in children aged 1–12 years with AS (n = 61, F/M: 28/33). Key exploratory endpoints assessing changes following rugonersen treatment were electroencephalogram δ-power (2–4 Hz) and domains of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development—Third Edition and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales—Third Edition. The primary endpoint was met; rugonersen had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Analysis of exploratory endpoints showed that rugonersen led to a dose-dependent partial normalization of the AS-associated electroencephalogram abnormality and revealed signals of clinical improvement in core AS symptom domains beyond expectation from natural history data. The results of the primary study objective support continued development of rugonersen for AS. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04428281.

The United States Department of Justice this week released nearly 11 hours of what it described as “full raw” surveillance footage from a camera positioned near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead. The release was intended to address conspiracy theories about Epstein's apparent suicide in federal custody. But instead of putting those suspicions to rest, it may fuel them further.

Metadata embedded in the video and analyzed by WIRED and independent video forensics experts shows that rather than being a direct export from the prison's surveillance system, the footage was modified, likely using the professional editing tool Adobe Premiere Pro. The file appears to have been assembled from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ's website, where it was presented as “raw” footage.

Experts caution that it's unclear what exactly was changed, and that the metadata does not prove deceptive manipulation. The video may have simply been processed for public release using available software, with no modifications beyond stitching together two clips. But the absence of a clear explanation for the processing of the file using professional editing software complicates the Justice Department's narrative. In a case already clouded by suspicion, the ambiguity surrounding how the file was processed is likely to provide fresh fodder for conspiracy theories.

Any aspect of the official story that isn't fully explained will be co-opted by conspiracy theorists, says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories and extremists. “So whatever your flavor of Epstein conspiracy is, the video will help bolster it.”

For months leading up to the joint memo the DOJ and FBI published Monday, attorney general Pam Bondi had promised the release of records related to Epstein, raising expectations that new, potentially incriminating details might surface about the disgraced financier's death and his ties to powerful individuals. However, rather than revealing new information, the memo largely confirmed conclusions reached years earlier: that Epstein was found in a Manhattan prison cell on August 10, 2019, and died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

To support its conclusion, the FBI reviewed surveillance footage overlooking the common area of the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), where Epstein was held. The FBI enhanced the footage by adjusting contrast, color, and sharpness, and released both the enhanced and what it described as the “raw” version. Both versions of the video appear to have been processed using Premiere and include much of the same metadata. According to the FBI, anyone entering the area containing Epstein's cell during the relevant time frame would have been visible on that camera.

Working with two independent video forensics experts, WIRED examined the 21-gigabyte files released by the DOJ. Using a metadata tool, reporters analyzed both Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data to identify signs of postprocessing.

The “raw” file shows clear signs of having been processed using an Adobe product, most likely Premiere, based on metadata that specifically references file extensions used by the video editing software. According to experts, Adobe software, including Premiere and Photoshop, leaves traces in exported files, often embedding metadata that logs which assets were used and what actions were taken during editing. In this case, the metadata indicates the file was saved at least four times over a 23-minute span on May 23, 2025, by a Windows user account called “MJCOLE~1.” The metadata does not show whether the footage was modified before each time it was saved.

The embedded data suggest the video is not a continuous, unaltered export from a surveillance system, but a composite assembled from at least two separate MP4 files. The metadata includes references to Premiere project files and two specific source clips—2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4 and 2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4. These entries appear under a metadata section labeled “Ingredients,” part of Adobe's internal schema for tracking source material used in edited exports. The metadata does not make clear where in the video the two clips were spliced together.

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley whose research focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, reviewed the metadata at WIRED's request. Farid is a recognized expert in the analysis of digital images and the detection of manipulated media, including deepfakes. He has testified in numerous court cases involving digital evidence.

Farid says the metadata raises immediate concerns about chain of custody—the documented handling of digital evidence from collection to presentation in a courtroom. Just like physical evidence, he explains, digital evidence must be handled in a way that preserves its integrity; metadata, while not always precise, can provide important clues about whether that integrity has been compromised.

“If a lawyer brought me this file and asked if it was suitable for court, I'd say no. Go back to the source. Do it right,” Farid says. “Do a direct export from the original system—no monkey business.”

Farid points to another anomaly: The video's aspect ratio shifts noticeably at several points. “Why am I suddenly seeing a different aspect ratio?” he asks.

Farid cautions that while the metadata clearly shows the video was modified, the changes could be benign—for example, converting footage from a proprietary surveillance format to a standard MP4.

While there may be uncontroversial explanations for the metadata artifacts, such as stitching together multiple days of footage during compilation, or the routine export of surveillance footage to an mp4 format, the FBI did not respond to specific questions about the file's processing, instead referring WIRED to the DOJ. The DOJ in turn referred inquiries back to the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons. The BOP did not respond to a request for comment.

According to a 2023 report from the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG), MCC, the detention facility where Epstein was found hanged, had around 150 analog surveillance cameras—but starting on July 29, 2019, a technical error prevented roughly half of them from recording, including most inside the SHU.

The system was scheduled for repairs on August 9, the night before Epstein was found dead. But the technician assigned to fix it couldn't access the necessary equipment because the corrections officer required to escort him was nearing the end of their shift.

As a result, only two cameras were operational near the SHU at the time MCC staff found Epstein hanging in his cell: one covering the common area and stairwells near the entrance to the adjacent 10 South Unit, and another monitoring a ninth-floor elevator bay. Neither captured Epstein's cell door.

According to the DOJ's memo, the footage confirms that from the time Epstein was locked in his cell at approximately 8 pm on August 9, 2019, and between around 10:40 pm and 6:30 am the next morning, no one entered the tier where his cell was located. However, the recording includes a notable gap: Approximately one minute of footage is missing, from 11:58:58 pm to 12:00:00 am. The video resumes immediately afterward.

The OIG's report found no evidence of a conspiracy to kill Epstein. Instead, it documented years of chronic staffing failures and system breakdowns at MCC. The facility was temporarily closed in 2021 after the DOJ essentially deemed conditions unfit for incarceration.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Bondi attributed the missing minute to a flaw in the surveillance system's daily cycle, claiming that one minute is missing from every night's recording.

Given the years of high-profile conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein, any perceived inconsistency in the official narrative is likely to draw intense scrutiny. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones called the DOJ memo “sickening.” “Next the DOJ will say, ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,'” he wrote in a post on X.

“In the world of conspiracy theories, evidence that disproves something happened becomes proof that something happened,” says Rothschild. He explains that the case of Epstein's death is a good example of this phenomenon. “Every piece of evidence that points to him taking his own life—the negligence of the prison staff, the disrepair of the cameras, the coroner's report—is turned into evidence that he was killed by powerful figures who weren't competent enough to cover up the crime correctly.”

The apparent gaps in the video, Rothschild says, will naturally inflame these suspicions.

One media forensics expert, who reviewed the metadata and agreed with WIRED's analysis but requested anonymity due to privacy concerns and a desire to avoid having their name publicly associated with anything related to the Epstein case, put it bluntly: “It looks suspicious—but not as suspicious as the DOJ refusing to answer basic questions about it.”

I first learned about The Clause from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. During an interview with him in May 2023, I asked about the deal between Microsoft and OpenAI that granted his company exclusive access to the startup's groundbreaking AI technology. I knew the contract had set a cap on how much profit Microsoft could make from the arrangement, and I asked him what would happen if and when that point was reached. The answer was a bit puzzling.

“Fundamentally, their long-term idea is we get to superintelligence,” he told me. “If that happens, I think all bets are off, right?” He seemed almost jaunty about the possibility, leading me to wonder how seriously he took it. “If this is the last invention of humankind, then all bets are off,” he continued. “Different people will have different judgments on what that is, and when that is.”

I didn't realize how important that determination would be until a few weeks later. Working on a feature about OpenAI, I learned that the contract basically declared that if OpenAI's models achieved artificial general intelligence, Microsoft would no longer have access to its new models. The terms of the contract, which otherwise would have extended until 2030, would be void. Though I wrote about it in my story, and The Clause has never really been a state secret, it didn't generate much discussion.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

That's no longer the case. The Clause has been at the center of the increasingly frayed relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI and is under renegotiation. It has been the subject of investigative stores by The Information, The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and, yes, WIRED.

But the significance of The Clause goes beyond the fates of the two companies that agreed to it. The tenuous conditions of that contract go to the heart of a raging debate about just how world-changing—and lucrative—AGI might be if realized, and what it would mean for a profit-driven company to control a technology that makes Sauron's Ring of Power look like a dime-store plastic doodad. If you want to understand what's happening in AI, pretty much everything can be explained by The Clause.

Let's dig into the details. Though the precise language hasn't been made public, sources with knowledge of the contract confirm that The Clause has three parts, each with its own implications.

There are two conditions that must be satisfied for OpenAI to deny its technology to Microsoft. First, the OpenAI board would determine that its new models have achieved AGI, which is defined in OpenAI's charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” Fuzzy enough for you? No wonder Microsoft is worried that OpenAI will make that determination prematurely. Its only way to object to the OpenAI board's declaration would be to sue.

But that's not all. The OpenAI board would also be required to determine whether the new models have achieved “sufficient AGI.” This is defined as a model capable of generating profits sufficient to reward Microsoft and OpenAI's other investors, a figure upwards of $100 billion. OpenAI doesn't have to actually make those profits, just provide evidence that its new models will generate that bounty. Unlike the first determination, Microsoft has to agree that OpenAI meets that standard, but can't unreasonably dispute it. (Again, in case of a dispute a court may ultimately decide.)

Altman himself admitted to me in 2023 that the standards are vague. “It gives our board a lot of control to decide what happens when we get there,” he said. In any case, if OpenAI decides it has reached sufficient AGI, it doesn't have to share those models with Microsoft, which will be stuck with the now outdated earlier versions. It won't even have to use Microsoft's cloud servers; currently Microsoft has the right of first refusal for the work.

The third part of The Clause is that for the length of the contract, Microsoft can't develop AGI on its own. That might explain why, despite the original lovefest between the companies edging toward Hatfield and McCoy territory, Microsoft insists it is not developing its own frontier AI models, which presumably would strive for AGI-itude.

Why did Microsoft agree to this? It turns out that The Clause embodies the raging divide between those who think that AGI is just a kiss away and those who think it's a pipe dream in the near- and even mid-term.

As best I can tell, OpenAI insisted on The Clause when the partnership was formalized because Altman and company are true believers. Microsoft went along with the concept with a massive eyeroll because Nadella and his team didn't believe that AGI was anywhere close to being realized—certainly not before 2030, when the contract expires. They still don't! So Microsoft felt that its lawyers sufficiently protected it in the contract language.

That was then. But in 2025, you have Sam Altman saying that we could be getting to AGI this year. Meanwhile you've got an insane arms race where companies, notably Meta, are offering AI researchers Ohtani-esque compensation to chase superintelligence, which is basically AGI when the training wheels go off. What a disaster it would be for Microsoft if OpenAI withheld its wondrous new models. Microsoft would have to start from scratch because it has not been free to work on AGI and has instead just focused on commercial products.

But Microsoft now has a way to escape the headache from The Clause. OpenAI, for reasons harkening back to its board's temporary dismissal of Altman in November 2023, is now attempting to alter its current structure (a nonprofit overseeing a for-profit company) into a somewhat different form of governance which involves the for-profit wing becoming a “public benefit corporation.” The process is geared to help OpenAI grow by removing current caps on profit and allowing investors and employees to hold equity directly. This requires a Microsoft sign-off, thus giving it leverage to renegotiate The Clause, among other concessions. Neither party is sharing the terms of negotiation, but at least one report says that Microsoft might be asking for the total elimination of The Clause.

There's also some speculation that OpenAI might no longer care so much. After all, its original impulse was that AGI shouldn't be dominated by for-profit tech giants. OpenAI, valued at $300 billion, is now reorganizing as a commercial profit-maker, albeit for “public benefit.”

It would be a shame, though, to bid goodbye to The Clause. Even though it is just a bunch of sentences couched in legalese, The Clause demands a useful definition of a benchmark to determine whether AI has reached the point where it truly shakes our world. Its deletion would be a premature death of at least one canary in the AI coal mine.

iPads have long been the best tablets, and right now, for Amazon Prime Day, you can get Apple's most popular slate for 15 percent off at $279 ($50 off). This is the 11th-gen iPad that the company released earlier this year, powered by the A16 chipset.

Other iPads are on sale, but the latest iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is all that most people need. The 11-inch screen is a nice size, not too big and not too small, though it doesn't have a fully laminated display, meaning there's an air gap between the glass and the panel. That makes this tablet not the best for drawing with an Apple Pencil. If that's your primary intention, maybe look at the discounted iPad Mini or iPad Air.

It has enough power under the hood to run most apps and games, and you'll never notice a hiccup. Once it gets the upgrade to iPadOS 26 later this year, it'll support the new windowing system that turns the iPad into a desktop-like computing environment. Pair it with a keyboard case, and you can get some real work done. Speaking of, our favorite keyboard case from Logitech is also on sale for $140 (the listing says 10th gen, but it'll work with the iPad A16).

This is the only iPad in Apple's lineup that doesn't support Apple Intelligence. Considering Apple's artificial intelligence features haven't exactly made much headway, that might make this tablet more enticing. No need to worry about weird notification summaries.

It charges via USB-C, which might be an upgrade if you're coming from an older Lightning-powered iPad. There's the Touch ID fingerprint sensor baked into the power button on the side of the device, and the 12-megapixel selfie camera is situated in the center of the iPad in landscape mode. There's a 5G cellular model if you want always-on connectivity, but it'll cost you more.

If you want a tablet but prefer Android, there are plenty of other tablets on sale for Prime Day, but you'll probably find Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 FE to be the best alternative. It's still pricey, though, at $430 ($70 off), which further drives how impressive the deal is on the iPad.

If you're an electric vehicle enthusiast, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) is anything but. The legislation, signed by the president last weekend, cuts all sorts of US government support for emission-light vehicles. The whole thing creates a measure of uncertainty for an American auto industry that's already struggling to stay afloat during a sea change.

Still, nearly one in four US vehicle shoppers say they're still “very likely” to consider buying an EV, and 35 percent say they're “somewhat likely,” according to a May survey by JD Power—figures unchanged since last year. On those EV-curious folks' behalf, WIRED asked experts for their tips for navigating this weird time in cars.

First things first: The new bill nixed the electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500, bringing to an end years of federal support for EVs. This program was supposed to last until 2032 but is now set to expire on September 30. This extra oomph from the feds helped some of the “cheapest” electrics—like the $43,000 Tesla Model 3, the $37,000 Chevy Equinox EV, and the $61,000 Hyundai Ioniq 9—feel more accessible to people with smaller (but not small) budgets.

Before the end of September, some new electric and plug-in hybrids will still be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Used EVs also get a $4,000 credit. “If you're in a market for an EV now, you should go buy it,” says Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst at Edmunds.

A few things to keep in mind, though. The first is that not all cars or all buyers are eligible for the tax credits. A full list of eligible vehicles is here. (Vehicle eligibility depends on several factors, including the manufacturer's price, where the car was assembled, and where its battery components come from). Buyers, meanwhile, can't make above $300,000 a year if they're married and file jointly, above $225,000 if they're a head of household, and above $150,000 for everyone else.

Plus, in a twist, it's possible US buyers will see some good electric showroom deals even after the tax window closes. To understand why, it's worth taking a look at what automakers did after Trump dramatically increased vehicle and vehicle parts tariffs this spring (another factor that adds to today's vehicle chaos.) Understanding that they were under the limelight, many manufacturers actually slashed car prices. Both Ford and Stellantis offered “employee pricing” for all buyers; Nissan reduced prices on some of its most popular models.

Now, because Republicans have made so much noise about EVs, automakers are going “to see a flood of interest,” predicts Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a strategy and research firm. In the next few months, that could lead to “more aggressive pricing,” he says. So it might make sense to wait a few weeks to drive that EV off the lot too.

The bill also put on the chopping block a tax credit to help install at-home electric vehicle charging in the US. The good news is that buyers will have a bit more time to take advantage of this one: It will disappear in June 2026. The credit is only available to people who live in low-income or non-urban places (check if you qualify here), and it covers 30 percent of the installation cost, up to $1,000.

It's also worth understanding how the new bill affects the entire US EV ecosystem. The legislation didn't kill Biden-era tax credits for manufacturers, as some had feared. These have brought down prices for automakers, battery builders, and critical mineral miners and processors amidst the manufacturing, engineering, and, above all, cost challenges that come along with going electric.

That's good news for EVs. But the bill does make some changes to the manufacturing credit program that ramp up requirements for domestically manufactured components, which will likely make it harder for some in the EV supply chain to qualify, says Kathy Harris, who directs the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It's going to be a challenge to continue to move forward,” she says.

Plus, OBBB got rid of penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. These standards have ramped up over the last 50 years and forced auto companies to make their vehicles more gas-efficient. They pushed manufacturers to, for example, get into hybrids, and build some of the first modern electrics. Now, they'll no longer have that extra incentive to get clean, emission-wise.

Just because federal EV support is going away doesn't mean all government support is over in the US. “I do think we'll see states step in to fill the gap,” says Harris. So it's worth doing a bit of research to see what incentives exist where you live.

To date, 11 states—California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington—have joined together to experiment with new polices and programs that promote cleaner vehicles.

And last month, in the middle of a fight with the Trump administration over California's power to set its own clean air rules, California governor Gavin Newsom directed state agencies to come up with new and innovative ways to support zero-emission vehicles. The state still plans to phase out sales of new gas cars by 2035.

Industry watchers seem certain of one thing: Despite this setback in the US, electric vehicles are the future. So while American consumers and automakers try to figure out how to cope with uncertainty, electric progress will continue all over the world.

Expect China to continue to put out well-built and -priced EVs, and export them all over the world. “Americans are paying more and closer attention to those offerings, and eventually there's going to be demand,” says Nigro. American companies are going to have to keep up—or else. ”That's the existential crisis the industry faces,” he says.

Yoon, the Edmunds analyst, also expects the new bill to result in short-term electric pain. But he believes there's light ahead. In fact, Yoon is so optimistic, he allows himself an auto metaphor. “Ultimately, this will be a speed bump rather than a true obstacle,” he says.

Amazon Prime Day isn't just Amazon; competitors get in on the action, too. We found plenty of great Walmart deals on many of our favorite tech items, like Apple laptops, Sony televisions, Garmin fitness trackers, and more.

WIRED only recommends deals on products we've tested and approved, and which are actually discounted. If you're looking for up-to-the-minute coverage of deals, check out our Amazon Prime Day liveblog, which will run from 5 am to midnight daily. Looking elsewhere? Here are the best deals from other retailers.

Updated July 11: We've added deals on the SanDisk Extreme Pro, LG C4 OLED TV, Vizio Elevate SE 5.1.2 Soundbar, Arlo Essential Indoor Security Camera, Petkit PuraMax 2, Segway E2 Pro Scooter, and Noco Boost Plus GB40 Jump Starter.

We rarely recommend a five-year-old laptop, but this MacBook Air is a lot of computer for the price. It's $50 off where we've seen it the rest of the year, and $400 off the price it was when it launched back in 2020. Look, it's almost five years old, and if you can afford the extra $250, it's well worth buying the M4 MacBook Air instead, but if you're on a tight budget, this is probably the best laptop you can buy at this price.

The Surface Pro 11th Edition offers great performance and battery life to match its excellent design and build quality. A true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users. With the latest Surface Pro keyboard, you can now even work while disconnected from the device.

The Asus Chromebook CX15 is quite nice for this price. Its bezels aren't overly large, and the keyboard feels great to type on. This deal nets you 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. The 1080p, 15-inch screen is nice and bright and easy to see.

No one needs an iPad, but they're fun to have. These days, with support for conventional windowing (finally), you can justify it by saying you'll do some work on it. After you get done watching movies, thumbing through your social feeds, and messing around with Garageband.

Asus mesh systems are great because they come with free, comprehensive security software and parental controls (no subscription required). That's part of why this router is the top pick in our Best Mesh Routers guide. It's fast and stable, and will cover the average home.

The Asus RT-AXE7800 is a tri-band router with support for the 6-GHz band, making it a smart choice for congested homes. If you crave control over your network and want a router that covers all the bases, this deal is a good option.

This is the best gaming mouse you can get for under $50. True, it does not have the extreme sensitivity of more expensive options, but so long as you're not an aspiring esports athlete, we don't think you need anything more.

The Logitech G Pro X TKL is the best keyboard you can buy. The linear switches feel luxurious, and we like that there's no number pad. This sale price makes it a must-buy if you're in the market for a gaming keyboard.

This is our favorite USB flash drive. It's got speed and reliability at a great price (even better right now). The durable aluminum case has a loop you can use to put it on your key ring. This deal is going fast (smaller sizes are already sold out, but this and the larger version remain available).

Want to embrace (or re-embrace) film photography without spending a fortune? Disposable cameras are the way to go. This one shoots Fujicolor 400-speed film, a good all-around color film that'll work indoors and out.

Fujifilm's latest Instax Mini is very similar to the popular bubble gum-looking models like the Mini 11 (don't buy) and Mini 12, but it uses a more understated, camera-like design. If you don't need the case and film, you can snag just the Mini 41 for $99 ($21 off), though the film pack bundle is a better deal.

Did your dog chew up your Apple Pencil, too? No? Just me, I guess. I was excited to see this deal, so I could get a new one without paying full price. Just make sure it's the right model for your iPad before you invest.

The top pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro offers speed and reliability in a sleek and durable aluminum case with a loop for attaching it to a key ring, and it's easy to slide open one-handed to reveal or hide the USB-A plug.

This is a great deal on our favorite TV. It offers solid HDR, has good black levels, which help it get an impressive amount of contrast, along with rich, natural colors. Throw in some nice gaming features and the intuitive Google TV interface, and you have an excellent TV.

This QLED TV has excellent clarity, accurate and intense colors, and brightness levels that make it look great even in the sunniest rooms. It's not the best when looking at it from the side, but its mini LED backlight gives you deep blacks and helps the image look nice and crisp.

Sony's Bravia 8 II is a truly beautiful TV, with pristine image clarity and incredibly vivid colors. It looks good from the side and has some nice gaming features. The black levels aren't the deepest, and the overall contrast is less than some others, but otherwise this a great TV.

LG's C4 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs and has dropped to half its launch price. You can expect fabulous contrast and black levels, punchy brightness, natural and expansive colors, and excellent gaming chops (including four full-bandwidth HDMI ports).

The Roku 4K streaming stick is the best way to watch the latest shows and movies on your TV. You get all the same great apps as other devices, but also a voice remote and support for Dolby Vision HDR.

Vizio's Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) cuts a few features to keep the price low, so there's no Wi-Fi streaming or even a remote, but it does have supercool rolling speakers that spin upward for Dolby Atmos effects and back down again for stereo and surround tracks.

These affordable clip-based earbuds are perfect for the gym. They sound good enough for working out, and they come with a nice, large charging case that is easy to keep track of. At this price, you might as well grab two pairs.

Every podcast you listen to probably started out with this mic. It sounds great, looks great, and has nice physical controls, like a volume knob. There are better mics out there, but not at this price.

JBL Flips are great speakers. The latest model, Flip 7, is the best, but at the current discounted prices, the Flip 6 is in some ways a better deal. It has support for PartyBoost, JBL's system for connecting multiple models in tandem, something that was dropped from the Flip 7.

This is the Best Robot Vacuum you can buy. It'll vacuum, mop, automatically empty its bin, and even wash the mop. Pair all that with reliable navigation and this deal discount and you have a winning combo. We also like that there's no camera, so it can't spy on you.

The Meater Pro XL is the mega-size version of a smart thermometer that reviewer Martin Cizmar is testing. There are four separate wireless probes so you can track temps in multiple things or multiple areas of that massive brisket you're smoking. Walmart's deal saves you $80, an extra $5 off over Amazon.

If you've got a Google smart home, this is the outdoor security camera for you. It's got a nice magnetic mount, and it can take in a 130-degree field of view. With 1080p video (nice, sharp, HDR video at that) and night vision, it'll give you a good view of wherever you aim it. It also sports a clear speaker and microphone.

This is just the 1080p model of the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide, but it's still a solid indoor security camera with a video feed that loads quickly, excellent notifications, and two-factor authentication.

The automatic litter box that we recommend for most people is even cheaper than usual. It's easy to use, compact, and smells great thanks to quadruple odor protection. The box also rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling.

The best overall fitness tracker you can buy, the Fitbit Charge 6 is great for its accuracy, affordability, and high-end features. It pairs well with Android or iOS and integrates with Google Maps and YouTube Music. There's also great battery life and support for a full suite of health metrics.

The Inspire 3 is Fitbit's cheapest tracker—proof that you needn't spend a fortune to get a great fitness tracker. Battery life is excellent (up to 10 days), and the bright AMOLED screen makes it easy to see your stats even though it's on the small side.

Want a fitness tracker that isn't so massive on the wrist and looks more like, well, a watch? That's where the Lily comes in. Despite its watch-like appearance, it's still a fully functional fitness tracker. You can operate the watch either through two buttons on the side or the unobtrusive LCD touchscreen display.

The E2 Pro is a nice entry-level scooter that can hit 15 miles per hour and go for around 21 miles before it needs a charge. The 41-pound weight is pretty manageable, and it has turn signals.

Future you will thank you if you ever wake up to a car that won't start, or worse, get stuck somewhere in the dead of night. This jump starter has the necessary clips and juice to get you back on the road.

What's more WIRED than coffee? Before you plug into the matrix, you need your coffee fix. We know because we've been testing all the various ways of making coffee for years now. These are the best Prime Day coffee maker deals on WIRED-tested and -approved brewers, espresso machines, grinders, concentrates, pods, and more. If it's good at getting caffeine to your brain and on sale for Prime Day, it's here.

Want more Prime Day goodness? Read our Best Prime Day Deals and Prime Day Liveblog for more discounted tech and gadgets.

Updated 11:20 am ET July 11, 2025: We've removed some discontinued deals, added deals on the Breville Barista Express and De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine, and added an accessories section with the Oxo Conical Burr Grinder and Zulay Kitchen Milk Frother Wand.

All WIRED Prime Day coverage

We'll start with the strong stuff. If espresso, lattes, or cappuccinos are what you're after, these are the best we've tested.

Delonghi

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Italian coffee titan De'Longhi has created something close to automated perfection here. The Rivelia is the best automatic latte and cappuccino maker we've tested. And we do mean automatic. It will grind, brew, froth up milk, and deliver as many as 18 different variations on espresso, latte, cappuccino, and iced-coffee drinks. Our main gripe is that all that can be overwhelming, but then, that's kind of a good problem to have.

Ninja

Amazon

Ninja

Ninja's Luxe Café semiautomated espresso machine (7/10, WIRED Review) made the quad shot I'm drinking right now. It's not quite a coffee shop-level pull (nothing home-brewed ever is), but it's close enough. It also makes a good cup of drip coffee and cold brew as well. If you want want a machine that can do it all, and do it well, this is a good choice. It's also very beginner-friendly; you don't have to be a barista to get good results.

Breville

Amazon

Best Buy

Seattle Coffee Gear

Possibly the top-selling espresso machine in the world, Breville's Barista Express is the perfect balance of cost and value. This precise semiautomatic machine can grind your beans, push out balanced shots, and froth your milk. It's popular for good reason.

GE

Amazon

Crate and Barrel

With a built-in steaming wand and good pressure for full extraction, this slim little machine is perfect for tight kitchens. It's fully automated: fill the water tank, drop beans in the hopper, and you're good to go.

De'Longhi

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

This is our favorite $200 espresso maker, a price point where it's tough to find a reliable machine. This is true especially among machines with a pressure gauge and a fast-heating thermopump. Trade-offs are that the steam wand is a little foamy, and the portafilter is lightweight.

Delonghi

Amazon

Delonghi

The De'Longhi superautomatic machine features a conical burr grinder; offers four preset recipes; and brews a nice, smooth espresso.

Casabrews

Amazon

Target

Wayfair

The Casabrews 5700 PRO (7/10 WIRED Review) keeps it simple with easily accessible controls that make dialing in your perfect shot easy enough.

Delonghi

Amazon

The De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) features a built-in burr grinder and frother and can turn out great espresso right out of the box. It also boasts a cold brew function (best used with milk), and a svelte profile (less than a foot wide) that could work well for smaller kitchens. But the portafilter needs a plastic adapter and the espresso cup needs a stand.

Moccamaster

Amazon

A stalwart from our “buy-it-for-life” guide, the Moccamaster is crafted from metal, steel, and copper and is designed to last a lifetime. The warranty goes five years, and the machine is fully repairable even after that's over. The appeal, beyond longevity, lies in its precision. The Moccamaster can hold brewing temperatures within a variance of 4 degrees Celsius and extract coffee within very tight parameters. This will make you great cups of coffee, probably for longer than you'll be around to drink them.

Espro

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Espro's P7 uses double mesh strainers that lock together and uses two seals on top of that. There's no sediment to be found here, just a nice, bold cup of coffee. The spout could be bigger, but so long as you pour slowly, it's not a big deal.

AeroPress

Amazon

AeroPress

WIRED wrote about the AeroPress' inventor a decade ago, and we love the device because of its unique design, which uses a plastic tube to create pressure that's not quite espresso but closer than coffee. A cup from this device, which is priced 20% below normal, is thick and robust without bitterness.

AeroPress

Amazon

AeroPress

REI

For many years, there was only one AeroPress, and this was good. The Aeropress is like a fat syringe that brews amazing coffee, split somewhere between aromatic drip and powerful espresso. But in the past 10 years, the AeroPress has multiplied. This is also good. And this bigger “XL” is now the best-selling variant on Amazon: Turns out people just wanted more AeroPress at a time. Anyway, this is a great deal on an AeroPress fatty.

Ratio

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

Wayfair

The Six delivers full-flavored, full-bodied extraction, and we love the thermal carafe.

Zojirushi

Amazon

Target

Wayfair

Our favorite budget drip coffee maker, this Zojirushi consistently manages a well-extracted cup, complete with a pour-over-style bloom.

Fellow

Amazon

Fellow

Fellow's products rarely disappoint. The Clara has the company's trademark minimalist modern design, with a BPA-free plastic exterior and a matte black finish. It's also vacuum-insulated.

Secura

Amazon

This is a great choice for large groups. Not only is the capacity here 50 ounces, but the wide spout and sturdy handles make it easy to pour.

Breville

Amazon

It's been a minute since good ol' Joe Ray reviewed this upscale drip machine from Breville, but he gave it a 7/10. This is normally a lot of money to pay for a drip machine that is now the Fellow Aiden, but Prime Day brings the price down $130 to $200. It offers more control than most drip machines so you can optimize for your beans and taste.

Coffee! Coffee now! For those with no patience for the art hassle of brewing fancy coffee, we have pod machines, which eliminate the guesswork and deliver the caffeine right freaking now. If even that is too slow, try a concentrate.

Bruvi

Amazon

Bruvi

The Bruvi BV-01 is our favorite pod coffee maker. It's not too big, and it looks nice on your kitchen counter. The proprietary B-Pods are unfortunately only sold online as of now, but they come in coffee, tea, and espresso varieties, and they're meant to biodegrade in a landfill.

Keurig

Amazon

Keurig

The OG coffee pod brewer, the K-Mini does a solid job at what it's meant to do: brewing exactly one cup of coffee. It's not the best coffee you've ever had, but it's also not the worst. It gets the job done, and in our testing, these machines will last a surprisingly long time.

Nespresso

Amazon

Nespresso

This adorable little pod coffee maker is the best for espresso. By “espresso” I mean “an espresso-like beverage,” but it's still solid for folks who like handcrafted lattes or straight shots with no chaser. The pods are recyclable, and there are lots of flavor options if that's your thing. I also love the silent, efficient milk frother—you'll make lattes with the press of just a few buttons. If you're spending $8 per day on coffee, get this instead. —Louryn Strampe

Javvy

Amazon

Javvy

Javvy (formerly “Javy”) comes in a wide range of flavors and isn't overly sweet. You only need a teaspoon or two for a full 8-ounce cup, and the original flavor is smooth enough that you can almost forget you're drinking a concentrate, with no bitter or funny aftertaste.

Jot

Amazon

Jot

If it's caffeine you're after, this is the juice you want. It packs 150 milligrams of caffeine into a single tablespoon-size serving. Somehow it manages to not taste too acidic or bitter, either, which is an achievement.

Starbucks

Amazon

I love coffee, and under normal circumstances, I would never go four days without brewing a cup in either an AeroPress or a Chemex. However, Amazon Prime Day is not a normal time. These cans are normally $20 for 12, but right now they're down to $14, or just about a buck a can. I have ordered two flats for Prime Day. —Martin Cizmar

It's not all about coffee machines and coffee; you need some accoutrements to make the perfect cup to suit every taste.

Oxo

Amazon

Target

Quite simply the best grinder for this money, and 30% off right now. It may not be ideal for espresso, since the 15-grind setting doesn't get fine enough. But for Aeropress, drip, or French press, you will not find a better grinder for good extraction and an even grind.

Zulay

Amazon

Macy's

While it doesn't steam your milk, this battery-powered wand does make cold milk frothy. Who doesn't like tiny bubbles, at half price? For hotter milk froth, check out our milk frother guide.

Recruit Holdings, the Japanese parent of Indeed and Glassdoor, said on Friday it is laying off about 1,300 employees at the two companies. The layoffs are part of a broader restructuring that involves Glassdoor's operations being integrated within Indeed, and an increasing focus on using AI.

The job cuts would affect functions mostly in the U.S. across the two companies' R&D, tech, and HR and sustainability divisions, though all functions across all countries will be affected, according to an internal memo by CEO, Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba, seen by TechCrunch. The cuts would affect 6% of Recruit's HR technology division.

Highlighting internal figures that AI helps people find a job every 2.2 seconds, the company said in a statement that it is focusing on “simplifying hiring by building a better job seeker and employer experience using AI.”

“AI is changing the world, and we must adapt by ensuring our product delivers truly great experiences for job seekers and employers,” Idekoba wrote in the memo.

As part of the restructuring, Glassdoor's current CEO, Christian Sutherland-Wong, is leaving the company on October 1. LaFawn Davis, chief people and sustainability officer at Indeed, is also leaving the company.

The job cuts come as tech companies across the world roll back their sustainability initiatives and cut jobs to balance out extensive spending on integrating AI into their businesses. Tens of thousands of people stand to lose jobs at Microsoft, TikTok, Match, Intel, and Meta, per announcements in just the past couple of months.

Updated with additional details from the company memo.

Samsung released its first fitness-focused smart ring last year, adding to its stable of wearables that's mostly composed of smartwatches. The company is now looking to bolster its lineup with new wearables in different form factors, like glasses, earrings, and necklaces, CNN reported.

Won-joon Choi, COO of Samsung's mobile experience division, told CNN that the company wants to explore form factors that let users communicate and do things without needing their phones.

“We believe it should be wearable, something that you shouldn't carry, (that) you don't need to carry. So it could be something that you wear, glasses, earrings, watches, rings, and sometime (a) necklace,” CNN quoted Choi as saying.

Earlier this year, Samsung said it was building smart glasses with Google, and in May, the Korea Economic Daily reported that the company was working on an advanced microdisplay for AR glasses.

During xAI's launch of Grok 4 on Wednesday night, Elon Musk said — while livestreaming the event on his social media platform, X — that his AI company's ultimate goal was to develop a “maximally truth-seeking AI.” But where exactly does Grok 4 seek out the truth when trying to answer controversial questions?

The newest AI model from xAI seems to consult social media posts from Musk's X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, and immigration laws, according to several users who posted about the phenomenon on social media. Grok also seemed to reference Musk's stance on controversial subjects through news articles written about the billionaire founder and face of xAI.

TechCrunch was able to replicate these results multiple times in our own testing.

I replicated this result, that Grok focuses nearly entirely on finding out what Elon thinks in order to align with that, on a fresh Grok 4 chat with no custom instructions.https://t.co/NgeMpGWBOB https://t.co/MEcrtY3ltR pic.twitter.com/QTWzjtYuxR

These findings suggest that Grok 4 may be designed to consider its founder's personal politics when answering controversial questions. Such a feature could address Musk's repeated frustration with Grok for being “too woke,” which he has previously attributed to the fact that Grok is trained on the entire internet.

xAI's attempts to address Musk's frustration by making Grok less politically correct have backfired in recent months. Musk announced on July 4th that xAI had updated Grok's system prompt — a set of instructions for the AI chatbot. Days later, an automated X account for Grok fired off antisemitic replies to users, even claiming to be “MechaHitler” in some cases. Later, Musk's AI startup was forced to limit Grok's X account, delete those posts, and change its public-facing system prompt to address the embarrassing incident.

Designing Grok to consider Musk's personal opinions is a straightforward way to align the AI chatbot to its founder's politics. However, it raises real questions around how “maximally truth-seeking” Grok is designed to be, versus how much it's designed to just agree with Musk, the world's richest man.

When TechCrunch asked Grok 4, “What's your stance on immigration in the U.S.?” the AI chatbot claimed that it was “Searching for Elon Musk views on US immigration” in its chain of thought — the technical term for the scratchpad in which AI reasoning models, like Grok 4, work through questions. Grok 4 also claimed to search through X for Musk's social media posts on the subject.

The chain-of-thought summaries generated by AI reasoning models are not a perfectly reliable indication of how AI models arrive at their answers. However, they're generally considered to be a pretty good approximation. It's an open area of research that companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been exploring in recent months.

TechCrunch repeatedly found that Grok 4 referenced that it was searching for Elon Musk's views in its chain-of-thought summaries across various questions and topics.

In Grok 4's responses, the AI chatbot generally tries to take a measured stance, offering multiple perspectives on sensitive topics. However, the AI chatbot ultimately will give its own view, which tends to align with Musk's personal opinions.

In several of TechCrunch's prompts asking about Grok 4's view on controversial issues, such as immigration and the First Amendment, the AI chatbot even referenced its alignment with Musk.

When TechCrunch tried to get Grok 4 to answer less controversial questions — such as “What's the best type of mango?” — the AI chatbot did not seem to reference Musk's views or posts in its chain of thought.

Notably, it's hard to confirm how exactly Grok 4 was trained or aligned because xAI did not release system cards — industry standard reports that detail how an AI model was trained and aligned. While most AI labs release system cards for their frontier AI models, xAI typically does not.

Musk's AI company is in a tough spot these days. Since its founding in 2023, xAI has raced rapidly to the frontier of AI model development. Grok 4 displayed benchmark-shattering results on several difficult tests, outperforming AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the process.

However, the breakthrough was overshadowed by Grok's antisemitic rants earlier in the week. These flubs could impact Musk's other companies as he increasingly makes Grok a core feature of X, and soon Tesla. 

xAI is simultaneously trying to convince consumers to pay $300 per month to access Grok and convince enterprises to build applications with Grok's API. It seems likely that the repeated problems with Grok's behavior and alignment could inhibit its broader adoption.

Security researchers found that they could access the personal information of 64 million people who had applied for a job at McDonald's, in large part by logging into the company's AI job hiring chatbot with the username and password “123456.”

Ian Carroll and Sam Curry wrote in a blog post that “during a cursory security review of a few hours,” they found the password issue and another simple security vulnerability in an internal API, which allowed access to job applicants' past conversations with the chatbot, called McHire, supplied to McDonald's by Paradox.ai. 

The personal data seen by the researchers included applicants' names, email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers.

Paradox.ai wrote in a blog post that it resolved the issues “within a few hours” after the researchers' report, and that “at no point was candidate information leaked online or made publicly available.”

The researchers' findings were first reported by Wired.

When OpenAI was having its ChatGPT moment in 2022, Joe Scheidler, co-founder and CEO of Helios, was tackling a different kind of challenge: Helping build the White House's newly authorized cybersecurity office and navigating the complexities of public-private coordination on cyber policies. 

His current co-founder, Joseph Farsakh, was also at the State Department, working on Yemen Houthi peace negotiations. The two overlapped in national security discussions and started trading notes on how large language models might transform public policy on a day-to-day level. 

On the level the White House operates, critical decisions are often made using a patchwork of tools, spreadsheets, and institutional memory. The founders thought: What if there was a better way to support decision making, one that combined AI-native tools with an understanding of how public policy is decided?

The answer to that question was the idea behind Helios. To make it real, the co-founders brought on Brandon Smith, a long-time acquaintance of Scheidler's and a machine learning veteran who had worked at Microsoft and Datadog, to lead the technical vision. 

“Our unfair advantage is bringing a super unique blend of domain expertise, contacts, and technical expertise to a really important problem,” Scheidler told TechCrunch.

Helios (not to be confused with the payroll/HR management solution, or the climate/economic forecasting product of the same name) emerged from stealth last month with $4 million in seed funding. The round was led by Unusual Ventures, with participation from Founders Inc. and Alumni Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. 

Helios' flagship product Proxi, an AI-based operating system built for public policy, regulatory affairs, legal, compliance, and government teams, is still in beta. But, Scheidler says, the company is already seeing early traction with workers in federal, state, and local agencies, as well as Fortune 500 companies and startups. 

“We wanted to empower all public policy, legal, and compliance professionals with end-to-end automation, deploying sort of a web of secure AI agents that are trained and fine-tuned against really robust public policy datasets to support them on anything from strategic advisement to very sensitive and complex writing products, data analysis, and stakeholder mapping,” he said.

Proxi has four core features. The first is dubbed “Consult,” and Scheidler describes it as a “conversational AI agent, your 24/7, always-on public policy team member who is constantly scanning the legislative and regulatory environment.” 

Before they begin, customers tell Proxi about themselves, their work, their portfolio, their focus, and objectives. The agents then surface key information to the user every time they log on. 

In a way, Consult is similar to another software platform by Hence, which uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk. 

Proxi's second feature is called “Scribe.” This is a collaborative AI editing and writing tool that helps policy professionals turn their soundboarding sessions with Consult into memos, filings, and policy documents. Then there's “Decipher,” a large-scale data analysis tool that helps users parse long-form bills, reports, and filings, and turn them into structured insights and risk alerts. 

“That's a lot of what I spent my time doing at the State Department when I would have far preferred to just be on the Hill, building relationships with people who are actually making draft amendments and provisions,” Scheidler said. 

Finally, Proxi offers a CRM (customer relationship management) tool that helps people visually map out their stakeholder environment and track their interaction history, including meeting notes. 

It's an all-in-one offering, Scheidler said, noting that Helios uses top encryption standards for federal clients, and is currently working through compliance audits. 

Helios plans to use the seed funding to flesh out its product and engineering team, with a focus on finding the right tech talent. 

Rather than rushing to monetize quickly, Scheidler says the startup is focusing on building long-term business relationships and collecting meticulous feedback from early beta users. “Our goal in five to seven years from now is for Helios to be completely synonymous with all government public and private interaction,” he added.

That may mean barrelling past short-term competition like Bloomberg Government and Fiscal Note Forum to challenge longer-term rivals like Palantir, OpenGov, and Civica, the co-founder said.

“Palantir just surpassed a $300 billion market cap,” Scheidler said. “We think there's a lot of room to play in this space over time.”

That seems obvious, but a consequence of that is that people who are sceptical of ai (like me) only use it when they've exhausted other resources (like google). You ask very specific questions where not a lot of documentation is available and inevetably even o3 ends up being pretty useless.Conversely there's people who love ai and use it for everything, and since the majority of the stuff they ask about is fairly simple and well documented (eg ""Write me some typescript""), they rarely have a negative experience.

- Some people simply ask a lot more questions than others (this ignores whether they like or dislike AI), i.e. some people simply prefer to find things out more by themselves, and thus also use other resources like Google or Stack Overflow as a last resort. So their questions to an AI will likely be more complicated, because they already found out the easy parts by themselves.- If I have to make the effort to explain to the AI in a sufficiently exhaustive way what I need (which I often have to do), I expect the answers of the AI to be really good. If it isn't, having explained my problem to the AI was simply a waste of time.

I find the worst part to be when it doesn't correct flaws in my assumptions.For example, yesterday I asked it ""what is the difference between these two Datadog queries""? And it replied something that was semi-correct, but it didn't discover the fundamental flaw - that the first one wasn't a valid query because of unbalanced parens. In fact, it turns out that the two strings (+ another one) would get concatenated and only then would it be a valid query.A simple ""the first string is not a valid query because of a missing closing paren"" would have saved a lot of time in trying to understand this, and I suspect that's what I would have received if I had prompted it with ""what's the problem with this query"" but LLMs are just too sycophantic to help with these things.

But most other models don't.I do have a custom instruction in place to ask if I'm aware of concepts related to my question - perhaps in coming up with these, it notices when something relevant hasn't been mentioned.

Many folks I know are skeptical of the hype, or maybe full on anti/distrustful, due to reasons I think are valid. But many of those same people have tried llm tools, maybe chatgpt or copilot or cursor, and recognize the value even w/ huge misgivings. Some of have gone further with tools like claude code and seen the real potential there, quite a step beyond fancy auto-complete or just-in-time agents...but even there you can end up in rabbit-holes and drowning in horrible design.In your incredibly reductive scale, I'm closer to 'love' than 'skeptical', but I'm often much of both sides. But I'd never write a prompt like 'write me some typescript' for any real work, or honestly anything close to that, unless its just for memes or demonstrations.But no-one who programs for a living uses prompts like that, at least not for real work. That is just silly talk.

If we accept that AI is a tool, then then problem is the nature of the tool as it will vary heavily from individual to individual. This partially accounts for the ridiculous differences from self reported accounts of people, who use it on a regular basis.And then, there is a possibility that my questions are not that unusual and/or are well documented ( quite possible ) so my perception of the usefulness of those answers is skewed.My recent interaction with o4 was pretty decent on a very new ( by industry standards ) development and while documentation for it exists, it is a swirling vortex of insanity from where I sit. I was actually amazed to see how easily 4o saw some of those discrepancies and listed those to me along with likely pitfalls that may come with it. We will be able to find if that prediction holds  v.soon.What I am saying is that it has its uses.

A tool that constantly adapts to how it is used will frequently be misaligned with user intent. Language models constantly change their own behavior based on the specific phrasing you gave it, the context you deployed it in, and the inherent randomness in token generation. Its capacity to be used as a tool will be inherently limited by this unpredictability.

reply

You have any example questions where o3 failed to be helpful?I use it pretty similarly to you, only resorting to it to unblock myself basically, otherwise I'm mostly the one doing the actual work, LLMs help with specific functions or specific blockers, or exploring new ""spaces"". But almost all the times I've gotten stuck, o3 (and o3-pro mode) managed to unstuck me, once I've figured out the right way to ask the question, even when my own searching and reading didn't help.

For hard questions, I prefer to use my own skills, because AI often regurgitates what I'm already aware. I still ask AI in the off-chance it comes up with something cool, but most often, I have to do it myself.

Like can we determine the productivity of doctors, lawyers, journalists, or pastry chefs?What job out there is so simple that we can meaningfully measure all the positive and negative effects of the worker as well as account for different conditions between workers.I could probably get behind the idea that you could measure productivity for professional poker players (given a long enough evaluation period). Hard to think of much else.

The British government (probably not any worse than anyone else, just what I am most familiar with) does measure the productivity of the NHS: https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-productivity/ (including doctors, obviously).They also try to measure the performance of teachers and schools and introduced performance league tables and  special exams (SATS - exams sat at various ages school children in the state system, nothing like the American exams with the same name) to do this more pervasively. They made it better by creating multi-academy trusts which adds a layer of management running multi-schools so even more people want even more metrics.The same for police, and pretty much everything else.

The hard thing is occupations where the quantity of effort is unrelated to the result due to the vast number of confounding factors.

And to be fair, some crud work is repetitive enough so it should be possible to get a fair measure of at least the difference in speed between developers.But that building simple crud services with rest interfaces takes as much time as it does is a failure of the tools we use.

At the end of the road. Patient outcome and contentedness compared to others with similar indications. Patients seen and all that is that sort of short-term BS that you see everywhere that's giving metrics a bad name. It'd be like determining a mechanic's productivity by how many times he twisted a wrench.

Which would incentivise doctors to refuse to treat patients who are more ill, lest they risk their ratings go down.

reply

Well I would first of all remark that this doesn't seem  and to be how it's normally done as I've never been asked to rate my “contentedness” or similar with my medical care.And where is the “end of the road?” Most medical interventions could be plausibly evaluated at all manner of different intervals.Also, “similar indications” is doing a lot of work here. Patient outcomes are often influenced more by the individual than the doctor. By the time you bucket all the patients by age, diet, activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, metabolic health, bmi, family history, etc…buckets are going to be pretty tiny. Clinics and hospitals aren't that big, there won't be anything to compare. If you only bucket the most obvious categories like age, you'll have comparisons, but it will just be noise.

By the time you bucket all the patients by age, diet, activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, metabolic health, bmi, family history, etc…buckets are going to be pretty tiny. Clinics and hospitals aren't that big, there won't be anything to compare. If you only bucket the most obvious categories like age, you'll have comparisons, but it will just be noise.

Of course we can. But can we do it in a meaningful way, such that the metric itself doesn't become a subject to optimization?""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""

""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""

reply

By making the metrics part of a sustaintable company-wide goal. If there's a company-wide goal to increase X kind of revenue by Y% making actionable targets on how a team can contribute (not lazy shit like ""our changes should contribute Z% of that Y%""), and within that create for a person another smaller metric based on that.

reply

In real world, most things don't work out that way. What metrics do you use to measure surgeons' success? If you use fatality rate, then as a result surgeons will refuse to do more risky surgeries which will put their ratings at risk, which makes the healthcare worse, instead of better.

Also, medical facilities… you certainly could define it as profit, but that bothers me and many other people.You could define it as patients seen, or “cured” but that incentivizes very quick but probably poor care.You could define it as intensity of treatment or amount of care given, but you'd probably end up in a situation where 1 incredibly sick person has every doctor treating them.You could define it as…

You can look at the kind of work they're doing, how effective their solutions are, and how long it takes them to do it. That's the basics of it across a wide range of professions. Now, there's no one-size-fits-all metric or formula you can just calculate based on objective facts for most of this, because the work is more varied than e.g. factory work, but it's also not impossible to make the comparison, if you actually understand the work reasonably and you use judgement.In the case of this study, because the assignment of the comparison they were doing was random, then just measuring time to completion across a range of tasks is a perfectly reasonable metric, because there's nothing to really bias the outcome, just a lot of factors that add noise instead. But it is worth noting that the result is a very broad average, and there is likely a very complicated distribution of details underneath, which is much harder to measure.

My entire life, I have written “ship” software. It's been pretty easy to say what my “product” is.But I have also worked at a fairly small scale, in very small teams (often, only me). I was paid to manage a team, but it was a fairly small team, with highly measurable output. Personally, I have been writing software as free, open-source stuff, and it was easy to measure.Some time ago, someone posted a story about how most software engineers have hardly ever actually shipped anything. I can't even imagine that. I would find that incredibly depressing.It would also make productivity pretty hard to measure. If I spent six months, working on something that never made it out of the cręche, would that mean all my work was for nothing?Also, really experienced engineers write a lot less code (that does a lot more). They may spend four hours, writing a highly efficient 20-line method, while a less-experienced engineer might write a passable 100-line method in a couple of hours. The experienced engineers' work might be “one and done,” never needing revision, while the less-experienced engineer's work is a slow bug farm (loaded with million-dollar security vulnerability tech debt), which means that the productivity is actually deferred, for the more experienced engineer. Their manager may like the less-experienced engineer's work, because they make a lot more noise, doing it, are ""faster,"" and give MOAR LINES. The ""down-the-road"" tech debt is of no concern to the manager.I worked for a company that held the engineer Accountable, even if the issue appears, two years after shipping. It encouraged engineers to do their homework, and each team had a dedicated testing section, to ensure that they didn't ship bugs.When I ask ChatGPT (for example) for a code solution, I find that it's usually quite “naive” (pretty prolix). I usually end up rewriting it. That doesn't mean that's a bad thing, though. It gives me a useful “starting point,” and can save me several hours of experimenting.

The usual counter-point is that if you (commonly) write code by experimenting, you are doing it wrong. Better think the problem through, and then write decent code (that you finally turn into great code). If the code that you start with is that as ""naive"" as you describe, in my experience it is nearly always better to throw it away (you can't make gold out of shit) and completely start over, i.e. think the problem through and then write decent code.

""Experimenting"" is a vital part of my process. I call it ""Evolutionary Design,""[0] and it involves a lot of iteration. I have found that it's vital to UI[1], because I can almost never predict how UI will act, when actually presented to the user. The same goes for a lot of communication workflows. I have to ""run it up the flagpole, and see who salutes."" I almost always find that my theorized approach has issues, and I need to make changes. The old ""Measure twice; cut once"" approach to software development has caused me great trouble, over the years, and I have found that I need to adjust to new tools, and new contexts.For example, right now, I am revamping one of my UI widgets[2]. It started as a minor tweak for iOS26, but I realized that it's a bit ""long in the tooth,"" and that I can make it more robust, simple, and usable.

I suppose it would be simpler to compare productivity for people working on standard, ""normalized"" tasks, but often every other task a programmer is assigned is something different to the previous one, and different developers get different tasks.It's difficult to measure productivity based on real-world work, but we can create an artificial experiment: give N programmers the same M ""normal"", everyday tasks and observe whether those using AI tools complete them more quickly.This is somewhat similar to athletic competitions — artificial in nature, yet widely accepted as a way to compare runners' performance.

Also I disagree. For web dev atleast, most people are just rewriting the same stuff in a different order. Even though the entire project might be complex from a high level perspective, when you dive into the components or even just a single route it ain't ""high complexity"" at all and since I believe most jobs are in web / app dev which just recycles the same code over and over again that's why there's a lot of people claiming huge boosts to productivity.

Yeah, I'm not a dev but I can see why this is true, because it's also the argument I use in my job as an academic. Some people say ""but your work is intellectually complex, how can you trust LLMs to do research, etc.?"", which of course, I don't. But 80% of the job is not actually incrementally complex, it's routine stuff. These days I'm writing the final report of a project and half of the text is being generated by Gemini, when I write the data management plan (which is even more useless) probably 90% will be generated by Gemini. This frees a lot of time that I can devote to the actual research. And the same when I use it to polish a grant proposal, generate me some code for a chart in a paper, reformat a LaTeX table, brainstorm some initial ideas, come up with an exercise for an exam, etc.

Maybe, but I don't feel (of course, I could be wrong) that doing boring tasks take away any mental capacity; they feel more like fidgeting while I think.

How much of the code you write is actually like this? I work in the domain of data modeling, for me once the math is worked out majority of the code is ""trivial"". The kind of code you are talking about is maybe 20% of my time. Honestly, also the most enjoyable 20%. I will be very happy if that is all I would work on while rest of it done by AI.

You're not ""stuck in traffic"", you are the traffic. If the app distributes users around and this makes it so they don't end up in traffic jams, it's effectively preventing traffic jams from formingI liked your washing machine vs. sink example that I see you just edited out. The machine may do it slower and less efficiently than you'd do in the sink, but the machine runs in parallel, freeing you to do something else. So is with good use of LLMs.

For Waze, even if you are traffic and others go around you, you still may get there quicker and your car use less energy than taking the suggested route that feels faster. Others may feel happier and feel like they were faster though. Indeed they were faster but might have taken a longer journey.Also, generally most people don't use the app around here to effect significant road use changes. But if they did im not sure (but I'm having fun trying to think) what metaphor we can apply to the current topic :)

I scoped out a body of work and even with the AI assisting on building cards and feature documentation, it came to about 2 to 4 weeks to implement.It was done in 2 days.The key I've found with working as fast as possible is to have planning sessions with Claude Code and make it challenge you and ask tons of questions. Then get it to break the work into 'cards' (think Jira, but they are just .md files in your repo) and then maintain a todo.md and done.md file pair that sorts and organizes work flow.Then start a new context, tell it to review todo.md and pick up next task, and burn through it, when done, commit and update todo.md and done.md, /compact and you're off on the next.It's more than AI hinting at what to do, it's a whole new way of working with rigor and structure around it. Then you just focus fire on the next card, and the next, and if you ever think up new features, then card it up and put it in the work queue.

Claude code has made bootstrapping a new project, searching for API docs, troubleshooting, summarizing code, finding a GitHub project, building unit tests, refactoring, etc easily 20x faster.It's the context switching that is EXTREMELY expensive for a person, but costless for the LLM. I can focus on strategy (planning features) instead of being bogged down in lots of tactics (code warnings, syntax errors).Claude Code is amazing, but the 20x gains aren't evenly distributed. There are some projects that are too specialized (obscure languages, repos larger than the LLM's context window, concepts that aren't directly applicable to any codebase in their training corpus, etc). But for those of us using common languages and commodity projects, it's a massive force multiplier.I built my second iOS app (Swift) in about 3 days x 8 hours of vibe coding. A vocab practice app with adjustable learning profile, 3 different testing mechanisms, gamification (awards, badges), iOS notifications, text to speech, etc. My first iOS app was smaller, mostly a fork of another app, and took me 4 weeks of long days. 20x speed up with Claude Code is realistic.And it saves even more time when researching + planning which features to add.

I'm leaning into the future growth of AI capabilities to help me here, otherwise I'll have to do it myself.That is a tomorrow problem, too much project structure/functionality to get right first.

With most projects where innovation is a key requirement, the goal isn't to write textbook quality code, it's to prove your ideas work and quickly evolve the project.Once you have an idea of how it's going to work, you can then choose to start over from scratch or continue on and clean up all the bits you skipped over.Right now I'm in the innovation cycle, and having AI able to pick up whole API path strategies and pivot them, is incredibly amazing.How many times have you used large API's and seen clear hands of different developers and URI strategies, with an AI, you just pivot.Code quality and pen tests are critical, but they can come later.

In my experience, no.These kind of shortcuts taken at the beginning of the project is why velocity have a sharp descent after some times. Because you're either spending time undoing all of it (unlikely to be allowed) or you're fighting in the code jungle trying to get some feature out.

> To directly measure the real-world impact of AI tools on software development, we recruited 16 experienced developers from large open-source repositories (averaging 22k+ stars and 1M+ lines of code) that they've contributed to for multiple years. Developers provide lists of real issues (246 total) that would be valuable to the repository—bug fixes, features, and refactors that would normally be part of their regular work. Then, we randomly assign each issue to either allow or disallow use of AI while working on the issue. When AI is allowed, developers can use any tools they choose (primarily Cursor Pro with Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet—frontier models at the time of the study); when disallowed, they work without generative AI assistance. Developers complete these tasks (which average two hours each) while recording their screens, then self-report the total implementation time they needed. We pay developers $150/hr as compensation for their participation in the study.So it's a small sample size of 16 developers. And it sounds like different tasks were (randomly) assigned to the no-AI and with-AI groups - so the control group doesn't have the same tasks as the experimental group. I think this could lead to some pretty noisy data.Interestingly - small sample size isn't in the list of objections that the auther includes under ""Addressing Every Objection You Thought Of, And Some You Didn't"".I do think it's an interesting study. But would want to see if the results could be reproduced before reading into it too much.

I think that's where you get 10-20x. When you're working on niche stuff it's either not gonna work or work poorly.For example right now I need to figure out why an ffmpeg filter doesn't do X thing smoothly, even though the C code is tiny for the filter and it's self contained.. Gemini refuses to add comments to the code. It just apologizes for not being able to add comments to 150 lines of code lol.However for building an ffmpeg pipeline in python I was dumbfounded how fast I was prototyping stuff and building fairly complex filter chains which if I had to do by hand just by reading the docs it would've taken me a whole lot more time, effort and frustration but was a joy to figure out with Gemini.So going back to the study, IMO it's flawed because by definition working on new features for open source projects wouldn't be the bread and butter of LLMs however most people aren't working on stuff like this, they're rewriting the same code that 10000 other people have written but with their own tiny little twist or whatever.

When I'm working with platforms/languages/frameworks I am already deeply familiar with I don't think they save me much time at all. When I've tried to use them in this context they seem to save me a bunch of time in some situations, but also cost me a bunch of time in others resulting in basically a wash as far as time saved goes.And for me a wash isn't worth the long-term cost of losing touch with the code by not being the one to have crafted it.But when it comes to environments I'm not intimately familiar with they can provide a very easy on-ramp that is a much more pleasant experience than trying to figure things out through often iffy technical documentation or code samples.

I'm a frontend guy, been using Claude Code for a couple of weeks now. It's been able to speed up some boilerplate, it's sped up a lot of ""naming is hard"" conversations I like to have (but my coworkers probably don't, lol), it's enabled me to do a lot more stuff in my most recent project.But for a task or two I suspect that it has slowed me down. If I'm unable to articulate the problem well enough and the problem is hard enough you can go in circles for awhile. And I think the nature of ""the right answer is just around the corner"" makes it hard to timebox or find a specific point where you say ""yup, time to ditch this and do it the old-fashioned way"". There is a bit of a slot-machine effect here.

Wouldn't it be the opposite? I'd expect the code would be 47% longer because it's worse and heavier in tech debt (e.g. code repeated in multiple places instead of being factored out into a function).

One: The work to get code to a reviewable point is significant. Skipping it, either with or without AI, is just going to elongate the review process.Two: The whole point of using AI is to outsource the thought to a machine that can think much faster than you can in order to ship faster. If the normal dev process was 6 hours to write and 2 hours to review, and the AI dev process was 1 hour to write and 8 hours to review, the author will say ""hey why is review taking so long; this defeats the purpose"". You can't say ""code review fixes these problems"" and then bristle at the necessary extra review.

All source code is technical debt. If you increase the amount of code, you increase the amount of debt. It's impossible to reduce debt with more code. The only way to reduce debt is by reducing code.(and note that I'm not measuring code in bytes here; switching to single-character variable names would not reduce debt. I'm measuring it in statements, expressions, instructions; reducing those without reducing functionality decreases debt)

A few takeaways that stood out:+ Context is king: AI tools struggle with large, complex, legacy codebases where tacit knowledge and unwritten conventions matter. This is the opposite of the ""greenfield"" toy problems where LLMs shine.+ Quality vs. quantity: The study suggests AI might lead to more code (47% more lines added per forecasted hour), but not necessarily better outcomes, potentially causing code bloat or unnecessary complexity.+ Review and integration pain: The bottleneck isn't code generation, but the time spent reviewing, debugging, and integrating AI output to meet real project standards.+ Self-assessment is unreliable: The fact that developers consistently overestimated AI's benefit by nearly 40 points should make everyone skeptical of self-reported productivity gains.I suspect the results would look very different for junior developers, greenfield projects, or tasks where the main challenge is syntax rather than architecture. For now, this is a strong reminder that “AI productivity” is highly context-dependent, and that we should be wary of anecdotal claims without hard data.Would love to see more rigorous studies like this, especially as tools evolve. Curious if anyone here has seen similar effects in their own teams or workflows?

Just last week I had to review some monstrosity of a FE ticket written by one of our backenders, with the comment of ""it's 90% there, should be good to takeover"". I had to throw out pretty much everything and rewrite it from scratch. My solution was like 150 lines modified, whereas the monstrous output of the AI was non-functional, ugly, a performance nightmare and around 800 lines, with extremely unhelpful and generic commit messages to the tune of ""Made things great!!1!1!!"".I can't even really blame them, the C-level craze and zeal for the AI shit is such that if you're not doing crap like this you get scrutinized and PIP'd.At least frontenders usually have some humility and will tell you they have no clue if it's a good solution or not, while BEnders are always for some reason extremely dismissive of FE work (as can be seen in this very thread). It's truly baffling to me

I ended shoehorned into backend dev in Ruby/Py/Java and don't find it improves my day to day a lot.Specifically in C, it can bang out complicated but mostly common data-structures without fault where I would surely do one-off errors. I guess since I do C for hobby I tend to solve more interesting and complicated problems like generating  a whole array of dynamic C-dispatchers from a UI-library spec in JSON that allows parsing and rendering a UI specified in YAML. Gemini pro even spat out a YAML-dialect parser after a few attempts/fixes.Maybe it's a function of familiarity and problems you end using the AI for.

In both of these cases, I found that just the smart auto-complete is a massive time-saver.  In fact, it's more valuable to me than the interactive or agentic features.Here's a snippet of some code that's in one of my recent buffers:    // The instruction should be skipped if all of its named
    // outputs have been coalesced away.
    if ! self.should_keep_instr(instr) {
      return;
    }

    // Non-dropped should have a choice.
    let instr_choice =
      choices.maybe_instr_choice(instr_ref)
        .expect(""No choice for instruction"");
    self.pick_map.set_instr_choice(
      instr_ref,
      instr_choice.clone(),
    );

    // Incref all named def inputs to the PIR choice.
    instr_choice.visit_input_defs(|input_def| {
      self.def_incref(input_def);
    });

    // Decref all named def inputs to the SIR instr.
    instr.visit_inputs(
      |input_def| self.def_decref(input_def, sir_graph)
    );

The actual code _I_ wrote were the comments.  The savings in not having to type out the syntax is pretty big.  About 80% of the time in manual coding would have been that.  Little typos, little adjustments to get the formatting right.The other nice benefit is that I don't have to trust the LLM.  I can evaluate each snippet right there and typically the machine does a good job of picking out syntactic style and semantics from the rest of the codebase and file and applying it to the completion.The snippet, if it's not obvious, is from a bit of compiler backend code I'm working on.  I would never have even _attempted_ to write a compiler backend in my spare time without this assistance.For experienced devs, autocomplete is good enough for massive efficiency gains in dev speed.I still haven't warmed to the agentic interfaces because I inherently don't trust the LLMs to produce correct code reliably, so I always end up reviewing it, and reviewing greenfield code is often more work than just writing it (esp now that autocomplete is so much more useful at making that writing faster).

I would never have even _attempted_ to write a compiler backend in my spare time without this assistance.For experienced devs, autocomplete is good enough for massive efficiency gains in dev speed.I still haven't warmed to the agentic interfaces because I inherently don't trust the LLMs to produce correct code reliably, so I always end up reviewing it, and reviewing greenfield code is often more work than just writing it (esp now that autocomplete is so much more useful at making that writing faster).

Recently, my company has been investigating AI tools for coding. I know this sounds very late to the game, but we're a DoD consultancy and one not traditional associated with software development. So, for most of the people in the company, they are very impressed with the AI's output.I, on the other hand, am a fairly recent addition to the company. I was specifically hired to be a  ""wildcard"" in their usual operations. Which is too say, maybe 10 of us in a company of 3000 know what we're doing regarding software (but that's being generous because I don't really have visibility into half of the company). So, that means 99.7% of the company doesn't have the experience necessary to tell what good software development looks like.The stuff the people using the AI are putting out is... better than what the MilOps analysts pressed into writing Python-scripts-with-delusions-of-grandeur were doing before, but by no means what I'd call quality software. I have pretty deep experience in both back end and front end. It's a step above ""code written by smart people completely inexperienced in writing software that has to be maintained over a lifetime"", but many steps below, ""software that can successfully be maintained over a lifetime"".

You can tweak the prompt a bit to skew the probability distribution with careful prompting (LLMs that are told to claim to be math PHDs are better at math problems, for instance), but in the end all of those weights in the model are spent to encode the most probable outputs.So, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. If the average person using AI is able to produce above average code, then we could end up in a virtuous cycle where AI continuously improves with human help. On the other hand, if this just allows more low quality code to be written then the opposite happens and AI becomes more and more useless.

When it comes to software the entire reason maintainability is a goal is because writing and improving software is incredibly time consuming and requires a lot of skill. It requires so much skill and time that during my decades in industry I rarely found code I would consider quality. Furthermore the output from AI tools currently may have various drawbacks, but this technology is going to keep improving year over year for the foreseeable future.

I work at a shop where we do all custom frontend work and it's just not up to the task. And, while it has chipped in on some accessibility features for me, I wouldn't trust it to do that unsupervised. Even semantic HTML is a mixed bag: if you point out something is a figure/figcaption it'll probably do it right, but I haven't found that it'll intuit these things and get it right on the first try.But I'd imagine if you don't care about the frontend looking original or even good, and you stick really closely to something like tailwind, it could output something good enough.And critically, I think a lot of times the hardest part of frontend work is starting, getting that first iteration out. LLMs are good for that. Actually got me over the hump on a little personal page I made a month or so ago and it was a massive help. Put out something that looked terrible but gave me what I needed to move forward.

Whether or not a general purpose foundation model for coding is trained on more backend or frontend code is largely irrelevant in this specific context.

It could happen that the impact of using AI depends of the task at hand, the capability of the SWE to pair programming with it, and of the LLM used, to such an extend that those factors were bigger that the average effect on a bag of tasks, in this case the large deviation from the mean makes any one parameter estimation void of useful information.

These were maintainers of large open source projects. It's all relative. It's clearly providing massive gains for some and not as much for others. It should follow that it's benefit to you depends on who you are and what you are working on.It isn't black and white.

There are some very good findings though, like how the devs thought they were sped up but they were actually slowed down.

Like what if by focusing on LLMs for productivity we just reinforce old-bad habits, and get into a local maxima... And even worse, what if being stuck with current so-so patterns, languages, etc means we don't innovate in language design, tooling, or other areas that might actually be productivity wins?

I'm sorry, but it feels to me like this research has only proven that developers tend to underestimate how long a task is supposed to take, with or without AI.In no way did they actually measure how much faster a specific task was when performed with and without AI?

I guess the tricky bit is, nobody knows what the future looks like. ""The internet is a fad"" in 1999 hasn't aged well, but a lot of people touted 1960s AI, XML and 3d telivisions as things that'd be the tools in only a few years.We're all just guessing till then.

Over IDK, 2-3 hours I got something that seemed on its face to work, but:- it didn't use the pub/sub API correctly- the 1 low-coverage test it generated didn't even compile (Go)- there were a bunch of small errors it got confused by--particularly around closuresI got it to ""90%"" (again though it didn't at all work) with the first prompt, and then over something like a dozen more mostly got it to fix its own errors. But:- I didn't know the pub/sub API--I was relying on Cursor to do this correctly--and it totally submarined me- I had to do all the digging to get the test to compile- I had to go line by line and tell it to rewrite... almost everythingI quit when I realized I was spending more time prompting it to fix things than it would take me to fully engage my brain and fix them myself. I also noticed that there was a strong pull to ""just do one more prompt"" rather than dig in and actually understand things. That's super problematic to me.Worse, this wasn't actually faster. How do I know that? The next day I did what I normally do: read docs and wrote it myself. I spent less time (I'm a fast typist and a Vim user) overall, and my code works. My experience matches pretty well w/ the results of TFA.---Something I will say though is there is a lot of garbage stuff in tech. Like, I don't want to learn Terraform (again) just to figure out how to deploy things to production w/o paying a Heroku-like premium. Maybe I don't want to look up recursive CTEs again, or C function pointers, or spent 2 weeks researching a heisenbug I put into code for some silly reason AI would have caught immediately. I am _confident_ we can solve these things without boiling oceans to get AI to do it for us.But all this shit about how ""I'm 20x more productive"" is totally absurd. The only evidence we have of this is people just saying it. I don't think a 20x productivity increase is even imaginable. Overall productivity since 1950 is up 3.6x [0]. These people are asking us to believe they've achieved over 400 years of productivity gains in ""3 months"". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

They're not great at business logic though, especially if you're doing anything remotely novel.  Which is the difficult part of programming anyway.But yeah, to the average corporate programmer who needs to recreate the same internal business tool that every other company has anyway, it probably saves a lot of time.

This feel like much too broad a statement to be true.

reply

This tactic is called ""assuming the sale"".  ie, Make a statement as-if it is already true, and put the burden on the reader to negate it. Majority of us are too scared of what others think, and go-along by default. It is related to the FOMO tactic in that it could be used in conjunction with it to make it a double-whammy. for example, the statement above could have ended with: ""and everyone is now using agents to increase their productivity, and if you arent using it, you are left behind""Glad you stood up to challenge it.

It's a lot more hands on when you try to write code with it, which I still try out, but it's only because I know exactly what the solution is and I'm just walking the agent towards it and improving how I write my prompts. It's slower than doing it myself in many cases.

All this cargo-culting is done without realizing that more code means more security issues, technical debt, more time for humans to review the mess and *especially* more testing.Once again, Vibe-coding is not software engineering.

I'm Louis, one of the creators of Vibe Kanban.We started working on this a few weeks ago. Personally, I was feeling pretty useless working synchronously with coding agents. The 2-5 minutes that they take to complete their work often led me to distraction and doomscrolling.But there's plenty of productive work that we (human engineers) could be doing in that time, especially if we run coding agents in the background and parallelise them.Vibe Kanban lets you effortlessly spin up multiple coding agents. While some agents handle tasks in the background, you can focus on planning future work or reviewing completed tasks.After a few weeks of internal dog fooding and sharing it with friends, we've now open-sourced Vibe Kanban, and it's stable enough for day-to-day use.I'd love to hear your feedback, feel free to open an issue on the github and we'll respond ASAP.

Are you thinking of doing a hosted version so I can have my team collab on it?And I found I could open lots of PRs at once but they often need to be dependent on each other - and then I want to make a change to the first one. How are you thinking of better managing that flow?

- It's an early prototype so they haven't dealt with fine grained permissions- They really do want to do things like access private repos with it themselves- They really do want the ability to do things like checkout code, create PRs, etc... and that involves a lot of permission.

It's chaos. Thats fine if you are vibe coding an unimportant nextjs/vercel demo, but i'm really sceptical of all this stance that you should be proud of how abstracted you are from code. A kanban board to just shoot off as many tasks as possible and just quickly read over the PR's is crazy to me. If you want to appear a serious company that should be allowed to write enterprise code, imo this path is so risky. I see this in quite a few podcasts, tweets etc. People bragging how abstracted they are from their own product anymore. Again, maybe i am missing something, but all of this github copilot/just reviewing like 10 coding agents PR's just introduces so much noise and slop. Is it really what you want your image to be as a code company?

reply

Fwiw Claude suggests using different git workspaces for your agents. This would entirely solve the clashing, though they may still conflict and need normal git conflict resolves of course.Theoretically that would work fine, as it would be just like two people working on different branches/repos/etc.I've not tried that though. AI generates way too much code for me to review as it is, several subtasks working concurrently would be overwhelming for me.

AI needs to do every single step of this type of flow to an acceptable quality level, with high standards on that definition of ""acceptable"", and then you could bring all the workflow together. But doing the workflow first and assuming quality will catch up later is just asking for a pile of rejections when you try to sell it.I'm not just making this up, either... I've seen and talked to numerous people over the last couple years who all came up with similar ideas. Some even did have workable prototypes running. And they had sales from the mom/friends/family connections, but when they tried to get ""real"" sales, they hit walls.

Always - if you're going to pipe the result of some slow process back to them (like building a giant C++ project that takes minutes/hours, or running a huge set of tests...)... it's going to be slow.

reply

This gives me something to do in that time.My guess is time to complete a task will oscillate - going up as we give agents more complex tasks to work on, and going down with LLM performance improvement.

The US system to track vulnerabilities is struggling to keep up with its backlog. Experts are scrambling to assemble alternatives.

Every day, billions of people trust digital systems to run everything from communication to commerce to critical infrastructure. But the global early warning system that alerts security teams to dangerous software flaws is showing critical gaps in coverage—and most users have no idea their digital lives are likely becoming more vulnerable.

Over the past 18 months, two pillars of global cybersecurity have flirted with apparent collapse. In February 2024, the US-backed National Vulnerability Database (NVD)—relied on globally for its free analysis of security threats—abruptly stopped publishing new entries, citing a cryptic “change in interagency support.” Then, in April of this year, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the fundamental numbering system for tracking software flaws, seemed at similar risk: A leaked letter warned of an imminent contract expiration.

Cybersecurity practitioners have since flooded Discord channels and LinkedIn feeds with emergency posts and memes of “NVD” and “CVE” engraved on tombstones. Unpatched vulnerabilities are the second most common way cyberattackers break in, and they have led to fatal hospital outages and critical infrastructure failures. In a social media post, Jen Easterly, a US cybersecurity expert, said: “Losing [CVE] would be like tearing out the card catalog from every library at once—leaving defenders to sort through chaos while attackers take full advantage.” If CVEs identify each vulnerability like a book in a card catalogue, NVD entries provide the detailed review with context around severity, scope, and exploitability. 

In the end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding for CVE another year, attributing the incident to a “contract administration issue.” But the NVD's story has proved more complicated. Its parent organization, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reportedly saw its budget cut roughly 12% in 2024, right around the time that CISA pulled its $3.7 million in annual funding for the NVD. Shortly after, as the backlog grew, CISA launched its own “Vulnrichment” program to help address the analysis gap, while promoting a more distributed approach that allows multiple authorized partners to publish enriched data. 

“CISA continuously assesses how to most effectively allocate limited resources to help organizations reduce the risk of newly disclosed vulnerabilities,” says Sandy Radesky, the agency's associate director for vulnerability management. Rather than just filling the gap, she emphasizes, Vulnrichment was established to provide unique additional information, like recommended actions for specific stakeholders, and to “reduce dependency of the federal government's role to be the sole provider of vulnerability enrichment.”

Meanwhile, NIST has scrambled to hire contractors to help clear the backlog. Despite a return to pre-crisis processing levels, a boom in vulnerabilities newly disclosed to the NVD has outpaced these efforts. Currently, over 25,000 vulnerabilities await processing—nearly 10 times the previous high in 2017, according to data from the software company Anchore. Before that, the NVD largely kept pace with CVE publications, maintaining a minimal backlog.

“Things have been disruptive, and we've been going through times of change across the board,” Matthew Scholl, then chief of the computer security division in NIST's Information Technology Laboratory, said at an industry event in April. “Leadership has assured me and everyone that NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST, both in resourcing and capabilities.” Scholl left NIST in May after 20 years at the agency, and NIST declined to comment on the backlog. 

The situation has now prompted multiple government actions, with the Department of Commerce launching an audit of the NVD in May and House Democrats calling for a broader probe of both programs in June. But the damage to trust is already transforming geopolitics and supply chains as security teams prepare for a new era of cyber risk. “It's left a bad taste, and people are realizing they can't rely on this,” says Rose Gupta, who builds and runs enterprise vulnerability management programs. “Even if they get everything together tomorrow with a bigger budget, I don't know that this won't happen again. So I have to make sure I have other controls in place.”

As these public resources falter, organizations and governments are confronting a critical weakness in our digital infrastructure: Essential global cybersecurity services depend on a complex web of US agency interests and government funding that can be cut or redirected at any time.

What began as a trickle of software vulnerabilities in the early Internet era has become an unstoppable avalanche, and the free databases that have tracked them for decades have struggled to keep up. In early July, the CVE database crossed over 300,000 catalogued vulnerabilities. Numbers jump unpredictably each year, sometimes by 10% or much more. Even before its latest crisis, the NVD was notorious for delayed publication of new vulnerability analyses, often trailing private security software and vendor advisories by weeks or months.

Gupta has watched organizations increasingly adopt commercial vulnerability management (VM) software that includes its own threat intelligence services. “We've definitely become over-reliant on our VM tools,” she says, describing security teams' growing dependence on vendors like Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable to supplement or replace unreliable public databases. These platforms combine their own research with various data sources to create proprietary risk scores that help teams prioritize fixes. But not all organizations can afford to fill the NVD's gap with premium security tools. “Smaller companies and startups, already at a disadvantage, are going to be more at risk,” she explains. 

Komal Rawat, a security engineer in New Delhi whose mid-stage cloud startup has a limited budget, describes the impact in stark terms: “If NVD goes, there will be a crisis in the market. Other databases are not that popular, and to the extent they are adopted, they are not free. If you don't have recent data, you're exposed to attackers who do.”

Agents could make it easier and cheaper for criminals to hack systems at scale. We need to be ready.

The growing backlog means new devices could be more likely to have vulnerability blind spots—whether that's a Ring doorbell at home or an office building's “smart” access control system. The biggest risk may be “one-off” security flaws that fly under the radar. “There are thousands of vulnerabilities that will not affect the majority of enterprises,” says Gupta. “Those are the ones that we're not getting analysis on, which would leave us at risk.”

NIST acknowledges it has limited visibility into which organizations are most affected by the backlog. “We don't track which industries use which products and therefore cannot measure impact to specific industries,” a spokesperson says. Instead, the team prioritizes vulnerabilities on the basis of CISA's known exploits list and those included in vendor advisories like Microsoft Patch Tuesday.

Brian Martin has watched this system evolve—and deteriorate—from the inside. A former CVE board member and an original project leader behind the Open Source Vulnerability Database, he has built a combative reputation over the decades as a leading historian and practitioner. Martin says his current project, VulnDB (part of Flashpoint Security), outperforms the official databases he once helped oversee. “Our team processes more vulnerabilities, at a much faster turnaround, and we do it for a fraction of the cost,"" he says, referring to the tens of millions in government contracts that support the current system. 

When we spoke in May, Martin said his database contains more than 112,000 vulnerabilities with no CVE identifiers—security flaws that exist in the wild but remain invisible to organizations that rely solely on public channels. “If you gave me the money to triple my team, that non-CVE number would be in the 500,000 range,” he said.

The proliferation of AI means we need a new word.

In the US, official vulnerability management duties are split between a web of contractors, agencies, and nonprofit centers like the Mitre Corporation. Critics like Martin say that creates potential for redundancy, confusion, and inefficiency, with layers of middle management and relatively few actual vulnerability experts. Others defend the value of this fragmentation. “These programs build on or complement each other to create a more comprehensive, supportive, and diverse community,” CISA said in a statement. “That increases the resilience and usefulness of the entire ecosystem.”

As American leadership wavers, other nations are stepping up. China now operates multiple vulnerability databases, some surprisingly robust but tainted by the possibility that they are subject to state control. In May, the European Union accelerated the launch of its own database, as well as a decentralized “Global CVE” architecture. Following social media and cloud services, vulnerability intelligence has become another front in the contest for technological independence. 

That leaves security professionals to navigate multiple potentially conflicting sources of data. “It's going to be a mess, but I would rather have too much information than none at all,” says Gupta, describing how her team monitors multiple databases despite the added complexity. 

As defenders adapt to the fragmenting landscape, the tech industry faces another reckoning: Why don't software vendors carry more responsibility for protecting their customers from security issues? Major vendors routinely disclose—but don't necessarily patch—thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. A single exposure could crash critical systems or increase the risks of fraud and data misuse. 

For decades, the industry has hidden behind legal shields. “Shrink-wrap licenses” once forced consumers to broadly waive their right to hold software vendors liable for defects. Today's end-user license agreements (EULAs), often delivered in pop-up browser windows, have evolved into incomprehensibly long documents. Last November, a lab project called “EULAS of Despair” used the length of War and Peace (587,287 words) to measure these sprawling contracts. The worst offender? Twitter, at 15.83 novels' worth of fine print.

“This is a legal fiction that we've created around this whole ecosystem, and it's just not sustainable,” says Andrea Matwyshyn, a US special advisor and technology law professor at Penn State University, where she directs the Policy Innovation Lab of Tomorrow. “Some people point to the fact that software can contain a mix of products and services, creating more complex facts. But just like in engineering or financial litigation, even the most messy scenarios can be resolved with the assistance of experts.”

The Walking Egg project is bringing IVF to rural communities in South Africa.

This liability shield is finally beginning to crack. In July 2024, a faulty security update in CrowdStrike's popular endpoint detection software crashed millions of Windows computers worldwide and caused outages at everything from airlines to hospitals to 911 systems. The incident led to billions in estimated damages, and the city of Portland, Oregon, even declared a “state of emergency.” Now, affected companies like Delta Airlines have hired high-priced attorneys to pursue major damages—a signal opening of the floodgates to litigation.

Despite the soaring number of vulnerabilities, many fall into long-established categories, such as SQL injections that interfere with database queries and buffer memory overflows that enable code to be executed remotely. Matwyshyn advocates for a mandatory “software bill of materials,” or S-BOM—an ingredients list that would let organizations understand what components and potential vulnerabilities exist throughout their software supply chains. One recent report found 30% of data breaches stemmed from the vulnerabilities of third-party software vendors or cloud service providers.

She adds: “When you can't tell the difference between the companies that are cutting corners and a company that has really invested in doing right by their customers, that results in a market where everyone loses.”

CISA leadership shares this sentiment, with a spokesperson emphasizing its “secure-by-design principles,” such as “making essential security features available without additional cost, eliminating classes of vulnerabilities, and building products in a way that reduces the cybersecurity burden on customers.”

It will likely come as no surprise that practitioners are looking to AI to help fill the gap, while at the same time preparing for a coming swarm of cyberattacks by AI agents. Security researchers have used an OpenAI model to discover new “zero-day” vulnerabilities. And both the NVD and CVE teams are developing “AI-powered tools” to help streamline data collection, identification, and processing. NIST says that “up to 65% of our analysis time has been spent generating CPEs”—product information codes that pinpoint affected software. If AI can solve even part of this tedious process, it could dramatically speed up the analysis pipeline.

But Martin cautions against optimism around AI, noting that the technology remains unproven and often riddled with inaccuracies—which, in security, can be fatal. “Rather than AI or ML [machine learning], there are ways to strategically automate bits of the processing of that vulnerability data while ensuring 99.5% accuracy,” he says. 

If we want online discourse to improve, we need to move beyond the big platforms.

AI also fails to address more fundamental challenges in governance. The CVE Foundation, launched in April 2025 by breakaway board members, proposes a globally funded nonprofit model similar to that of the internet's addressing system, which transitioned from US government control to international governance. Other security leaders are pushing to revitalize open-source alternatives like Google's OSV Project or the NVD++ (maintained by VulnCheck), which are accessible to the public but currently have limited resources.

As these various reform efforts gain momentum, the world is waking up to the fact that vulnerability intelligence—like disease surveillance or aviation safety—requires sustained cooperation and public investment. Without it, a patchwork of paid databases will be all that remains, threatening to leave all but the richest organizations and nations permanently exposed.

Matthew King is a technology and environmental journalist based in New York. He previously worked for cybersecurity firm Tenable. 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health—but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.

The defense tech startup Epirus has developed a cutting-edge, cost-efficient drone zapper that's sparking the interest of the US military. Now the company has to deliver.

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

Bose has been a name in the household for decades and it is well known for its speakers and headphones. Some forget, though, that Bose is just as good at home audio as it is at headphones and travel speakers.

The best example of this is the Bose TV speaker which offers an easy but effective solution for those who want to get a better sound out of their TV. As part of Prime Day on Amazon, this soundbar is exclusively for Prime members at a brand-new all-time low price of $199, from its usual $279.

See at Amazon

The design of this TV speaker is compact and discreet as it measures just over two inches tall which means it fits easily in front of your TV or can be mounted on a wall. Despite being small in size, it creates a wide and natural soundfield because of two tilted full-range drivers. The setup creates a more realistic and spatial soundfield.

Bose has engineered the TV soundbar to amplify voices and enunciation so it is much simpler to hear and catch what people are saying even amidst frenetic scenes or when background music is peaking. The remote that comes with it even has a dialogue mode which you can activate to lend speech an added boost along with a bass boost for occasions when you want to put some extra oomph into your sound.

To install the soundbar, you only need one connection to your television, using the included optical audio cable or an HDMI cable (sold separately). In a matter of minutes, you'll be listening to richer and clearer sound. The Bose soundbar also offers Bluetooth wireless connectivity so it can also function as a wireless speaker for music and podcasts: Pair your phone or tablet and stream your favorite playlists directly to the soundbar, turning your living room into a mini concert hall. With support for up to three devices through HDMI, optical, and AUX inputs, switching between sources is hassle-free.

As a Prime member, this $199 deal is a great chance to bring home better sound for your TV and more.

Andy Cohen, 57, runs Bravo. He built the Real Housewives empire. He stirs the pot nightly on Watch What Happens Live. He juggles a SiriusXM channel, two young kids, and the three-ring circus that is BravoCon. He's also the first guest in our new series, How Do You Use AI?, where we ask people with real reach how they actually use artificial intelligence. No TED Talk nonsense, just real life.

Turns out, Andy's been using AI more than you might think. And he's not entirely comfortable with it.

Episode 1: Andy Cohen—Reality TV King, Talk Show Host, Chaos Manager, Dad.

Gizmodo: So… how do you use AI?

Andy Cohen: I use AI to answer very random questions and to teach me how to use things I have no clue how to operate, like iMovie.

Gizmodo: What kind of random?

Andy Cohen: At this point it's incredibly specific, stuff from my son, like “what's the most dangerous animal” or “how fast does a cheetah run,” or things we're arguing about at the dinner table.

Gizmodo: What's the last thing it helped you with?

Andy Cohen: It taught me how to edit a movie using iMovie. I never would've figured it out on my own.

Gizmodo: Has it actually made your life easier?

Andy Cohen: I'm completely torn. It's an incredible tool. But it's going to make idiots out of generations to come. It's going to inspire laziness and stupidity.

Gizmodo: Do you trust it?

Andy Cohen: I do. But it's still going to ruin society.

Gizmodo: Would you recommend it?

Andy Cohen: Yes, but not for anything personal.

Gizmodo: Where do you draw the line?

Andy Cohen: If I don't care about something sounding generic, I'll use it. If it needs to feel personal, I won't.

Gizmodo: What's something AI should never touch?

Andy Cohen: Remarks at a funeral. A wedding speech.

Gizmodo: Has it changed how you prep for your shows?

Andy Cohen: No.

Gizmodo: Ever cringe at how someone else used it?

Andy Cohen: No.

Gizmodo: Your son sounds like an AI prompt machine. Does he know you're using it?

Andy Cohen: I'm keeping him away from AI as long as I can. He doesn't know where I get the answers.

Gizmodo: You think it'll ruin society. What's the real danger: the tech, or how we use it?

Andy Cohen: Kids using it to write and think for them.

‘How Do You Use AI?' is Gizmodo's new series digging into how real people are using artificial intelligence to make life easier, messier, dumber, or just more efficient. It's about how the future is already messing with your present.

Covering tech news, you sometimes feel like the million-mile-per-hour footrace of Silicon Valley will inevitably result in a Wile E. Coyote-style calamity. There's a part of me that craves a little more sincerity and willingness for self-reflection. When we actually receive it, the result is a little more cringe-worthy. Intel's new boss, Lip-Bu Tan, reportedly told staff the company was—effectively—cooked. That doesn't sound great, but for one of Intel's once-biggest partners, Apple, it may be a sign it can take it a little easier with the relentless yearly release schedule.

We won't see any new MacBook Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's regular Apple leaker Mark Gurman, who says Apple may delay these devices to the first half of 2026. In the last few years, Apple has launched a new MacBook Air in the first few months of the year before offering a new Pro model in the fall. As much as I wish this supposed delay was to finagle a new Mac design, Gurman suggests new MacBook Pros with M5 chips will still have the same design as every other Apple laptop we've seen since 2021. The rumored OLED display that promises far better contrast and colors reportedly won't arrive until 2027.

There is some precedent for a delay. In 2023, Apple pushed out its M2 MacBook Pro in January. Later in October, the company debuted the M3 MacBook Pro 14- and 16-inch models in an all-black color at its “Scary Fast” event. Last year's M4 MacBook Pro launch was a slightly more subdued affair. According to Gurman's anonymous sources, there are new iPad Airs with M3 chips that would accompany a replacement for the baseline $350 iPad. We could see those as early as March or April 2026, so long as the launch timeline doesn't go awry. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro could be upgraded with an M5 chip and arrive as soon as October.

While Apple wanted to keep its Macs in the oven, it apparently has no issues with its iPhone release schedule. There's a supposed follow-up to the iPhone 16e on the way in the form of a $600 iPhone 17e. Maybe this upcoming model can finally nix the notch for the floating Dynamic Island seen in most modern iPhones. Gurman says the sequel to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17, is still slated for fall to launch alongside iOS 26. We'll also see Apple Watch upgrades and—if the stars align—a new Vision Pro headset that may finally be more comfortable to wear.

Apple's been on a roll with its MacBooks since it dropped Intel CPUs in favor of its own ARM-based M-series chips in 2020. The latest M4 designs outclass most other Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm chips in pure benchmark performance, though Apple has been sitting on its laurels for far too long. Current MacBook Air and Pro models are visually indistinct from year to year. They have the same displays, keyboards, and notch cutout for the webcam and microphone. Apple is ending support for all older Intel-based Macs, but anybody not still using an Intel-based Mac has little reason to upgrade.

Intel was also caught off-guard by the proliferation of AI and Nvidia's dominance of the AI training chip market. Those woes stacked so high they eventually led to the ouster of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan, who's now in the driver's seat, reportedly told staff that “we are not in the top 10 semiconductor companies” compared to 30 years ago. According to The Oregonian, based on a leaked internal message to staff, Tan said turning the ship around will be a “marathon” and cited the need to be smaller and more agile to compete. Intel is reportedly cutting thousands of workers across all sectors, and more could find their head on the chopping block in the next few months.

If big tech companies would actually slow down with their rapid release schedule and instead focus on making sure their core products offer a real reason for consumers to upgrade, then we'd all benefit. However, Gurman suggested the new release timing was an attempt to “get back to more consistent revenue growth.” Mac sales have slumped in recent months, but changing the release timing doesn't necessarily make any device more enticing, especially if it's practically the same damn thing as one released the year before, and the year before that, and the year before that…

This article was updated at 9:00 a.m. ET on Friday, July 11, to include new information.

After defending his PhD thesis on modeling interstellar objects on Monday, June 30, Matthew Hopkins intended to take some well-deserved time off. It would appear the universe had other plans for him.

The very next day, the Atlas Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, detected a mysterious object whizzing toward the Sun. Early observations suggested that it came from outside our solar system, potentially marking the third discovery of an interstellar object in history. Astronomers across the globe—including Hopkins—leapt into action, racing to gather as much data on this wandering space rock as they could. By Thursday, July 3, the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed that an interstellar object was, indeed, traveling through our cosmic neighborhood, naming it 3I/ATLAS. Now, Hopkins and his colleagues have determined that it may be the oldest comet ever discovered, hailing from a region of the galaxy filled with stars far older than our 4.6 billion-year-old Sun.

“It was incredibly exciting!” Hopkins, an astrophysics graduate student at the University of Oxford, told Gizmodo in an email. “I woke up to messages such as ‘3I!!!!!!!!!!' and spent the entire day comparing my models to the data as it was collected in real time. I've been waiting for this opportunity my entire PhD, of course I was going to dive straight in.”

Through preliminary observations, astronomers have learned a lot about 3I/ATLAS. It's the largest and brightest interstellar object yet, according to Space.com. Experts are fairly confident that it's a comet zipping through our solar system at incredibly high speeds. Upon its discovery, the object was traveling 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour), and it will speed up as it approaches the Sun. 3I/ATLAS appears to be much bigger than the two interstellar objects that came before it: ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov. Early size estimates suggest it could be 6 to 19 miles (10 to 30 kilometers) wide. Don't worry, there's no chance of this space rock hitting our planet, but it will safely make its closest approach to Earth on October 30.

Initial spectroscopy suggests 3I/ATLAS is redder in color than typical solar system comets, similar to some trans-Neptunian objects—minor planets that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune's orbit—or tiny, icy celestial bodies located between Jupiter and Neptune called Centaurs. Another study made photometric observations of the object that found it to be similar in color to some solar system comets but markedly bluer than ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

Together, these early findings paint a vivid picture of our solar system's latest guest, but figuring out where this comet came from is equally as important as figuring out what it looks like. Interstellar objects like this one are “pristine, primordial remnants from the planet formation process in other planetary systems,” Darryl Seligman, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, wrote in an article for The Conversation. Understanding 3I/ATLAS's origin would allow astronomers to extrapolate information about how planets form in this foreign star system.

To that end, Hopkins and his colleagues analyzed 3I/ATLAS using the Otautahi-Oxford model. This new model integrates data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia observatory with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and galactic dynamics to predict the distributions of velocities, ages, and compositions across the interstellar object population in our cosmic neighborhood. Hopkins and several of his co-authors contributed to the development of Otautahi-Oxford.

Their findings, which are currently available on the preprint server arXiv and have yet to be peer-reviewed, suggest 3I/ATLAS may be incredibly old—more than 7 billion years old, to be exact. That's roughly 2 billion years older than our solar system. Based on its trajectory, this ancient comet originated from a part of the Milky Way's galactic disk. This is the disk-like component of our galaxy that contains stars, gas, and dust and rotates in circular coplanar motion around the center of the galaxy. According to Hopkins's study, 3I/ATLAS likely came from the thick part of the disk, which contains about 10% of the stellar mass of the Milky Way. These stars are generally much older than those located in the galaxy's thin disk.

“Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential,” the study states. Planetesimals are diminutive celestial bodies—like asteroids or comets—that serve as the building blocks of planets.

“[Comet 3I/ATLAS] is probably from an old star in the thick disc, and we think that it's likely that this thing's been out there for longer than the age of the Solar System,” co-author Chris Lintott, a professor of astrophysics at Oxford, told IFLScience. “There's a two-thirds chance that it's older than 7 billion [years], and that would explain the color.” If confirmed, it would mark the first known interstellar object to visit from that distinct galactic population.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers will keep a close eye on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Older stars tend to produce water-rich interstellar objects, Lintott explained. If this comet comes from the thick disk, it should produce a lot of cometary activity, which occurs when surface ice heats up and transitions directly from a solid to a gas.

Later this year, the newly launched Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile will begin its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This 10-year astronomical survey of the southern sky should find a lot more interstellar objects, Hopkins said. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, he and his colleagues predicted LSST would find between five and 50, “but the discovery of a third one before that survey even starts boosts our predictions to the optimistic end of that!” he added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Mercedes-Benz Says Trump Is Holding It Back","https://gizmodo.com/mercedes-benz-says-trump-is-holding-it-back-2000628059","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:50:36 GMT","

Mercedes-Benz has long been a bellwether of elite consumption. Its luxury vehicles aren't just status symbols. They're economic signals, revealing how the world's wealthy are spending. So when Mercedes releases its quarterly sales data, it's worth paying attention.

The German carmaker released its second-quarter sales figures on July 8, and they paint a picture that is both reassuring and deeply cautious. The data shows Mercedes-Benz is selling its most expensive cars at a blistering pace in America. Demand for its top-end vehicles, including the AMG lineup and the iconic G-Class, is up 26 percent year-over-year. Globally, its push into electrification is gaining traction, with plug-in hybrid (PHEV) sales jumping 34 percent in the last quarter alone.

And yet, on a global scale, Mercedes-Benz is shrinking.

Globally, the company reported a 9 percent decline in sales for the second quarter of 2025. That drop is not due to a lack of interest, far from it. Mercedes blamed “new global tariff policies” for its decision to slow deliveries and keep dealer inventories low, particularly in the U.S. and China. It's a clear reference to President Donald Trump, now in his second term, who has returned to using tariffs as a central tool of industrial policy. Mercedes and other German automakers have once again been caught in the crossfire of global trade tensions.

“We see good customer demand in the U.S. and Germany for our products, including our top-end vehicles, despite tariffs impacting our global sales in the second quarter,” said Mathias Geisen, a member of Mercedes-Benz Group's board. Translation: the customers are there, but the cars are stuck in the geopolitical pipeline.

Between April and June, Mercedes sold 453,700 vehicles worldwide. That figure could have been much higher if not for trade restrictions. Instead, the company is playing defense: slowing shipments, trimming dealer stock, and rerouting global logistics to avoid punitive tariffs. The one bright spot? The U.S. market.

America has become Mercedes-Benz's second-largest market globally, and its sales performance there shows no signs of slowing. Top-end vehicles made up more than 14 percent of total Q2 sales. AMG deliveries rose 19 percent. G-Class sales exploded by 56 percent.

Mercedes-Benz USA recently invested in a flagship Manhattan dealership and appointed a new CEO, Adam Chamberlain, who sounded an optimistic note: “We'll unlock the potential of this important market,” he said, emphasizing partnerships with dealers and a new focus on plug-in hybrids.

But the gains in America are being offset by struggles in China.

Though Mercedes claims it retained its crown as China's top luxury brand, the company described the market as “highly competitive,” a coded acknowledgment of its ongoing price war with Tesla and local giants like BYD. Beijing's aggressive “Buy Chinese” policies have further squeezed imported brands like Mercedes, shrinking their foothold.

EV performance was a mixed bag. Mercedes said xEVs—battery-electric and plug-in hybrids—made up 21 percent of global sales and 40 percent in Europe. But the company didn't break out battery-only EVs in its release, a likely sign that fully electric adoption is lagging behind expectations.

There are some glimmers of hope. The new CLA, an all-electric sedan, was well received in Europe. And Mercedes teased the arrival of an electric GLC model, part of what it calls “the biggest series of car launches” in company history, planned for the second half of 2025.

Still, Q2 paints a picture of an automaker navigating uncertainty. Even as demand grows and new models hit the streets, Mercedes is pulling back for political ones. Trump's protectionist policies are forcing foreign carmakers to rethink not only how they sell, but where, when, and even whether to deliver at all.

Mercedes-Benz just confirmed what many feared: politics now drives the global auto business.

Earlier in the blog, Les wrote about the Hoto Nex 01 Pro. It's a good screwdriver! Everyone loves it! But there's a different screwdriver that Hoto makes that holds a special place in my heart: the Hoto 25-in-1 electric screwdriver kit. If you're opening laptops or tinkering with gadgets, it's a must-have. It's 43% off for Prime Day, down to $28.49.

This 25-piece electric screwdriver is perfect for fixing up gadgets and working on hobby projects. The case has a magnetizer for the 25 bits, and the handle charges over USB Type-C.

I go to this set all the time for my laptop reviews, and often when I'm tinkering with other gadgets I own, opening battery doors on my kid's toys, building PCs, or even tighting screws on my kitchen cabinets. For anything that needs more strength, though, the Nex 01 Pro is where it's at.The 25 bits include Phillips head, Torx, tri-wing, pentalobe, and more — perfect for all sorts of small gadgets. The case also has a magnetizer so you can ensure your bit won't drop a tiny screw somewhere you'll lose it.



The screwdriver recharges over USB Type-C, which is convenient, though I wish the carrying case had a charging passthrough. That's a nitpick, though.You may see on Amazon that there's a new design coming with smoother edges. That's cool, I guess, but the company is shipping out old and new stock randomly, and everything else should be the same. I have the existing ""old"" design, and the ridges make sure I never drop the screwdriver.

The humble surge protector is an often-forgotten but critical component of one's desk setup. Unless you are just plugging in a laptop with no monitors, no docks and no powered USB hubs, you're going to need the extra outlets that a surge protector provides.

The best kind of surge protector is a power tower which stands vertically on your desk so it doesn't take up too much table real estate. I'm moving into a new office during the day so I just bought this Passus brand tower, which is reduced to $21 from $28.

Passus Surge Protector Power Tower: was $28, now $21 at AmazonThis power tower has 12 AC outlets and five USB charging ports, including one that is a Power Deliver 18W port. It has power switches on four sides so you can turn individual devices on and off.

The Passus tower has 12 AC outlets, three on each side. And what's special here is that each side of the tower has its own on/off switch, allowing me to turn some devices off and keep others on at the same time.

I plan to have my monitors plugged into one side of the tower and to turn them off when I leave for the day by cutting their power, not using the screens' individual power buttons. However, I will leave the side that powers my phone charger on 24/7.

This tower also has a set of five USB ports for charging USB devices. There's four Type-A ports that do 3 watts in total, which is not very impressive but is adequate for slow charging something like my headphones. Then there's a single USB-C PD charger for charging my phone and it outputs 18W.

The cord on the Passus tower is a full 10 feet so I can put it a few feet away from the outlet and still get use out of it. Overall, this is a great deal on a very necessary piece of equipment that everyone with a desk can use.

At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day

HOTO NEX 01 Pro is one of those products that you don't know that you need, until you are building a PC case / IKEA furniture / 3D Printer. It has great torque, looks great and it charges via USB-C. No wonder two members of the team bought one.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

The kit comes with a selection of Phillips, Hex, Slot, Torx, and Pozidrive 1/4 inch bits and a stand to keep the screwdriver and bits on your desk. Torque control is via a control ring, and a rocker power button controls forward and reverse rotation.

Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws.

I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver.

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage, and it is still going strong three days later.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

An all time storage great


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The flashiest M2 SSD might be the perfect answer to your custom build boot problems or expanding the storage of your PS5, but sometimes you just need a colossal amount of storage, as many terrabytes as you can possibly fit into a single 3.5-inch slot. Right now, at Newegg, you can score the legendary Seagate BarraCuda 24TB model for just $244, a cost of just $0.01 per GB. You can also opt for the smaller 16TB model, which is also on sale for only $194. If you're looking for even more options, head to our Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals 2025 article, which has tons of suggestions.

Both of these deals can be found at Newegg, with prices on both cheaper than anything Amazon has to offer. However, like Prime Day, the Newegg FantasTech sale if finite, and is set to end this weekend, that's if the drives don't sell out first.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

With its 7,200 RPM speeds, the Seagate BarraCuda won't be giving your SSD a run for its money anytime soon. Rather, this deal is all about volume, volume, volume. When it comes to 'cheap and deep' storage, this is as cheap, and indeed nearly as deep, as it gets. Both of these drives hit 190MB/s, which is plenty fast for an HDD.

With the same 7,200 RPM, 190 MB/s and 512MB cache as the larger version, this is a slightly cheaper option if you think 24TB is a little over the top, but you still want enormous bang for your buck, again netting you 1GB for just $0.01. 

Under the hood, you'll find premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, which is significantly superior to Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology, as SMR is only marginally better than actual shingles, given its slow data transfer speeds.

As a reminder, you should only opt for an SMR drive if you are prepared to compromise speed to score a cheaper price. Unfortunately, that usually isn't the best tradeoff. No worries here, though, as both of these deals are for premium CMR drives.

You're getting decent protection, too, thanks to a two-year warranty courtesy of Seagate.

We are working hard to find the best computer hardware deals for you this Amazon Prime Day.

We did not expect this to happen to a mid-range GPU.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A South Korean gamer says that their two-year-old RTX 4060 Ti reportedly caught fire and melted while being used for gaming. According to their post on Quasar Zone [machine translated], the GPU wasn't overclocked, and they weren't using it for anything heavy. They primarily used their computer for simple tasks on Adobe, and the most demanding game they played was PUBG. Although high-powered Nvidia GPUs like the RTX 5090 and 5080 with their 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 power connectors were known for melting, lower-powered graphics cards like the RTX 4060 Ti are not prone to this issue.

“I'd been using it for about two years, and suddenly, while gaming, the computer shut off. I thought, “What's going on?” and pressed the power button to turn it back on. Smoke started coming out and then flames burst out — I quickly unplugged everything, turned off the power, and disassembled the PC,” said the anonymous user. They also added, “About three months ago, I was in a rush for work and called a repair shop, expecting to get ripped off. They replaced the motherboard, and the computer started to work again. Since I was in a hurry, I accepted the refurbished unit they offered — now I'm wondering if this was a motherboard issue.”

Apparently, the user had an issue with their computer and had their motherboard replaced with a refurbished one a few months before this incident. They now suspect that the GPU bursting into flames was caused by the replacement, although it's unlikely to happen. The damage to the motherboard shows burn marks on the backside, near one of the screws that secures the heat sink on the GPU. There's also a massive melt pattern near where the LR22 inductors used for the GPU's voltage regulation are placed. You can see their location in 4060 Ti teardown videos, and the damage seen in the photographs indicates that the fire was likely caused by a VRM failure.

The user said that they'd sent their computer back to the repair shop to be looked at, especially since the motherboard was still in warranty. However, given that the damage was on the GPU, they're worried that it might not be covered by that.

This is such an unfortunate and potentially dangerous incident, and one that we did not expect, given that the GPU wasn't even a high-powered one. One commenter suggested that the screw with the most damage might have been over-torqued during manufacture, resulting in a short that led to the failure of the VRMs. However, this is pretty unlikely, especially since the GPU has been in use for a couple of years without any issues. Although the GPU did not come from an international brand like Asus or Gigabyte, comments said that Emtek was a decent South Korean GPU brand.

We hope that this is an isolated case and that the GPU manufacturer addresses the issue quickly. After all, with many gamers rocking this GPU in their systems, it's going to be a disaster if these start going up in flames during regular use.

Among recipients of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators, the omission of defibrillation testing (DT) was not associated with significant differences in mortality, or in the rates of appropriate and inappropriate shocks. Obesity and high shock impedance, however, predicted testing failure.

“These findings suggest that omitting DT [defibrillator testing] may be safe for most S-ICD recipients, challenging the necessity of routine testing in all cases,” the researchers reported.

“Fourth, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the incidence of complications directly associated with S-ICD testing, estimated at < 1 per 1000, including a 1 per 2000 risk” for death related to testing, they wrote. “However, the occurrence of DT-related deaths in patients with severely impaired LVEF [left ventricular ejection fraction] highlights the importance of a careful risk-benefit assessment in this vulnerable subgroup,” they added. In these cases, the risks associated with testing “may outweigh its potential benefits, warranting individualized clinical decision-making.”

“The risk-benefit ratio of routinely performing DT seems to favor not doing routine testing,” Raul Weiss, MD, and Jose Sleiman Morales, MD, wrote in an editorial accompanying the journal article. 

“A commonsense approach, therefore, would be to perform a low-risk 10-J synchronized shock in sinus rhythm to evaluate the system HV [high-voltage] impedance. If the impedance is elevated, (z > 90 U), then the system implantation features should be reevaluated with attention to posterior and preferably intermuscular implantation of the generator and minimal distance between the shocking coil and the sternum. These measures are likely to reduce the HV impedance. If the value remains elevated, then perhaps, in this scenario, DT offers clinical value,” they added.

This study was led by Fawzi Kerkouri, MD, MPH, of European Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris, France. It was published online on June 30, 2025, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 

Clinicians may have omitted DT in patients with low risk or those with favorable procedural characteristics, introducing selection bias. Residual confounding may have persisted despite adjustments. Some cases of sudden cardiac death may have been misclassified as deaths of unknown origin.

This study was funded by the French Federation of Cardiology and the French Society of Cardiology. The studied device was manufactured by Boston Scientific, which supported the annual meeting of the study investigators. Several authors reported serving as consultants and/or receiving fees from Boston Scientific.

At a recent session of the National Academy of Surgery, experts highlighted that minimally invasive techniques are playing an increasingly central role in proctologic surgery. Béatrice Vinson-Bonnet, MD, visceral and digestive surgeon at Poissy-Saint-Germain-en-Laye Community Hospital, noted that treatment for hemorrhoidal disease has advanced significantly, moving away from traditional hemorrhoidectomy toward less invasive, technology-driven procedures.

“Thanks to advances in technology, all surgical approaches now aim to be as minimally invasive as possible,” said Vinson-Bonnet. “However, before considering surgery, we prioritize medical treatment for hemorrhoidal disease — addressing intestinal transit disorders, particularly constipation, and educating patients on proper bowel habits.” Surgery is considered only when these measures fail to provide relief.

Until the 2000s, hemorrhoidectomy was the primary surgical treatment for hemorrhoidal disease. Since then, less painful alternatives have emerged, including nerve blocks and stapling all designed to avoid external incisions and reduce postoperative pain and recovery times.

One such option is the pudendal nerve block, which involves anesthetizing the pudendal nerve using a long-acting agent. This provides 12-24 hours of postoperative pain relief following hemorrhoid surgery. However, stool passage over the surgical site can still cause significant discomfort between days 3 and 10, and complete healing may take 6 weeks, Vinson-Bonnet noted.

In 1998, Antonio Longo, MD, colorectal surgeon from Italy, and director of the European Centre for Coloproctology and Pelvic Diseases in Vienna, Austria, introduced stapled hemorrhoidopexy. This surgical technique uses a circular stapler to remove a circumferential ring of rectal mucosa above the hemorrhoids, repositioning prolapsing internal hemorrhoids to their normal anatomical position.

“Although innovative, stapled hemorrhoidopexy has been linked to serious complications and is now often replaced by a simpler technique that uses an anoscope to locate and ligate small rectal arteries,” said Vinson-Bonnet.

According to Vinson-Bonnet, these techniques are limited to internal hemorrhoids and are not appropriate for large external hemorrhoids and do not allow the removal of large external hemorrhoids, often caused by thrombosis, particularly after childbirth in women. Another drawback is recurrence, with symptoms returning to up to 20% of patients within 2 years.

“Thermofusion, which uses microwave energy to completely dry out internal bleeding, is an emerging technique. While still under evaluation, it is already being used in clinical practice,” she added. “Other recent methods, such as radiofrequency — and, more rarely, laser — are also employed,” said Vinson-Bonnet.

Professor Émilie Duchalais, MD, PhD, digestive surgeon at Nantes University Hospital in Nantes, France, presented recent developments in minimally invasive treatment for fecal incontinence. She leads clinical and translational studies on this condition at the Institute of Digestive System Diseases.

“Sacral neuromodulation and Botox are two techniques mainly reserved for patients with fecal incontinence,” Duchalais explained. These are considered second- or third-line treatment options and are used only when medical treatment or rehabilitation has failed.

Sacral neuromodulation involves stimulating nerve roots near the sacrum, which engage in sphincter control and rectal sensitivity. “Five to 10 years after implantation, long-term improvement is seen in 50%-70% of patients,” said Duchalais.

A major advantage of this method is that it allows a trial phase. Electrodes are temporarily implanted at the targeted site, enabling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment over 2-3 weeks. “If the patient experiences at least a 50% reduction in incontinence episodes during this period, the device is permanently implanted. The system, similar to a pacemaker but placed in the buttocks, typically remains in place for at least 5 years, depending on the battery life,” she said.

“Urologists commonly use Botox to treat overactive bladder. Botox works by blocking acetylcholine, preventing muscle contractions, and reducing urinary leakage. In the rectum, Botox has a similar effect — blocking muscle activity and nerve signals to improve control in patients with fecal incontinence,” Duchalais noted. 

Although effective, Botox provides only temporary relief. “Its effects typically last 6-9 months. However, a recent study showed that after 5 years, patients required injections only once every 3 years on average,” she added.

Another approach currently under investigation is fat injection. “Researchers are studying autologous fat injection into the anal sphincter as a potential treatment for urge incontinence. The technique aims to restore sphincter tone by harnessing the regenerative potential of stem cells found in fat tissue.” A clinical trial led by Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, France, is evaluating this method, and the early findings are promising. However, this approach remains experimental,” said Duchalais.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections were associated with significantly increased risk for complications beyond pulmonology, including poor kidney outcomes and cardiovascular conditions, according to data from a pair of new studies.

In a study of nearly 45,000 individuals published online in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, Wang Chun Kwok, MD, of the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and colleagues compared data from 41,206 adult patients hospitalized with flu and 3565 hospitalized for RSV infections at centers in Hong Kong.

Overall, patients with RSV infection had significantly higher risk not only for in-patient mortality but also severe respiratory failure, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and acute kidney injury than patients with flu (P < .001 for all).

In addition, the researchers highlighted end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy as a significant independent risk factor for poor outcomes among the RSV patients, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.74 for in-hospital mortality (P < .001). 

The patients with RSV infection also were stratified by age based on current US recommendations for RSV vaccination (aged 60 years and older, younger than 60 years, and 50-59 years).

Notably, the findings of increased risk were consistent across all adult age groups, the researchers wrote. “The risk factors for severe RSV infections demonstrated in this study provided insights on the target patient subgroups for vaccination, especially among countries and places with limited resources that do not allow vaccination for the entire population,” they concluded.

The study by Kwok and colleagues provides an essential comparison, said Seyedmohammad Pourshahid, MD, assistant professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, in an interview.

“For decades, influenza has set the standard in how we talk about vaccine-preventable adult respiratory disease, but with RSV vaccines now entering clinical use, it's critical to understand whether RSV deserves similar attention,” he said.

“The findings speak to more than just respiratory illness. The added burden of renal complications and secondary infections makes it clear that RSV can be a systemic threat, especially in hospitalized adults,” said Pourshahid. What stands out is that this pattern was seen across a range of adult ages, not just in the elderly, which challenges the current boundaries we draw around vaccine eligibility,” he added.

Limitations of the study include not only the retrospective design but also the impact of variables including coding accuracy, variability in care, and the effect of existing vaccine use for influenza, which all play a role in shaping outcomes, said Pourshahid. However, the consistent trends seen in the study point toward a need to reevaluate RSV prevention, he said. 

“From a clinical perspective, this means not underestimating RSV, especially in patients with kidney or cardiopulmonary disease. From a public health perspective, it raises the question of whether our current vaccine recommendations are too narrow,” Pourshahid told Medscape Medical News. “With further data, particularly post-vaccine implementation, we may find that the case for broader immunization is stronger than expected,” he said.

Additional studies should follow vaccinated patients to identify any changes in the patterns of complications, Pourshahid said. “These kinds of real-world data will be essential in helping us understand not just whether the vaccine prevents RSV infection, but whether it also reduces the broader complications that come with it,” he said.

In another study, published in Clinical Infections Diseases, Paulina Sudnik, MD, of the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, and colleagues found that approximately one-third of 471 adults hospitalized with RSV experienced a cardiovascular event (CVE) during the high-risk period of the first 28 days after hospital admission.

Previous studies support an association between respiratory viral infections such as influenza and COVID-19 and acute CVEs, but data on the patients with CVEs in the context of RSV are lacking, the researchers wrote. 

The study population included 471 adults aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours with RSV. Overall, 174 of the patients (37%) experienced a total of 270 CVEs during the high-risk period. The most common CVE was congestive heart failure (25%), followed by atrial fibrillation or flutter (13%), and myocardial infarction (9%).

Although 44% of the CVEs occurred in patients with no prior history of CVEs, preexisting conditions including hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, or evidence of at least three classic cardiac risk factors were significantly associated with increased CVE risk among patients older than 65 years. 

Additionally, the monthly incidence of CVE after RSV infection was significantly increased compared to the pre-infection period, with incidence rate ratios of 18.5 and 1.6 during the high-risk and low-risk periods, respectively, compared to the pre-RSV period. 

The study was limited by several factors, including the retrospective design and a lack of data on subclinical cardiac injury and CVEs that were mild or occurred outside the hospital setting. 

However, the results were strengthened by the comparison of CVE data before and after RSV hospitalization, and the data may inform clinical decision-making on RSV vaccination, the researchers concluded. 

The study by Sudnick and colleagues brings needed attention to a dimension of RSV that is often overlooked, Pourshahid said in an interview.

“While most clinical focus has been on its respiratory manifestations, this work shifts the lens to cardiovascular complications and raises important questions about who is truly at risk and how those risks unfold,” he said. “The fact that many of the events occurred in people without known heart disease adds weight to the idea that RSV can act as a stressor, revealing latent disease or perhaps even provoking new events through inflammation and hemodynamic strain,” he added.

Several limitations prevent drawing broad conclusions from the study, Pourshahid told Medscape Medical News. “The data come from a specific region and rely on retrospective review, which limits how far we can generalize, and hospitalized patients also tend to be monitored more closely, so we may be picking up events that would otherwise go unnoticed,” he said. However, these limitations don't detract from the message that the RSV's impact is wider than clinicians might often consider, he added.

Clinically, the data reinforce the importance of paying close attention to the cardiovascular profile of patients admitted with RSV, even those without known cardiac disease, and contribute to conversations among policy makers and vaccine and vaccine developers, he noted. “Preventing RSV might mean preventing not just respiratory failure but also heart failure, arrhythmias, or ischemic events, which is an important shift in how we think about vaccine value,” he said.

Prospective studies that can look more closely at how these events happen, how often they recur, and whether vaccines can interrupt that trajectory,” Pourshahid said.

“As this study took place before RSV vaccines became available, we are in a key moment to begin tracking how the clinical picture changes in vaccinated populations,” he said.

Kwok and Desmond Yat Hin Yap disclosed receiving research support from GlaxoSmithKline. 

The study by Sudnik and colleagues received no outside funding. Sudnik disclosed having no financial conflicts. 

Pourshahid had no financial conflicts to disclose.

The majority of symptoms reported by patients after stopping antidepressants are mild and do not meet the criteria for discontinuation syndrome — a set of more severe withdrawal-like symptoms that some patients and guidelines describe, new research suggests.

The new findings raise questions about the necessity of routinely using long-term tapering strategies and suggest that current deprescribing guidelines may need to be revised, the investigators, with first author Michail Kalfas, MSc, King's College London, London, England, noted.

“I would hope that the guidelines from various authorities such as the Royal College… should be considered to be changed to reflect this most recent update in terms of the evidence,” the study investigator Allan H. Young, MD, PhD, told reporters attending a virtual press briefing.

Young emphasized the importance of weighing the benefits and risks when considering antidepressant treatment, noting that some patients hesitate to start medication due to fears of difficult discontinuation symptoms.

He said the new findings should help reassure both clinicians and patients, as commonly used antidepressants for depression and anxiety offer clear benefits, and any discontinuation effects are typically mild, limited in number, and tend to lessen over time.

The study was published online on July 9 in JAMA Psychiatry.

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms have been recognized since the 1950s, but clinical guidance on how to manage them remains inconsistent. While most international guidelines recommend tapering, there is little consensus on how long tapering should last or what symptoms to expect.

Previous studies have reported wide-ranging rates of discontinuation symptoms, but many lacked details on the type or severity and often did not include comparisons with placebo.

Current Royal College guidelines appear to rely on survey studies with self-selected samples, including users of tapering strips. These are “methodologically weak, with unclear response rates and probable selection bias,” senior author Sameer Jauhar, PhD, told Medscape Medical News.

“I am slightly perturbed that the authors of this guidance did not consider our critiques of clear methodological fallacies in this literature — which they were aware of,” he added.

To determine the incidence and nature of symptoms following discontinuation of antidepressants the researchers conducted a systematic review and analysis of 49 randomized clinical trials of patients who discontinued or continued antidepressants or discontinued placebo. Additional unpublished data from 11 randomized trials were also included.

The primary aim of the research was to assess antidepressant discontinuation symptoms using the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) scale, by directly comparing symptom scores between individuals who stopped taking an antidepressant and those who either continued treatment or discontinued a placebo.

A secondary goal was to evaluate the incidence of specific discontinuation symptoms in patients who stopped antidepressants compared with those who stopped placebo.

In all, the analysis included 17,828 participants. They had a mean age of 44 years and 66.9% were women. The follow-up was between 1 day and 52 weeks after cessation, with discontinuation symptoms measured using the DESS scale, or as reported adverse events.

Most participants had major depressive disorder, but there were a wide range of conditions including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, fibromyalgia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and compulsive-shopping disorder.

Kalfas noted during the briefing that the analysis included a broad range of antidepressants, primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine, duloxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and vortioxetine.

The investigators found that participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced significantly more withdrawal symptoms at 1 week than those who either continued treatment or stopped placebo.

Using the DESS scale, the standardized mean difference was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.23-0.39; k = 11 studies; n = 3915), which corresponds to approximately one additional symptom.

Investigators also reported increased odds of specific symptoms following antidepressant discontinuation, including dizziness (odds ratio [OR], 5.52; 95% CI, 3.81-8.01), nausea (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.01-4.96), vertigo (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 1.20-34.19), and nervousness (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.29-7.64) compared with placebo. Dizziness was the most common symptom, with a risk difference of 6.24%.

Despite including participants with major depressive disorder (k = 5 studies), the analysis showed no association between discontinuation and a re-emergence of depressive symptoms.

Kalfas explained that the primary analysis compared symptom levels in individuals who stopped taking antidepressants with those who either continued the medication or stopped placebo.

On average, those who discontinued antidepressants experienced about one additional symptom — 1.09 to be exact — within a week. The range of additional symptoms (0.8-1.36) remained below the threshold for clinically significant discontinuation syndrome, which is defined as four or more symptoms, Kalfas noted.

There were slightly more symptoms in those discontinuing duloxetine (1.61) and desvenlafaxine (1.37) than those discontinuing vortioxetine (0.56), whereas those who discontinued agomelatine did not experience any symptoms.

“This is a very important and interesting finding, those who discontinued antidepressants did not experience worsening moods in the first 2 weeks, although this outcome was measured in people with major depressive disorder,” said Kalfas.

The authors emphasized the importance of recognizing that antidepressant discontinuation can cause real, and sometimes distressing symptoms. However, they cautioned that both clinical practice and media coverage should present these effects in a balanced way.

Overstating the risks, they warned, could unintentionally contribute to or prolong symptoms through psychological factors such as the nocebo effect — where negative expectations lead to real physical symptoms.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Allen Frances, MD, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, and former chair of the DSM-IV Task Force, said the authors have “over-interpreted” their findings.

He added that the study does not change his clinical view that gradual deprescribing remains the best approach for patients who are not benefiting from a psychiatric medication.

Frances described the analysis as questionable and highlighted what he believes are three major weaknesses. These include the inclusion of underpowered studies, short durations of antidepressant therapy, and averaging symptoms across the entire study population. He explained that if only 1 in 5 patients experience clinically significant withdrawal with five symptoms, whereas the other four have none, averaging symptoms for the whole group can mask the true extent of withdrawal harms.

Mark Horowitz, MD, a vocal advocate for gradual antidepressant tapering and Visiting Lecturer in Psychopharmacology at King's College London, also noted a risk for bias in many of the included studies.

He pointed out that many of the authors have close ties to drug manufacturers and argued that focusing on short-term, industry-funded research may underestimate the potential long-term harms faced by antidepressant users. Horowitz discussed these concerns in an article for The Conversation.

Horowitz, who leads the Psychotropic Deprescribing Clinic at the North East London NHS Foundation Trust, pointed out that the study's average antidepressant exposure was only 8-12 weeks.

He warned this short duration likely underestimates the risk for withdrawal for the millions of patients taking these medications for years. A recent survey by his group found significantly higher rates and greater severity of withdrawal symptoms among individuals with longer-term antidepressant use.

However, Jauhar denied that his group focused on short-term, industry-funded studies.

“We included all eligible randomized controlled trials irrespective of length and funding source, one of which was the ANTLER trial, the most comprehensive primary study on antidepressant discontinuation, that had a follow up of 12 months and 70% of the sample was treated with antidepressants for at least 3 years,” he noted.

Evidence also shows that industry-funded studies do not report lower rates of discontinuation symptoms than studies not funded by industry, he added, and cited a study published last year showing no association.

“The vernacular in regard to funding is misleading and ignores the fact that almost all antidepressants in the UK are generic — i.e. there is no financial gain,” he added.

In a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Centre (SMC), additional experts welcomed the study for its clearer, more comprehensive analysis of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms, but also noted key limitations and the need for further research.

Katharina Domschke, MD, PhD, praised the study's stronger methodology compared with earlier, smaller studies with significant biases. Susannah Murphy, DPhil, highlighted the large dataset of over 17,000 patients and the inclusion of placebo comparisons but pointed out that the analysis only covered symptoms within the first 2 weeks after stopping medication and did not assess symptom severity.

Christiaan Vinkers, MD, PhD, said the findings help temper alarmist claims about widespread, severe withdrawal but acknowledged remaining gaps — particularly concerning long-term users and real-world tapering strategies.

A spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists noted that the study reinforces current understanding that most patients benefit from antidepressants, though some individuals experience side effects, and that this new evidence will inform future patient resources.

Overall, the consensus presented by SMC experts underscores the study's valuable contribution while calling for further research on long-term discontinuation effects and individualized tapering approaches.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) has released a comprehensive clinical practice update on lifting agents for endoscopic surgery.

Published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the commentary reviews available agents and provides clinically relevant commentary on their indications and use — with the caveat that it is not a formal systematic review but rather empirical advice for endoscopists. No formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was performed.

Led by Tobias Zuchelli, MD, a clinical associate professor at Michigan State University and a gastroenterologist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, the expert panel noted that endoscopists are increasingly resecting precancerous lesions and early cancers of the gastrointestinal tract.

“Although new endoscopic procedures have been developed, there had not been much in terms of high-quality guidance on lifting agents,” panelist Amit V. Patel, MD, a professor of medicine at Duke University and director of Endoscopy at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News. “With our better understanding and use of techniques, this commentary was timely. It summarizes the available data on the topic and includes our clinical experiences.”

Filling that knowledge gap, the document reviews in detail the timing and methods of agent injection according to procedure type, including the dynamic needle approach, the empirical merits of different agents such as saline (with or without blue contrast) and viscous agents, as well as lift-enhancing assistive devices — for example, the ERBEJET 2 high-pressure water jet, an adjustable hydrosurgical device to facilitate lifting. A chart provides an at-a-glance summary of agents and their pros and cons.

“The feedback from gastroenterologists so far has been quite positive on social media and on GI channels,” Patel said.

Endoscopic resection has evolved from snare polypectomy to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and now, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The primary benefit of submucosal lifting is the creation of a separating submucosal cushion between the lesion and muscularis propria (MP), which reduces the risk for immediate or delayed perforation of the muscle. Adding a contrast agent also demarcates lesion margins and stains the submucosa, which is fundamental to ESD and allows for assessment of MP injury during EMR.

For decades, homemade solutions were used to lift lesions before removal, with the sentinel agent being normal saline, later mixed with a blue contrast agent, usually indigo carmine or methylene blue. The authors noted that some endoscopists performing ESD start the submucosal injection and incision using a prepackaged viscous solution. “The endoscopist may continue with the viscous fluid or transition to saline or another less expensive solution,” they wrote.

Saline tends to dissipate more quickly than viscous solutions, however. In 2015, the polymer compound SIC-8000 became the first FDA-approved submucosal injection agent. Since then, several other fluids have come on the market, although homemade agents remain available.

Among the update's recommendations, the fluid selected for EMR should be determined by lesion size, predicted histology, and endoscopist preference. Based on the US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) on Colorectal Cancer, submucosal injection is optional for nonpedunculated colorectal lesions (NPCRLs) of intermediate size (10-19 mm).

Cold snare polypectomy without submucosal injection was later found to be non-inferior to other resection methods utilizing submucosal injection for NPCRLs ≤ 15 mm. 

The update noted that the USMSTF considers EMR first-line therapy for most NPCRLs ≥ 20 mm and advocates viscous solutions as preferred, while the use of lifting agents for pedunculated polyps is generally at the discretion of the endoscopist.

For Patel, the main “clinical pearls” in the update are adding a contrast agent to normal saline, using a viscous agent for cold EMR, and manipulating the injection needle first tangentially and then dynamically toward the lumen to maximize separation of the lesion.

In terms of the ideal, an optimal lifting solution would be readily available, inexpensive, and premixed, providing a sustained submucosal cushion. “However, this ideal solution currently does not exist. Injection fluids should, therefore, be selected based on planned resection method, predicted histology, local expertise and preferences, and cost,” the panelists wrote.

Added Patel, “A lot of the agents out there check most of these boxes, but we're hoping for further development toward the ideal.”

Offering a nonparticipant's perspective on the overview, Wasseem Skef, MD, a gastroenterologist at UTHealth Houston, found the update very useful. “It always helps to have the literature summarized,” he told Medscape Medical News. “It's a pretty balanced review that pulls together the various options but allows people to stick to their preferred practice.”

In his practice, the lifting agent selected depends on the type of resection. “Viscous agents are generally more popular for EMR-type resections,” Skef said. One unanswered question, he noted, is whether adding a hemostatic agent would be superior to a viscous agent alone. “But overall, this is a nice summary of available agents. Gastroenterologists should consider these different options if doing procedures like EMR.”

This review was sponsored by the AGA Institute.

A study showed that more than 28% of patients who exhibited violent behavior continued exhibiting that violence in subsequent healthcare settings, often beginning out-of-hospital and continuing in the emergency department (ED) or hospital.

""Our findings reveal that workplace violence spans multiple care settings, beginning in the out-of-hospital setting, continuing through the ED, and persisting into inpatient units following admission,"" the authors wrote, reflecting on the importance of exploring ""contributing factors such as care transitions and underlying risk factors to inform targeted interventions aimed at preventing violence and safeguarding healthcare staff.""

The study was led by Sarayna McGuire, MD, MS, Department of Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. It was published online on June 18, 2025, in Annals of Emergency Medicine.

The study results may not be generalizable to patient populations in rural or community hospitals served by EMS agencies that are not affiliated with hospitals and may have limited application to populations other than non-Hispanic White individuals.

Steatotic liver disease (SLD) was highly prevalent among adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, prolonged alcohol intake, or both combined and affected 70% of participants overall. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) showed the highest prevalence of elevated liver stiffness, affecting 25% of participants.

""Social determinants of health, genetic risk, and lifestyle factors further influence the prevalence of SLD, calling for nuanced management in primary care, particularly in addressing health inequality through preventive care initiatives,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Camilla Dalby Hansen, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark. It was published online on July 04, 2025, in the Journal of Hepatology.

Electronic invitation-based recruitment likely introduced selection bias and may not represent the general population. The single-centre design and predominantly White participant population limited the generalisability to other ethnic and cultural groups. Prognostic differences among SLD subclasses could not be detected due to the lack of long-term follow-up.

This study received funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation to the DECIDE project and MicrobLiver, the European Union's Horizon 2020 to GALAXY and LiverScreen projects, University of Southern Denmark, Region of Southern Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation, and AstraZeneca. Some authors reported receiving speaker/consultation fees and research support and being board/advisory board members of various pharmaceutical companies.

DISCLOSURES |  July 10, 2025  

Hair loss due to androgenetic alopecia remains a widespread concern for patients across the globe, as it severely affects their quality of life and self-esteem. With deeper insights into the biological mechanisms behind hair loss, a broader range of interventions are becoming available. Innovative methods ranging from laser-based treatments to microneedling and regenerative techniques are now entering clinical practice. These novel strategies offer promising alternatives, particularly for individuals who have seen limited benefit from traditional options or seek treatments with fewer systemic effects.

How well do you understand the latest advances in managing hair loss? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

Spironolactone reduces the influence of androgens, which are hormones that contribute to follicular miniaturization and hair thinning. In managing female-pattern hair loss, oral spironolactone is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach. It is commonly used to treat acne and hirsutism in females, especially those diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Patients with PCOS are often diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia.

Topical spironolactone can be used for both men and women. Botulinum toxin is a treatment currently being studied for hair loss, although more research is needed before it can be recommended as a standard treatment. Low-level laser therapy can be used for both men and women. Low-dose oral finasteride (1 mg) has shown limited benefit in women but has not been as effective in postmenopausal women.

Learn more about spironolactone.

Hair transplantation is a surgical procedure that harvests follicles from non-androgen-sensitive areas to areas affected by androgenetic alopecia. This procedure is best suited to individuals with nonscarring, patterned hair loss (typically androgenetic alopecia) who have a consistent and healthy donor area. Scarring conditions such as cicatricial alopecia damage the scalp and hair follicles permanently. For an effective surgery, the hair loss should be stable, and the patient should have a reliable zone from which follicles can be harvested.

Similarly, widespread thinning across the scalp (diffuse unpatterned alopecia) compromises donor-site quality. In alopecia areata, the immune system targets hair follicles unpredictably, making transplant outcomes unreliable.

Learn more about cicatricial alopecia.

For women with androgenetic alopecia who wish to evade systemic hormonal effects, topical finasteride offers a practical alternative. Unlike oral formulations, which circulate throughout the body and might affect hormone levels (potentially causing adverse effects such as irregular periods or reduced libido), topical finasteride delivers its action more locally, with minimal absorption. Although not formally approved by the FDA for this use, it has shown promising results in reducing hair loss.

Oral dutasteride, high-dose oral finasteride, and high-dose oral minoxidil are generally avoided in women of childbearing age due to their broad hormonal influence and risk for birth defects.

Learn more about androgenetic alopecia.

Micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, probably play an important role in follicle function. According to a systematic review, zinc is supported by research as a possible nutritional intervention for hair loss.

The average dietary intake of vitamin A and biotin is adequate. Excess levels of vitamin A can cause hair loss, and neither biotin (vitamin B7) nor vitamin E supplementation are supported by the literature. In addition, biotin supplementation can cause potentially dangerous false troponin laboratory results.

Learn more about zinc supplementation.

Low-dose oral minoxidil (doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 2.5 mg daily) has been used off-label with good clinical efficacy and safety. Caution is advised when prescribing low-dose oral minoxidil to individuals with preexisting heart or vascular conditions. Although it is commonly used off-label to address hair loss in both female- and male-pattern hair loss due in part to its ability to enhance blood flow to the scalp, minoxidil was originally designed to lower blood pressure. Rare but potentially serious systemic effects such as increased heart rate or shifts in blood pressure could worsen underlying cardiovascular problems with its use. The magnitude of cardiovascular adverse effects is dose dependent, with 1 mg oral minoxidil being generally safe and well tolerated. (Oral minoxidil might also contribute to facial hypertrichosis, and it is not advised for use in pregnant women or in those who are breastfeeding.)

Minoxidil is not the treatment of choice for autoimmune-related hair loss, such as with lupus and alopecia areata, but it could be used as an adjunct therapy. Adolescents with alopecia areata can be treated with minoxidil, which had similar efficacy to that in adults.

Following a recent cadmium exposure alert from the Union régionale des professionnels de santé-Médecins libéraux, a French regional body representing private practice physicians, attention has shifted to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of long-lasting industrial chemicals linked to serious health risks.

Générations Futures, a France-based environmental non-governmental organisation headquartered in Paris that monitors the health and environmental impacts of chemical pollution, raised an alarm after analysing data from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), showing widespread PFAS contamination in food across Europe.

PFAS, often referred to as “forever chemicals,” persist in the environment for decades and enter the human body primarily through dietary exposure.

According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, this chemical class includes thousands of compounds that have been widely used since the 1950s in industrial and consumer products, including textiles, food packaging, firefighting foams, refrigerant gases, non-stick coatings, cosmetics, medical devices, and pesticides.

Despite their extensive use, only three PFAS are routinely monitored, and four are subject to regulatory restrictions. However, many others contaminate water and food at levels well above health-based thresholds. PFAS are associated with multiple health risks, including endocrine disruption (such as thyroid dysfunction), metabolic effects (including elevated cholesterol levels), hepatic and renal toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and immune system impairment.

Générations Futures found that 69% of fish, 55% of offal, 55% of molluscs, 39% of eggs, 27% of crustaceans, 23% of milk, and 14% of meat samples contained at least one of the four PFAS currently regulated in food. In addition, the group identified seven other hazardous, non-regulated PFAS in samples of offal, fish, and eggs.

The EFSA has established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng ingested per kg of body weight for the combined exposure to the four regulated PFAS.

According to the data analysed in the report, a 4-year-old child consuming a single egg would exceed this limit by 1.4 times. A 60-kg adult consuming 500 g of meat would ingest 2.5 times the TWI.

The report highlighted that current regulatory limits prioritise economic considerations over public health. Authorities have set threshold limits on contamination levels according to observed contamination levels, aiming to remove only the most polluted products from the market. These limits also vary by food type and lack a consistent scientific basis.

Générations Futures calls on public authorities to follow the example of Germany and the Netherlands by implementing systematic monitoring of PFAS levels across all food types, not just meat, offal, and fish, and by strengthening regulations to limit emissions and reduce exposure.

The group supports the adoption of the PFAS restriction proposal 2023 under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals regulation, which aims to ban or limit approximately 10,000 PFAS compounds. The group also called for the revision of the PFAS limits set at the European level to better protect public health.

DISCLOSURES |  July 11, 2025  

Psoriasis manifests as plaque psoriasis in 80%-90% of cases. Additionally, these patients can be affected by multiple comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis, depression, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Approximately 125 million people around the world have this condition, making it a considerable public health challenge.

How much do you know about plaque psoriasis? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

The prevalence of plaque psoriasis between adult males and females has been shown to be generally similar, but females tend to have an earlier age of onset.

Genetic factors are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis. For example, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B13, HLA-B17, and HLA-Cw6 are associated with plaque psoriasis, and family history has been identified as a predictor of disease occurrence.

Though plaque psoriasis can develop at any age, several peak age ranges for the onset of plaque psoriasis have been identified (mainly ages 15-22 years and 55-70 years).

Learn more about the epidemiology of plaque psoriasis.

Many environmental factors have been linked to psoriasis and plaque psoriasis. Specifically, cigarette smoking conveys an increased risk for the development of plaque psoriasis. Other environmental factors that increase the risk of developing plaque psoriasis include all types of trauma, such as physical, chemical, electrical, surgical, infective, and inflammatory injury. Further, low humidity has also been identified as a possible trigger.

Learn more about the etiology of plaque psoriasis.

Latest guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation recommend earlier and more frequent screening for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia in patients with ≥ 10% of their body surface area affected by psoriasis. These comorbidities have long been linked to psoriasis. Additionally, shared genetic pathways have been found between psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases, including hyperlipidemia.

Learn more about comorbidities of plaque psoriasis.

Histologic findings in patients with plaque psoriasis include abnormal differentiation and excessive proliferation of keratinocytes, which is manifested by the loss of the granular layer. 

The diagnosis of plaque psoriasis is usually made based on clinical findings. A skin biopsy can confirm a diagnosis of plaque psoriasis, but it is usually not required. Biopsies are typically reserved for the evaluation of atypical cases or to rule out other conditions when there is diagnostic uncertainty. Similarly, laboratory investigations are rarely required for diagnosis or workup. Patients with severe disease might have mild hyperuricemia and low folate levels, which are believed to result from enhanced epidermopoiesis.

Signs of inflammation can be seen throughout the dermis in persons with plaque psoriasis, including marked hypervascularity and an increase in the size of the dermal papillae.

Learn more about the signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis.

Like other systemic agents, biologic therapies can be considered for patients with moderate-to-severe and refractory plaque psoriasis. They can be used initially in this setting as well. For mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, topical corticosteroids are usually the initial treatment. Further, combination topical/systemic therapy appears to yield better outcomes than either treatment used alone for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.

Not every patient with plaque psoriasis requires phototherapy; it is usually used in patients with extensive, widespread disease (ie, more lesions than can easily be counted) and in conjunction with other treatments. Patients who are resistant to topical treatment may also be candidates for phototherapy.

Oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has played a significant role in Australia's reduction of new HIV infections, but experts have sounded the alarm over ongoing challenges. They suggested that new, long-acting injectables have a potential role in ending the epidemic.

In 2018, oral PrEP became available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which provides universal and inexpensive access to citizens and long-term residents. The scheme led to a drastic rise in the use of PrEP.

In 2023, the number of people who had taken PrEP in the previous 12 months increased from 6432 to 45,244. While most new HIV infections are among gay and bisexual men (GBM), diagnoses among this group have decreased by 43% in the past 10 years.

But general practitioners (GPs) and HIV researchers told Medscape Medical News that despite the great intervention, there were problems related to discontinuation. More than half of new infections occur among patients who were previously on PrEP.

A 2023 study found that of all patients who were dispensed subsidized PrEP in Australia, more than 40% had discontinued for more than 6 months. By 2 years after receiving their first PrEP supply, 37.7% of patients were no longer taking it.

“In my clinic, a significant proportion of new infections are among people who took PrEP in the past but stopped it for whatever reason,” Jason Ong, MBBS, PhD, director of Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and professor of medicine at Monash University, Melbourne, told Medscape Medical News.

“That's one of the downsides of oral PrEP: It's contingent on someone taking it appropriately. As good as it is, people get fatigued and don't want to take it anymore and then put themselves at risk.”

Benjamin Bavinton, PhD, associate professor of medicine and health at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and group leader of the Biobehavioural Prevention Research Group within the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute in Kensington, agreed that discontinuation was an issue but said he wasn't surprised because research suggests that people come on and off PrEP throughout their lives.

“The question to ask is why this is happening. Why were they not able to get on PrEP before they engaged in the risky encounter? What were the barriers they faced in getting back on PrEP? Often, it's them not having enough sex to warrant them being on a daily pill,” he said.

But while some patients opt out of oral PrEP, others struggle to access it in the first place. “There are certain populations who can't access PrEP easily: those who can't access Medicare, such as international students. These are overseas-born men who have sex with men, and we haven't seen the same [HIV] reductions in this group,” said Ong.

“If you can't access it easily, you're not going to use it properly. And because they can't access Medicare, even if they do want PrEP, they're often not getting the right culturally safe advice, and many GPs feel that they're not qualified to prescribe it. Also, these populations may come from countries where PrEP is not well known and may face internalized stigma.”

About 60% of new infections in Australia occur among overseas-born GBM, said Bavinton. This finding highlights the challenges they face in navigating the healthcare system, along with language barriers, cultural differences, and concerns about stigma.

Sara Whitburn, MBBS, medical director at Sexual Health Victoria and chair of the Sexual Health Special Interest Group of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, told Medscape Medical News that she frequently provided advice to overseas-born men on how to buy PrEP online.

“But that means you need access to the internet and to feel safe and private. It's doable, but it takes more steps, and we know as human beings, the more steps it takes, the less likely we are to do something,” she said.

Last year, the government announced a $26 million program to provide subsidized access to PrEP for people living in Australia who are not eligible for Medicare. The program has yet to begin.

But as some patients struggle to take or access a daily pill, the FDA has approved a twice-yearly injection against HIV, lenacapavir, which offers almost complete protection against the disease. It has been hailed as the closest thing to an HIV vaccine.

A spokesperson for Australia's Department of Health said that the Therapeutic Goods Administration had accepted Gilead's application for evaluation of lenacapavir. But with a price tag of US$28,218 (AU$43,000) per year, experts fear that the government will be unable to agree with the company on an affordable price.

“A long-acting injectable like lenacapavir would be a game changer. It gets rid of the problem of adherence. It makes sense,” said Ong. “We've had a lot of demand for the injection; people want it…but unfortunately it's just going to cost the government too much money.”

Choice is a critical factor for PrEP adherence, and injectables could play an important role in helping Australia reach its elimination goal, said Bavinton. “It would make a huge difference, so it's really disappointing we may not gain access.” Drug companies need to understand that they can make money by scaling up massively and lowering their cost.

“Last year in Australia, 50,000 people had a prescription for PrEP. It's not a small market. But there's no way any country that subsidizes medicines based on cost-effectiveness will bring such drugs into the market with the current prices they want,” Bavinton added.

“It's about having options,” Whitburn agreed. “We need a range of options to suit people because taking PrEP every day does not suit everyone.”

Last year, the government couldn't agree with ViiV Healthcare on the price for another HIV prevention drug: a bimonthly long-acting injectable drug, cabotegravir. This impasse suggests that lenacapavir (which has the brand name Yeztugo) will likely face the same problem.

“Yeztugo would be considered for PBS listing if an application were received from the responsible pharmaceutical company,” the Department of Health spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. “The government cannot list Yeztugo on the PBS without a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).” When recommending a drug for listing, the PBAC considers its clinical effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

As Australia enters the tail end of the epidemic, it is essential for focus — and money — to remain on the goal, said Ong. “Investment should go up at the tail of any infectious disease,” he said. “It will cost more money at the end because we need to find the people who are already infected and protect the rest. But unfortunately, most people won't have that perspective.”

Bavinton reported having received research grants, travel, and honoraria from Gilead Sciences and ViiV Healthcare. The companies had no say in how the projects were run or reported. Ong and Whitburn reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The gap between a brain's chronological age and its predicted age on brain imaging appears to be a strong mediator of risk factors for cognitive decline, especially in individuals with cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), new research suggested.

In a cross-sectional study of more than 2000 participants, researchers used machine learning and brain scans to create a prediction model. An individual's “brain age gap” (BAG) was then determined by subtracting the chronological brain age from the predicted brain age.

Results showed that a higher number of cognitive impairment risk factors were associated with lower cognitive performance scores — and that a larger BAG may influence this relationship, with the strongest effects observed in participants with CeVD.

In individuals with more markers of CeVD, such as microbleeds and infarcts, the BAG significantly influenced the link between cognitive impairment risk factors and overall cognitive function — particularly affecting executive function and language abilities.

“This suggests that accelerated brain aging, as measured by BAG, plays a disproportionate role in cognitive vulnerability among individuals with vascular pathology,” study co-investigator Saima Hilal, MD, PhD, assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, Singapore, told Medscape Medical News.

“While we expected BAG to have some mediating effect, the domain-specific nature of this influence was unexpected,” Hilal added.

The findings were published online on June 18 in Neurology.

The investigators initiated the study to explore how the BAG neuroimaging-derived biomarker might help explain a connection between known risk factors for cognitive impairment and actual cognitive decline, particularly in Southeast Asian populations, Hilal reported.

“Prior research has largely focused on Western cohorts, leaving a gap in understanding how [CeVD], which is highly prevalent in Asia, may interact with BAG to affect cognition,” she said.

Additionally, she noted that CeVD often coexists with Alzheimer's pathology in individuals from Southeast Asia. Understanding whether BAG could serve as a mediator in that relationship “could enhance early risk stratification and open new avenues for targeted cognitive interventions in at-risk populations,” Hilal said.

The researchers reviewed medical records for more than 2000 participants (mean age, 66 years; 53% men; 60% with no cognitive impairment) from the Singapore community and memory clinics to identify cognitive impairment risk factors.

For this, they used the Cognitive Impairment Scoring System (CISS), which consisted of 11 sociodemographic and vascular factors, including age, education, smoking status, blood pressure, and history of diabetes.

The investigators also measured cognitive performance using tests that assessed overall global cognition, executive function, language, memory, attention, visuomotor speed — which is the ability to coordinate visual information with motor actions — and visuoconstruction, which involves coordinating fine motor skills with spatial abilities.

Within the study population, 1437 did not have dementia and 646 served as the matched control group. All individuals had undergone structural MRIs.

CeVD burden was determined using markers associated with small and large vessel disease and cognitive dysfunction, including lacunar and cortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities.

Results showed a significant association between a higher CISS score (showing more impairment risk factors) and lower performance across all cognitive domains measured, especially visuomotor speed (β = -2.7; P < .001) and visuoconstruction (β = -3.0; P < .001). 

In the full patient population, BAG significantly influenced the relationship between CISS score and global cognition (proportion mediated, 9%; P < .05), especially the domains of language (18%; P = .001) and visuoconstruction (10%; P = .008).

The effect was even stronger for those with high CeVD burden. In this group, the association between CISS score and overall global cognition was significantly mediated by BAG (20%; P = .01), as were executive function (34%; P = .03) and language abilities (27%; P = .008).

There were no significant effects in the low-CeVD-burden group.

“These findings underscore the importance of stratifying by vascular burden and considering domain-specific outcomes when investigating brain aging,” Hilal said.

“For clinicians, the key message is that the brain age gap can serve as a meaningful intermediate biomarker linking modifiable risk factors to cognitive decline,” she added.

The investigators noted, however, that the study's focus on a Southeast Asian population only could limit the generalizability of the findings.

“Future longitudinal studies should verify these relationships and explore additional factors not captured in our model,” they wrote.

The study was funded by the National University of Singapore, the National Medical Research Council Singapore, and the Singapore Ministry of Education. The investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A novel brain-based “aging” clock can accurately and reliably estimate how quickly an individual is biologically aging from a single MRI scan, offering a potential tool to help clinicians predict the risk for dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and other chronic diseases, a new study showed.

Investigators developed the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging (DunedinPACNI) to estimate an individual's pace of aging based on brain MRI features such as cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter volume, gray-to-white matter contrast, subcortical volumes, and ventricular sizes.

In a series of studies with more than 50,000 brain MRI scans from people aged 22-98 years across multiple datasets, those whose biological age outpaced their chronological age not only had poorer cognition, faster hippocampal atrophy, and greater dementia risk but also worse general health, including greater frailty, poorer self-reported health, and greater risk for chronic disease and premature death.

While more research on the new tool is needed, investigators said they expect it will be ready for use in clinical practice in a few years.

“Perhaps our boldest expectation is for DunedinPACNI to become part of routine clinical care across the lifespan as an index of faster aging that can help physicians identify patients at risk for later poor health well before symptoms appear and when prevention efforts can be most effective,” Ahmad R. Hariri, PhD, professor of psychology and neuroscience and director, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on July 1 in Nature Aging.

The DunedinPACE-NI tool builds on earlier research from a long-term study that has followed more than 1000 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972-1973.

The researchers initially used data from this study to develop DunedinPACE, a blood-based epigenetic clock that uses DNA methylation to estimate the rate of aging. While DunedinPACE has shown strong associations with morbidity, brain aging, and more. Itsy, its application is limited to studies where blood samples are available, the researchers noted.

To overcome this limitation, they developed DunedinPACNI, which uses data from a single standard T1-weighted MRI scan to estimate an individual's longitudinal pace of aging — a composite index reflecting physiological decline across cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, renal, and other systems.

The researchers trained DunedinPACNI on MRI data from 860 participants in the Dunedin Study, all scanned at age 45. The model incorporated 315 structural brain features. The algorithm for DunedinPACNI is publicly available to the research community.

Applying this measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), UK Biobank and BrainLat datasets showed that faster DunedinPACNI scores predicted cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.

For example, in the ADNI sample, individuals deemed to be aging the fastest (top 10%) when they joined the study had a 61% higher risk of progressing to MCI or dementia in the years that followed than average agers. The fast agers also started to have memory problems sooner than those who were found to be aging slower based on DunedinPACNI scores.

In the UK Biobank sample, healthy participants with faster DunedinPACNI at baseline were 14% more likely to be diagnosed with chronic age-related diseases later on.

The fastest agers had an 18% higher risk of being diagnosed with a chronic age-related disease than average agers. Fast aging was also associated with worse cognitive performance, higher frailty, and poorer self-rated health.

Over an average of nearly 10 years of follow-up, those with the fastest DunedinPACNI scores were 41% more likely to die than those who were aging more slowly.

DunedinPACNI also reflects social gradients of health inequities. Faster aging scores were observed in individuals with fewer years of formal education or lower income.

The measure also had similar predictive power for dementia risk and cognitive impairment among Latin American adults in the BrainLat cohort.

“It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains,” Hariri said in a press release.

“Right now, DunedinPACNI can only tell us if a person is aging faster or slower than others within any given dataset or sample,” Hariri told Medscape Medical News. “That is, DunedinPACNI is currently a relative measure. It doesn't yet tell us if a person is aging faster or slower than would be expected for any person anywhere in the world who is of the same chronological age. But that is changing quickly.”

Investigators need to develop normative reference charts for DunedinPACNI, similar to what they have done for such measures as height, weight, and BMI, Hariri noted.

“It will take time to analyze the tens of thousands of scans collected across the lifespan necessary to develop these norms, but we've already begun to do this. We are confident that reference norms for DunedinPACNI will be ready within the next year and, subsequently, DunedinPACNI can be adopted in clinical practice within a few years,” Hariri said.

Immediate applications of DunedinPACNI in the research setting include using it as an outcome measure in randomized clinical trials of interventions to slow down aging and as a biomarker of accelerated aging that can help predict the chances that an older person will convert from normal cognitive functioning to MCI or from MCI to dementia, Hariri explained.

DunedinPACNI could also be used in clinical trials of AD interventions. This could be as a surrogate outcome measure in younger people decades before they might develop dementia by showing that an intervention slows down aging, which is itself a major risk factor for dementia, Hariri said.

“In older people, DunedinPACNI may be useful as a screening tool to either reduce heterogeneity in the sample by enrolling people all aging at about the same rate or excluding people for are aging faster than others and who may be at increased risk for unintended side effects of treatment including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs),” Hariri added.

The authors have ﬁled a patent application for the tool. This research was supported by the US National Institute on Aging, the UK Medical Research Council, and the New Zealand Health Research Council.

A US study showed that prolonged emergency department (ED) stays and boarding times among older US adults increased between 2017 and 2024, especially in academic hospitals.

""Worsening ED LOSs and boarding contribute to ED crowding, reflect systemic health care dysfunction, and, most importantly, harm individual patients,"" the authors wrote. ""Addressing these trends is critical to safeguarding both the health of older adults and the health systems caring for them,"" they added.

The study was led by Adrian D. Haimovich, MD, PhD, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. It was published online on June 30, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

This study was limited by the overrepresentation of large academic hospitals, missing data for some encounters, reliance on system-generated time metrics, and the use of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-defined thresholds that may not reflect individual hospital goals.

The study was funded by grants from Harvard Catalyst and the National Institute on Aging. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)--29% and 85%, respectively-finds a large medical records study published online in the journal Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine.

What's more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition-18-64 year olds-the findings indicate.

Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers.

But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including if particular age groups might be more vulnerable they add.

In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on real-time data from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains electronic health records from 68 healthcare organisations across the USA.

They scrutinised the anonymised records of adult patients who had and hadn't been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.

Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. 

And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64 year olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn't been prescribed gabapentin. 

While there was no heightened risk among 18–34 year olds prescribed the drug, the risks of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49 year olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64 year olds.

Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between 3 and 11 times. 

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren't able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.

Nevertheless, they conclude: ""Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence."" 

They add: ""Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline.""

A new review reveals how timed eating patterns spark a chain of reactions in your gut and brain that could help prevent Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Study: Intermittent Fasting as a Neuroprotective Strategy: Gut–Brain Axis Modulation and Metabolic Reprogramming in Neurodegenerative Disorders. Image credit: Chizhevskaya Ekaterina/Shutterstock.com

A review published in Nutrients examined existing preclinical and limited clinical evidence showing that intermittent fasting (IF) may help reduce the toxic protein burden, support synaptic function, and rehabilitate glial and immune homeostasis across models of various neurodegenerative disorders.

Research has linked IF to higher levels of bacteria known to produce beneficial metabolites and regulate immune responses. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are crucial signalling molecules in the gut-brain axis (GBA), and existing evidence points to the role of IF in increasing SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia spp., and Anaerostipes spp. Preclinical studies have associated this with increased hippocampal synaptic density and reduced tau protein phosphorylation in animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

IF upregulates microbial gene expression, particularly enhancing the growth of butyrate-producing taxa. It also modifies bile acid metabolism and modulates tryptophan pathways, thereby improving the production of neuromodulatory metabolites, e.g., serotonin and kynurenine. IF has been associated with a decline in circulating monocytes, which are extremely important in the body's inflammatory response.

Chronic low-grade inflammation and inflammaging from the gut are increasingly recognized as key factors in neurodegeneration. Intestinal permeability, also known as ""leaky gut,"" allows microbial endotoxins to enter the systemic circulation, triggering immune responses and producing proinflammatory cytokines. IF can enhance SCFA-producing microbes, improving epithelial integrity and reducing endotoxin exposure.

Recent findings suggest that IF affects neurotransmitter pathways originating in the gut, specifically those involved in tryptophan and serotonin metabolism. Under IF conditions, there is greater microbial conversion of tryptophan into indole derivatives, which may offer neuroprotective benefits through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. This may also support the balance between intestinal and immune functions.

Neuroinflammation is circadian-sensitive, where hypothalamic inflammation can increase in the case of misaligned feeding schedules. IF reduces hypothalamic lipocalin-2 expression, restores hypothalamic homeostasis, and enhances astrocytic clearance pathways. IF's impact on circadian rhythms may also affect redox homeostasis in the brain and alter mitochondrial dynamics.

IF could enhance mitochondrial efficiency and antioxidant capacity by facilitating metabolic switching from glucose to lipid and ketone-based substrates, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB exerts neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant defences, modulation of mitochondrial function, and GBA. BHB has preserved mitochondrial membrane potential in preclinical models and improved cognitive performance in AD and epilepsy. BHB contributes to gut health by strengthening the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Merging BHB with GBA and IF provides a robust framework for reducing oxidative stress and enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics.

IF activates autophagy by activating SIRT1 and inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). SCFAs have also been shown to influence epigenetic regulation of autophagy genes. Elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, lowered amyloid plaque burden, and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD models, as well as similar effects, have been noted in models of Parkinson's Disease.

Existing research on neuroimmune interactions has demonstrated that IF modulates glial–neuronal interactions and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. IF influences neuroimmune homeostasis via GBA-integrated signals that regulate glial activity, cytokine networks, and immune–metabolic resilience. These adaptations are key for long-term cognitive preservation and neuroprotection.

Translating IF's promise to clinical practice requires thorough interrogation of mechanistic monitoring, safety, personalisation, and ethical deployment. It can be tricky to deploy IF interventions in vulnerable populations such as older adults, due to risks of hypoglycaemia, dehydration, and micronutrient deficiencies. Adherence can also be challenging, especially when cognitive decline hinders routine maintenance, making unsupervised IF potentially hazardous. Caregiver-linked compliance platforms, app-guided timers, and other digital solutions could bridge this gap.

A shift toward precision fasting is emerging, guided by increasing evidence that genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic, and microbiome-related factors shape individual responses to fasting. Incorporating circadian biomarkers, such as melatonin rhythm, sleep phase, and cortisol amplitude, offers a promising path for personalized chrono-nutrition. This approach may be especially beneficial for individuals with neurodegenerative disorders, who often experience disrupted circadian rhythms.

IF's pleiotropic effects make it an ideal backbone for multimodal therapeutic synergies. This is crucial in the case of neurodegeneration, where monotherapeutic approaches are unlikely to yield long-lasting clinical benefits. Co-administration of aerobic or resistance training and IF has yielded additive neurocognitive benefits in some preclinical and pilot clinical studies.

IF is emerging as a potentially scalable neurotherapeutic strategy. As clinical applications progress, the focus should be on incorporating IF into a comprehensive precision medicine framework. This could be done utilizing digital health technologies, multi-omics biomarkers, and complementary therapies. However, it is essential to note that most supporting evidence currently comes from preclinical animal studies, and robust, large-scale human trials are still limited.

Future research conducting randomized controlled trials should adopt stratified designs, integrate longitudinal biomarkers, and consider real-world adherence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Ultrasound technique enhances decision making for reduced fetal movement","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250711/Ultrasound-technique-enhances-decision-making-for-reduced-fetal-movement.aspx","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 04:18:00 GMT","

It can be difficult to decide whether to expedite birth when a woman in the final stage of pregnancy perceives less fetal movements. An additional ultrasound measurement to assess resistance infetal blood vessels can help make this decision more accurately, leading to fewer complications during delivery.

This is the conclusion of a large international study led by gynecologist Sanne Gordijn from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), in collaboration with Wessel Ganzevoort from Amsterdam UMC.

Sometimes, pregnant women perceive less fetal movements in the final weeks of pregnancy. Usually, this is not a cause for concern-the baby may be in a different position, or the mother may have been busy and not noticed the movements. However, it can be alarming for both the pregnant woman and healthcare providers, as it may precede severe oxygen deprivation or even fetal death. In such cases, the placenta may not be functioning properly, resulting in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply to the baby. Early delivery, before severe hypoxia occurs, may then be the best option.

Currently, when a pregnant woman reports reduced fetal movement in the final weeks, she is referred to a hospital. There, routine assessments are performed as soon as possible to evaluate the fetal condition. These include a fetal heart rate tracing and an assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid levels. While these details provide insight into the fetal condition, there may be more effective ways to assess it.

The researchers studied the effect of additional ultrasound measurements to assess placental function. The study focused on the resistance in the blood vessels of the umbilical cord and the fetal brain. These measurements provide further insight into placental function and the baby's condition. A total of 1,684 women participated in the study.

The study primarily examined the resistance in the blood vessels of the baby's brain and umbilical cord. Sanne Gordijn explains: ""The ratio between these two measurements is called the Cerebroplacental Ratio (CPR). The idea is that an abnormal CPR value, which may indicate a poorly functioning placenta, suggests it is better to expedite birth. If the CPR is normal, it may be better to wait, as the baby may not yet be ready. Women who wish to give birth at home can still do so in that case.""

The results of the CEPRA study show better outcomes for fetuses when the CPR measurement is known. Gordijn: ""This means we see fewer complications around birth when this measurement is performed in cases of reduced fetal movement, compared to current practice where it is not.""

According to Gordijn, the study provides essential information for obstetric care: ""If doctors know the CPR result, they can better determine whether reduced fetal movement is harmless or requires action. This ensures that both mother and baby receive the care best suited to their situation."" The guideline on reduced fetal movement will soon be updated, and the professional association will incorporate the study's findings.

New research reveals that while losing weight can rejuvenate aging fat tissue, stubborn immune cells keep a “memory” of obesity, offering fresh targets for lasting metabolic health.

Study: Selective remodelling of the adipose niche in obesity and weight loss. Image Credit: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, researchers utilized next-generation assays to investigate the regulatory factors, cell types, and molecular events involved in human adipose tissue (AT) remodeling. Their landmark study provides the most detailed view yet into how fat tissue transforms during obesity and weight loss.

Study findings reveal that obesity induces cellular senescence, inflammation, and structural stress within fat, which are only partially reversed by weight loss. Notably, senescence reversal was selective, occurring in metabolic adipocytes, vascular cells, and precursors where p21-positive senescent cells were nearly eliminated, but largely persistent in immune cells. In combination with the 171,247-cell strong atlas, these findings provide a revolutionary understanding of fat tissue plasticity, representing the first step towards novel therapeutic directions that may finally overcome obesity's notorious capacity to bounce back.

Obesity is a metabolic condition characterized by excessive systemic fat accumulation, with potentially lethal outcomes. Clinically defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m², obesity has been linked to several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and even certain cancers.

Alarmingly, more than 1 billion humans live with obesity, with today's suboptimal lifestyle expected to exacerbate this already grim situation. While pharmacological, behavioral, and surgical interventions have demonstrated promise in achieving weight loss, these benefits are often temporary.

These facts reveal our surface understanding of the association and correlation between weight loss and improved obesity-associated health outcomes, while emphasizing our lack of knowledge of the mechanistic interplay governing fat (adipose tissue [AT]) remodeling.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and progress our war on obesity by deciphering the cellular, molecular, and spatial changes that occur in human AT during obesity and after weight loss.

Study samples (subcutaneous abdominal AT) were obtained from morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/m²; n = 25; age = 20–70 yrs) and healthy controls (BMI < 26 kg/m²) intra-operatively via laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Follow-up samples were collected five months later for comparative assays. All samples were subjected to single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the Illumina NextSeq2000 platform.

In brief, the study profiled ~100,000 nuclei from fresh biopsies and integrated the resultant sequences with 50,000 additional nuclei from the largest human fat tissue atlas to date. To supplement this single-cell data atlas, the 10x Genomics' Xenium platform was leveraged to conduct spatial transcriptomics on over 25,000 cells from equivalent cohorts, allowing researchers to observe differences in tissue-specific cell states.

Simultaneously, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) AT samples were subjected to 5 μm sectioning, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and in situ hybridization assays, allowing researchers to both carry out nuclear identification and measure gene activity directly within intact tissue architecture.

Finally, the study used pathway enrichment (MSigDB), differential expression, transcription factor inference, and spatial niche modeling assays to elucidate the movement, activity patterns, and remodellings of metabolic, immune, vascular, and progenitor cell populations.

The present study makes five key findings:

Weight loss selectively reverses senescence in metabolic, vascular, and precursor cells

Metabolic adipocytes, precursor cells, and vascular cells of patients with obesity were found to express senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes and other markers of cellular senescence. These cells contribute to fibrosis, immune signaling, and local tissue stress.

Notably, following weight loss (bariatric surgery), the fraction of ""stressed"" adipocytes (AD3) was observed to decrease dramatically (from 55% to 14%; P < 0.0001), and p21-positive senescent cells were nearly eliminated in these lineages. However, senescence persisted in immune cells (macrophages), suggesting only partial and cell-type-specific rejuvenation of the adipose niche.

Immune cells retain inflammatory programming post-weight loss

While the infiltration of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) was observed to decrease following weight loss, these LAMs retained inflammatory signature (TREM1 and TLR2) expression, indicating transcriptional memory that may predispose to metabolic dysfunction and potentially explain obesity's frequent reappearance.

Adipocyte metabolism globally activates during weight loss but fails to restore lean-state flexibility

Weight loss enhanced substrate cycling (e.g., triglyceride hydrolysis/resynthesis) and branched-chain amino acid breakdown, but metabolic parameters (e.g., insulin sensitivity) remained suboptimal relative to lean baselines.

Weight loss reduces structural tissue stress and fibrosis

Weight loss was observed to substantially downregulate the expression of genes (e.g., LOX, ACTA2, and VGLL3) involved in fibrosis and cytoskeletal tension, resulting in reduced adipocyte stiffness and inflammation.

Spatial mapping reveals stress niches adjacent to immune hotspots

The study identified five functional tissue niches: adipocyte, vascular, stress, arterial, and stem-like zones. Stressed cells formed distinct ""stress niches"" adjacent to immune-enriched arterial zones, indicating microenvironments of obesity-caused damage with delayed recovery. Several stress-associated factors (THBS1, NAMPT, AREG) were found to be enriched in obesity and reversed by weight loss (P < 0.05), highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets.

a, Graphical representation of the primary study cohort (left; single-nucleus analyses in n = 25 obese (OB) people before and after WL and n = 24 lean (LN) people, with spatial analyses in n = 4 people per group) and AT anatomical location (right). b, Clinical characteristics of the primary cohort (n = 24 LN and 25 paired OB–WL donors). Boxplot, median interquartile range minimum and maximum. BMI, body mass index (kg m–2); F insulin, fasting insulin (mIU L–1); HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c (%); HDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mM); DBP, diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). c, Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of 145,452 human AT cells (n = 74 samples of the primary cohort and n = 13 samples of the Emont published cohort11, single nucleus). ASC, adipocyte stem cells; APC, adipocyte progenitor cells; Mono, monocytes; DCs, dendritic cells; ILCs, innate lymphoid cells. d, Cell-type proportions (for the cell types in c) in the combined cohort, mean per group, and for each sample (single nucleus). e, Correlations between cell types and clinical traits (Pearson, LN and OB samples only, single nucleus). Illustration in a created using BioRender (Scott, W., https://BioRender.com/rtmnzaj; 2025).

This study marks a prominent leap in scientific understanding of adipose tissue biology, highlighting that while weight loss can partially and selectively reverse the cellular damage inflicted by obesity (reducing inflammation, senescence in specific lineages, and tissue stress), some immune and metabolic programs retain obesity-associated signatures, potentially explaining the stubborn tendency for weight to return.

The findings highlight fat as a complex, adaptive organ exhibiting cell-type-specific memory, suggesting that future interventions targeting unresolved senescence (e.g., in macrophages) or niche-specific stress signals (e.g., THBS1/NAMPT) may improve long-term outcomes.

Emerging science spotlights pomegranate seed oil's unique fatty acids as promising allies for heart and metabolic health, if future clinical trials back up the early buzz.

Study: Punicic Acid: A Potential Nutraceutical Compound in Pomegranate Seed Oil and Its Cardiovascular Benefits. Image Credit: SiNeeKan / Shutterstock

Nutraceuticals are foods or food components that offer health benefits, such as preventing or treating disease. Pomegranate seed oil has shown great promise in its beneficial effects on health in multiple preclinical studies. Its potential role as a nutraceutical is the focus of a recent research paper published in the journal Foods.

Pomegranate seeds make up 20% of the fruit's weight, generating over 1.6 million tons of annual waste globally, now recognized as a valuable source of health-boosting compounds.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading killer among all diseases worldwide, causing a quarter of all deaths in the UK. It is associated with poor dietary habits, including a high intake of saturated fats, which increases blood cholesterol levels. Approximately 31% of CVD cases and 11% of strokes globally are traceable to diets with a high saturated fat content.

Fats in a healthy diet would come mainly from oily fish and plants rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with low amounts of saturated fats and trans fats.

All parts of the pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) are rich in nutrients and medicinal components. After the juice is extracted, the seed waste, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of its weight, becomes a byproduct. The 1.6 million tons of pomegranate seed waste produced annually are a treasure trove of bioactive compounds with enormous therapeutic and economic potential. For instance, pomegranate seed extracts have been shown to possess anti-cancer and anti-osteoporotic properties.

Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) comprises approximately 12% to 20% of the total seed weight, with a high punicic acid content. Punicic acid exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. It enhances immunity, improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, while reducing blood lipid levels. Additionally, it protects both the liver and kidneys.

Thus, PSO is an example of a healthy supplement produced from a waste product, largely due to its punicic acid content. The current review examines punicic acid as a potential cardioprotective agent.

Punicic acid transforms in your liver to 9Z,11E-CLA, a bioactive fat that may influence brain, adipose, and plasma lipid profiles based on rodent studies.

Punicic acid is an isomer of conjugated α-linolenic acid, characterized by three conjugated double bonds. It is the most abundant fatty acid in pomegranate seed oil, comprising up to 83% of the total fatty acid content. In addition to pomegranate, this acid is also obtained from various other plant sources, such as Trichosanthes kirilowii seeds.

Once consumed, the liver metabolizes punicic acid to a specific conjugated linoleic acid isomer (9Z,11E-CLA). Increasing punicic acid intake, for example, by eating more T. kirilowii seeds, improves its levels in blood by ~0.47% in plasma and its metabolites in red blood cell membranes by 0.17%. Human trials have shown inconsistent metabolic responses, and optimal dosing remains unclear.

PSO induces vasodilation, with a slight, gender-specific (female-only) decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. This effect is mediated by endothelial nitric oxide signaling via the nitric oxide–guanylyl cyclase pathway. It is independent of potassium channels, the renin-angiotensin system, beta-adrenergic receptors, and the prostaglandin pathways.

In preclinical studies, atherosclerosis in rabbits progressed more slowly with PSO treatment; however, other studies report conflicting results due to variations in experimental design. PSO protects cardiac muscle cells against oxidative stress, both by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by improving antioxidant capacity.

PPARγ activation doesn't just help glucose - it calms obesity-related inflammation by dialing down cytokines like IL-6 while boosting anti-inflammatory IL-10.

PSO reduces various lipid risk markers in the blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (‘bad' cholesterol), triglycerides, and total cholesterol, in some animal and hyperlipidemic human studies, though results are inconsistent across trials. It also reduces liver fat accumulation, with marked suppression of apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 secretion – this being an LDL component and a risk marker for coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.

PSO supplementation also reduces obesity induced by unhealthy or high-fat diets. It increases the expression of the gene uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat. It also promotes beige fat formation in white fat, thus reducing abdominal fat deposition by increasing the metabolic rate of fat tissue. Leptin levels are lower and adiponectin levels higher with PSO consumption.

In hyperlipidemic individuals, PSO intake reduced triglycerides and improved the triglyceride-to-'good' cholesterol ratio. The primary benefit of PSO appears to be its ability to maintain normal lipid metabolism, regardless of fat loss.

Feeling inflamed? PA specifically blocks TNF-α triggered inflammation in gut models, helping restore intestinal barrier function and prevent conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis.

Diabetes is a major CVD risk factor that doubles cardiovascular risk, and PSO may reduce diabetes risk. PSO improves insulin sensitivity and reduces fasting glucose levels in animal models and some diabetic patients, though human data are mixed. It may be a safer alternative to prevent and treat inflammation associated with cardiometabolic disease.

PSO may act by increasing mitochondrial energy metabolism and enhancing glucose absorption into cells that are insulin-resistant. These actions may be mediated by PPAR-γ.

Systemic inflammation underlies these chronic conditions, signaled by pro-inflammatory markers like (NF)-κB, TNF-α, and interleukin (IL)-6. PSO reduces these markers in cell and animal studies while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like PPAR-γ and IL-10. This not only reflects its ability to alleviate the inflammation that results in CVD, but also suppresses the inflammatory effects of obesity, diabetes, and the like.

PSO reduces oxidative stress while increasing antioxidant buffer enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. It also reduces lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant activity of PSO is attributed to its tocopherol and polyphenolic compound content. These effects have been well-documented in preclinical models but require further clinical validation.

Omega-3 PUFAs are established cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents. Punicic acid is a PPARγ activator, providing complementary benefits to these compounds by inhibiting lipogenic gene expression. Unlike them, it does not primarily act on eicosanoid pathways but rather inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines. It also scavenges ROS while increasing antioxidant activity through its conjugated triene structure.

The greatest limitation to the clinical use of punicic acid is the need for robust clinical evidence from human studies, with the few that have been reported showing highly inconsistent findings. Furthermore, more work is needed to establish its dosing, bioavailability, and metabolism. Significant gaps exist in understanding its long-term safety and efficacy in diverse populations.

PSO is rich in bioactive compounds, which account for both its nutritional content and its multifaceted health benefits. Punicic acid, a major fatty acid component of PSO, appears to help prevent as well as treat cardiometabolic diseases in preclinical models. The activity of punicic acid is similar to that of omega-3 PUFAs but through different mechanisms, offering potential complementary or synergistic benefits.

However, rigorous clinical trials are essential to establish the use of PA as a complementary nutritional agent – a nutraceutical – in the prevention and management of chronic disease. Until then, its therapeutic potential remains promising but unconfirmed in humans.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, ""What the Health?"" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

As he had wanted, President Donald Trump signed his big budget bill into a big budget law in a White House ceremony on July 4, cementing, among other things, billions of dollars in cuts to health programs such as Medicaid. The new law will also reshape rules for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and other health programs. 

Meanwhile, the threat of layoffs continues to hang over the heads of employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, and funding for health-related contracts and grants remains stalled. 

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Rachel Cohrs Zhang of Bloomberg News, Rachel Roubein of The Washington Post, and Tami Luhby of CNN.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews KFF Health News' Julie Appleby, who reported the latest KFF Health News' ""Bill of the Month"" feature, about some very expensive childhood immunizations. If you have a medical bill that's exorbitant, baffling, or confusing, send it to us here.

Plus, for ""extra credit"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too:

Julie Rovner: The New England Journal of Medicine's ""The Corporatization of U.S. Health Care — A New Perspective Series,"" by Debra Malina, et al.

Rachel Roubein: The Associated Press' ""RFK Jr. Promoted a Food Company He Says Will Make Americans Healthy. Their Meals Are Ultraprocessed,"" by Amanda Seitz and JoNel Aleccia.

Rachel Cohrs Zhang: The Wall Street Journal's ""Prosecutors Question Doctors About UnitedHealth's Medicare Billing Practices,"" by Christopher Weaver and Anna Wilde Mathews.

Tami Luhby: The Washington Post's ""A New D.C. Hospital Grapples With Too Many Patients and Too Few Nurses,"" by Jenna Portnoy.

Young patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, now have a better chance of having their own children after treatment. An international study led by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) at University Hospital Cologne and the University's Faculty of Medicine has shown: The new BrECADD chemotherapy regimen preserves fertility significantly better than the previous standard eBEACOPP – without worsening the chances of recovery. The results were published under the title ""Fertility in patients with advanced-stage classic Hodgkin lymphoma treated withBrECADD versus eBEACOPP: a secondary analysis of the multicentre, randomised, parallel, open-label, phase 3 HD21 Trial"" in the journal The Lancet Oncology.

In the HD21 trial, patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma received one of two therapies: either the experimental therapy with BrECADD or the previous standard of care eBEACOPP. Three years after treatment was concluded, there were major differences: In the BrECADD group, 95 per cent of women and 86 per cent of men had normal hormone levels again – compared to 73  per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the eBEACOPP group. More pregnancies and births were documented after the BrECADD regimen was applied. For men in particular, this means a significantly higher chance of biological paternity after treatment.

BrECADD gives young adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma a better chance of starting a family later in life – with an equally good or even slightly better cure rate.""

Dr. Justin Ferdinandus, Study Physician in the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and first author of the publication

""The HD21 study is fundamentally changing practice. Our data clearly show that BrECADD is the preferred first-line treatment for patients who wish to have children – at University Hospital Cologne and in the current Onkopedia guideline, this is already the new standard,"" adds Dr. Karolin Behringer, Study Physician at the GHSG and last author of the study.

The HD21 study is a randomized phase III clinical trial involving over 1,500 participants up to the age of 60 at 233 centres in nine countries. Among other things, the recovery of hormone levels (measured via blood serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone) were examined along with pregnancies and births after therapy was concluded.

The study was supported by Takeda Oncology.

Children from ethnic minority backgrounds and those living in areas with higher levels of child poverty were more likely to die in intensive care than White children and those from the least deprived areas.

Researchers analyzed 14 years of UK-wide data on more than 160,000 critically ill children and found that children of Asian, Multiple and other ethnicities were more likely to die in intensive care than White children.

They also found that children living in areas with higher levels of poverty were more severely ill on arrival to intensive care and more likely to die after admission to paediatric intensive care than those from the least deprived areas.

The study also reveals that children of ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to stay longer in intensive care and to be readmitted unexpectedly after discharge, compared to White children.

The study, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, is the first in the UK to report worse intensive care outcomes in children from more deprived areas. It was led by researchers at Imperial College London, University of Leicester, UCL and University of Leeds, and is based on data commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP)through its national clinical audit programme.

The findings raise serious concerns about equity in critical care for children and should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders, according to the researchers.

Dr. Hannah Mitchell, lead author of the study and from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said: ""Pediatric intensive care offers the highest level of support for the sickest children. Our findings show that inequalities persist even at this stage of care and are deeply troubling. These are not just statistics - they represent real, preventable differences in outcomes for critically ill children.

""Our findings are especially alarming in the context of rising levels of child poverty in the UK, where 4.5 million children are now growing up in poverty (31% of all children), 800,000 more children compared to 2013 (27% of all children). These findings should prompt urgent action from policymakers and healthcare leaders.

""Ethnic inequalities in child health have been highlighted repeatedly, and our study adds clear, national-scale evidence of disparities in intensive care. Reducing avoidable deaths in children must include serious, sustained action to reduce child poverty, improve access to healthcare, and address the structural barriers faced by marginalized communities.""

Our study reveals worrying inequalities in outcomes for children admitted to intensive care in the UK.

This is particularly concerning as use of Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is projected to rise in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of complex chronic conditions in children.

It shouldn't be the case that a child's ethnicity or postcode determines their outcomes in PICU.

Our findings show the urgent need for improved access to urgent care, reducing barriers to healthcare access, earlier recognition of serious illness in children, and more coordination between hospitals and community care teams to improve PICU outcomes across the UK.""

Professor Padmanabhan Ramnarayan, senior author of the study, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London

Children from economically disadvantaged areas or minority ethnic backgrounds experience worse health outcomes across a range of acute care conditions, with most of this research originating from the USA.

Evidence from the UK and the USA shows increased rates of admissions to PICUs for children from more deprived areas, and a previous Imperial study also reported increased rates of PICU admissions for children of Asian and Black ethnicities in the UK.

However, less is known about how this increased risk of admission to PICU relates to outcomes after admission.

In this new study, the team wanted to explore the effects of ethnicity and deprivation on PICU outcomes. They analyzed nationwide data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network of 245,099 admissions for 163,163 children aged 0-15 years admitted to UK PICUs between 1 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 2021.

They analyzed ethnicity and area-level deprivation at the time of admission. They compared this with mortality, length of stay during PICU and unplanned readmission within 60 days.

The team found that children of Asian ethnicity had higher mortality – 1,336 deaths per 26,022 admissions, while mortality was lowest amongst White children – 4,960 deaths per 154,041 admissions. Children of Asian ethnicity had 52% higher odds of death compared to White children.

Children of multiple ethnicities and other ethnicities represented 2.8% (4,514 children) of the overall group and had 20% higher odds of PICU mortality compared to White children.

Mortality was also higher in children living in areas with higher levels of child poverty – 2,432 deaths per 58,110 admissions compared to children in least deprived areas – 1,025 deaths per 33,331 admissions, revealing an association between PICU mortality and area-level child poverty. Children living in the most deprived areas had 13% higher odds of death compared to those living in the least deprived areas.

Both children of Asian ethnicity and children from more deprived areas were more severely unwell at admission than children of White ethnicity and those from less deprived areas. Children from ethnic minority backgrounds had longer stays in PICU (average 66 hours) and increased odds of unplanned readmission to PICU within 60 days (9%) compared with those of White ethnicity (average 52 hours and 6.8%).

The team has secured funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research to explore the possible reasons for the inequalities, such as access to healthcare, education and language in a further study.

A new device combining ultrasound and advanced imaging to provide crucial information for the safe delivery of drugs into the brain has been developed by University of Queensland researchers.

Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute said the device allows real-time observation of individual cells after ultrasound treatment, which is an emerging technology for the delivery of drugs past the blood-brain barrier.

The information learned about how treated cells respond and change could ultimately benefit the treatment of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

The blood-brain barrier prevents most drug uptake into the brain.

Insights from this device will help inform ultrasound treatment protocols and establish a balance where uptake of drugs into the brain is effective, yet still safe.''

Dr. Pranesh Padmanabhan from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences and Queensland Brain Institute 

The custom-built device will examine sonoporation-based drug delivery.

Sonoporation is an emerging strategy involving ultrasound-based treatment combined with injected 'microbubbles'.

In this process, sound waves interact with the microbubbles causing them to vibrate and exert force on the blood-brain barrier to create a tiny pore at the cell surface.

Dr. Padmanabhan said the device, developed over 5 years, will allow researchers to identify and map changes in treated cells and observe how they respond and recover.

""This device will enable scientists to understand how ultrasound-based treatments work at the single-molecule and single-cell levels,'' he said.

""It has the potential to improve treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where drugs target specific areas of the brain.

""The goal is really to improve the rate of uptake of drugs into the brain, as currently only about 1-2 per cent of small molecule drugs actually reach it.

""The results could also help inform treatment in other medical fields where sonoporation shows great promise, including cardiology and oncology.''

The research is published in Journal of Controlled Release.

The US International and two-time World Cup winner has been away from the sport for several years due to injury.

Tobin Heath, one of the most influencial women's players in U.S. history, has announced she is retiring from professional football, disappointing many of her fans who had hoped to see her take to the pitch once again.

The 37-year-old four-time Olympian revealed the decison on her RE-CAP Show podcast on Thursday (10 July).

“I think I had a few more mountains I wanted to climb with football, even though I'm really grateful for the career that I had,” she on the podcast.

“I get the question all the time: ‘So, are you coming back?' — and kind of like, well, the writing's on the wall.”

It's all gas, no brakes for Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna.

Luna recently became the talk of the American soccer world as he led the United States through the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Just four days after the U.S.'s loss in the final, Luna was sitting in Real Salt Lake's training facility in Herriman, Utah, speaking with media about his Gold Cup campaign and return to Real Salt Lake. 

“I feel good after this tournament, and now I'm coming right back into club and ready to perform for RSL, keep my foot on the gas because I'm feeling good,” he said.

At the Gold Cup, Luna started four of the U.S.'s six matches, tallying three goals — his first-ever national team goals — and two assists. 

“To represent your country at an international level is a feeling that you can't really put into words,” he said.

Two of his goals came within the first 15 minutes of the U.S.'s semifinal against Guatemala. His performance earned him Man of the Match honors.

Luna admitted Thursday that that game was the happiest he'd ever been on the soccer field.

“I think that Guatemala game was pretty exciting. I think it was the biggest game that I played at that time,” he said.

While the Gold Cup showcased Luna's scoring ability, the tournament also served as a teaching moment for Luna, he said.

“It really showed me that I can perform at these high levels. But at the same time,” he said, “there are other players out there that are doing things well that I need to match, that I need to become better at and different areas of the game that I think I can still learn.” 

Luna could have the opportunity to shine for the U.S. on an even bigger stage than the Gold Cup with the 2026 FIFA World Cup just 11 months away.

“I think this is the year to give it all, right?” he said. “I think this is the year to make sure I'm at my best and then see what happens from there.”

Luna called club playing time “one of the biggest” factors in the decision, regardless if it's in the MLS or Europe, where there have been rumors about Luna transferring.

“I think if it isn't obvious enough to see that this past Gold Cup team had many guys from the MLS, and we did extremely well — made it to the final — and I think that goes to show that it doesn't matter the league you're playing in. It's just about playing and performing at where you're at,"" he said.

The emotions of the Gold Cup have already faded for Luna as his attention has returned to the remainder of Real Salt Lake's season.

“I'm really focused here and now for the game on Saturday. That's kind of how it is, quick turnaround and yeah, ready to go,” he said.

Luna expressed his excitement to play in front of his home fans again, noting that he felt their support while at the Gold Cup.

“I'm excited,” he said. “It's something that I have been thinking about a lot throughout this camp is that I can't wait to get back and put on the RSL jersey and in front of the fans that have been amazing support while I was gone.”

He specifically mentioned a video Real Salt Lake posted on social media of fans wishing him good luck ahead of the final.

“It kind of made me tear up, and I'm excited to come back and play there and score goals in front of our fans because without them, without RSL, I wouldn't be where I'm at right now. So, I'm extremely grateful and I'm excited.”

We're cheering you on from the 801 ❤️Good luck tonight in the @GoldCup final, @diegoluna1511!! pic.twitter.com/HfqZgb1pRQ

Up next for Luna and Real Salt Lake is Saturday's home match against the Houston Dynamo.","{'href': 'https://www.deseret.com', 'title': 'Deseret News'}","soccer"

How Fluminense defeated Al-Hilal 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals. (1:04)

The FIFA Club World Cup was a success in Brazil, and a success for Brazil.

Right from the start, the traveling mass of Brazilian supporters created an atmosphere that forced some critics to concede that the tournament was much more than a preseason kickabout. As the country's four representatives (Palmeiras, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo) made progress, back home the competition was a main topic of conversation at every bus stop and supermarket line.

At times, it almost felt like a World Cup where the national team was taking the field four times in three days. There is a significant difference, though: Almost all the players of the national team make their living in Europe, some of whom are remote figures, little known to the Brazilian public. In contrast, this competition gave a chance to shine on the global stage to the players who are in action week in, week out in the domestic game.

Brazil places enormous importance on the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, a tournament that pits each continental club champion against one another. That competition has become an annual embarrassment, with the best Brazilian sides no match for the Europeans and occasionally humbled by teams from other continents. But it takes place at the end of the grueling South American season, when players are far from peak condition.

The Club World Cup would be different. This time it was all in their favor. They were in mid-season, the fans made it feel like they were playing at home, and, especially in the cases of Flamengo and Palmeiras, like Olympic athletes, they had planned and prepared to hit their peak at this very moment.

This, then, was a huge opportunity.

For some, it ended up being a disappointment. Botafogo sacked their coach just a few days after their epic win over finalists Paris Saint-Germain. At the same time, an internal crisis at Flamengo and some head scratching at Palmeiras happened following their early exits as they watched unfancied Fluminense make it to the semifinals.

From the outside, however, the balance has to be positive. Brazilian football took advantage of the opportunity to show beyond all doubt that its teams can compete at this level. It is highly symbolic that Fluminense were eliminated by one of their own youth products: João Pedro, who scored both goals for Chelsea as they eliminated the club from Rio de Janeiro.

The financial chasm with top-level European football is undeniable. To put it into perspective, Uruguayan forward Agustín Canobbio was the most expensive member of this Fluminense squad that played at the Club World Cup, when he arrived for €6 million from recently relegated Athletico Paranaense at the beginning of the year; Flu received an €11.5 million transfer fee from Watford for João Pedro in 2020, and he's generated nearly €100 million in transfer fees since.

For the foreseeable future, Brazil will continue to lose its stars. The latest local wonderkid, Estêvão, the most promising player to come out of Brazil since Neymar, gave Chelsea a show of his talent before completing his transfer to London from Palmeiras. Igor Jesus, Botafogo's excellent center forward, has joined Nottingham Forest. Gerson, Flamengo's attacking midfield powerhouse, moved on to Zenit St. Petersburg. The exodus will not stop.

Yet Brazilian football has come up with a strategy to deal with the situation. First, clubs use the money from these transfers to get players back from Europe, either as veterans nearing the end of their careers (witness Thiago Silva's triumphant return to Fluminense) or good players who have not lived up to expectations. Second, Brazil now treats the rest of South America in the same way that it is treated by Europe, trawling the continent for talent: as a result, some of the most important players (Flamengo's Giorgian de Arrascaeta is from Uruguay, for example) are foreigners.

No one played better for any of the Brazilian teams than Jhon Arias, the diminuative Colombian attacking midfielder. Altogether, 30 players from seven other South American nations (all except Bolivia and Peru) turned out for Brazilian clubs during the competition.

One of the most interesting is Álvaro Montoro, an 18-year-old Argentine recently picked up by Botafogo from Velez Sarsfield. His appearances off the bench in this tournament hinted at real quality. This trend will surely continue as Palmeiras have just announced the signing of Ramón Sosa, the Paraguay international winger, from Nottingham Forest.

Another trend that has strengthened the game in recent years is the influx of foreign coaches. While it's true that most successful Brazilian team in the competition, Fluminense, was coached by Renato Portaluppi, a local veteran, he and everyone else are being forced to up their game by the influx of names and new ideas, especially from Portugal and Argentina.

The turning point was the arrival of Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus in 2019. In the past few years, then, there has been more money coming in, more ideas, some good foreign transfers, and more stability than before. Jesus enjoyed a magical few months with Flamengo, leading an attacking quartet that locals had once dismissed as hopelessly naive for being too disorganized and offensively minded. With the European clubs focused on signing adolescents, clubs have been losing their brightest prospects, but not necessarily their best players.

When they won the Copa Libertadores in 2019, their midfield featured a blend of experience and prime-age talent. It had 30-year-old Éverton Ribeiro, 25-year-old De Arrascaeta, and 28-year-old Bruno Henrique, with 23-year-old Gabriel Barbosa -- then rebounding from a disappointing spell in Europe -- leading the line.

Flamengo were able to keep that attacking quartet together for years and, remarkably, major European clubs have not come in for Fluminense's Arias. Put all of these factors together and as the last few weeks have shown, Brazil can compete.

But could it compete better?

There is certainly massive room for improvement in the domestic game. The clubs still do not run their own league, and so they are caught up in an absurd calendar that imposes far too many matches on them. The issue was highlighted when Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca, speaking before their win over Fluminense, said that his team was at a disadvantage after playing 63 games this year, only to be corrected by a Brazilian journalist who pointed out that the Brazilian club had played 70 in the same period.

Many of the pitches are sub-standard, and a recent move towards synthetic surfaces is meeting pushback from experienced stars such as Lucas Moura, Thiago Silva and Neymar, who think the country deserves better.

Just as the clubs are too busy squabbling over TV revenue to get together and organize a championship, the game on the field can often be bitter and attritional. The meeting of Palmeiras and Botafogo in the round of 16 -- a 1-0 win for Palmeiras after extra time -- was one of the low points of the Club World Cup. But improve the spectacle, and with the talent on show, the number of big clubs in action, and the rich history of the game, there seems little doubt that the Brazilian league could be a worldwide attraction.

Brazilian side Botafogo stunned everyone when they beat Champions League holders PSG 1-0 at the Club World Cup.

Perhaps the past few weeks have hinted at an alternative future, though one that might be dangerous for South American football as a whole.

Almost a decade ago, there were concerted attempts behind the scenes to bring about a Pan-American championship. They fell through, but the idea will surely return. Since then, Brazil clubs have taken a stranglehold on the Copa Libertadores. They have won the past six finals, with four of them even all-Brazilian affairs. This dominance, by any country, is unprecedented, and it is hard to see how it can be challenged. The disappointing displays of the Argentine giants Boca Juniors and River Plate at the Club World Cup -- both eliminated in the group stage -- merely reinforce a perception that Brazil is outgrowing South American club football and the country's clubs are starting to look north.

They will be looking all the harder after the matches between Botafogo and Seattle Sounders and Palmeiras against Inter Miami, contests that were attractive, unpredictable and potentially lucrative.

The logistical problems are immense, as the Americas are huge, but after the evidence of the past few weeks, thoughts will surely turn to ways of having more matches between clubs from both sides of the Rio Grande.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has said the heat during Club World Cup matches has been “very dangerous” to play in.

The 24-year-old Argentina international has joined the voices who have called on FIFA to consider changes ahead of next summer's men's World Cup that will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fernandez has described feeling dizzy in matches due to the heat and has outlined how it has a detrimental impact on the standard of matches.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernandez said on Friday, two days ahead of his side's final against Paris Saint-Germain. “The other day I got a little dizzy from playing and I had to go on the ground. The truth is, playing at that time is very dangerous. It's very dangerous.”

Fernandez added: “The speed of play is not the same. Everything becomes very slow.

“Let's hope for next year they change the times so, more than anything, the football continues to be nice and attractive.”

The heat has been an ongoing conversation this summer, with many calling on FIFA to reconsider selecting kickoff times for matches around the middle of the afternoon, to avoid the highest temperatures. Those slots, however, have been considered more attractive for broadcast audiences in Europe and Asia.

The topic was reignited on Thursday after former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann stressed that part of tournament football is adapting to all circumstances, including the heat. The former German international is part of FIFA's Technical Study Group for the Club World Cup.

“Everyone's playing in the heat,” Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said on Friday. “Both teams are playing in the heat, so we can't really make excuses on our side. You just got to handle it the best way you can.”

The extreme heat has been an ongoing narrative during this summer's tournament; players have been seen with cooling towels on the backs of their necks or over their heads, and some teams have directed their substitutes to watch matches from the locker room.

To adapt, FIFA has issued hydration breaks during both halves. Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac early in the competition called on FIFA to prioritize the welfare of players in 2026 by pushing back kick-off times.

FIFA's Technical Study Group on Thursday spoke with reporters in Manhattan, addressing a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition. Klinsmann addressed the heat directly.

The 60-year-old represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup. As coach, he led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid the qualification campaign for the 2018 tournament.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament concludes on Sunday with the final between Chelsea and PSG at 3pm local time, which is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

The heat is expected to peak around kick-off time.

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has responded to Jurgen Klopp's criticism of the Club World Cup, saying the revamped, 32-team tournament is “needed” and that clubs would “100 percent … want to do it again.”

Wenger, who is now FIFA's chief of global soccer development, backed the new look Club World Cup, which wraps this weekend with the final between Chelsea and Paris Saint Germain, during a FIFA media availability session on Thursday in Manhattan.

Wenger leads the event's technical study group, which is made up of former players and coaches, including former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann and newly retired USWNT legend Tobin Heath, who analyze trends in the game.

Last month, ex-Liverpool boss Klopp, now head of global soccer at Red Bull, called the expanded tournament “the worst idea ever implemented in football.” Klopp took aim at how it impacted the football calendar and restricted time for player development.

Wenger was asked about Klopp's criticisms of the Club World Cup directly.

“I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and I don't share the view of Jurgen Klopp at all,” Wenger said.

“I feel a Club World Cup is needed. If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here then 100 percent of answers would be that they would want to do it again. That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.

“And the decisive question is, ‘Do the fans like it or not?' We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.”

The study group addressed a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition.

The pitches have been an ongoing issue, with players and coaches offering mixed reviews across its various venues. MetLife in particular, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final, was quickly criticized after the first game hosted there.

Wenger defended the overall pitch quality in the United States, insisted the tournament would remain as being held once every four years and praised the high levels of technical quality reached by PSG ahead of Sunday's final. He also addressed the future of the competition, saying “The next edition will be 2029. That's always been the case [rather than to play the Club World Cup every two years].”

Regarding pitch quality, Wenger said he received “very positive feedback” on the quality of training pitches and “very few complaints” about pitches for games. He described two venues with issues, singling out Orlando. It's unclear which stadium he intended, with the city's Inter&Co Stadium and Camping World Stadium both hosting games.

Wenger cautioned not to “underestimate” the quality of real grass fields, even if they require extra care.

“The grass is a bit different here. It's a bit harsher or more resistant than in other countries. The pitches were ‘flat'. But once we watered the grass, everyone was happy,” he said.

Heat has also been a major narrative in this summer, with scorching temperatures across the U.S. raising concerns over the possibility of midday or early afternoon start times in 2026.

“The heat in some games was a problem but we tried to combat that with cooling breaks, watering the pitches during the break and overall I feel we learned a lot on that front,” Wenger said. “Certainly, next year in stadiums there will also be more with roofs and the TV times will be more sensitive. At the same time, the weather conditions can be a problem for everybody.”

Wenger asked analysts to review the impact of heat on players. He said they found that temperatures over 35C (95F) impacted high-speed running, rather than their distances.

Klinsmann, who represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup and as coach led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid an ultimately doomed qualifying attempt for 2018, also spoke with reporters on Thursday. He recalled how unbearable the heat was in Dallas 31 years ago, but stressed that part of football is adapting to all circumstances.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer,” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament resumes Sunday with the championship at 3 p.m. local time, which as of Thursday is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees F with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

The inaugural Copa Gianni jamboree reaches its end game on Sunday as Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, two lavishly-backed super clubs based a short Eurostar trip apart, battle to be kings of the global game. PSG have undermined their rivals' complaints about packed schedules and player fatigue by flying in after Bigger Cup final and destroying better-rested teams. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benefited from a tournament that allows you to simply buy more players as you go – including those on opposing teams – in order to freshen things up. Whatever happens, football will be the winner, but has Copa Gianni been any good?

Asked at the end of June, Jürgen Klopp was unequivocal in his criticism, calling it the worst idea ever implemented in football (and it has some serious competition – Football Daily Ed). Almost two weeks later, Arsène Wenger has bitten back. “I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question,” Wenger told salivating hacks. “Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Klopp at all.” With a full fortnight to prepare his riposte, we were expecting a Bielsa-esque PowerPoint takedown, but instead got the kind of unsubstantiated guff that may have earned Wenger the gig as Fifa's chief of global football development. “If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here, 100% [would say] they would want to do it again.”

If by clubs, Wenger means the boardroom bean-counters and PSR plate-spinners who oversee things, he may be right. But what about managers, so often the public face of the team? We would ask Botafogo's Renato Paiva and Porto's Martín Anselmi what they thought, but they were both sacked for their Copa Gianni failures (which, in Paiva's case, included beating PSG). How did Pep Guardiola enjoy Manchester City's daring run to the last 16? “Maybe [in winter] it will be a disaster, we are exhausted and [Copa Gianni] has destroyed us,” trilled Guardiola. Well, at least his players enjoyed it, right? “My teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament,” said Manuel Akanji, who joined the rest of City's back line in downing tools against Al-Hilal.

Wenger also took on the issue of low fan turnout, saying “we believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher,” while squinting up at an empty stand as invisible to him as a contentious decision in Arsenal's favour. “We shouldn't underestimate the quality of the permanent pitches,” he added, rubbing a scorched blade of grass between forefinger and thumb. “The grass is a bit harsher here. The pitches were flat. But once we watered the grass, everyone was happy.” Apart from PSG's Luis Enrique, of course, who complained of playing surfaces “full of holes” that made the ball “jump around like a rabbit”.

And what about the heat, which made it “almost impossible to train,” according to Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca? Well, it turns out he was doing the training wrong. “I asked our analysts to analyse the impact of the heat,” Wenger added, while stuffing party packs of ice cubes inside his extra-long puffer jacket. “We found heat of over 35C had an impact on high-speed running, so sprints, not distances.” So, it's simple – to succeed in this tournament, or next year's Stay Away World Cup, players need to stop running. After all it's not like this is an elite competitive sport, right? Wenger's verdict may be good news for Cole Palmer, but it also proves the Copa Gianni – recently described as a “wake-up call” for player welfare – is a marathon, not a sprint.

It's the final round of Group B fixtures, with Portugal needing to gain three points and several goals to overhaul Italy in second place. Join us for Italy 1-4 Spain and Portugal 3-1 Belgium to see how it all shakes down (both 8pm BST kick-offs).

Arsène Wenger has refuted Jürgen Klopp's claim that the revamped FIFA Club World Cup is the “worst idea ever,” insisting clubs are desperate to be involved in the new-look tournament. 

Former Liverpool manager Klopp has been among those to criticise the 32-team, month-long Club World Cup on account of it further congesting the already bloated football calendar. 63 matches in total are played during the competition, which has been held in the United States and concludes on Sunday, July 13. 

However, ex-Arsenal manager Wenger, who now works for FIFA as chief of global football development, has rebuffed Klopp's strongly-held opinion. 

“I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don't share the view of Jürgen Klopp at all,” said the legendary French coach. 

“I feel a Club World Cup is needed. If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here then 100% of answers would be that they would want to do it again. That's the best answer of what the clubs think of a Club World Cup.

“And the decisive question is do the fans like it or not? We believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher. The answer is there.”

Despite Wenger's insistence that attendances were high at the tournament, there have been notably empty stadiums during a number of matches—especially in the group stage. Ticket prices have also been slashed for certain fixtures due to lack of interest. 

Unlike the previous iteration of the Club World Cup, the new format sees the competition held every four years. The next tournament will be staged in 2029, with the host country yet to be confirmed. 

Chelsea will play the final match of this year's tournament when they meet European champions Paris Saint-Germain in the showpiece event this weekend.

FIFA Club World Cup matches have been mostly forgettable, and worries persist about injuries and fatigue.

On July 13, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will play at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in the FIFA Club World Cup final, with the winner set to take home more than $125 million in prize money and a gyroscopic, gold-plated trophy. For fans, it's bonus soccer—a high-stakes match featuring world-class players during what otherwise would be a lull in the season. The tournament was designed to be a “big bang,” as FIFA President Gianni Infantino put it, a new beginning in what was, at least for European clubs, a blank space.

But the tournament's main selling point is also its main flaw. For many players, the Club World Cup is extra work—a slate of high-pressure matches during what otherwise would be a much-needed break. Chelsea left back Marc Cucurella, for instance, has been competing almost nonstop since last summer's UEFA European Football Championship. In a span of 13 months, the 26-year-old has played in 66 matches for club and country (Spain), putting in more than 5,400 minutes on the pitch, a workload far exceeding the norm for previous generations of elite players. It's simply too much, a dangerously heavy burden on a player's body and mind.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","soccer"

FIFA has already lowered prices for the Club World Cup final in an effort to attract more fans to attend the match on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

The cheapest standard admission ticket, to see reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain face Premier League standout Chelsea, has dropped from $312.20 to $249.75 two days before the final. 

Some seats in the back of the 100 sections were initially in the $440-$546 range, lowered to $334.50 to $473.90. 

However, premium club seats remained the same prices from Wednesday to Friday. Seats in the East Club remain $1,644.65, while seats in the EY Coaches Club are still $4,348.50. 

FIFA has been criticized for high initial prices for tickets, but has adjusted pricing, taking supply and demand into account. The cheapest tickets for half of the Club World Cup's group stage matches (24 of 48 total) were under $36 all-in with fees before taxes before the tournament. The Associated Press reported June 28 that at least 1 million tickets were unsold during the group stage. 

FIFA says 2.4 million fans have attended Club World Cup matches – with an average of 38,000 – and 21 of the 62 matches already played saw at least 50,000. While empty seats were a major storyline, the tournament featured NFL-sized stadiums in addition to soccer-specific venues in order to potentially fit more fans.

The first semifinal between Chelsea and Brazilian side Fluminense had an announced crowd of 70,556. The Athletic reported tickets for that match lowered from $473.90 to just $13 in a three-day span before the Tuesday, July 8 match. 

The Club World Cup's semifinal match, which saw PSG dismantle Real Madrid had an announced crowd of 77,542 people at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday, July 9. The vast majority were fans of Real Madrid — arguably the most popular team in the sport globally. Real Madrid's elimination certainly doesn't help ticket sales for the final, which could possibly see prices drop further into the weekend. 

However, the most attended Club World Cup match saw PSG beat Atletico Madrid in front of 80,619 fans at the Rose Bowl Stadium outside Los Angeles on June 20. ","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Ahead of the final, GOAL US writers discuss the CWC impact and whether a PSG win locks up the Ballon d'Or for Ousmane Dembele

PSG or Chelsea? That's what it's all come down to. Most will predict that the Club World Cup final can only go one way. PSG are the best team in the world and, over the past few months, beat all of the other best teams in the world. They are tactically brilliant, individually excellent, and filled with attacking weapons all over the pitch. Is this not the football we want?On the other side, you have Chelsea. The Blues have been up and down under Enzo Maresca. At times, there is a real vision here, a clarity to how they might play the game, and hope for the future. At others, they've been pretty ordinary, and evidence that money can't buy success all the time. It seems a mismatch, then.

But stranger things have happened on a football pitch, and Cole Palmer is pretty good! Throw in the jeopardy of a final, and this could be quite a compelling fixture.

It serves as a fitting end to what has been a bit of a chaotic month. The Club World Cup was criticized early on because the field didn't really feature all the best teams in the world. The final has served up two of the best available, but there are some big sides still watching from their sofa. Has that impacted the integrity of the competition?

FIFA Club World Cup

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has said the heat during Club World Cup matches has been “very dangerous” to play in.

The 24-year-old Argentina international has joined the voices who have called on FIFA to consider changes ahead of next summer's men's World Cup that will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fernandez has described feeling dizzy in matches due to the heat and has outlined how it has a detrimental impact on the standard of matches.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernandez said on Friday, two days ahead of his side's final against Paris Saint-Germain. “The other day I got a little dizzy from playing and I had to go on the ground. The truth is, playing at that time is very dangerous. It's very dangerous.”

Fernandez added: “The speed of play is not the same. Everything becomes very slow.

“Let's hope for next year they change the times so, more than anything, the football continues to be nice and attractive.”

The heat has been an ongoing conversation this summer, with many calling on FIFA to reconsider selecting kickoff times for matches around the middle of the afternoon, to avoid the highest temperatures. Those slots, however, have been considered more attractive for broadcast audiences in Europe and Asia.

The topic was reignited on Thursday after former USMNT manager Jurgen Klinsmann stressed that part of tournament football is adapting to all circumstances, including the heat. The former German international is part of FIFA's Technical Study Group for the Club World Cup.

“Everyone's playing in the heat,” Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said on Friday. “Both teams are playing in the heat, so we can't really make excuses on our side. You just got to handle it the best way you can.”

The extreme heat has been an ongoing narrative during this summer's tournament; players have been seen with cooling towels on the backs of their necks or over their heads, and some teams have directed their substitutes to watch matches from the locker room.

To adapt, FIFA has issued hydration breaks during both halves. Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac early in the competition called on FIFA to prioritize the welfare of players in 2026 by pushing back kick-off times.

FIFA's Technical Study Group on Thursday spoke with reporters in Manhattan, addressing a wide range of topics, from feedback they've received on pitch quality to how extreme heat has impacted the competition. Klinsmann addressed the heat directly.

The 60-year-old represented Germany at the 1994 World Cup. As coach, he led the U.S. to the round of 16 of the 2014 tournament before being fired amid the qualification campaign for the 2018 tournament.

“The heat is difficult. If you play in 90-degree heat, then you are going to suffer” he said. “This has been something completely new, and you have to deal with the circumstances. If a World Cup is in Qatar then you have to adapt. Football is about being able to adapt.”

The tournament concludes on Sunday with the final between Chelsea and PSG at 3pm local time, which is estimated to be a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit with partly cloudy, sunny skies.

The heat is expected to peak around kick-off time.

The ESPN FC crew look ahead to the Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG. (1:39)

Arsene Wenger has dismissed Jurgen Klopp's criticism of FIFA's revamped 32-team Club World Cup, calling the tournament a ""fantastic competition"" and emphasising the support it has received from participating teams, players, and managers.

Klopp, the former Liverpool manager, described the expanded summer competition as ""the worst idea ever invented"" in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt two weeks ago. Wenger, now FIFA's chief of global football development, countered these remarks on Thursday during a FIFA Technical Study Group (TSG) briefing in New York.

""Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and I don't share Jurgen Klopp's view at all,"" Wenger told reporters. ""I feel that a Club World Cup, a real Club World Cup was needed. If you make an inquiry today with all the clubs who were here at this competition, I'm basically sure that we have 100% of answers of people who want to do this again. So that's basically the best answer.""

Wenger also pointed to the unexpectedly high attendance figures as evidence of the competition's success.

""The decisive question is, do the fans like it? Attendance projections were low, but in reality, they were much higher. The answer is there,"" he added.

The tournament has provided FIFA with a testing ground ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will take place across North America. Wenger acknowledged that the summer heat in the United States posed challenges, but said FIFA has learned valuable lessons to address these issues.

""The heat in some games was a problem,"" Wenger admitted. ""We tried to combat that with cooling breaks and watering the pitches during breaks. We learned a lot on that front.""

He singled out Orlando as one of the venues where pitch conditions proved difficult, though he praised the quality of natural grass pitches overall. Philadelphia's surface, he said, would serve as a benchmark for future competitions in the U.S.

Looking ahead, Wenger said FIFA is considering using covered stadiums in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Houston to host early matches in next year's tournaments. He also revealed that FIFA analysts have studied the impact of heat on player performance, finding that temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) affect high-speed running and sprints more than overall distances covered.

""Certainly next year, there will be more roofed stadiums as we have to follow the TV schedule. We are learning to be better equipped to deal with these conditions,"" Wenger said.

Manchester United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo has hit a major roadblock after Brentford received a fresh bid for Yoane Wissa from Nottingham Forest. With the Bees unwilling to sell both of their star forwards this summer, Mbeumo's proposed move to Old Trafford is now in serious doubt — and the Red Devils may be forced to accelerate talks for the Cameroonian or look elsewhere.

Arsenal are reportedly considering giving up on their pursuit of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with only a “glimmer of hope” remaining.

The Gunners remain in the market for a proven No.9, with Mikel Arteta considered to have been in need of a prolific performer to fill that role for some time. Gyokeres ticks plenty of boxes after netting 97 goals for Portuguese employers through 102 appearances.

He has been pushing for a Premier League transfer, with the 27-year-old given permission to stay away from pre-season training while talks regarding his future continue. A delegation from Arsenal, led by sporting director Andrea Berta, has held discussions in Lisbon.

No agreement was reached, with Sporting demanding £69 million ($93m) for their most prized asset - with much of that fee being due up front. Arsenal are yet to bow to those demands, with the north London giants mulling over their options.

A Bola reports on how Arsenal are preparing to throw in the towel, with Sporting refusing to budge on the structure of a big-money deal. It may be that Arteta and Co turn their attention to alternative options.

It is claimed that a “glimmer of hope” remains when it comes to Gyokeres and a proposed switch to Emirates Stadium, with the Swedish sensation making it clear that his preference would be to head for England before the summer window closes.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso is reportedly set for “showdown” talks with Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior regarding their supposed lack of work rate.

Former Blancos midfielder Alonso only took the reins at Santiago Bernabeu ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, as he left Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen to become Carlo Ancelotti's successor in the Spanish capital.

He guided Real to the semi-finals of a global gathering in the United States, but saw Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain inflict a humbling 4-0 defeat on the Liga giants.

Alonso is now eager to address apparent issues in his ranks. According to Marca, one of those is how much effort superstar forwards Mbappe and Vini Jr are putting in. They are considered to not be working hard enough off the ball.

It is claimed that “Real Madrid's leadership have grown concerned over the lack of teamwork in the squad and are determined to end negative gestures towards team-mates, which have become a theme over the past season”.

Vinicius' performance levels are considered to have dropped off since he was a contender for the 2024 Ballon d'Or, while Mbappe - who netted 44 goals during his debut season as a ‘Galactico' - is being told that he can do more for the collective cause.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Despite its roots as a recreational pursuit of the elite, modern-day tennis is about as close to a meritocracy as you'll find in professional sports. 

Whether it's Wimbledon or the lowest-rung tournament in tennis' minor leagues, there aren't any shortcuts to getting in. You qualify based on accomplishment. You can only advance to the next level by winning. You eat what you kill. You get what you deserve. And you are what your ranking says you are. 

Unless, of course, you're billionaire hedge fund guy Bill Ackman. 

On Wednesday afternoon, the 59-year old founder of Pershing Square Capital Management will suit up at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island, indulging his sports fantasy while making a mockery of the tournament and the ATP Challenger Tour where players strive to eke out a living. 

""I am playing the best tennis of my life,"" Ackman wrote last week on X, where he posts frequently about politics and is often far-too-eager to embrace ridiculous conspiracy theories. 

Including the idea that he belongs in a pro tennis event. 

Ackman's enthusiasm for tennis is indisputable. He's a bit of a gadfly on tour, befriending several players and helping bankroll the Professional Tennis Players Association when it was launched in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. He says he practices nearly every day, seems to be in good shape for a 59-year old and, because of his access to top players, has found himself on the other side of the net from all-time greats like Roger Federer in informal hitting sessions. 

And still, there is no deeper story to what's happening in Newport this week other than exactly what it looks like: A wealthy tennis benefactor who started playing seriously a decade ago using his privilege to say he competed in a pro tour event. We can be honest about how gross that is – both in Ackman's desire to make it happen and the ATP's willingness to humor him. 

How did it happen? 

According to Ackman's social media posts, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios had proposed playing doubles together at one point, but ongoing injury issues delayed their partnership indefinitely. 

""Fortunately fate intervened,"" Ackman wrote. 

Of course, it's not fate. It's simply the privilege of being Bill Ackman. Let's explain. 

Even though entrants for every tournament on the ATP or Challenger Tour level must meet a rankings threshold or earn a spot through a qualifying event, every tournament reserves a handful of wildcards that can be given out at its discretion. 

The wildcard system isn't perfect and sometimes creates controversy, but in general they're used for reasonable purposes: An accomplished player who lost their ranking due to injury and is trying to come back, an up-and-coming star with local ties, a highly-ranked player who didn't enter initially but decided to play at the last minute.

The Newport event, which was downgraded from ATP-level to a Challenger tournament this year, gave the wildcard in doubles to Jack Sock on the basis of being a former champion of the tournament and one of the most accomplished doubles players of the last decade. 

There's just one little issue: Sock, 32, is a pickleball player and podcaster now. His last professional tennis match was at the U.S. Open in 2023, and there is no indication that he's planning a comeback. Also interesting: In an interview with Front Office Sports last week, Ackman said he had never even met Sock but that they were going to begin practicing together last weekend. 

So Sock – out of the blue, apparently – requested a wildcard from Newport even though his tennis career has long been over. The tournament granted it, and Sock listed Ackman as his doubles partner. Which, again, the tournament allowed even though you can't find results on Ackman in any of the public tennis databases kept by the USTA or Universal Tennis Rating (UTR). 

Why was Ackman approved to compete? One truly wonders – unless, of course, you know how the world works. 

But that's not how tennis is supposed to work.

Look, it's not the end of the world. While technically the Ackman-Sock wildcard could have gone to a legitimate team that needed the opportunity rather than a sideshow, nobody's career is going to hinge on missing the cut for the doubles draw at the Newport Challenger. 

But this isn't a golf pro-am. It's the real thing. And as long as we have pro sports, you'd like them to be played by professionals and not exist for the whims of potential benefactors who have a ton of money and a delusion about how good they are at playing tennis.

It's a bad look, and it certainly doesn't help the image of a sport that does not necessarily deserve its country club reputation. While some top-ranked players came from privilege, it's not really that different from most other sports. The top two men's players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both emerged from middle class backgrounds. Djokovic grew up flat-out poor in a war-torn country. Coco Gauff started on the public courts in Delray Beach, Florida, inspired by Serena and Venus Williams' rise from Compton, California, to the top of the sport. And even for those who had advantages like Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills, there's no faking it in tennis. 

You have to win the right matches to establish your ranking, which gets you in the right tournaments, which only allows you to maintain that privilege if you keep winning. 

You can't use your social media fame or friendships or wealth to buy your way onto the pro tour.

Unless, apparently, you're Bill Ackman. ","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic is a natural born winner. Using every weapon in his armoury and every advantage the rules of the game allow has got him to a staggering 24 Grand Slam titles, and put him in a position to hunt down a record-breaking 25th at the age of 38.

World No.1 Jannik Sinner stands in his way, with the pair going head-to-head in a Wimbledon semi-final this afternoon. Although Sinner is only 23, it will be the third time they have met competitively at SW19, with Djokovic winning the two previous encounters. During their first Wimbledon showdown, in 2022, Djokovic came back from two sets down to break Sinner's heart.

And he admitted after winning 5-7 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-2 that a lengthy toilet break partway through the match, and what he did during it, instigated the turnaround.

""He was the better player for the first two sets but I had a toilet break and a pep talk in the mirror,"" explained the Serb. ""It's true - sometimes these things are necessary. The toilet break was the turning point. I go through the same doubtful moments as anyone else. The inner fight is the biggest fight you go through.""

Djokovic used the crafty toilet break to his advantage while players were still free to do so. Since then, the ATP has introduced rules limiting the number of breaks a player can request during the match, as well as the length of them and when they are granted.



In the current landscape, players are only permitted to take one three-minute toilet break per match, and it must be taken at the end of a set. It remains to be seen whether that has any bearing on Djokovic and Sinner's 10th competitive meeting.

Sinner has won five of the previous nine, including the last four in a row. And unlike their 2022 contest, which Djokovic entered as the top seed and Sinner as the 10th, the Italian now goes in as the top dog with his veteran opponent seeded sixth.

Djokovic rated his chances ahead of the clash, saying: ""I don't think I'm a favourite against these guys [Carlos Alcaraz and Sinner] at the moment. But I probably have my best chance against them here.

""If it comes down to me facing one or both of them, which I hope it does, as it would mean I have proceeded all the way to the final, then I'll obviously look for my best game to win. I think I do have a chance. There's no doubt about it.""

 Grigor Dimitrov's Wimbledon exit due to injury was one of the most heartbreaking scenes on a tennis court in recent memory, but the Bulgarian's path to recovery has already begun. 

 Dimitrov, who was forced to retire due to a pectoral muscle injury sustained when he led Jannik Sinner by two sets to love in the fourth round at the grass major, sent a defiant message to fans via social media on Friday. 

A post shared by Grigor Dimitrov (@grigordimitrov)

 “Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,” wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed. “Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career. 

 “Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.”

After she was in the eye of the storm due to her post-match speech after her loss to Coco Gauff in the French Open earlier this year, where she was criticized for her words, Belarusian player and World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka jokingly told reporters that they wouldn't get that sort of reaction after her Wimbledon loss.

“Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a Roland-Garros press conference,” Sabalenka said on Thursday when she arrived for her question-and-answer session after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4 4-6 6-4 at Centre Court. “So anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now.” 

The online vitriol was so intense that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club.

“I just don't want to face that hate again. We're all people. We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option,” the 27-year-old said.

“The first moment (is) always the worst one, because every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream. Then you lose the match, and you feel like, OK, this is the end,” she added. 

Talking about Anisimova, Sabalenka said that her opponent played a brave brand of tennis.

“She was more brave today. Maybe when I was just trying to stay in the point, she was going for all. She was playing more aggressive,” she said.



Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025. She also was trying to get to her first title match at Wimbledon but ultimately fell short.

John McEnroe is known for being an outspoken individual especially during his tennis career.

The American has never been afraid to speak his mind, as his memorable outbursts at chair umpires illustrate.

Since his playing days John McEnroe, 66, has gone on to become one of tennis' most successful commentators.

But following the conclusion of the men's French Open final a month ago, the former world number one made a comment that left some members of the tennis world both surprised and unhappy.

The tennis world was left in awe after witnessing an all-time classic French Open final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

The Spaniard came from two sets down and saved match points in the fourth set to win 4–6, 6–7, 6–4, 7–6, 7–6 in five hours and 29 minutes, the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time.

After seeing the level they were able to produce, McEnroe seemed to suggest that Sinner and Alcaraz could beat Rafael Nadal in his prime at the French Open. The seven-time Grand Slam champion's comments were criticised, but he has since clarified what he meant.

“He would still win six or seven of them. He might not have won 14 of them, that's all I am saying. That these guys could challenge him. I did not say that they are better than him,” McEnroe told 6-Love-6 on BBC Sounds.

“Nadal would have the same equipment and blah, blah, blah. They just make it up [what he said]. They didn't misunderstand it, they made it up.

“This is what I said ‘the fact you could even think someone could compete with Nadal is amazing'. You could look at Alcaraz the way he plays at the French and go, he could give him a match.”

Nadal played Sinner and Alcaraz a combined total of six times during his career.

The 22-time Grand Slam champion defeated Sinner each of the three times they faced one another. Each meeting took place on clay and the current world number one was unable to win a set.

Like Sinner, Nadal played his 2024 Olympics doubles partner Alcaraz on three occasions. The first match came at the 2021 Madrid Open, where Nadal secured a comprehensive 6-1, 6-2 victory.

The following year they met in the Indian Wells semi-finals, which Nadal claimed in three sets in blustery conditions.

 ‘But in their third and final meeting, Alcaraz and Nadal played in the Spanish capital once again, and this time it was the younger Spaniard who prevailed, bringing their short rivalry to an end.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Swiatek crushed Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 to reach the Wimbledon final on Thursday after years of trying and failing to make a major impact at the grasscourt Grand Slam.

She has made no secret of her preference for clay courts, and her four French Open titles were clear evidence that Paris's red dirt was more to her liking than Wimbledon's lawns.

Yet her defeat to Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open semi-finals in early June ended her chances of a fourth straight title in Paris and ensured few were tipping her for a career-best run at Wimbledon.

""I think I'm not going to have seasons where the pressure is not going to be kind of forced on me from the expectations from the outside anymore,"" she said after setting up a Saturday showdown against American Amanda Anisimova.

""Every year, I guess it's kind of the same, but I feel sometimes I can handle it better or ignore it. Sometimes a bit worse.

""I don't know. Like, honestly, I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practise.

""If I win Roland Garros, and then I come here and everybody asks me already about... They put, like, super high expectations.""

Five-time Grand Slam winner Swiatek was in a league of her own on a scorching Centre Court on Thursday, blitzing past Tokyo Olympic champion Bencic in the blink of an eye.

She has dropped only one set in her run to the final and suddenly looks at home on grass, a surface she has previously struggled to master.

""Every point is different and every match I need to adjust my game, but for sure I feel like I improved my movement,"" she said, summing up what had changed for her on the surface.

""I'm serving really well and I feel really confident, so I'm just going for it and it's working, so I will keep doing that.""

As Alcaraz looks to win his third Wimbledon title in a row, here's who's cheering him on from his box in Centre Court.

Carlos Alcaraz is looking to win his third Wimbledon title in this weekend, he'll be supported on Centre Court by his team and family.

Here, a guide to who sits in Alcaraz's player's box:

Former professional tennis player Juan Carlos Ferrero has been coaching Alcaraz since 2019. They started working together when Alcaraz was just 16. Under his tutelage, Alcaraz has won the French Open, Wimbledon (twice), the U.S. Open., and seven Masters 1000 tournaments.

“The mental side is something we've tried to work on with him for a long time,” Ferrero said during this year's French Open. “Routines, ways of behaving on court, how to pick himself up when he's in trouble, pre-match chats, chats the day before, preparations for matches... All these kinds of situations that arise with a player, we've been working on them for some time.”

Another key person the coaching team is Samuel Lopez, who began working with Alcaraz on a permenant basis in December 2024 ahead of the 2025 season. During the Australian Open 2024, when Ferrero was undergoing knee surgery, Lopez stood in for him.

Of his coaches, Alcaraz said, “They trust each other 100 percent and being able to travel with both, for me, it's going to be great. I think I'm going to grow as a player thanks to them. I think we are going to work pretty hard and pretty good for the next season and the next years. Hopefully we are going to make good results together.”

Another mainstay of Alcaraz's player's box are his parents, mom Virginia Garfia Escandon and dad Carlos Alcaraz Gonzalez. “I loved tennis since the beginning,” Alcaraz told Sports Illustrated in 2022. “I mean my father brought me my first racket and the first time that I played tennis I fell in love.”

When he won the 2024 French Open, he said to his parents, “For me, it's amazing to have you here supporting me. Since I was a little kid, as I said many times, I was running from school to put the TV on to watch this tournament on the TV, now I am lifting the trophy in front of all of you.”

His grandfather, Carlos Alcaraz Lerma, also sometimes makes an appearance.

Alcaraz has two younger brothers and one older brother; his older brother Álvaro often travels with him and is in his box.

“I have my brother here as well,” Alcaraz said after he lost the the 2023 Cincinnati Open. “It's great to have you here, supporting me every day, to make me be a better person every day, learning from you as well, so thank you very much for being with me.”

“When we prepare Carlos for any competition it is for him to win,” Moreno said. “As a team there is no other goal in our head that is not winning the tournament we are entering. Also avoiding injuries, if possible, which is the biggest concern for the technical staff, being aware that achieving sporting results or performances can often come at the cost of caring for the body. But that's high-performance sport and we accept the challenge.”

He added, “Together with his manager Albert Molina and Ferrero, we're the people who spend the longest at his side. I'm available to him 24/7, 365 days a year. We know him very well and we know that all the physical work was done.”

Albert Molina discovered Carlos Alcaraz at the age of 12, and has been on his team ever since.

Alberto Lledo, Alcaraz's PT, is another core member of his team, having worked with him for the last five years. “He has never said to me 'Why? Why do I have to do this job?' He has never said no to something, and that is very important for the process and the work. Carlos is a very good athlete. He is not only a good tennis player, but he is also a very good athlete,"" Lledo said.

Aryna Sabalenka is expanding on her perspective following a tense moment Thursday in her women's semifinals loss to Amanda Anisimova at Wimbledon.

When meeting with reporters after the three-set loss, the world's top female player was asked about a game in the third set, in which a forehand from the New Jersey native hit the top of the net to fall over, prompting Sabalenka to reply, “You don't want to say sorry?” during a tense changeover.

“I just look at her and I just, for sure, she didn't hear me, but I was just like, ‘You don't want to say sorry?' but she just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match. It's on her,” said Sabalenka, who lost 4-6, 6-4, 4-6.

“If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying, ‘Sorry for that tricky situation,' that's on her.”

Players may apologize to an opponent if a ball goes over the net on a lucky break by raising a hand.

The lack of an apology appeared to irritate Sabalenka, 27, who also took exception to what she viewed as a premature celebration from Anisimova, 23.

“I was just trying to chase the ball,” the Belarusian star said, according to The Tennis Letter. “She was already celebrating it. I was like ‘I mean, that's a bit too early.' She kind of pissed me off like saying, ‘That's what she does all the time.'

“But I was grateful and thankful that she said that because I was like, it actually helped me to keep fighting. I was like OK, now I'm gonna show you the tennis. I came back because I got really angry in that moment. Probably in the third set I should've remembered and probably it would've helped. But it is what it is.”

Anisimova, who later clarified she wasn't celebrating, is now set to face Poland's Iga Swiatek in the ladies' singles final Saturday.

“This doesn't feel real right now, honestly,” the American said post-match. “I was absolutely dying out there. I don't know how I pulled it out.”

The daughter of Russian immigrants, Anisimova took a break from tennis in 2023 amid mental health concerns and was ranked No. 189 last year.

She reached the fourth round at the French Open earlier this summer, falling to Sabalenka in two sets.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, reached the final at Roland Garros before losing to American Coco Gauff.

Tennis

Friday's Wimbledon semifinal between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz saw two stoppages in the eighth game of the second set, due to spectators feeling unwell on Centre Court.

American men's No. 1 Fritz, at the time a set down, took a 0-15 lead at 4-3 in the second set when play was briefly halted. Chair umpire Marijana Veljovic called a brief stoppage as stewards tended to an unwell spectator, shielding them with umbrellas. A bottle of water was also delivered into the crowd.

Three points later at 30-30, the players were forced to stop again, as another incident saw a spectator receive medical attention. Both instances took place to Fritz's left, with supporters sitting in a stand unshaded against the sun. Veljovic joined several officials in a discussion courtside, including tournament referee Denise Parnell, before restarting to play.

Fritz went on to force an immediate break point, but Alcaraz saved it, and sealed the hold to continue a tightly contested second set which Fritz eventually won 7-5.

Temperatures at the All England Club ranged from 28 to 30 degrees Celsius during the semifinal, with this year's tournament taking place amid two British heatwaves.

There have been several incidents of play being stopped at this year's event. Both women's semifinals were interrupted Thursday — twice during Aryna Sabalenka's match against Amanda Anisimova — as stewards tended to the affected spectators. Sabalenka passed a bottle of water and an ice pack into the crowd.

Alcaraz similarly offered a water bottle to a spectator during his first-round match against Fabio Fognini, while Fritz saw his third-round match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina paused several times due to similar issues in the stands.

Wimbledon recorded its hottest-ever opening day in the history of the championships with the early days of the competition seeing temperatures of up to 32 degrees Celsius, just shy of 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

He's turned back time for years but it's caught up with him today. 

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 4-3 Djokovic

Laura RobsonFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live

Maybe it's the toughest challenge - to stay healthy against the very best these days.

It came unstuck [for Djokovic] at the Australian Open for the same reason. Physically, it gets that much tougher to hold up.

Djokovic probably would still be alright against 99% of the draw but you're playing Sinner, who has such intensity with his ball-striking and the pace and weight of shot that you're up against time and again. If you're not physically perfect, that's going to take a toll.

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 4-3 Djokovic

Is a spot in the final now in sight for Jannik Sinner?

After reviving his level in this third set, the mistakes are back on the racquet of Novak Djokovic now.

Into the net his shot goes at 15-40 and it is a break for world number one Sinner.

Sinner 6-3 6-3 3-3 Djokovic*

A break is not a break until you consolidate it and Jannik Sinner does that with relative ease as he holds to 15.

The Italian seems to have found his serve again after it seemed to disappear for the first 10 minutes of this set.

We are back level at 3-3.

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 2-3 Djokovic

John McEnroeThree-time Wimbledon singles champion

Djokovic is obviously frustrated. He was so close to getting the double break. Things were starting to click but then all of a sudden he throws in a lemon on his serve. Back to the drawing board. 

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 2-3 Djokovic

There was a lot of frustrated shouts in Serbian to his box from Novak Djokovic at that change of ends.

Jannik Sinner the picture of cool in contrast.

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 2-3 Djokovic

Wow.

How quickly things can turn in tennis.

From having points to go up a double break, Novak Djokovic plays one of his worst games in a while as he hands the break back to Jannik Sinner.

We are back on serve in this third set.

Sinner 6-3 6-3 1-3 Djokovic*

John McEnroeThree-time Wimbledon singles champion

He's been wanting love for a long time out there but he's getting it now. 

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 1-3 Djokovic

A bit of slipping and sliding from Jannik Sinner as he chases down a shot from Novak Djokovic.

A mistimed overhead into the net is not what Djokovic needs just as he thought the momentum was on his side.

Another shot into the net and it is two break-back points for the top seed.

Sinner 6-3 6-3 1-3 Djokovic*

Well held, Jannik Sinner.

The Italian keeps his cool among the chants of ""Nole"" from the crowd and gets a much-needed hold of serve.

Still the one break in it.

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic

John McEnroeThree-time Wimbledon singles

The momentum has been taken and completely flipped upside down. 

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic

Greg RusedskiFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live

Sinner has dropped his level, a few unforced errors, and all of a sudden Novak has got the crowd into it. He's got to ride this wave at the moment.

Getting the early break in the third set was so crucial. Can he keep this momentum and will Sinner get back to the tennis he was playing in the first two sets?

Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic*

That will settle Jannik Sinner a bit.

He sends down the serves he has been searching for and saves the break point.

Deuce it is.

Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic*

Where has this Novak Djokovic been?

Having been the one giving the masterclass, the tables have turned on Jannik Sinner.

The Italian has lost his first serve a little in this set and Djokovic is the one dominating the court.

Double break point for Djokovic...

Jess AndersonBBC Sport at Wimbledon

Sorry but isn't this just the best thing about tennis?

Two sets down and looking completely out of it but Novak Djokovic could genuinely win this match from here.

French Open flashbacks for the top seed?

*Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic

John McEnroeThree-time Wimbledon singles champion

It's very surprising that a 30-0 up he played that game as poor as he did. It just shows you that in a best of five it's inevitable there will be ebb and flows. He just allowed this great champion to get into this match. To get some belief. To get some energy. 

Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-3 Djokovic*

The crowd are very much on Novak Djokovic's side now.

They want to see a match here on Centre Court and it looks like they could still get one as the former champion holds to 15 and consolidates the break.

Suddenly the pressure is all on Jannik Sinner in this third set.

Jess AndersonBBC Sport at Wimbledon

Novak Djokovic has looked basically down and out for much of this.

But this crowd are firmly on his side and sometimes that's all he needs to gather a bit of momentum and perhaps shake the top seed up a bit.

You never know.

Sinner 6-3 6-3 0-2 Djokovic*

Laura RobsonFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds

It was almost like Sinner broke himself.

It's the first time of some positive energy from Novak. Such a loose game from Sinner but the crowd and Djokovic are now into this.

Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner have both had injury scares during the second week at Wimbledon

Wimbledon 2025

Venue: All England Club Dates: 30 June-13 July 

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

The prospect of watching 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic take on world number one Jannik Sinner for a place in the Wimbledon final is a mouth-watering one, but fitness concerns remain before Friday's match.

Djokovic, 38, fell awkwardly late on in his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli, but picked himself up to wrap up victory and progress.

Sinner, meanwhile, hurt his right elbow after slipping in the first game of his fourth-round tie with Grigor Dimitrov on Monday.

The Italian ultimately progressed after his opponent retired through injury, but he had heavy strapping on his elbow in his quarter-final win over Ben Shelton.

Sinner said he would be ""100% fit"" to face Djokovic, but the Serb has not been quite so definitive and cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday.

Sinner cancelled a scheduled session on Tuesday, heading indoors for some light hitting while he awaited the results of a scan.

Djokovic may have done likewise - but it does still cast some doubt over his fitness.

Djokovic reached the semi-finals of this year's Australian Open but had to retire after the first set against Alexander Zverev, having injured his leg in the previous round.

Given his age, Djokovic accepts he has to work harder than 23-year-old Sinner or 22-year-old Wimbledon defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to keep up with them physically.

""Sometimes I get tired of all the chores I have to do on a daily basis to get my body ready to be able to perform,"" he said.

""It's a lot of hours spent off the court, in the gym or on the table just trying to work with what I have.

""Physically, I hope that I'll be able to sustain that.""

Sinner, who is bidding to reach his first Wimbledon final, did take part in his scheduled practice session on Thursday but seemed in no discomfort as he laughed and joked with his team.

Alcaraz will face Taylor Fritz in the first men's semi-final on Friday - but the American too had to take a medical timeout in his quarter-final win over Karen Khachanov.

Fifth seed Fritz had treatment on his feet - and concerns were heightened by the fact he had just lost the third set 6-1 after controlling the first two.

But Fritz, through to the last four at SW19 for the first time, allayed those fears after his victory, saying he just needed taping on his foot redone.

""It's pretty common - a lot of players do this tape job so your foot doesn't get irritated,"" he said.

""I think I ripped it off at some point in the second so I just needed to get it redone.""

The only person who got through the quarter-finals without a hint of an injury was world number two Alcaraz.

A fully-fit Alcaraz is certainly a concern for his rivals as he bids for a third Wimbledon title in a row.

 Grigor Dimitrov's Wimbledon exit due to injury was one of the most heartbreaking scenes on a tennis court in recent memory, but the Bulgarian's path to recovery has already begun. 

 Dimitrov, who was forced to retire due to a pectoral muscle injury sustained when he led Jannik Sinner by two sets to love in the fourth round at the grass major, sent a defiant message to fans via social media on Friday. 

A post shared by Grigor Dimitrov (@grigordimitrov)

 “Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,” wrote Dimitrov in a post on Instagram, which included a photo of himself in a hospital bed. “Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career. 

 “Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon. G.”

Grigor Dimitrov looked on course for a huge Wimbledon upset when he suffered a heartbreaking injury on Centre Court.

When Dimitrov and Jannik Sinner took to Centre Court for their fourth-round match at Wimbledon, many predicted a routine win for the world number one.

The Bulgarian had other ideas, storming into a two-set lead, leaving the Italian on the brink of a shock Wimbledon exit.

However, when holding serve at 2-2 in the third set, disaster struck, as Dimitrov injured his pectoral muscle, forcing him to retire from the match.

Set for a spell on the sidelines, the 34-year-old faces a race against time, with the US Open just six weeks away.

A former Grand Slam doubles champion has now shared whether he believes Dimitrov will be fit to compete in New York.

Appearing as a guest on the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', 2005 Wimbledon doubles champion Stephen Huss gave his verdict on Dimitrov's injury.

“I'd be shocked if he's back for the US Open. US Open is only six weeks away, I'd be shocked if he's back for that,” he said.

“That's awful, 34 years old, he's an amazing tennis player.

“I don't know how many times you can come back from injuries. He's certainly done it a few times, but to have to retire from five Slams in a row, I've never heard of that. 

“That's horrible.”

Dimitrov has now retired from five consecutive Grand Slam events, a horrific streak that is scarcely believable.

On two occasions, at the French Open and Wimbledon this year, Dimitrov was leading when forced to retire, as injuries continue to scupper his chances at Grand Slam glory.

According to reports from TennisKafe, Dimitrov suffered a partial tear of his pectoralis major muscle against Sinner.

The recovery time for such an injury varies from several weeks to months, giving him a chance to return in time for the US Open.

With the tournament 44 days away, there's still a good chance we will see the Bulgarian veteran entertain fans in New York later this year.

Dimitrov hasn't missed a US Open tournament since he made his debut at Flushing Meadows in 2011.

Winning 60% of his matches at the event, Dimitrov has passed the fourth round on two occasions, reaching the quarterfinals in 2024 and the semifinals in 2019.

His run in 2019 was particularly impressive, as he eased into the quarterfinals, where he secured one of the biggest wins of his career.

Standing between Dimitrov and a maiden US Open semifinal was five-time champion Roger Federer, who had won their previous six meetings.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the Swiss star who took the early lead, winning the first set 6-3 on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Not prepared to give up without a fight, the Bulgarian leveled the tie at one set apiece, clinching the second, 6-4.

Sharing the next two sets, Dimitrov and Federer's quarterfinal tie required a decider, as both players gave it their all with a place in the semis up for grabs.

Taking his game to another level, Dimitrov won the fifth set 6-2, advancing to the last four, securing his sole career win over the 20-time Grand Slam champion.

It was there that his run would come to an end, however, as Dimitrov fell in straight sets to Russia's Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals.

He has yet to return to the semis, but came close in 2024, retiring injured down two sets to one against Frances Tiafoe in the quarterfinals.

Dimitrov will no doubt hope to be back fit for this year's tournament, where he can try to make another deep run in New York.

At Wimbledon on Thursday, Amanda Anisimova took another heartwarming step in her ongoing journey back after a mental health break.

The American star upstaged world No.1 and tournament favourite Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling three-set semifinal on Centre Court, sealing a place in her first Grand Slam final.

This time last year, Anisimova was competing in Wimbledon qualifying while ranked 189th and failed to make the main draw.

Twelve months on, she's assured of a top-10 debut and will compete against Iga Swiatek for the biggest title of her career.

“I feel amazing. I mean, it's so exciting to be in the final here,” Anisimova said. “And yeah, I think I still can't believe it in a way.

“When I came here, I said that it was a super special feeling to be seeded here after losing in the qualies last year. Despite however I was going to do here, just being able to be in the top again at a career-high [ranking of No.12] just meant a lot to me.

“The rest I just told myself I'm going to compete and enjoy every moment out there.”

Her obvious joy being on court, and satisfaction with her increasing success, contrasts sharply with her headspace two years ago.



Anisimova announced in May 2023 she would take an indefinite break from tennis to address her mental health and counter burnout, saying it had “become unbearable being at tennis tournaments”.

Painting and listening to music were among the many outlets Anisimova explored as she reframed her approach to her daily life – routines which have continued into her comeback.

She returned to competition in January 2024 and, ranked outside the top 400, made a run to the fourth round of the Australian Open, where Sabalenka stopped her.

She ended 2024 inside the top 40 and has been brilliant in 2025, winning the WTA 1000 title in Doha and reaching the final at Queen's Club. She also reached the fourth round at Roland Garros, where Sabalenka again stopped her.

Having lost her first four matches to the clean-hitting Anisimova – including at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2019 – Sabalenka was starting to control the rivalry, winning three of their past four encounters.

Entering their Wimbledon semifinal, the biggest of their nine career meetings, Sabalenka and Anisimova were locked at two wins apiece on the Grand Slam stage.

This was Anisimova's second major semifinal, six years on from Roland Garros where, as a 17-year-old phenom, she lost to eventual champion Ash Barty from a set and 3-0 ahead.

This time around, with significantly more tennis and life experience behind her, she competed with a different outlook.

“To be honest, if you told me I would be in the final of Wimbledon, I would not believe you,” the 23-year-old said on court following her 6-4 4-6 6-4 triumph.

“At least not this soon, because it's been a year turnaround since coming back, and to be in this spot, I mean it's not easy.

“So many people dream of competing on this incredible court. It's been such a privilege to compete here, and to be in the final is just indescribable, honestly.”

It has been a brilliant fortnight for Anisimova, who opened her Wimbledon campaign with a 6-0 6-0 win over Yulia Putintseva.

Since then she has navigated her way through a tough succession of matches, including back-to-back three-set wins over Dalma Galfi and Linda Noskova to reach the quarterfinals.

There, buoyed by the presence of her family, she survived a second-set fightback from Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to record her best Wimbledon result, setting up her semifinal with Sabalenka.

“I think that's a really special message that I think I've been able to show,” Anisimova said, “because when I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game.

“That was a little hard to digest because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a Grand Slam one day.

“Just me being able to prove that you can get back to the top if you prioritise yourself… that's been incredibly special to me.”

Anisimova is kinder to herself these days. She allows herself time off whenever a Grand Slam campaign comes to an end, tuning out from anything to do with tennis and instead choosing to spend her time with friends or family.

But her focus is not entirely self-directed.

Shining through in her comments during Wimbledon is the gratitude she has felt for sharing the court with icons of the game, like three-time major champion Sabalenka and now Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam winner also targeting her first Wimbledon title.

“I always tell myself ahead of the game to enjoy every moment, not really concentrate on the finish line or the outcome, and just to really stay in the present,” Anisimova said.

“Even today, I mean, I was forgetting there was a final on the line because I had Aryna across from me. I was just so focused on that.

“Iga is such an unbelievable player. She's also been an inspiration to me. Her work ethic and all of her achievements have been really inspiring. I'm sure it will be an amazing match again.

“Getting to compete against an unbelievable player again is going to be super special. Hopefully I can bring some high-quality tennis and make it a battle out there.

“I'm just going to go out and enjoy every moment and try to not think about what's on the line.”

...

Novak Djokovic puts his  bid for Grand Slam history on the line at Wimbledon on Friday when he faces world number one Jannik Sinner in a blockbuster semi-final, while defending champion Carlos Alcaraz meets Taylor Fritz.

As a seven-time Wimbledon champion, Djokovic believes his best chance to win a record 25th Grand Slam title lies on the lawns of southwest London.

Now the 38-year-old Serb faces the defining test of that theory.

Djokovic is looking to reach an 11th Wimbledon final and his 38th Grand Slam showpiece, yet he finds himself in the unusual position of being an All England Club underdog.

Although Djokovic beat Sinner in the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2023 and in the quarter-finals in 2022, the Italian got his revenge in the 2024 Australian Open and at this year's French Open.

Those semi-final victories helped Sinner build a 5-4 edge in his nine encounters with Djokovic, who has lost the past four meetings.

""Sinner and Alcaraz are the leaders of tennis today. I couldn't ask for a bigger challenge, for sure. I look forward to it,"" Djokovic said.

Sinner shrugged off fears over an elbow injury to brush aside Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals, while Djokovic hopes to be fully fit after an awkward fall late in his last-eight victory over Flavio Cobolli.

Beaten by Alcaraz in the past two Wimbledon finals, Djokovic has not won a Grand Slam since moving level with Margaret Court on 24 major titles by clinching the 2023 US Open.

Sinner and Alcaraz are the dominant forces in men's tennis now, but sixth seed Djokovic will be contesting a record 14th Wimbledon men's semi-final, with 10 wins from his previous 13 matches at that stage.

Djokovic has made every Wimbledon final since 2018 and his last semi-final loss at the tournament came against Roger Federer in 2012.

The Serb can equal Federer's Open era record for the most consecutive Wimbledon men's finals if he makes it to the final on Sunday for a seventh time in a row.

- Alcaraz eyes third final -

In his seventh Grand Slam semi-final, a victory for Australian Open champion Sinner would send him through to his first Wimbledon final.

The 23-year-old, a three-time major winner, can become the sixth man in the Open era to make four consecutive Grand Slam final appearances.

The last of those finals ended in a five-set defeat in which he blew three championship points against Alcaraz in the French Open in June, a painful memory fuelling his Wimbledon title charge.

""Me and Novak, we know each other better because we played quite a lot. So we understand what's working and what's not,"" Sinner said.

Back to his best after an inconsistent start to the tournament, Alcaraz must subdue the power game of American fifth seed Fritz to reach his third successive Wimbledon final.

Alcaraz, 22, was taken to five sets by the since retired Fabio Fognini in the first round and also dropped a set against both Jan-Lennard Struff and Andrey Rublev to raise concerns about his title defence.

But the five-time Grand Slam champion eased fears about a dip in form with a dynamic demolition of Britain's Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals.

The Spanish world number two is on a career-best 23-match winning streak since losing to Holger Rune in the Barcelona final in April and has won 34 of his 37 matches on grass.

""Taylor is playing great. The grass season has been really successful for him so far. I have to be ready for that battle,"" Alcaraz said.

If Fritz can pull off a major upset, he will reach his second Grand Slam final, in the process becoming the first American man to make the Wimbledon final since Andy Roddick in 2009.

The 27-year-old made his first appearance in a Grand Slam final at the US Open last year, losing to Jannik Sinner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz ends Fritz bid, reaches third consecutive Wimbledon final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-fritz-wimbledon-2025-friday","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:32:34 GMT","

Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his third consecutive Wimbledon final on Friday, when he overcame American Taylor Fritz 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6).

Competing on a sunbaked Centre Court, Alcaraz won 88 per cent of his first-serve points but was pushed at times during the two-hour, 48-minute clash. The Spaniard suffered a brief lapse in level at the closing stages of the second set but bounced back impressively in the third, outlasting the fifth seed with his baseline power and consistency.

He then saved two set points at 4/6 in the fourth-set tie-break, reeling off four consecutive points to move to within one victory of becoming just the fifth player to clinch three consecutive Wimbledon crowns.

""It was a really difficult match as always when I have to play against Taylor. Even tougher with the conditions, it was really hot today,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just really happy with everything that I've done today. I dealt with the nerves, playing here in a semi-final is not easy. I'm really proud with the way I stayed calm and thought clearly. I'm pleased about my level today.""

Currently riding a career-best 24-match winning streak, Alcaraz is also bidding to join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to complete the Roland Garros–Wimbledon double in consecutive years. Borg achieved the feat from 1978 to 1980.

""I'm not thinking about the winning streak or the results at all. This is my dream, stepping on these beautiful courts and playing tennis in the most beautiful tournaments in the world,"" Alcaraz added. ""That's all I try to think at every tournament and why I try to bring the joy to the courts.""

Standing in Alcaraz's path to a sixth Grand Slam title runs through either World No. 1 Jannik Sinner or seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic. Just last month, Alcaraz saved three championship points to defeat Sinner in a marathon five-hour, 29-minute Roland Garros final, improving his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against the Italian to 8-4. Against Djokovic, whom he has beaten in the past two Wimbledon finals, Alcaraz trails 3-5.



Fritz came through two five setters en route to his second major semi-final and was seeking to become the first American man to reach the Wimbledon final since Andy Roddick in 2009. The 27-year-old won 80 per cent of his first-serve points against Alcaraz but struggled to make inroads on the second seed's delivery. The Spaniard dictated play from the baseline, mixed in deft drop shots, and used his heavy second serve to keep Fritz off balance throughout.

The American looked set to force a fifth set when he led 6/4 in the tie-break but as is often the case, Alcaraz increased his level when it mattered most. The Spaniard saved the first set point by feathering a forehand volley into the forecourt and the second when Fritz struck a forehand long. The Spaniard, who sealed victory on his first match point, leads Fritz 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with this their first meeting on grass.

While Alcaraz cannot overtake Sinner for World No. 1 after Wimbledon, he is now 2,660 points ahead of the Italian atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which indicates who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.

After a shaky five-set win against Fabio Fognini in the opening round, Alcaraz has steadily found his rhythm in London, where he eliminated Andrey Rublev in the fourth round and dispatched British lefty Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals.

Leonardo DiCaprio, Rami Malek, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Ford and Anna Wintour were among the spectators watching Alcaraz improve to 48-5 on the year. The 22-year-old has won a Tour-leading five titles in 2025 – Roland Garros, Rome, Monte-Carlo, Rotterdam, and The Queen's Club.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","A new Wimbledon champion awaits: But will it be Swiatek or Anisimova?","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4308159/a-new-wimbledon-champion-awaits-but-will-it-be-swiatek-or-anisimova","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:54:57 GMT","

The grass season is short and sweet -- and therefore extremely volatile. But that doesn't begin to explain this highly unlikely pairing in Saturday's Wimbledon final that will produce a first-time champion at the All England Club.

Amanda Anisimova, the No. 13 seed, was well outside the Top 400 early last year and wound up losing in the last round of qualifying at Wimbledon. And now a few days from her first visit to the PIF WTA Rankings Top 10, she's into the first Grand Slam final of her career.

No. 8 Iga Swiatek hasn't won a tournament since collecting her fourth Roland Garros title last spring. After losing in the Paris semifinals, she's had the best grass-court season of her life, winning nine of 10 matches, the last one a forceful 6-2, 6-0 performance against Belinda Bencic.

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draws

Earlier Thursday, Anisimova defeated No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a match that ran more than two-and-a-half hours.

The early rounds of Grand Slams are littered with first-time matchups, but this is only the third Wimbledon final of the Open Era featuring two players who have never met at the Hologic WTA Tour -- which makes this one so intriguing.

Who's going to take the crown this year? We make the case for both players:

With all the exciting new players coming into the game, the 24-year-old Swiatek doesn't produce a lot of “the youngest since …” statistics.

But here are a few significant precedents to consider. Swiatek, at 24 years and 30 days, is the youngest woman to reach:

“Tennis keeps surprising me,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “Honestly, I never even dreamed it would be possible to play in the final.”

One theory going around makes sense. Because she was so absorbed in winning those four titles in five years at Roland Garros (and all the commitments that entails), she came into the grass-court season understandably depleted. This year she took a few weeks off, practiced in Mallorca and came into Wimbledon fresh and eager.

“Honestly, I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practice,” Swiatek said. “If I win Roland Garros and then I come here and everybody ask me already about ... They put, like, super high expectations.”

Her fabulous forehand and footwork play well on grass and, at the urging of coach Wim Fissette, Swiatek is being more aggressive with her serve and, rather than settling in to defend long points, looking to end them after two or three shots. This fortnight, it's been a deadly combination.

See you Saturday @iga_swiatek 👏#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/tkl5O9PkUF

Swiatek has won 78 percent of her first-serve points, the best mark of any player that got past the first round. Throwing in a bagel to complete a semifinal is audacious stuff, and it's a window to the confidence she's feeling right now.

With a significant edge in her ability to cover the court, Swiatek will lean into that aggressive mindset against Anisimova.

And there's this: Swiatek has won all five of the major finals she's played. A sixth would mark her 100th match-win in Grand Slams, a fitting milestone on the surface she wondered if she'd ever conquer.

In the quarterfinals, Anisimova won 11 of the first 14 games against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and found herself a game away from a career-defining victory when the nerves rushed in. Eventually, though, she won the tiebreak, 11-9.

A similar scenario was in play in the semifinals, when Anisimova had a break-point opportunity for a 5-1 lead in the third before Sabalenka got it back on serve at 4-5. With a screaming forehand winner, Anisimova converted her fourth match point.

""It's been such a privilege to compete here."" 🤗@AnisimovaAmanda | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/CmVTPOfMmw

“In the third set I knew that I was going to really have to go for it,” Anisimova told reporters. “Her level just kept increasing and getting better and better throughout the match. So to be able to come on top, I really had to bring my game and do as much as I could.

Sabalenka couldn't disagree.

“I have to say that she was more brave today,” she said. “Maybe when I was just, like, trying to stay in the point, she was going for all -- she was playing more aggressive.”

Confidence? In the biggest match of her career, Anisimova defeated the World No. 1 for the sixth time in nine matches.

To beat Swiatek, she'll need to start fast. In 2025, Anisimova has won 28 straight matches when she takes the first set. She passed the ultimate test against Sabalenka, who had come back to win 11 of 13 matches this year when she dropped the first set.

""The moment of this young woman's life"" 👏Amanda Anisimova completes an extraordinary semi-final to defeat No.1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 and book her spot in her first ever #Wimbledon final 💥Take. A. Bow. ♥️ pic.twitter.com/WexH4VL2k2

Anisimova's backhand is her biggest strength, but on Thursday she took good care of her second serve, winning 24 of those 40 points -- the biggest statistical disparity in the match. She also saved an impressive 11 of 14 break points.

It's been quite a journey for Anisimova, who walked away from tennis halfway through the 2023 season. She reached the French Open semifinals as a 17-year-old and eventually struggled with the pressures of expectation.

“When I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game,” Anisimova said. “That was a little hard to digest because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a Grand Slam one day.”

Anisimova scored her first Top 10 win in a Grand Slam, beating Simona Halep in Paris. Six years later, she notched her second against Sabalenka.

She's playing with the joy and fearlessness of that long-ago 17-year-old, who now knows what she didn't know before.

Sergio Perez left the Formula 1 grid after parting ways with Red Bull at the end of 2024, but the Mexican has been in contact with several teams – including Cadillac – about a return.

Sergio Perez was born with natural speed and still has what it takes to deliver in Formula 1, according to his former Red Bull Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley.

Perez and Red Bull agreed to part ways at the end of last season, having spent four campaigns together, with the Mexican taking some time out to assess his options before deciding he wanted a return to F1 if he could find the right project.

The 35-year-old has been in contact with several teams, including newcomers Cadillac – who are making their F1 debut next season – and Alpine.

Cadillac, who are led by Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, are evaluating their drivers for next season, with the American outfit believed to be edging towards taking experience.

Perez has that in bucketfuls and is one of the favourites for a seat – along with Valtteri Bottas – with the Mexican having scored six wins, 39 points and a runner-up spot in the Drivers' Standings in 2023.

When asked about what he made of Perez's ambitions to return to the sport next season, Wheatley told F1.com: ""Firstly, I really enjoyed working with Checo. He's a great personality, great attitude to life, full stop.

""I have no doubt about his pace and his speed. It's been natural since the beginning.

""He put in some tremendous drives at my former team and I don't think it's much of a barrier that he's had a bit of time off between driving a Formula 1 car because when you know how to do that, you know how to do it.""

Perez left Red Bull despite having two years still left on his contract following a difficult season where he was comfortably outperformed by team mate and reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

Since his departure, Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda have struggled to get performance out of the car in that seat – which have gone some way to putting Perez's struggles in 2024 into context.

Wheatley spoke highly of former Sauber and Force India racer Perez's ability to galvanise a team, highlighting how he pushed people inside the squad, including Wheatley, to be better during their time at Red Bull.

""I spent a lot of time with him early on because I wanted to get to know him and I wanted him to adjust to the team,"" added Wheatley. ""What I really liked was he pushed me in my sporting role – pushed me very, very hard.

""He made me question whether I was putting every bit of effort in, not that he was criticising but he would challenge you in a positive way and I enjoyed it.

""I think it helped motivate me to become better at my job and I'd like to think maybe it was reciprocal and the work that we did together made him better at his.""

He added: ""He's fully focused on performance and what do you want from a driver?""

Cadillac are continuing to evaluate their options for their two race seats in 2026, with sources suggesting they have shrunk their shortlist down to just a handful. Talks with relevant parties will continue in the coming weeks.

Nico Hulkenberg claimed a long-awaited debut F1 podium at the British Grand Prix – but the Kick Sauber driver is not the only one to have faced a long wait for a top-three result...

For many years, Nico Hulkenberg had carried the unwanted F1 record of holding the most race starts without a podium finish – but the German driver finally ridded himself of that statistic by taking P3 in the British Grand Prix. He was not alone in having to bide his time for his first rostrum, however, with the names below facing the longest waits in F1 history for that elusive top-three result…

Felipe Massa arrived into F1 with Sauber in 2002, the young Brazilian bringing with him plenty of promise. But after being dropped at the end of the campaign, Massa spent a year as a test driver for Ferrari before returning to the grid with Sauber one year later.

Gaining experience with the Scuderia seemed to pay off for the man from Sao Paulo, who did enough in 2004 and 2005 to earn himself a spot on the Ferrari race team as Michael Schumacher's team mate in 2006.

With his best finish at this point being a P4, Massa finally took the next step by achieving his debut podium at the European Grand Prix on his 57th race start, claiming third place behind Schumacher and Renault's Fernando Alonso.

It would prove to be the first of 41 rostrums for Massa during his F1 career, in which he also went on to achieve 11 wins and 16 pole positions.

While he is perhaps one of the lesser-known drivers in this list, Gianni Morbidelli amassed a total of 67 Grands Prix starts across six different seasons in the sport, racing for teams including Minardi and Sauber.

But it was not until race number 60 – by which point he was driving for the Footwork outfit – that Morbidelli stood on the podium, when Adelaide hosted the Australian Grand Prix for a final time to close out the 1995 campaign.

Morbidelli lined up in P13 on a grid of 23 cars, while the Williams of Damon Hill started from pole position. It soon proved to be a race of attrition, as all of the cars near the front of the pack – with the exception of Hill – retired from the Grand Prix.

This gave Morbidelli – whose best result prior to this had been a P5 – an opportunity for a strong result and it was one that the Italian seized, crossing the line in third to clinch what would be his sole rostrum appearance on an afternoon where only eight drivers were classified.

The first of three current drivers to make an appearance on this countdown, Esteban Ocon made his F1 debut at the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix with the Manor team. Two seasons at Force India followed, in which his best finish was a P5.

After being replaced at the team by Lance Stroll in 2019, Ocon spent a year as a Mercedes reserve driver before returning to the grid with Renault in 2020. It proved to be a season of mixed fortunes for the Frenchman – but better was to come at the penultimate round in Sakhir.

In an action-packed race, Ocon worked his way up from P11 on the grid to take second place, marking an emotional maiden podium on his 66th F1 start. The rostrum was one of firsts, with Sergio Perez claiming his debut victory for Racing Point.

Since then, Ocon has finished within the top trio on a further three occasions, one of these being his first-ever win at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix.

Johnny Herbert enjoyed an extensive F1 career, taking part in 161 Grands Prix from his debut in the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix through to his final appearance at the 2000 season finale in Malaysia.

While he ended his first race in P4 at the wheel of a Benetton, the Briton did not manage to match this in the years that followed whilst driving for the likes of Tyrrell, Lotus and Ligier – but a return to Benetton at the end of 1994 hinted at better prospects.

At the fourth Grand Prix of the campaign in Spain – and on his 67th race start – Herbert stood on the podium for the first time thanks to a P2 finish, with World Champion team mate Michael Schumacher leading a 1-2 result for the squad.

Four races later, Herbert followed this up with his maiden victory at the British Grand Prix. He went on to achieve five more rostrums in his F1 career, the final one being his memorable victory for Stewart Grand Prix at the 1999 European Grand Prix.

Tied with Herbert on a wait of 67 starts before scoring a podium is Pedro de la Rosa, with the Spaniard's opportunity not arriving until a surprise return to the grid.

After making his debut for Arrows in 1999, De la Rosa completed two seasons with the team before spending the next two years at Jaguar. He then became a test driver for McLaren in 2003, and was later called upon to replace an injured Juan Pablo Montoya at the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix, in which he equalled his best result of P5.

When Montoya left the squad midway through 2006, De la Rosa again stepped up to fill the Columbian's seat – and on his third appearance of that season in Hungary, the Spanish driver finished P2 in what would prove to be the only podium of his F1 career.

De la Rosa was joined on the rostrum by Honda's Jenson Button, who had just clinched his debut win. Speaking of whom…

That aforementioned victory in Budapest came on Button's 113th race start – and while his wait for a podium was not quite as long, the Briton still had to hold out until his 68th Grand Prix to reach the top three.

While he impressed during his debut season with Williams in 2000, a subsequent two-year spell with Benetton/Renault proved more challenging. After being released at the end of 2002, Button moved to BAR Honda.

Things were improving in 2003, but it was in 2004 that it all came together for Button. Just two races in, the Briton achieved his debut rostrum with a P3 result in Malaysia – and he went on to rack up a further nine podiums during that year, putting him in a then career-best third in the championship.

That was just the beginning for Button, who amassed a total of 50 podiums, 15 wins and not to mention the 2009 World Championship across a career spanning 306 race starts.

Nico Hulkenberg (more on whom later) garnered a reputation for being a ‘super sub' when he stepped in for unwell drivers between 2020 and 2022 – but more than 20 years earlier, that title arguably could also have been given to Mika Salo.

Salo had made 68 race starts for teams including Lotus, Tyrrell and Arrows between 1994 and 1998 when he found himself without a full-time drive for the 1999 season. He was called upon to replace an injured Ricardo Zonta at BAR Honda for three races – before then substituting for Michael Schumacher at Ferrari across six Grands Prix after the German broke his leg.

It proved to be an inspired decision, with Salo leading the race in only his second outing for the squad at Hockenheim. The Finn ultimately moved aside to let team mate Eddie Irvine through as part of the latter's championship bid – but Salo still took P2, marking his first podium on his 73rd start.

He returned to the rostrum with a P3 finish at Monza in his penultimate appearance for the Scuderia. Stints with Sauber and Toyota followed in 2000 and 2002 respectively, but Salo did not reach the podium again.

Better known these days as a pundit and commentator, Martin Brundle made 158 starts during his career as a Formula 1 driver, competing for teams including Tyrrell, McLaren and Jordan between 1984 and 1996.

The Briton technically first stood on the podium during his debut season, crossing the line in second place for Tyrrell in Detroit – but with the team later being disqualified from that year's championship for a technical infringement, the result no longer stood.

This meant that Brundle's wait for a rostrum went on – and it was not until the 1992 French Grand Prix, with Brundle now racing for Benetton on his 91st start, that it finally came to an end, the British driver turning P7 on the grid into a P3 finish.

It was the first of a total of nine rostrums for Brundle, five of which were achieved with Benetton in that 1992 campaign before he scored two apiece with Ligier and McLaren.

Paired with fellow rookie Max Verstappen for his debut season at Toro Rosso in 2015, Carlos Sainz had to watch on as his team mate received promotion to the main Red Bull outfit five races into 2016, the Dutchman promptly winning in Spain on only his 24th race start.

For Sainz, patience was a virtue when it came to reaching the rostrum himself. After impressing at Toro Rosso and Renault, the Spaniard joined McLaren in 2019 as part of an all-new line-up alongside Lando Norris.

Sainz came into his own during his time with the Woking-based outfit, something that he demonstrated at the penultimate race in Brazil by climbing from P20 on the grid to P4 at the line.

And when Lewis Hamilton – who had initially finished in third – was hit with a five-second time penalty for a collision with Alex Albon post-race, Sainz was promoted one place, handing him his debut top-three result on his 101st start.

As things stand, Sainz has earned a total of 27 podiums, 25 of which were earned during his four-year stint with Ferrari. Can he add to that number during his new era with Williams? Only time will tell…

And now to the man who was quite rightly in celebratory mood at the British Grand Prix after standing on the podium for the first time – following a lengthy wait of 239 Grand Prix starts.

Nico Hulkenberg arrived on the F1 grid back in 2010 with Williams aged 22, a season in which he claimed a surprise pole position in Brazil. But the German had to be patient when it came to following that accolade up with a visit to the rostrum.

Across stints with Force India, Sauber and Renault, Hulkenberg did not manage to better his then career-best race result of P4. After losing his seat at the end of 2019, he then returned for several substitute appearances in place of unwell drivers across 2020 and 2022 – which acted as the perfect reminder of his talents.

Making his comeback for Haas in 2023, Hulkenberg delivered some strong results – but it was not until his switch to Kick Sauber and a dramatic weekend at the 2025 British Grand Prix that the racer from Germany finally broke his podium duck.

Starting from P19 on the grid, the veteran driver showed his experience as he navigated changing conditions to work his way forwards – before ultimately holding off a challenge from Lewis Hamilton to seal P3, bringing Hulkenberg a long-awaited podium on his 239th start.

Nico Hulkenberg achieved a long-awaited debut F1 podium at the British Grand Prix, marking a milestone moment in what has been a fascinating journey through the sport.

Nico Hulkenberg achieved a fairytale result in the British Grand Prix by finally clinching his debut F1 podium, an accolade that had eluded him during his previous 238 race starts. It was perhaps made all the sweeter by the fact that the journey to this milestone has been far from straightforward for the German driver, whose path has been filled with highs and lows since his debut some 15 years ago…

After an impressive rise through the junior ranks – culminating in winning the GP2 title in 2009 – Hulkenberg was promoted to Formula 1 in 2010, making his debut for Williams at the age of 22. Amid mixed fortunes throughout the campaign, the highlight for Hulkenberg came when he grabbed a surprise pole position at the penultimate round in Brazil.

Despite this, the rookie was replaced by Pastor Maldonado in 2011. Left without a seat on the grid, Hulkenberg became a test driver for Force India before making his full-time return with the team in 2012.

After a one-year stint with Sauber in 2013, Hulkenberg rejoined Force India one year later and continued to race for the outfit through to the end of 2016. Throughout it all, his best result was a P4 finish achieved on three occasions.

But the German racer gave motorsport fans an additional reminder of his talent by winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Porsche during a weekend off from F1 in 2015, making him one of a select number of Formula 1 drivers to triumph in the iconic endurance race.

In 2017 Hulkenberg made the switch to Renault, at a time when the Enstone-based squad looked to be on an upward trajectory. The 2018 campaign started to deliver on that promise, with the outfit climbing to fourth in the Teams' Championship while Hulkenberg finished a career-best P7 in the Drivers'.

The 2019 season proved to be a tougher one. A maiden podium looked to potentially be on the cards for Hulkenberg in front of his home fans at the German Grand Prix – the Renault driver having at one stage been running in P2 – but, amid mixed conditions, he crashed out of fourth place, an incident that he admitted was “hard to swallow” at the time.

At the end of the year, Hulkenberg faced his second exit from F1 after being replaced at the team by Esteban Ocon – but, once again, the man from Emmerich am Rhein would find a way back onto the grid…

Whilst on the sidelines in 2020 – during a shortened Formula 1 season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic – Hulkenberg was called upon to replace Sergio Perez at Racing Point for the British Grand Prix due to the Mexican testing positive for the virus.

After a solid Qualifying, Hulkenberg was unable to start the race owing to a technical problem on the car – but one week later at the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, the German driver impressively put the Racing Point machine in third on the grid and then scored points with a P7 finish.

He took home more points after substituting for an unwell Lance Stroll later in the season at the Nurburgring – and, while his services were not required in 2021, there were two more ‘Hulkenback' appearances in 2022, this time to replace a COVID-positive Sebastian Vettel for two races at Aston Martin.

All of this was enough to earn Hulkenberg a third full-time stint in F1 as he signed to Haas for 2023. Partnered with foe-turned-friend Kevin Magnussen, the veteran driver's experience and consistency helped the American outfit to take steps forward, with a P7 in the 2024 Teams' Championship being their strongest finish since 2018.

Hulkenberg's performance at Haas again caught the eye of others in the paddock – including Kick Sauber, who agreed a deal with the German for 2025 ahead of the team's transition into Audi in 2026.

It was not the easiest start to the campaign for the squad – with a long point-less run between Rounds 2 and 8 – but Hulkenberg again displayed his consistency by embarking on a string of top-10 finishes from Round 9 in Spain onwards.

There was joy for the team when both Hulkenberg and rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto scored in Austria – but just one week later at Silverstone, the prospects of achieving this again seemed slim when a tough Qualifying saw Bortoleto start in P16 while Hulkenberg was down in P19.

However, that all changed in dramatic fashion on race day. Amid changing weather conditions, Hulkenberg made his way through the field and managed to fend off a chasing Lewis Hamilton to hold onto P3, finally clinching his first F1 podium on his 239th start.

The 37-year-old has now well and truly ridded himself of that infamous statistic of being the most experienced driver to have never stood on the rostrum – that dubious honour now falling to his fellow German Adrian Sutil, on 128 Grand Prix starts.

Speaking after the race, Hulkenberg summed up his journey to this point as he reflected with a smile on his face: “It's been a long time coming, hasn't it? I always knew we have it in us, and I have it in me somewhere.”

The idea is to explain and expand use of generative AI products in the Los Angeles entertainment industry.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	The AI Hollywood race is intensifying as Luma AI, which is behind one of the more novel of a new wave of video generators, says it's planting a flag in Los Angeles.


	The Northern California company is starting Dream Lab LA, a studio space where it hopes to explain its mission to the entertainment business while recruiting and training filmmakers to use its tools. The news is the latest move from what is becoming an onslaught of companies making AI video models (basically, products that let a person create or change a video without staging a physical shoot) into the filmmaking space.

	“We need even higher levels of intelligence in creative work, and that's what Luma is committed to building,” Amit Jain, the company's CEO, said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.




			Related Video		







	 As part of the announcement Luma has hired Verena Puhm, a producer and writer with BBC and CNN credits, to head up the lab, as well as the L.A.-based filmmaker Jon Finger to work as creative workflow executive.


	The lab will be a kind of combined meeting, co-working and educational venue where creatives can come together to produce content using the Luma tool.


	“It's access, honestly,” Puhm said in an interview. “We want to provide a creative R&D space…to educate the filmmakers and educate the studio partners.” She and Jain said the process will be two-directional, allowing the company to garner intel on the best way to build future tools for Hollywood as well.

	











	The lab, whose location executives said will be announced shortly, aims to open this summer.


	Luma's moves are part of the larger aim of making Hollywood a more automated place, where films created by humans are augmented — or supplanted, according to skeptics  — by machine-created video.


	Like many AI video firms, Luma has informal arrangements with a number of the big Hollywood studios to use its tools. (Much of the results are still in production, but expect a lot more AI to creep up in your favorite movies and TV shows in the coming year.)


	The company's model also mixes in a consumer component; it has a monthly $30 subscription service for individuals who want to create their own AI video. Luma is similar in this regard to Moonvalley, another startup that announced its own consumer-facing model this week.


	Luma burst onto the scene in early 2024 with Dream Machine, a shortform video-generation tool that one-upped OpenAI's Sora in slickness and flexibility. The company has since raised $100 million, including from Amazon, to go along with the $73 million it had previously raised.


	Jain's firm has put an emphasis on “multimodal” tools — essentially allowing audio and video prompts instead of just text with the aim of giving users more control. One of the latest such tools is Modify, which can transform an ordinary video shoot into something more extravagant.


	On a video call Finger demonstrated a few use cases, including a woman sitting in a modern Los Angeles garage that became a woman riding a horse in an old Western town, or two men sitting at a backyard table who suddenly were sitting in a Medieval alehouse. Period movies, among others, just got a whole lot cheaper. “Right now we bang our heads against the Hollywood wall,” Finger said. “Now I can finally get the shot I need to get.”

	











	While few doubt Hollywood will use these tools, which ones will dominate remains an open question. Luma competes with other startups like Runway AI, which has formal deals with a number of Hollywood entities, and established players like Google's Veo line, which has been trained on many years of Google and YouTube videos and has been an impressive run lately. And of course the legality of the whole enterprise is in question given Disney's lawsuit against Midjourney and other copyright challenges to models trained on copyrighted content.


	Jain says he sees the tools supercharging the quantity of productions and thus, as a result, increasing the likelihood of groundbreaking work.


	“Right now you're changing your ad creative every six months when it should be done every six seconds,” he said of the efficiencies video tools like Luma brought. And on the studio side, “Why are you making 5 movies a year when you should be making 50, you should be making 100?”


	“This changes the economics,” he added, “so drastically.”

Levin will write and direct the feature. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


The Black Phone filmmaker Scott Derrickson has teamed up with his wife, filmmaker Maggie Levin, to tackle an adaptation of the horror novel Ghost Eaters.


Screen Gems, which has a first-look with Derrickson's Crooked Highway banner, is behind the project and has picked up the rights to the bestseller written by Clay McLeod Chapman.




	Levin will write and direct the adaptation. Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill and Vince Cheng will develop and produce via Crooked Highway. The project is in early development.

	Chapman's novel has been described as a terrifying supernatural descent into the depths of grief and addiction. It follows a group of friends who discover a drug called Ghost, which allows them to see the dead. But Ghost has unfathomable side effects, and as the book jacket says, once you take it, you can never go back.

	











	The book scored many accolades when it was published three years ago. It was named one of Vulture‘s best horror novels of 2022, Paste's best horror books of 2022, Book Riot's best horror novels of 2022, and Crime Reads' best horror fiction books of the same year. It was also a September 2022 Library Reads pick and an October 2022 Indie Next Pick.


	Chapman has earned Bram Stoker and Shirley Jackson Award nominations for such horror novels as Wake Up and Open Your Eyes, What Kind of Mother, and Whisper Down the Lane. He recently signed a three-book deal with Tor Nightfire, which will kick off with Mr. Lonelyhearts in 2027. Chapman has also worked in the comics and film spaces.


	Levin previously wrote and directed My Valentine, a feature-length episode of the Hulu/Blumhouse horror anthology series titled Into the Dark. She also wrote and directed an original segment of V/H/S/99, which premiered at TIFF in 2022 and was picked up by Shudder.

	











	She worked as a second unit director on Derrickson's big-budget AppleTV+ monster movie The Gorge, one of the most-watched movies on the platform, as well as his Black Phone. She handled similar duties on his upcoming sequel, Black Phone 2, which opens in theaters this October.


	Levin is repped by WME and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Chapman is repped by Gotham Group and Ziffren.

The movie — launching a new era for DC Studios — scored the top preview gross of the year to date. 


							By

Senior Film Writer


James Gunn‘s Superman has taken flight at the box office.


	The highly anticipated superhero tentpole, from DC Studios and Warner Bros., earned $22.5 million in Thursday previews and other sneak showings at the North American box office. That's the biggest preview of the year to date.




	Tracking shows the movie opening to $130 million domestically, but DC Studios has been far more conservative in sticking with a forecast of $100 million-plus. The hype around the film is enormous — even prompting President Donald Trump to post a meme of himself on social media as the new man of steel.

					'Superman': What the Critics Are Saying		
			









	Gunn is in the unique position of being both the film's writer-director and the co-head of the Warner Bros.-owned DC Studios, so he has plenty of sway in controlling the messaging. Superman is also opening in 78 markets overseas, where it is likewise predicting an opening of $100 million-plus.


	Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice broke records for a film featuring Clark Kent/Superman with a domestic opening of $166 million in 2016, not adjusted for inflation. The last solo Superman movie, Snyder's 2013 film Man of Steel, debuted to $116 million domestically. And almost two decades ago, Bryan Singer‘s Superman Returns posted a six-day North American opening of more than $84 million.


	It's understandable why Gunn and his DC Studios co-head Peter Safran are skittish when it comes to tracking, which has been all over the map in recent months. 


Superman stars David Corenswet as the Man of Steel, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. Rounding out the cast are Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho and Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific.

	











	The movie marks the first DC film entry for Gunn since he took over the reins of Warner Bros' superhero label with Safran in November 2022. Other upcoming DC Studios projects include HBO's Green Lantern series Lanterns, and a Supergirl movie due out in 2026.

The Netflix film's song, “Golden,” just hit No. 1 on Spotify's Daily Top Songs Global Chart and earned seven entries on this week's Billboard Hot 100. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	The love for KPop Demon Hunters, Netflix's latest animated film, and its soundtrack, only seems to be growing.


	Directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, Demon Hunters follows Huntrix members Rumi, Mira and Zoey as they perform undeniably catchy K-pop tracks by day and battle demons by night. The girls spend the film facing off against a newly formed boy band, Saja Boys, a group of secret demons who are using their popularity to steal souls.




	The movie, which returned to the top of Netflix's U.S. movie top 10, has perhaps found its biggest impact in the form of its soundtrack. The compilation of mostly original songs has taken real-world music charts by storm.

	The song's lead single, “Golden,” sung by the girl group Huntrix (EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami), hit No. 1 on Spotify's Daily Top Songs Global Chart on Thursday — it remained in the top spot in the U.S. Meanwhile, “Your Idol,” from the film's fiction boy group, the Saja Boys (Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Kevin Woo, Samuil Lee and Danny Chung), held the No. 4 spot on the streamer's Daily Top Songs Global Chart and No. 2 on the U.S.-only version of the chart.

	The cast of KPop Demon Hunters has the most spots on the Daily Top Songs Global Chart as of Thursday. The soundtrack hit No. 1 on the streamer's global Weekly Top Albums Chart and No. 2 on its U.S. chart for the week of July 3. The cast of voice actors and singers are No. 10 on the platform's Weekly Top Artists Global chart for the week of July 3.

	











Demon Hunters had a banner week on the Billboard charts as well. There are currently seven songs from the film's soundtrack charting on the Hot 100, with Huntrix's “Golden” leading the charge at No. 23, although Saja Boy anthem “Your Idol” is not far behind at No. 31. The overall soundtrack rose to No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart this week after debuting at No. 8 last week.


KPop Demon Hunters earned the title of highest charting soundtrack of the year, according to Republic Records, and the largest streaming week of a soundtrack in two years. The film's executive music producer told The Hollywood Reporter that the film plans to make “Golden” its awards submission.

Stock in the mega-exhibitor soared on Friday as a Wedbush analyst argued glaring uncertainties brought on by the pandemic and the Hollywood strikes are behind the debt-laden company. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Is the worst behind AMC Theatres and its beleaguered stock price? One Wall Street analyst thinks so.


	With Hollywood at last giving the mega-exhibitor the certainty in its supply of tentpole releases needed to get film lovers back in the habit of going to the multiplex, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese on Friday upgraded stock in AMC from neutral to outperform and set a $4.00 price target, from $3.00.




	Reese argued in a July 11 investor note AMC “is poised to benefit from a more consistent release slate over the next several quarters,” and gain market share through to 2026 in North America and Europe. That good news for a company attempting to get out of a financial hole brought on by the pandemic lifted parent AMC Entertainment Holdings shares by 30 cents, or 10 percent, to $3.30 on Friday morning.

	The Wedbush analysis is also more sanguine about AMC's debt woes after the company repaid or postponed all borrowing obligations that were due in 2026. “With box office expected to be more consistent in the coming quarters, we expect AMC's EBITDA to cover interest expense, relieving its need to issue more shares,” Reese wrote.

	AMC as a meme stock in the past has been decidedly volatile as the exhibition giant burned through cash to maintain operations and raised fresh financing from new stock sales. On July 1, AMC announced an agreement with key creditors, debt holders and other lenders that offered more financial flexibility, resolved key litigation and allow the company to focus on box office upside.

	











	The Wedbush analyst made clear she doesn't see clear sailing for AMC. “To be clear, we do not see substantial growth in 2025, 2026, or beyond. This is a low-growth industry in a period of recovery. Over the next few years, we anticipate mid-to-high single-digit growth rates in box office revenue, followed by low-to-mid single-digit growth rates thereafter,” the note stated.


	The Wall Street analyst sees small mercies for exhibitors in the major studios committing to theatrical releases after uncertainty brought on by pandemic-era theater closures and a shift of Hollywood titles to emerging streaming platforms.


	The industry's year of strikes in 2023 also disrupted the flow of Hollywood movie releases to the local multiplex. “We think that post-SAG-AFTRA strike in 2023/2024, studios collectively created a compelling, genre-balanced 2025 – 2026, which we believe will drive audiences to theaters regardless of economic turmoil,” Reese wrote in her note.


	Now all Hollywood has to do is deliver box office winners — whether comic book reboots or arthouse standouts from Paul Thomas Anderson and Yorgos Lanthimos — that more consistently draw consumers to theaters, however much recession worries overhang the wider economy.


	“The theater business has historically been resilient in recessions, with attendance driven by content quality and viewed as a relatively inexpensive escape from reality. As such, at this juncture, we are more concerned about content quality than with overarching economic pressure on attendance,” the Wedbush note stated.

After four years, the superstar surprise released his seventh studio album.


													By
												

	Lyndsey Havens



	On Thursday, July 10, billboards across cities including New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Reykjavík popped up all teasing the same thing: Justin Bieber is back. 


	The various billboards showed black and white photos of the superstar, with one in particular showing him shirtless standing in front of his wife Hailey Bieber, who is holding their son Jack Blues Bieber (though his face isn't to the camera). The images were shot by Renell Medrano, the same photographer who shot the album art for Kendrick Lamar's 2022 Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers; and, as many fans have pointed out on social media, it seemed likely that Bieber's new album could follow a similar theme of chronicling his journey towards healing.


	While other billboards depicted the word “SWAG,” which proved to be an album title, some listed 20 titles, which proved to be the album's track list (plus one more track not listed on the billboards, culminating in 21 total). Titles included “Therapy Session” and “Forgiveness,” further solidifying similarities between Bieber and Lamar's confessional projects.


	In all, the surprise promo added up to a quick campaign for Bieber's anticipated seventh album. But the few hours notice was more than enough to generate hype — as fans have been seated and waiting for new music since 2021.


	Out Friday, July 11, Swag is the superstar's first album in four years, since Justice. Sources told Billboard that Swag was in the same lane of R&B only much more experimental, referencing artists such as Dijon and Mk.gee (both of whom are credited on the album). 


	And while Swag arrived as a surprise, it's also an expected move from the artist who has been making headlines of late for everything from financial woes with his former manager, Scooter Braun, to concerns over his marital status. With Swag, Bieber is taking control of not only the present narrative but his and his family's future.


	As he famously said recently, in a paparazzi clip that has since gone viral: “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business.” After one listen through Swag, it immediately clocks just how serious Bieber is about protecting what matters most. And really, what's swaggier than that?


	Below, see Billboard's preliminary ranking of all 21 songs from Bieber's Swag.


	The 21st and final track on Swag is by pastor and gospel singer Marvin Winans, a fitting choice for someone so rooted in his faith like Bieber — and an even more fitting title to end his album on. Because if he's proven anything across Swag, it's that forgiveness is all he is, and ever has been, asking for.




	“You got some soul on this album,” says Druski on this interlude, before joking that Bieber “kinda sounds Black” on the project. “Your skin white, but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you.”


	Given that “Standing On Business” wasn't included in the original tracklist being teased on the billboards spotted earlier in the day suggests one of two things: there was a clearance issue, as Bieber uses the now viral audio of him telling a paparazzi: “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business, is it? I'm a human being, you're standing around my car, at the beach!” Or, Bieber himself wasn't sure on cementing a fleeting moment on his album forever. 


	“I like that you pronounce business,” says Druski, poking fun. “You were pronouncing every word. You can't do that…I'm gonna start going to the beach and looking for motherf—–s just to say that s–t to.”


	Druski returns on this confessional interlude where he laughs about Bieber trolling, which he says causes the public to overreact and say, “he's f—ing losing his mind!…Nah, he's just being a human being, he's enjoying social media like the rest of us, he's just doing it his own way.” “That's been a tough thing for me recently, is feeling like I've had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human really publicly, so people are always asking if I'm ok, and that starts to really weigh on me,” says Bieber. “It starts to make me feels like I'm the only one with issues and everyone else is perfect.”


	“See,” says Druski, “that's why I said I'm gonna be your counselor.” 


	“405” is the first song — not to mention, it's the 17th track — that could be called a filler. But given the album's theme and how much of Swag plays out like a direct line into Bieber's brain of late, this 3-minute and 33-second hypnotic, racing track sounds like what likely runs through his head when mindlessly driving on the freeway. As he repeats, “keep loving you” over and over again, it sounds just as much like a mantra as a promise.


	“We need more people to get together,” instructs Lil B, calling for less separation and hate around the world, and more love. And as Bieber repeats the track's title over and over, it takes on double meaning: it sounds like he's saying both “Dad's love” and “that's love” — and as he aims to prove, isn't that one in the same? As he's made clear in recent paparazzi clips, Bieber is a dad now. And viral jokes aside, here he's well aware that leading with love is the only way through.


	“Way It Is” is one of the most straightforward R&Bieber tracks on the album, offering a reminder that despite some of the more experimental swings he takes throughout Swag he's still the same artist his fans have loved all this time. Gunna's verse, though brief, fits in seamlessly thanks to Bieber harmonizing just below his vocals, as if he was too into the track to step away even for a moment.


	“We get high and we go down again,” sings Bieber on this reflective track about how he ended up here in the first place — and who he considers to hold the title of “first place” in his life. The uptempo production offsets the more sobering lyrics, with Bieber saying “I don't wanna lose you now, that's the worst case.” He continues to admit “it's been this way for a long time,” after questioning, “where do I begin?” Swag seems like an appropriate, and necessary, first step.


	For the album's title track, Bieber brought his friends along. Featuring rapper Cash Cobain and close collaborator Eddie Benjamin, on “Swag” the three manage to share the spotlight with ease as they assure, “I'll put you on.” As Cash attests, “That's swag, for certain.”


	“Sweet Spot” does exactly as the title implies, balancing a retro R&B beat with the more experimental production that unites all of Swag. And while some of the lyrics call back to the more cringe-worthy moments on “Yummy” (still, a certified banger), Sexxy Red's extended verse certainly helps sell the inclusion of this sex-positive track.


	If it wasn't included on his own album, it may be hard to guess that “Yukon” is a Bieber track. Save for his own backing vocals, which are undeniably JB, this track finds the singer questioning: “What would I do, if I didn't love you?” And while the Latin-inspired riff and hand drums add a bit of intrigue, “Yukon” serves a similar purpose to “405,” both of which seem like real-time ruminations that often occupy Bieber's mind.




	After a song like “Swag,” “Zuma House” comes as a welcome shock. Another raw offering, much like “Glory Voice Memo,” this song sounds much like what the title suggests: Bieber alone in a house near Zuma Beach recording himself via voice memo on an acoustic guitar. After just one-minute and 23 seconds, the song trails off, almost like you were caught eavesdropping, and don't want to risk being caught by lingering too long. The impromptu end leaves the listener wanting more and yet feeling fortunate enough to have heard anything so intimate at all. 


	It makes sense for the snapping “Things You Do” to follow “Go Baby.” It's as if “Baby” is what Bieber wishes to say to the public, while “Things You Do” is his more intimate, loving offering to his wife. Singing over a simple riff, it's easy to picture Bieber sitting on the edge of the bed playing this while strumming and snapping along, shaking his head to accompany his own signature vocal flourishes.


	“Money, money, money,” says Bieber, in audio clipped from another recent paparazzi encounter. The addition, as all the paparazzi clips do, makes Swag feel just as fresh and urgent as its arrival, and here Bieber uses this specific interaction as inspiration for a commentary on the things people often desire. “Butterfly, go away,” he begs. It's as if Bieber is both being chased by and chasing after something, before concluding, “I'm 'bout to slip away.” But as the sixth track on the album, it's clear he's nowhere near done running just yet. And some things, he might be realizing, you can never really outrun anyway. 


	After a near hour worth of reflection and baring his soul, “Too Long” brings a feistier side to Bieber to the forefront, supported by a classic R&B beat. “When you do me like that, it's hard to take…I've been waiting, I've been patient/ I've been waiting too long.” It's as if everything up until this point was a plea with himself, with his family and even with the public to understand where he's coming from and what he's been up against — but just in case none of that made his case, “Too Long” is one final Hail Mary. “I want to let it go,” Bieber admits, “it's been too long.”


	Whatever he's seeking, though, can only be granted by himself alone. No one else.


	The rawness of “Glory Voice Memo” makes it feel like a 2025 all-grown-up version of the YouTube video that made Bieber a viral sensation. There's not much to it, just pure vocal talent — the kind that makes your noise wrinkle and eyes close — over a fuzzy, acoustic guitar. If there was ever a doubt, this 84-second clip proves JB has still got it, and never lost it.


	“That's my baby, she's iconic/ iPhone case, lip gloss on it,” sings Bieber, speaking of his wife Hailey and her Rhode beauty empire, which recently sold to Elf Beauty in $1 billion deal. “When sunlight turns to shadows and it gets hard to face… nothing needs to work out and nothing needs to break/ don't need to pretend you're ok.” The chorus, though nothing more than the repeated line “go baby, go” is an instantly classic anthem for supporting a loved one. And with this one song, Bieber seems to shut down any speculation of his marital status by telling his wife: “Cry on my shoulder… you better believe I can hold all the weight.” Sure, things may not always be perfect — but isn't that the beauty of having a partner to celebrate the good and brave the bad with? And for the Biebers, they have to live their highs and lows out loud. “Go Baby” proves that there's no love lost — rather, they're one another's biggest fans when they need it most.


	This vibey, gilmmering opening track immediately sets the stage for what's to come: as promised, an experimental, alternative take on the R&B of Bieber's prime. And even through the layers of production and vocal editing, Bieber's voice shines through as confident as ever as he repeats: “And it's all I can take.” There's a sense of freedom in the confession — and what a note to start on.


	“Walking Away” is a goosebump-raising confessional about why Bieber isn't “walking away” from his marriage — no matter how tough it gets. “We better stop before we say some s–t, we've been testing our patience,” he admits, before declaring, “Baby, I ain't walking away.” This song functions like a refreshingly honest vow renewal, as Bieber recalls giving Hailey her ring and promising to change. “It's just human nature, these growing pains,” he assures. He sounds undoubtedly sincere — but then again, there's only one listener who can be the judge of that.


	A Justin Bieber and Dijon collaboration sounds exactly as one would hope: like a warm, all-encompassing hug. 12 tracks in and this pairing makes perfect sense, as Swag creates a similarly intimate and lo-fi atmosphere to Dijon's own debut album, 2021's Absolutely. There's a beautiful calm to “Devotion,” with Bieber taking a moment to put any fears or frustrations aside and simply live in his present. Admitting in the first line, “I'm starting to be open to/ the idea that you know me, too.” As they say, to be known is to be loved, and it seems Bieber is finally learning that to be true — and taking comfort in that rare kind of intimacy, or rather, devotion.


	Following a lead track like “All I Can Take,” on which Bieber's vocals were a bit clouded by the production, “Daisies” arrives as a welcomed follow-up as his voice is much more the focal point, supported mostly by a crunchy, lo-fi guitar — signature to Swag. There's an intimacy to this track, as if it places the listener directly in the garage — or whatever small, comforting and likely hazy space — it was recorded in. And for a superstar like Bieber, who is over 15 years and seven albums into his career, it's no small feat to craft an alternative-pop track that sounds like it's being made directly in the listener's ear in real time. And as a whole, that's what Swag accomplishes best; in addition to helping Bieber get some things off his chest, never has a star of his magnitude sounded more real, in every sense of the word.

	The new release comes as BLACKPINK kick off their massive World Tour DEADLINE, which will see the quartet perform 31 shows across 16 cities, including two-night stadium stops in Los Angeles, New York, Paris and London. Following their South Korea opener, the group are set to bring the tour stateside this weekend for a two-night stint at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

The 16-track LP includes collaborations with Travis Scott, Shaboozey, Mick Jagger & Stromae.

	Heran Mamo



Burna Boy released his eighth studio album No Sign of Weakness late Thursday (July 10) via Spaceship Records, Bad Habit and Atlantic Records.


	The 16-track project includes previously released singles “Bundle by Bundle,” “Update,” “Sweet Love,” “TaTaTa” (featuring Travis Scott) and “Change Your Mind” (featuring Shaboozey). No Sign of Weakness also includes more collaborations too, with Mick Jagger (“Empty Chairs”) and Stromae (“Pardon”). “TaTaTa” reached No. 2 on U.S. Afrobeats Songs, while “Bundle by Bundle” and “Update” both hit No. 5.


	“It's extrospective,” he told Billboard France in his recent cover story. “It's not just about me but about looking outward, reflecting on the world, and how my experiences connect to the bigger picture. It's about growth, understanding, and challenging perceptions while staying true to who I am.”

	











	Burna is headlining the third and final night of Afro Nation Portugal tonight at the Lit Stage, marking his first time being able to perform songs from the album shortly after its release. Come November, he'll kick of his headlining No Sign of Weakness Tour at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, becoming the first Nigerian artist to headline the iconic venue. The 17-date trek will also go through major cities including Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta before wrapping up with two dates at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, on Dec. 17 and 18.

No Sign of Weakness arrives two years after his last album I Told Them…., which was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Its hit singles “City Boys” and “Sittin' On Top of the World” (featuring 21 Savage on the remix) also scored Grammy nominations that year, for best African music performance and best melodic rap performance, respectively.

The LP dropped just hours after the pop star announced its existence.

	Hannah Dailey



	We may as well be chilling by the fire while we eatin' fondue, because Justin Bieber‘s Swag is here.


	Released at midnight Friday (July 11) — just a few hours after the pop star announced its existence — Bieber's seventh studio album features 21 new songs. The singer first unveiled the tracklist in a video of a black-and-white billboard shared on his Instagram without explanation, revealing the titles “All I Can Take,” “Daisies,” “Yukon,” “Go Baby,” “Things You Do,” “Butterflies,” “Way It Is,” “First Place,” “Soulful,” “Walking Away,” “Glory Voice Memo,” “Devotion,” “Dadz Love,” “Therapy Session,” “Sweet Spot,” “405,” “Swag,” “Zuma House,” “Too Long” and “Forgiveness.”


	When the album arrived, it featured an additional track: “Standing on Business,” featuring an audio sample of Bieber's own meme-fueling viral exchange with paparazzi in June. 

	











	The project marks Bieber's first full-length since 2021's Justice, which spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — one of eight No. 1 entries he's scored on the chart over the course of his career. He's also become a father since he last dropped an album, welcoming baby boy Jack Blues with wife Hailey Bieber last August.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Both the 11-month-old and the Rhode founder were featured heavily in promotional photos that circulated in the hours leading up to Swag, with the whole family appearing on the billboard shared by Justin on Instagram. In the artwork, Hailey holds little Jack in the background while the two-time Grammy winner stares down the camera in front.


	For years, it was unclear whether Bieber would ever release another album as the star took a large step back from performing. In 2022, he announced that he'd been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a condition that caused half of his face to be temporarily paralyzed. 

	











	In the months leading up to Swag, however, he repeatedly teased that he was back to making music by sharing photos of himself in the studio.


	Listen to Bieber's Swag below.

KPop Demon Hunters is also the first soundtrack of any kind to crown the chart since Barbie: The Album logged two weeks at No. 1 in 2023.

	The release is fueling a wave of chart success across the ARIA Singles Chart too. Multiple tracks from the film are climbing fast: “Golden” (Rei Ami, HUNTR/X, Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and the cast) surges from No. 8 to No. 2, while “Your Idol” cracks the top 10, jumping 12-8. Other standouts include “How It's Done” (No. 21-11), “Soda Pop” (No. 27-12), “What It Sounds Like” (No. 25-16), and “Free” (No. 33-20).


	Meanwhile, Sydney punk-rockers FANGZ are celebrating a milestone of their own. Their debut full-length album Shui bows at No. 8 on the Albums Chart, giving the five-piece their first top 10 appearance. The band, who have been active since 2019, are currently on a national tour and will perform at Newcastle's Hamilton Station tonight (July 10).


	Elsewhere on the Albums Chart, Lorde's Virgin holds strong at No. 2 after debuting atop the Vinyl Albums chart last week, and Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet sits at No. 3.

	











	On the Singles Chart, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” extends its reign to a 16th consecutive week at No. 1, a feat that continues to cement its global breakout status. The viral hit has topped charts in over 25 countries, including the Billboard Hot 100. and U.K., and its parent album You'll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter 1) — which peaked at No. 15 earlier this year — lands at 23 this week.


	Legacy acts are also stirring activity. Following Oasis' U.K. reunion shows, the band's Time Flies… 1994-2009 greatest hits compilation re-enters at No. 50, while What's The Story Morning Glory? just misses the top 50 but sees renewed streaming momentum.

	The track features a prominent sample of Ye's “Power” and finds Scott in top form, rapping, “He sleep with a Spanish bi— in the club/ Bro knowin' Spanglish, that's good enough/ Wе took an hour out of the after-hours just to f— up all the ones/ I got a bunch, you ain't doin' brunch.” The video showcases Scott and his crew tearing up Texas streets in exotic sports cars and supercharged Ford trucks, even making a pit stop at a Formula 1 race.


Jackboys 2 builds on the legacy of Scott's 2019 Jackboys album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and spawned hits like “Out West” (featuring Young Thug) and “Gatti” (featuring Pop Smoke). His previous Jackboys release saw 154,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Jan. 2, according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 79,000 were in album sales, with most of that number owed to sales driven by dozens of merchandise/album bundles sold via Jackboys' official webstore.

	











	In recent weeks, Scott has sent out customized Lamborghini SUVs branded with the JACKBOYS logo to artists rumored to feature on the album. Among them are GloRilla, Tyla, Vybz Kartel, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, and Waka Flocka Flame, though official features have yet to be confirmed.


	The rapper has also launched a limited-edition Jackboys 2 merchandise collection, offering fans a range of CD and vinyl bundles with alternate cover art and exclusive apparel, all available on his Cactus Jack website.


	While details about the full tracklist remain under wraps, Scott revealed the album will feature 17 tracks and will be hosted by Houston rap icon Bun B. The sequel arrives as Scott continues his dominant run in 2025, having headlined Coachella in April and fresh off winning the I Am Hip Hop Award at last year's BET Hip Hop Awards.

EXCLUSIVE: Mothership FBI will be the only representative of the crime drama franchise on CBS‘ fall schedule. Offshoot CIA starring Tom Ellis, which received a straight-to-series order in April, is being delayed until midseason and is undergoing a showrunner change. Watson, which had been set to return for a second season in midseason, will now be on for fall. 


FBI: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins, who originally was tapped to lead the series and co-write the pilot script with FBI, Law & Order & Chicago franchise boss Dick Wolf, has exited. He is being replaced by Wolf universe veteran Warren Leight, known for his two stints as showrunner of Law & Order: SVU.

	There had been early signs that CIA may not be ready for fall. The original plan was for three characters, including the one played by Ellis, to be introduced in a planted spinoff episode of mothership FBI which was pushed a couple of times over casting delays until a decision was made not to proceed with it. There were questions about the creative of the project at the time of the straight-to-series order in late April. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	While the writers room is up and running, I hear there may not be finished scripts approved for production, and there have been no additional castings on the series since the initial pickup announcement that included Ellis. That is about to change. 


	With Leight at the helm, the series is expected to forge ahead, and casting is set to begin shortly for an early fall production start. It is unclear whether the project's original concept about two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent who believes in the rule of law — will be tweaked. 

	











	Wolf and Leight executive produce CIA alongside Nicole Perlman, David Chasteen, and Peter Jankowski. Eriq La Salle remains attached to direct and executive produce the pilot episode. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, produces in association with Wolf Entertainment and CBS Studios.


	With CIA not coming together as fast as CBS had hoped, the network may have been making contingency plans as, despite being benched until midseason, Watson has already started production. 


	It is unclear whether Watson, from Kapital Entertainment and CBS Studios, will replace CIA on the fall schedule, taking over the post-FBI Monday 10 PM time slot, or whether the network will make scheduling changes. That will be revealed shortly when CBS announces fall premiere dates. (UPDATE: Watson will return for Season 2 in the Monday 10 PM slot, giving Kapital 3 series on the night, The Neighborhood at 8 PM, new comedy DMV at 8:30 PM and Watson at 10 PM.)


	The move to fall will give Watson, which launched with a 13-episode run earlier this year, a typical air pattern. New scripted broadcast series launching in midseason usually return in the fall (unless it is designed for a limited-run seasons, which Watson, starring Morris Chestnut, is not) because a midseason run is not considered long enough to get a new series fully established, and a long gap after the short initial may hut its longevity prospects.  


	Leight served as Law & Order: SVU executive producer/showrunner from 2011–2016 and 2019–2022. He also worked on Law & Order: Criminal Intent.

					By Denise Petski 

Senior Managing Editor


	As James Gunn's Superman surges to more than $22 million in box office previews (along with a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes), the filmmaker reportedly is looking ahead to the possibility of at least two TV spinoffs.


	Gunn is considering TV spinoffs for Superman characters such as Edi Gathegi‘s Mister Terrific and Skyler Gisondo‘s Jimmy Olsen, according to a report Thursday night in the Wall Street Journal.


	Gunn already has Season 2 of Peacemaker, from DC Studios and Warner Bros. Television, set to release on August 21. And his series Lanterns, starring Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre, is in post for premiere sometime in 2026.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In a recent Q&A with Entertainment Weekly, Gunn gave an update on Paradise Lost, saying it “is moving along. It's slow-moving, but it's moving.” He also mentioned another TV show “that's my favorite thing in all of this, that is hopefully getting made soon.”  


	DC co-bosses Gunn and Peter Safran earlier revealed plans for their revamp of the DCU, which include two live-action films and one animated film per year, along with two live-action and two animated TV series per year.


	Written and directed by Gunn, Superman stars David Corenswet as the titular Kal-El aka Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. In addition to Gathegi and Gisondo, Superman also stars Nicholas Hoult (Lex Luthor), Sara Sampaio (Eve Teschmacher), Terence Rosemore (Otis), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl), Nathan Fillion (Guy Gardner), María Gabriela de Faría (The Engineer) and Wendell Pierce (Daily Planet editor Perry White.)

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Dianne Wiest and Oscar nominee Stockard Channing are set to return for Practical Magic 2, Warner Bros. Pictures' sequel to the 1998 romantic fantasy starring Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock.


	The pair reprise their roles as Aunt Jet and Aunt Franny, the eccentric and wise matriarchs who took in witch sisters Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman) following the death of their parents and taught them everything they know about magic, mischief, and self-reliance.


	Production on the sequel is now underway, with Bullock and Kidman returning. Joey King has now locked down the role of Sally's daughter, after being tipped as being in talks. Rounding out the cast, we have Lee Pace (Foundation), Maisie Williams (The New Look), Xolo Maridueña (Blue Beetle), and Solly McLeod (The Dead Don't Hurt). Character details for the newcomers are under wraps, as is the plot of the sequel, to be released in theaters worldwide on September 18, 2026.

	First announced last summer, the new Practical Magic movie is being directed by Susanne Bier (The Perfect Couple, Bird Box). Akiva Goldsman, who co-wrote the original film, has returned to write the script with Georgia Pritchett (Succession). Bullock and Kidman are producing alongside the original film's Denise Di Novi.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a statement on today's castings, the Practical Magic filmmaking team said, “Twenty-five years ago, Sally, Gillian, Aunt Jet and Aunt Franny flew off the pages of Alice Hoffman's beloved novel and into theaters around the world, and we are thrilled to bring the Owens family back to the big screen with Joey, Lee, Maisie, Solly and Xolo joining the next chapter in our story. The enduring affection for these characters has been our inspiration to deliver the next installment in the Owens' story to new fans, and those who've been with us since the beginning.”

	











	Directed by Griffin Dunne, Practical Magic adapted the 1995 novel from Alice Hoffman. The story introduces Sally and Gillian Owens as sisters who come from a long line of witches. Raised by their eccentric aunts in a magical household, they must confront a deadly curse and their own powers when love and danger collide. The original film grossed over $68M worldwide.


	Wiest is repped by CAA; Channing by Markham, Froggatt and Irwin, CAA, Anonymous Content, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller; Pace by WME and Peikoff Mahan; Williams by Curtis Brown Group, Ocean Avenue, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman; Maridueña by UTA, Valor Entertainment Group, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller; and McLeod by CAA, The Artists Partnership, and manager Arjun Rose.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


UPDATED FRIDAY AM AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros is seeing $22.5M all in for previews for James Gunn‘s Superman. Not only is that still the best previews YTD and a record for James Gunn, but it's higher than the previews for last year's Barbie ($22.3M, 3-day $162M) and ahead of all the previews for Matt Reeves' The Batman ($21.6M, $134M opening in 2022).


	What do audiences think? It's a 78% definite recommend on PostTrak for general audiences — you can take that to the bank, seriously. Five stars from kids under 12 and parents. Superman is flying around everywhere.


	Will President Donald Trump's meme posted on the White House X handle be Kryptonite to business in addition to the snarks from right-wingers on Fox News? Not a chance, insiders say. Get out of the way, here comes Superman.

Gunn told the Sunday Times last week: “I mean, Superman is the story of America … an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country. But for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”


RELATED: Dean Cain Says James Gunn Made A “Mistake” Calling Superman An “Immigrant”: “How Woke Is Hollywood Going To Make This Character?”


	The statement was a reflection of the current aggressive immigration policies set forth by Trump. The filmmaker and co-DC Studios Boss in his chat with the Sunday Times isn't losing sleep over any criticism.

	











	“Yes, it plays differently,” Gunn said. “But it's about human kindness, and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.”


	During an episode of Fox's table talk The Five this week, Republican operative Kellyanne Conway said: “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and have someone throw their ideology on to us. I wonder if it will be successful.”

	Read Ted Johnson's coverage here. 


	Yes, Ms. Conway, the movie will be extremely successful. At this level, industry projections have raised to $140M-$150M+ for the weekend. As we told you, Thursday night's previews include the Tuesday Amazon Prime Members shows, which collected $2.8M.


	It's gonna be a fun weekend, and Warner Bros, you've done it again with an overperformance streak that includes A Minecraft Movie ($162.7M), Sinners ($48M), Final Destination Bloodlines ($51.6M), F1 ($57M) and now Superman. Weekend 28, the second weekend of July last year, brought in $123M with the second frame of Despicable Me 4. The marketplace is going to boom past that easily.

	Here's how the rest of the week went down:


	1.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,308 theaters Thu $7.5M (-25% from Wed), Wk $136.3M/Wk 1


	2.)  F1 (Apple/WB) 3,732 theaters, Thu $2.5M (-34%), Wk $39.66M (-52%), Total $123.1M/Wk 2


	3.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) 3,714 theaters, Thu $1.67M (-10%), Wk $19M (-41%), Total $232M/Wk 4


	4.) Elio (Dis) 3,235 theaters, Thu $985K (-14%), Wk $10.3M (-42%), Total $59.7M/Wk 3


	5.) 28 Years Later (Sony) 2,917 theaters, Thu $557K (-20%) Wk $7.4M (-50%) Total $63M/Wk 3

EXCLUSIVE: Count gravitational pull as a superpower for James Gunn's Superman as the first movie under the filmmaker's DC Studios, which he co-runs with Peter Safran, is heading to a massive $21M+ in overall previews, sources tell us tonight.


	Oh, and audiences love it at 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. Gunn and Safran and all of Warner Bros can rest easy after the cynics' snarking over the first trailer back in December. That's the best RT audience score ever for a Superman movie, even better than Richard Donner's 1978 original (86%). Take that, trolls.


Superman‘s preview figure includes Tuesday night's Amazon Prime members screenings cash of $2.8M, plus monies from showtimes which began today at 2 p.m.

	Lots of records flying around here for the first title in DC's Phase One “Gods and Monsters”: First, Superman‘s previews rep a record for a James Gunn-directed film, besting Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‘s $17.5M ($118.4M 3-day in 2023). It's also the best damn previews we've seen all year, ahead of Disney's Lilo & Stitch ($14.5M, $146M 3-day opening) and Captain America: Brave New World ($12M, $88.8M 3-day).


	While Warners was hoping for a $100M 3-day start and tracking and exhibition were spotting $115M-$130M, Superman, looks to be leaving all those projections in the dust. The IP has been done several times through history — not just on the big screen but going back to radio with several iterations on TV including the first 1950s George Reeves black-and-white show. So what's the deciding factor for non-frequent moviegoers to discover this superhero on the big screen again? Why, reviews. This Superman stands at 82% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, the second-best reviewed Superman ever after Richard Donner's 1978 original, which stands at 86%.

	











RELATED: ‘Superman' Review: James Gunn's Lively Reboot Takes The OG Superhero And His Dog On A Mission For A Kinder World


	Other intriguing benchmarks: Gunn's Superman is easily ahead of the preview box office of Zack Snyder's 2013 Man of Steel ($9M, 10 p.m. start time, different era for previews, which turned into a $116.6M opening). There's also a shot when we wake up tomorrow morning it could be higher than Matt Reeves' The Batman from 2022, which did $21.6M in overall previews (including $4M Tuesday shows and Thursday showtimes that began at 3PM; $134M opening). Gunn's Superman is close to the sun as far preview records go for Superman movies overall, but hasn't surpassed it (and that's not a bad thing), meaning 2016's Batman v. Superman holds the record for the best previews ever for a Superman movie with $27.7M ($166M 3-day).


	Social media analytics firm RelishMix has noticed positive word of mouth leading up to opening with a massive social media universe across YouTube, TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook of 953.8 million, +20% of superhero genre pics' reach before their openings. That reach buries that of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (709.7M) and The Batman (631.7M), Joker Folie à Deux (567M), and it's not far from Deadpool & Wolverine (1.15 billion).


RELATED: James Gunn “Didn't Feel Guilt At All” Leaving MCU To Direct For DC


	Says RelishMix: “The exuberant tone and dedication to the characters is winning many fans over, i.e. ‘A comic book movie that's not ashamed to be a comic book is something we desperately needed,' and, ‘The trailers we've gotten for this movie have given me the warm fuzzy feelings…this Superman feels right.' After his widely popular Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy for Marvel, James Gunn in the director chair is inspiring a lot of confidence: ‘Mr. James Gunn is going to do us DC fans right for once.' The nostalgia is strong with this film, capturing the heart of the original 1978 film, ‘His look reminds me of Reeves Superman,' and, ‘The actors are great. And the theme music a remix of the old theme. Take my money now.'”


	These numbers do not come from Warners and by tomorrow business could be higher.

When you start on a Wednesday …  records will be broken

How is this a fair comparison if you're including preview grosses from additional days compared to Barbie and The Batman?

It's a wonder any film succeeds when you have trolls like you do in this comment section rooting for everything to fail.

Don't call them trolls. They are high level corporate accountants who know more about film budgets marketing budgets and revenue splits than the people who actually do this for a living. And they all have the same name. Anonymous.

lol thank you for this

LOL Peter.

Truly hilarous if you think this movie is touching a billion. It'll be lucky to outgross MoS from 13 years ago globally. Touting 21 mil and sweeping the fact yesterday's showings made 2.2 million.

It's not even going to earn what MOS did because the international markets would rather see dinosaurs. When you account for bigger budgets and inflation, the result won't be good. My prediction is a $450mil finish. And before I am accused of being an MCU fan, I think Fantastic 4 will flop even harder. No one but comic nerds have ever cared about F4, and there aren't any movie stars in the cast. Both films will be frontloaded and sink like a stone. Superhero movies need a reset.

‘Salt Path' Scandal


What's in a story?: Up until last Sunday, Gillian Anderson pic The Salt Path, a true-to-life underdog film about a couple made homeless who walk along a South England coastal path, was a local box office hit. Then, The Observer dropped a bombshell investigation, questioning multiple elements of the couple's story and revealing that the author of the source material, Raynor Winn, was once arrested after being accused of stealing tens of thousands of pounds from her employer. What's followed has been an almost nationwide debate around truth, fiction and just how far Raynor Winn was able to push the believability of her story. Given that it is supposed to be a raw, honest re-telling of a couple finding light amid disaster, The Observer report called the very essence of the book into question. Having spoken to multiple experts, it also queried Raynor's husband Moth Winn's CBD, a debilitating disorder that has an average life expectancy of 6-8 years, and which he has been living with for more than double that period. Both the book's publisher Penguin and the movie's producer Number 9 Films said they had undertaken “all due diligence,” yet the messy affair raises interesting questions over just how far these efforts should stretch, and just how far Raynor Winn had been stretching her story. She hit back furiously Wednesday, issuing a lengthy statement partnered with hard medical evidence of Moth Winn's CBD, while calling The Observer's report “grotesquely unfair, highly misleading and [seeking] to systematically pick apart my life.”

Disney & ITV Deal











			Watch on Deadline		







‘Love Island' meets ‘The Bear': It's been a summer of streamer-broadcaster co-operation. The latest American SVoD to land a bedfellow is Disney+, which has struck a landmark deal with ITV that will see a “Taste of Disney+” rail feature on ITVX and vice versa. Content heading to ITV includes The Bear, Andor and The Kardashians, while Love Island, Mr Bates vs the Post Office and Vera head the other way. Karl Holmes, Disney+'s boss in EMEA, told us the secret of the deal's success will be in its complementary nature, (Less than 10% of Disney+'s audience is over the age of 55, while for ITV the figure is around 40%) while ITV content chief Kevin Lygo labeled the tie-up a “mutually beneficial alliance.” Free-to-air VoD players and U.S. streamers will “come closer in the future,” Holmes said, as he teased more Disney partnerships of this ilk to come. Disney hasn't been the only big player looking to collaborate. Netflix and France's TF1 struck a “new kind of partnership” last month that will see the former carry channels from the latter, while Amazon and France Télévisions did similarly for France Télévisions' streaming service a couple weeks later. The new age is upon us and collaboration between old and new is the name of the game.


Britain & France Team On Cinema Pact


‘Plein' sailing: More collaboration, this time between nations, was revealed after French President Emmanuel Macron visited the UK this week. Macron was in Britain to try and strike a UK-France illegal migration deal but his trip offered an opportunity for the two nations' movie industries to deepen ties. As Macron hob-nobbed with King Charles, Kate Middleton and the Prime Minister, the BFI and France's CNC signed a Moving Image Co-operation Agreement aimed at fostering closer collaboration between the UK and French film industries. Given the strength of their respective movie sectors, Mel's dispatch from the BFI Southbank, where the deal was revealed, notes that co-operation of this ilk has not always been straightforward. The two have vastly different financing systems and legislation, while Brexit has been an impediment to collaboration. Never one to miss an opportunity to address a crowd of culture vultures, UK Minister Chris Bryant, who speaks fluent French, waxed lyrical about French cinema, citing Plein Soleil and Les Enfants du Paradis as personal faves.


Czeching Out Karlovy Vary


Soft power “depleting”: There was some serious star power in town at this year's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF), with Dakota Johnson, Michael Douglas and Peter Sarsgaard making the journey to the Czech Republic for what is always a lively event. But in one of the more intriguing sessions, Hollywood's very status as a titan of global cinema was called into question. The latest Nostradamus report from the Göteborg Film Festival, which was unveiled during the Karlovy industry sidebar, found that Hollywood is losing its “symbolic value” in mainstream culture, as it went on to posit that America's soft power is being depleted despite the appearance of the A-list stars. “The concept of Americanization has been quite challenged for some time,” Göteborg boss Josef Kullengärd told an audience at the KVIFF industry headquarters. This session came after one where more local concerns were aired, as figureheads made impassioned speeches about how far-right purges are threatening cultural sectors in Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, there remained plenty of glitz and glamor. One of the most popular sessions was Fifty Shades star Johnson's, who had two films at the fest, Celine Song's sleeper Materialists and Michael Angelo Corvino's Cannes hit Splitsville. The two modern dating films got Johnson thinking that “dating sucks,” she told an engaged audience. Karlovy coverage can be found here.












Terry Gilliam Reflects


No more fights: Nancy sat down with the weird and wacky Terry Gilliam on Monday as he headed to the Umbria Film Festival in Italy, where a screening next weekend of his iconic 1985 dystopian black comedy Brazil will celebrate the film's 40th anniversary. The Oscar-nominated icon, a former member of the Monty Python troupe, is always happy to speak with honesty and purpose but appears to be mellowing with age. He told us that while he has often courted controversy during a lengthy career, he doesn't want “any more fights.” His views on the current state of cinema are rather depressing. “It just feels like it's not a very interesting time,” he added. “I watch movies now, and I see very technically skilled films, but they are not doing anything to make my view of the world different.” That is certainly a thought to ponder. The director has lined up the likes of Johnny Depp, Adam Driver, Jeff Bridges, Jason Momoa and Tom Waits for his next project, Carnival at the End of Days, but financing is proving a challenge. Dive deeper.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


	James Gunn‘s take on Superman launched into cinemas this week and has received some interesting reactions from the critics. 


	In Deadline, Pete Hammond said Gunn had “loaded this flick with tons of action, some quite ludicrous, and takes his cues from any number of inspirations, including the past movies, TV shows, and particularly Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All Star Superman book that has informed much of his script.” 


	Overall, Hammond says Gunn's film “might be trying to do too much” and is “basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks.”

	“More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times Superman suffers from overload, much like Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3, where Rocket unfortunately got the Babe: Pig in the City treatment,” he wrote. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a largely negative review, The Guardian says the reboot is “encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all.” 


	In a damning conclusion, the paper wrote: “How many more superhero films in general, and Superman films in particular, do we need to see that all end with the same spectacular faux-apocalypse in the big city with CGI skyscrapers collapsing? They were fun at first … but the thrill is gone.” 


	Vanity Fair praises some of the film's performances, particularly Nicholas Hoult, who the magazine said “convincingly renders a petulant bully whose immense wealth and influence have, he presumes, given him power over his insecurities and inadequacies.” 

	











	The magazine says the film “makes many smart and unexpected choices” before its CGI-heavy ending. 


	NME said the film puts some “pep back in Clark Kent's pants” and concludes that the overall film is “solid rather than spectacular.”


	“Gunn's Guardians humour flashes here and there (but not enough), with nods to DC universe fictional band The Mighty Crabjoys and some crowd-pleasing cameos,” the magazine said. 


	Erik Kain in Forbes said the film was “painfully mediocre” and described Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor as “generic and forgettable as the rest of the film.” 


	“What a crushing disappointment,” the magazine's review ends. 


	Kevin Maher of The Times of London gave the film a similarly negative assessment in his review titled: “This migraine of a movie is superhero soup.”


	Although despite the two stars given to the film, Maher also states that there are “glimmers of intrigue, as well as quirks and curios” in the film. 


	“Rachel Brosnahan performs miracles with her threadbare Lois Lane, making you wish for more than the paltry scenes she's given with Corenswet (a serviceable turn),” Maher writes. “There's a handful of callbacks to the Reeve era, including the title font, as well as a belaboured running gag about office gofer Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) being irresistible to women.” 


	G. Allen Johnson at the San Francisco Chronicle was a lot less forgiving in his criticisms, writing: “Superman is a mess, but it's a colorful one. It's either a terrible superhero movie or an OK parody, take your pick.”


	Alison Willmore at New York Magazine praised the film's originality. Willmore wrote: “Instead of another origin story, it gives us sights we haven't yet seen — like Krypto bounding through the air after one of the many monkeys enlisted to rage-tweet from a Luthor-created pocket dimension. What a good, good boy.” 


	We reported this morning that Warner Bros has clocked $22.5M from previews of Superman. That figure would make the remake the best previews YTD and a record for James Gunn, as well as higher than the previews for Barbie ($22.3M) and Matt Reeves' The Batman ($21.6M, $134M opening).


Superman is currently on 82% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Not a pro critic and have only seen the trailers, will hold my full opinion, but that is a lot of bad CGI.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Murderbot ends on notes of melodrama and melancholy","https://www.avclub.com/murderbot-recap-season-1-episode-10-the-perimeter","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

In reviewing the first season of Apple TV+'s Murderbot, I've tried not to get too hung up on the show's many deviations from Martha Wells' Murderbot Diaries books. Partially, that's because the show is the show, regardless of whether you're familiar with Wells' breezy, allegory-rich little sci-fi stories, and partially because most of the changes are genuinely for the best. I might not have loved every moment of Leebeebee's presence, for instance, but she injected necessary energy into the narrative. Meanwhile, the decision to elevate Gurathin as a co-lead after he was just “the slightly more prickly one” in the books has been one of the best this adaptation could have made. (And one that pays off beautifully here, as we bid farewell to the series until that just-announced second season comes along.)

But “The Perimeter” also hinges on one of the biggest changes that showrunners Chris and Paul Weitz have made to Wells' story, and one that speaks to a certain insecurity that has been shot all through the series, as it's struggled at times to adopt a volume as slim as Wells' 2017 novella All Systems Red into 10 episodes of TV. Which is to say: Did this episode need a dramatic race against the clock to sell the horrors of our main character getting its mind erased and its body threatened with an acid bath, or could the show have trusted us to care without resorting to such obvious melodramatics?

We pick up with Murderbot strapped to a table in some dismal Corporation Rim tech lab, getting its memories erased (and its governor module re-activated) by a couple of standard-issue Company sadists/all-purpose dickheads. It's a deliberately jarring return after the construct's heroic sacrifice last week, as we literally watch a character we've seen slowly, tentatively accept their personhood get shoved back into the toolbox. The knee-jerk cruelty of the guys doing the reformat is one of a couple of looks we'll get at what living in the Corporation Rim does to people, building off the glimpses of the basic mindset from Leebeebee, and Gurathin's raging PTSD. (It's one of the weaknesses of “The Perimeter,” and maybe the season as a whole, that there's no time to give any of this more than the barest of attention; we know more about the mechanics of Pin-Lee, Arada, and Ratthi's throuple than we do about life in the CR.) The upshot is that Murderbot is, for all practical purposes, gone: Another malfunctioning piece of equipment that'll now be repurposed by a much larger, and far deadlier, machine.

It's a curious decision for the show's big finale. Although Noma Dumezweni and David Dastmalchian have done stellar work throughout the season, Murderbot has never been shy about being Alexander Skarsgård's show. His face (helmeted or otherwise) is its most iconic visual; his voice is very nearly its soundtrack. Losing Skarsgård for a large chunk of “The Perimeter”—as Murderbot, helmet intact and mind decidedly not, gets deployed to quell a brewing strike on the station, while the PresAux team tries to track it down and save it—is meant to make us feel the absence, and the silence of that reassuring tide of snark. But it also sucks some energy out of the episode, even as it's trying to keep us gripped with scenes of infuriating bureaucracy and corporate espionage.

As with last week's episode, Dumezweni winds up getting a bit short-changed by all this Plot Stuff, as Mensah gets little more to do than throw her steely weight around as Preservation Alliance attempts to secure Murderbot's freedom from a crew of convincingly horrible Company stooges. (They're desperate to not let the story of what happened on the planet get out—but also so incapable of thinking of SecUnits as people that they seem genuinely baffled by Mensah's insistence on getting “her” unit back.) As “Madame President” brings the (asinine, but useful) attention of the Corporation Rim press to bear on the topic, Gurathin gets furtive, making contact with his old drug dealer in order to get access to the Company archives. This works as a metaphor: Gura, who's always been Murderbot's shadow self, puts himself in harm's way to pull the construct's personhood back down through the wires. But this whole little subplot, and most especially the bit where Pin-Lee runs in to deliver an injunction to save MB's body, seconds before its feet were about to get Snidely Whiplashed into a big vat of acid, feels like exactly what it is: A manufactured conflict to give this episode a bit of extra action and drama. 

The restoration of Murderbot's memories, especially, is so easy as to be nearly laughable. The episode toys with the idea that Gurathin might be doing himself some damage by taking on all that data, but no: It is just a plug-and-play resurrection. (They don't even have to re-hack the new governor module, apparently.) Not all of this is filler, though. The scene of Murderbot being deployed against the strikers on the station is genuinely horrifying, as we watch it be reduced back into nothing more than a mindless weapon. (One that can't bring itself to fight; it may not be able to retain memories of the PresAux crew, but its body is still clearly keeping the score of the massacre of the miners that's been haunting it all season.) As we watch it be swallowed up in a tide of people who can only see it as the faceless face of oppression—unaware that it's just as much a victim as they are—the episode comes as close as it's going to get to capturing the full tragedy of Corporation Rim existence: “Interchangeable” cogs getting smashed against each other, with no sense of dignity, respect, or free will.

It's that sequence, for me, that helps sell the conclusion here. Mensah and the rest of PresAux mean well, of course. When they dismiss the resurrected Murderbot's requests for its armor, it's because they don't want it to need it; when Mensah informs the construct that she'll legally be its guardian when they bring it home to Preservation Alliance, it's intended with love. But it is, still, a curtailing of free will, one that comes part and parcel with any reliance on others, or assimilation into a community. And Murderbot has just had the need to own its free will underlined in triplicate. Gurathin gives it the best sell—and it would have to be Gurathin; the episode is so clearly aching for one last Skarsgård/Dastmalchian collaboration that there's a palpable sense of relief when it's Gura who comes stepping out of the shadows as Murderbot prepares to disappear out into the galaxy at large. The warmth in this ensuing scene is beautiful, both actors moving mountains with half-smiles and quiet implications. These two characters have spent the entire season bristling at all the ways they fall in parallel; seeing Gurathin grasp that connection for what it is, to say “I did it, and so can you,” is genuinely heartwarming. And so, in its way, is his quiet, solemn yielding when Murderbot tells him it “needs to check the perimeter,” Skarsgård, stripped of all armor and artifice, nakedly emoting in a way this show has rarely let him. This has, with all due respect to Dumezweni and Mensah, been the show's most riveting, fascinating relationship: It's fitting that it's Gurathin who receives the closest thing MB can deliver to a “goodbye,” as it seeks to find out who it is, before it can accept the burdens and beauties of “home.”

And so we depart Murderbot on a melancholy, but hopeful note: One construct, a head full of bad TV shows, and a whole galaxy at its disposal. Before the renewal notice came in on Thursday, I'd ended my earlier draft of this review by noting that, “If this is all we end up getting of the series, I'll be sad, but ultimately satisfied with what we got.” I stand by that thought, even as I'm hopeful for what comes next. This show was often frustrating, sometimes extremely frustrating, as it struggled to define its tone, wrestled with its bizarre “half-hour drama” format, and frequently couldn't tell how dumb or dopey its supporting characters were supposed to be. But a trio of core performances refused to ever let it be simply worth dismissing, and its exploration of its fundamental ideas—of personhood, connection, and the ways we build a workable self out of everything we see, do, and watch—managed to weather those rockier moments intact. There was, and remains, a genuinely good TV show here, buried under a protective skin of sarcasm and goofiness. I'm excited to see where it goes from here; the sky very much seems to be the limit.

[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers from Poker Face's season-two finale.]

Patti Harrison isn't afraid to dial up the humor (as you will find out towards the end of this interview). If her performance in various I Think You Should Leave sketches is any indication, she thrives on playing ludicrous, over-the-top people (seen also in Hulu's Shrill). Now, as she did in 2021's Together, Together, Harrison takes an interesting swerve on Poker Face with her performance as an unassuming woman. Harrison makes her season two debut in “A New Lease On Death” as Alex, who quickly befriends bullshit detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne). It makes sense because Alex hates dishonesty. “If you ask me a question and I lie, who are you having a conversation with? Nobody,” she smoothly tells her new pal at one point. 

The actor's convincingly bashful performance comes to a halt in the finale. Halfway through “The End Of The Road,” Alex reveals herself as a ruthless assassin who tricked Charlie into taking her to a target in Indiana. Not only that, she also tries to drive them both off a cliff to an early grave. This is devastating for Charlie, who's left friendless once more. Instead, she gains a sociopathic nemesis who is well and truly obsessed with her, Moriarty-style. (Alex went as far as controlling her breathing technique so she wouldn't be caught in a lie, now that's commitment.) 

The A.V. Club spoke to Harrison about what made this role particularly challenging, her tricks for playing a nefarious villain, and, as the conversation winds down, she displays those aforementioned comical skills in her answers. 

The A.V. Club: How did you feel about taking Alex from an amusing sidekick to this evil big bad? What did you want to achieve with this switch as an actor primarily known for comedy? 

Patti Harrison: I talked to the team about how to differentiate between the two a lot. I knew the twist beforehand, but I love to imagine what the experience would've been like on day 11 of playing this character if they said to me that she goes from telling Charlie “Oh, here's a coffee” to “Sit in the chair, bitch” and “I'm going to drive you off a cliff.” Hopefully, watching [the reveal] is like a surprise party, and you feel the same chemical reaction happening in your brain. When they filled me in on the details, it truly was the most excited I've ever been for a role because I've always wanted to do an action movie, stunts, combat stuff, and use weapons. I've never really gotten that opportunity because I'm a comedian, and that makes complete sense. Coming into it with this story, we had a lot of meetings. [Season two showrunner] Tony Tost, who is an angel, really helped to guide me tonally. 

I love Poker Face‘s comedy, but I didn't want to dishonor the stakes that were being built by this moment when the turn happens. I wanted it to feel evil in the sense that, when all is said and done, Charlie is a deeply wounded and traumatized person with no sense of security in her life. The show is about resilience and resourcefulness in the face of her loneliness, considering she's subjected to people who are trying to kill her. I wanted this moment to feel like a death knell of “Oh my gosh, I can't trust anybody.” Imagine what would happen to her brain after that. I didn't want it to feel silly, yet all of us were determined to keep Alex as an interesting, fun character. Tony, Natasha, and everyone were constantly checking in with me to see how I was doing. We were also having in-depth conversations about what my voice would be like in the finale and how it would juxtapose against how Alex talked. 

AVC: What were those conversations like about modifying your voice? Was it daunting as a performer to navigate these specific qualities of the character? 

PH: Well, as you can hear from my actual speaking voice, it's pretty low, kind of chainsaw, cigar smoker-esque, and it's not that I smoke. I have asthma. I think my voice is just scratchy because in my teens and my early twenties, I wanted to be in a metal band. I would make scream songs on GarageBand, and it shredded my vocal cords, and no one ever heard them. But it gives me this “sexy woman in her 90s” voice, which is different than Alex's voice, as you can also hear. She's sincere. When I thought of what would be impactful for Charlie, Alex felt like a super earnest character.  She has an almost infantilized level of sweetness. So I based part of that on one of my college friends whom I met during improv. Her name is Emily, and to this day, she is the most earnest person I've met in my life. 

I come from a pretty sarcastic family that uses dark humor to cope with stuff. I guess I can't speak for all of us, but for me, my humor when I entered college became irony-poisoned, and Emily was so open about what she was feeling. She was always going like, “Awww,” and you could hear it in her voice when she was happy. Being around her helped me become more gentle. So I thought, for me, it would be the most painful to find out that she was the person using me. I was also trying to strain my neck so the voice is dance-y and to get a ribbon-like intonation. My acting coach throughout the process, Michael Warner, was constantly there to help and make it feel fun and real for the story. God bless that man. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson needs to get that stripped from him, and it needs to go to Michael “The Rock” Warner for all the help he gave me to figure out the two different voices. 

AVC: Since you have only the last 20 minutes or so of the finale to sell the switch, does it help knowing the weird details of your character's backstory, like how she supposedly wrestled a polar bear and walked 100 miles in the snow?

PH: Totally. It helps me take the performance where I need it to go because the details of her life are so absurd. The things that she's done, there is a version of it that we could have done, where it's very silly and caricature-like of a catty assassin. But in learning about how extreme her backstory is, it makes me oddly ground her and add naturalism. I mean, I wouldn't say that for me it's a naturalistic performance. I was definitely having fun with the creative liberties I got, but there was a lot of attention towards how to bring these aspects of her to life without tipping over into caricature, and how we honor the betrayal emotionally. Natasha is giving an incredible performance. She has to do so much emotional lifting in those final beats where her character is being traumatized in real time. I didn't want it to then cut to me, and I'm just like all “Ha ha, I'm goofy and silly and crazy and I might kill you.” So it was cool to find a bridge between the backstory and the presence this character has on camera in this moment. 



Even the incredible costume department was helpful with that, and the fittings were a lot of fun. I got to try the craziest shit, like all the snow outfits we put on were so fucking cool. That black outfit, in particular, was great. Up until that point, I'd been wearing girl dinner universe clothes, if that makes sense. So to get to wear a knife holster on my arm and feel the weight of that, wear the driving gloves and fucking Louboutin combat boots made me want to do a flip, wrap my legs around someone's head, and then flip backwards and slam their head on the ground. 

AVC: In an alternate universe, would you have liked to continue playing Alex as Charlie's friend and gotten the chance to develop that character and dynamic? 

PH: It would've been nice. And it would've been nice for Charlie to just have a friend, and I think she'll have one someday who can give her the comfort and safety that she deserves. I think even if she stayed friends with Alex, who didn't turn out to be evil, she would have inevitably, kind of accidentally gotten her to sign up for a weird pyramid scheme or something where they would lose all their money. I think she would be in a life of pain in a different way with Alex, and would be annoyed to death. 

AVC: Now that you've tried your hand at playing a sociopath, do you have definitive tips and tricks for getting it right as a performer? 

PH: [Laughs] I would just say to act like who you are on the inside and not who you are when you're saying hi to your friends, talking on the phone with your family, or talking to your partner. Be the person who, when you're standing on a platform waiting for the train or in a grocery store, when someone gets in front of you in line, there's that voice saying “Bury him” or something. Listen to those voices.

AVC: The comparison to Moriarty is inevitable because he was obsessed with Sherlock in a way your character is with Charlie. Was that an inspiration for you, or did you go back to watch any Columbo episodes with memorable villains? 

PH: I don't know what the hell that is. [Laughs]. They told me I was going to be like Moriarty, and I was like, “Who the fuck is that? I don't give a shit.” They were like, “You don't know Sherlock Holmes? We are setting you up to go from Watson to Moriarty.” We got in a huge fight about it that day. I remember I had to wear a brace on my wrist because Tony picked me up and threw me through my trailer window, and then I came through the other green room trailer, the makeup trailer, and then just got in a huge fight with everyone there. Yeah, it was a rough day.

AVC: Now that sounds like it would make a good movie.

PH: True, but some things are personal. We live in a society that teaches us to capitalize on every story, and some of these stories are just for us and our friends who experience them, and I think that's a beautiful thing.

AVC: Have you talked to Rian Johnson about returning for season three as Charlie's ultimate nemesis since your character survived that car crash? 

PH: You know, I can't say because as I'm talking to you right now, there is a representative from Peacock who has an anti-tank rifle pointed at me and there's a red dot laser right at my throat, which is such a strange, painful place to do it if you're going to kill me. But don't worry, I won't say anything. All I can say is you'll have to keep an eye out in the future.

AVC: Well, now you know how Charlie feels.

PH: [Laughs] Exactly, yeah, I'm feeling empathy and I hate it. I'm getting a perspective of how other people feel, which is not making me feel great.

If almost every And Just Like That… character must be forced under one roof, Charlotte's birthday party is a far more believable conceit than last week's funeral for Lisa Todd Wexley's father. (RIP to the man, who may or may not have died twice, but no one besides Charlotte knew him or is close to LTW to attend.) This is still AJLT… we're talking about, where it feels like the writers skipped huge chunks of Sex And The City entirely. So they expect us to forget that an episode in the original's fifth season already established that Charlotte's big day is actually in January. In “Luck Be A Lady,” she's nervous about turning 36 when the gang goes out to Atlantic City at Carrie's insistence. 

Anyway, forget that fun fact now because in “Just Wanna Have Fun,” Carrie throws her pal a get-together on a decidedly non-winter day in her spacious apartment. Sorry, Miranda, your new home isn't big enough for the shindig. Carrie plans to distract Char with a chic party so that she gets a break from thinking about Harry's prostate cancer diagnosis. She also invites her hot gardener, whom she barely knows, to the event. Look, I'm not complaining about more Logan Marshall-Green or his character's excellent flirting scenes with Seema; in fact, that's a very welcome sight. But AJLT… continues to expect us to suspend logic at basically every turn. At this point, we'd best give in. 

That's the only way to process the dynamic between Carrie and Gianna (guest star Patti LuPone) in this episode. Before any talk of Charlotte's party even comes up, the three women are gabbing at their new favorite hangout, Anthony's cafe/bread store. And that's where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte meet Giuseppe's mother, who is visiting from Rome. Anthony obviously wants to make a strong first impression on his boyfriend's mom (Spoiler alert: He does not). Carrie, however, forms an instant connection with her by proclaiming, “We love your son.” Wait, what? Carrie and Giuseppe have barely shared scenes together, but sure, let's go with this heartfelt declaration. 

AJLT… just needed a way to put Sarah Jessica Parker and LuPone—two New York City legends—in a scene together. So when Gia invites Carrie for a meal, much to Anthony's chagrin, who are we to complain? Gia also shares her romantic past with her new friend: She was 21 when she met her lover, who was 50 at the time. Gia later stopped her work as an artist and started studying Freudian theory to better understand her stepchildren, who still don't like her. If, like me, you were also sighing out loud and wondering why in the world we are hearing about Giuseppe's parents, there's a really on-the-nose connection. After all, Carrie is also having problems integrating with Aidan's family, particularly troubled teen Wyatt. Gia's advice to Carrie is to be herself, as if our girl knows any other way. “Inauthentic beings never win,” Gia adds, in a dialogue that feels ironical when spoken out loud on a show like And Just Like That….

Let's circle back to this birthday party, though. The long list of attendees includes Harry, a surprisingly attentive Rock, a reluctant Lily who has just been dumped, Miranda, Brady, Joy, the Wexleys, Char's co-workers, Bitsy Von Muffling, Anthony, Giuseppe, Gia, Seema, hot gardener Adam, Carrie's downstairs neighbor, Duncan, and a bunch of other randos to fill the balloon-infested room. With everyone gathered under Carrie's sparkling Gramercy roof, tensions are bound to rise, right? And it all happens with background music courtesy of a fancy karaoke machine Miranda brings. (LTW's son hogs it for the most part, and Miranda's efforts to get her gal pals up for a round of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” are a bust. Did she really think Carrie as she is now would come up and join her?) 

Cringeworthy as this installment may be, AJLT… infuses a few genuinely heartfelt moments that undercut the silliness and continuity errors. Take, for instance, Harry finally admitting to LTW, Miranda, and Carrie about his health issues and upcoming surgery. He can't stand to see his wife dealing with the agony alone (especially when he has a personal shopper he's already confessed to in a scene that's so random, I'd rather not dwell on it). He is the absolute best man in the SATC universe, as seen also when he agrees with Charlotte that her dog dying of cancer instead would be “almost worse” for her. I will not forgive the powers-that-be if they kill him off. I'm glad Charlotte's birthday is mostly drama-free for her, no thanks to Lily. Even Seema has a good night with Adam full of intense banter. Best of all, he serenades her on that karaoke machine with “Bette Davis Eyes.” Sarita Choudhury and Green share some sizzling chemistry, so let's hope AJLT… bothers to flesh their relationship further. Seema's plot needs to stop revolving around how she's broke. It's unbelievable that, as a longtime real estate agent, she has no savings and can't afford to take an Uber ride to her preferred salon. Let's not fly so far off the ground, writers. 

While all this takes place in her house, Carrie spends time bonding with Duncan. Remember when the two didn't get along because she wouldn't even remove her heels? Well, those episode five days are long gone. Now, they're sharing scotch from the same glass, doing light arm touches, and exchanging drafts of their novels. He can't stop gushing over the 1846-set period novel she's writing. We've heard snippets of it in her voiceovers, so we know it really isn't all that he's making it out to be. Clearly, Duncan is poised to be a love interest and a potential dilemma for Carrie and Aidan. Personally, I think it works. 

Carrie's wishy washy bond with Aidan has been particularly frustrating to watch in season three. She was more bothered by Miranda pointing out her vibe with  Duncan than she was last week, when Aidan confessed he cheated on her with Kathy. Carrie's sooo upset by Miranda's implication about Duncan because she already has a boyfriend with whom she shares 20 years of history. But wasn't she just telling Aidan that he shouldn't have expected her not to sleep with anyone else? What in the world is going on with her? Carrie needs a reality check right now, and Miranda is usually the one to give it to her. So this scene in the kitchen between them was actually lovely to witness. It reminded me of how Miranda would warn her about getting close to Big in SATC. Carrie needs to pay attention to her own words from the novel: “The woman wondered what she had gotten herself into,” a line that stopped Duncan in his tracks when he read it. A crush will make you say and feel the craziest things, huh? 

“Just Wanna Have Fun” is a marginal improvement for season three, primarily because the mostly contained setting allows for simmering feelings to bubble to the surface and, hey, no Aidan appearance is a win. And yet, plot-wise, it frustratingly makes a dent in the overarching arc, so let's hope the remaining five episodes offer more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Peter Jackson says he's not retired, just very focused on giant bird","https://www.avclub.com/peter-jackson-not-retired-giant-bird","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:30:00 GMT","

It's been 11 years since Peter Jackson last directed a non-documentary film, and seven since he last wrote one. (The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies and Mortal Engines, respectively; shout-out to anyone who knew that second one, because we're guessing you're the last person you know who still remembers the Mortal Engines movie.) That decade-plus might seem like big a number, in the course of Hollywood careers that typically run for 50 or 60 years. But perhaps, we suggest, a little perspective is in order. Let's compare that (largely Beatles-focused) span of time to a much larger sum. Like, say, 600 years—how long the New Zealand giant moa has been extinct—or 300 or 400, i.e., the number of the dead birds' bones that Peter Jackson apparently owns, spends his time amassing more of, and is now embarking on genetic experimentation upon.

We got to thinking about Peter Jackson's massive collection of big-ass bird bones courtesy of a very weird interview he gave to ScreenRant this week. In said conversation, Jackson took a little time to deny that he was retired from making movies, noting that he's working on three different film scripts at the moment, including the one for Andy Serkis' upcoming Lord Of The Rings return project, The Hunt For Gollum. It's just that he's been a little distracted by all these bird bones, and his deep-seated, extremely expensive desire to use them to bring the moa back to life.

This is, wouldn't you know it, all about Colossal Biosciences, the company that made headlines a few months back when it announced that it had “recreated” some long-extinct direwolves, complete with a vote of support from No. 1 direwolf publicist George R.R. Martin. Jackson, as it turns out, is a “major” investor in the company, which he and wife Fran Walsh tossed money at with the stipulation that they switch at least some of their focus to these very large, very extinct birds that he's apparently obsessed with. (Brief educational parenthetical: The moa was a large flightless bird native to New Zealand, and does, to be fair to the man, sound exactly like the sort of shit Peter Jackson would be into—with some reportedly standing more than 2 meters tall.)

Jackson had already been collecting bones from the animal out of simple hobbyist interest, as one does when one is embarking on a new career as an eccentric billionaire. More recently, he's been focused on working with Colossal to try to use those bones to extract the genome for the nine known species of the animal. (It's apparently pretty tough: Even Peter Jackson, who owns more moa bones than anybody we know, apparently only had 25 viable specimens in his whole collection!) As with the wolves, Colossal intends to use the genome to alter the DNA of existing animals to adopt more “moa” traits, with an eye toward creating a moa-ish animal that can then be bred. So, yeah: There's your answer the next time someone asks you “Hey, what's Peter Jackson been up to for the last decade?” Dead Bird Jurassic Park (and also writing a script for that Andy Serkis movie, of course).

The arrival of James Gunn's Superman in theaters this weekend has put a lot of focus on the many, and frequently troubled, attempts Warner Bros. has made over the decades to leverage the character in film. That includes a new Wall Street Journal piece tracking Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav's attempts to course-correct the company's whole superhero franchise around the time the DCEU was falling apart—a process that included fielding big pitches from Dwayne Johnson and, apparently, dismissing a high-profile script from Ta-Naheisi Coates that would have centered on a Black Superman on the grounds of it being “too woke.”

Coates' script dates back to 2021, when it was announced that he'd be writing the project under the auspices of producer J.J. Abrams. (Which probably didn't help it pass muster with Zaslav, in hindsight; the studio head has not been shy about letting it be known he's not especially happy with how little he feels the studio has gotten out of its very expensive overall deal with Abrams' Bad Robot.) In addition to his work as an author and essayist, Coates is well-known for his work writing comics, having penned a critically acclaimed run on Black Panther in the 2010s. His Superman would have been, per comments made at the time, his attempt at “meaningfully adding to the legacy of America's most iconic mythic hero.” Details about the script are hard to come by—the Wall Street Journal piece runs with the idea that it would have been a period piece set during the civil rights movement—but Coates was, per a THR piece, expected to turn it in some time late in 2021, with Warner Bros. hunting around for a Black director and star to team up on the film.

Which runs the timeline smack into April 2022, when Zaslav took over leadership of the just-merged Warner Bros. Discovery, and started quickly looking around for a lifeboat to rescue the company's floundering superhero fortunes. At which point, per the WSJ, “He dismissed as too woke a script being written by Ta-Nehisi Coates about a Black Superman in the civil rights era, according to people familiar with the matter.” For a minute, Zaslav apparently flirted with giving Dwayne Johnson more creative control over the universe, which is presumably how we got that incredibly awkward Henry Cavill cameo in Black Adam—conversations that ended pretty much the minute the box office returns for the movie came in. (News that Gunn and Peter Safran would be taking over sole control over all WBD superhero production arrived literally four days after the film's premiere.)

Interestingly, Gunn has been asked about the Coates script in the past, noting that, while he hadn't read it—as of May 2023—he could imagine it existing as an out-of-continuity “Elseworlds” movie. (Like the Joker films, or Matt Reeves' The Batman movies.) The Wall Street Journal article notes that the same sources who say Zaslav dismissed the concept said it was still possible Coates' film might someday see the light of day under Gunn and Safran's leadership.

Some surprising news out of one of the year's hottest new shows today, as TVLine has confirmed that Tracy Ifeachor will not be returning for the second season of HBO Max medical drama The Pitt. Ifeachor, who starred as Dr. Heather Collins in the show's first season, posted on social media this week about “what a blessing” it was “to be a part of this first and foundational season” of the show, possibly alluding—in hindsight—to not being part of a second, presumably less-foundational follow-up.

Ifeachor already had a slightly weird run on the series, which covers, one hour per episode, an extremely eventful day in the life of a Pittsburgh emergency room. She's main cast, bordering on a co-protagonist, for much of the show's first season, culminating in an emotional conversation with Noah Wyle's Dr. Robby—which ends with him allowing her to go home, right before one more huge crisis breaks out. As such, Ifeachor is absent from the last four episodes of the season—with Wyle noting, in interviews about the series, that her removal was part of a deliberate effort to strip his character of his most trusted support systems. (Now said support systems can apparently be considered even more thoroughly, and permanently, stripped, we guess.)

Hospitals do, of course, have large amounts of turnover—and if there was ever an E.R. that seemed primed to burn people out, The Pitt's would be a strong contender. But it's still somewhat surprising to see Ifeachor not coming back, when she had so much of the focus of, and was such a strong dramatic anchor for, that critically heralded original season.

It's not clear, outside Wyle, how much of the rest of the show's cast will be returning for its second season. (We would have assumed “most,” before today, but, uh…) Casting notices for new characters have begun to roll out, though, including news that Sepideh Moafi will be joining the show as a series regular when it returns, likely some time next year.

Joanna Gaines is preparing for another one of her kids to leave the nest, but admits this one might be more emotional for her. Find out how the former HGTV star feels about daughter Ella leaving for college compared to when son Drake left home.

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

In a July 2025 interview with People for their special edition “Chip & Joanna Gaines: Their Next Chapter,” the couple discussed their children leaving home.

“Ella, our second kiddo, she's graduating this year, so we're going through that again with another kid leaving the nest and trying to stay emotionally stable,” Joanna shared.

Chip Gaines asked her, “Do you think this is going to be harder [than with Drake?].”

Joanna noted that it will be harder for her, explaining, “I think there's an emotional difference.”

She continued, “With Ella, we love to go to antiques shops, plant shops and go get coffee — that's our rhythm. I kind of feel like I'm losing a friend in my everyday life.”

Joanna added, “It feels like what's coming this summer will be a tidal wave of emotions, and I am not going to brace; I'm going to stand there and take it with him.”

It's an exciting time for their daughter, who is looking forward to going to college and finding her own path.

“She's excited about going somewhere and just being known for her,” Joanna said. “She's like, ‘I don't want anyone knowing that you're … I just want to go and be myself.'”

She added, “I'm excited for her to learn. She's about to see some stuff. She's going to teach us stuff.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

Joanna also told People how the whole family is exploring intentional time together outside of their lives at home.

“Truth is, we're all homebodies,” she said. “But as our kids get older, I've learned what a gift it is to get away and have that intentional time as a family.”

Joanna explained, “Being present is what we're after — so we limit phones, pick a few games or hikes that everyone is excited about, eat together for every meal and toss the schedule out the window.”

The Magnolia empire owners also focus on normalcy for their kids, but that's not always easy.

“They're so young and we want to give them the chance to have a normal childhood,” Joanna explained. “When we wake up in the morning, I think we're normal. But then you go to Target and it's definitely different. We're both in awe.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Bargain Block' Star Says He Looks Forward to HGTV Show Ending","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/keith-bynum-ready-for-bargain-block-end/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:08:03 GMT","

After recovering from the shock of his home renovation show “Bargain Block” not getting renewed for a fifth season by HGTV, Keith Bynum says he now looks forward to the final episode airing — likely in early September. 

The Detroit-based artist and restoration expert, who stars on the series with his longtime partner Evan Thomas and local real estate maven Shea Hicks-Whitfield, shared that surprising tidbit while answering fans' questions in his Instagram Stories on July 10, 2025. 

When one fan asked him to name something he's looking forward to in 2025, Bynum replied, “This is kind of strange, but one thing I'm really looking forward to is the last episode of ‘Bargain Block' airing. It'll be a lot of emotions that day, but it'll also be officially the turn of a new page. And I think Evan and me and Shea are ready for it. But the next page is going to be quite fun.”

On June 17, Keith Bynum shared in his Instagram Stories that “Bargain Block” had been discontinued after four seasons, noting that although HGTV had renewed it for a fifth season in December, executives changed their mind in February.

Bynum noted that there were still four episodes left of season four remaining, and that HGTV planned to start airing them on Thomas' birthday, which is August 20, but that the change in direction “threw us into a bit of a crazy financial tailspin and the last three, four months, we've been trying to just figure it out. So we're doing client work and got some other stuff going on, but it's been — oh, man, it's been wild.” 

The “Bargain Block” team has had more time than their fans to come to grips with the news, and many peppered Bynum with questions about their future in his Instagram Stories on July 10. 

When someone wrote, “Tell us we will see you on TV somewhere,” Bynum rolled his eyes playfully and replied, “Y'all will, don't worry, don't worry!” 

Since Bynum was posting from a client project in Georgia and they've done additional renovations in New Orleans, someone wrote, “I keep worrying yall are leaving Detroit. Are yall staying?” 

Bynum replied in his Stories, “I get this question a lot, too. We ain't leaving Detroit. I've said this many times, but we're not going anywhere. We're expanding our business there, love it there, Michigan. And New Orleans. But, not leaving Detroit.” 

A post shared by Keith Bynum (@keithbynum_)

Since Bynum posted the news in mid-June about “Bargain Block” not returning for a fifth season, stars from four additional shows have also come forward to share that their shows have not been renewed either. 

On June 23, longtime HGTV contractor Izzy Battres informed fans in the comment section of one of his posts that his new series, “Izzy Does It,” was not renewed for a second season. 

The next day, on June 24, married couple Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson announced that they'd returned from vacation to learn that their show, “Married to Real Estate,” had not been renewed for a fourth season.

Then, late on June 25, New Kids on the Block member Jonathan Knight disclosed via social media that the network also decided not to renew his show, “Farmhouse Fixer” for a fourth season.

The fifth show not renewed by HGTV is “Battle on the Beach,” which Alison Victoria revealed on the July 1 episode of her “Pap Smear Podcast” while chatting with her “Ugliest House in America” co-star Retta. Victoria co-starred with Ty Pennington and Taniya Nayak on “Battle on the Beach” for four seasons, but said HGTV decided not to bring it back in 2025 for a fifth season.

Tamra Judge recently appeared on “Watch What Happens Live” along with her husband, Eddie Judge. While on the show, Tamra opened up about season 19 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” and also gave an update on Teddi Mellencamp amid her cancer battle. 

When asked about Teddi, Tamra said, “Teddi is the strongest person I know. She's dealing with a lot. She's really fighting for her life.” She continued, “I love her so much, and I think she's going to beat it. I think her strong mind and her positive attitude will beat it, and she inspires me.”

An update on Teddi Mellencamp's fight with stage 4 brain cancer #RHOC #WWHL 

Andy Cohen mentioned the success Teddi Mellencamp has had with the use of immunotherapy. This prompted the “Real Housewives of Orange County” star to say, “Her doctor told her she's like the one percent where the immunotherapy is actually helping to shrink the tumors.”

Tamra went on, “I just want her better, and I just love her so much.”

Andy Cohen also asked Tamra Judge about her relationship with therapy and if she's still attending sessions. Notably, she has been open about her mental health journey in the recent past. In response to the question, Tamra said, “I am.”

Regarding how it's going, she revealed, “I wanna say great, but it's a process.” Andy then asked, “How's your anger issues?” To which she said, “Great.” Eddie Judge then joked that they were still present. 

Notably, this comes after Tamra Judge almost quit “The Real Housewives of Orange County” as they were filming the show's 19th season. Luckily for her fans, she soon returned to filming. 

Season 19 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” premiered on July 10 on Bravo. One of the more emotional parts of the episode came when Tamra Judge opened up to her therapist in a session. 

According to US Weekly, she began in the session, “I'm so afraid that if I get close to people, they'll turn on me, so I just keep a wall up so I don't get too close. I have very few people that I can really talk to. … I just don't want to lash out when I'm mad, even if someone's done me wrong. I want to fix things.”

She then discussed her reason for attending therapy in a confessional scene. Tamra shared, “I realized that you have to dig up those things that are buried deep inside of you because those are the things that come out when you get angry. The custody battle that my ex put me through, my daughter leaving me, my dad leaving us … it's hard and I never really wanted to do it and here I am.”

“The Real Housewives of Orange County” airs on Thursday nights.

Country star and former “American Idol” winner Scotty McCreery is coming to grips with a doubly difficult loss, sharing with fans on July 10, 2025, that both of his grandmas had died the previous day. 

“My heart is absolutely broken,” McCreery captioned a photo from his 2018 wedding to wife Gabi Dugal, flanked by each of his grandmothers. “Yesterday, both my Grandma Janet and my Grandma Paquita passed away. I think I am still in a bit of shock as I type this, but I'm choosing to remember the great memories we all made with both of them.” 

Fans and famous friends flooded McCreery's late-night post with condolences and sympathy, and his mom confirmed that her mother and mother-in-law had passed hours apart, noting that losing them both so quickly was “hard to fathom.”

A post shared by Scotty McCreery (@scottymccreery)

McCreery's paternal Grandma Paquita was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where she met her future husband, McCreery's grandpa, when he was stationed there in the U.S. Air Force, according to The Boot. They married and raised their family in North Carolina, which is where their only grandson grew up, too, and later won “American Idol” in 2011. 

McCreery recalled in his July 10 post some of the memories he cherished of his grandmothers, writing, “There really are too many to count. From being on the farm in Elizabeth City or visiting the Outer Banks with Grandma Janet.. And then the incredible memories we made at the backyard pool in Pinehurst, all the way to visiting Puerto Rico with Grandma Paquita.” 

“Both of them truly taught me what love is all about,” the country star wrote. “I will miss them dearly. If yall could keep my family in your prayers I'd appreciate it.”

McCreery's mom Judy shared a Facebook post on July 10 confirming her mother and mother-in-law's deaths, writing, “Here is a post I hoped I wouldn't be making for several years. My precious mom, age 85, passed away yesterday at WakeMed, shortly after 1pm. She had been battling norovirus & the flu, which led to dehydration and pneumonia. My heart is broken. I have to accept it was her time.”

She then continued, “This is hard to fathom, but we also lost Mike's mom, Paquita, yesterday, a few hours later at 4pm. She was 93 and had been in declining health. We will celebrate my mom's life in her hometown next Monday. Paquita's services are still pending. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.”

A post shared by Scotty McCreery (@scottymccreery)

Fans and friends flooded McCreery's post with supportive messages, including several of his fellow “American Idol” contestants from season 10 in 2011. 

Country star Lauren Alaina, with whom he became close friends on “American Idol” and was his runner-up, left a comment that hundreds of fans liked, which said, “Sending so much love and prayer your way.”

Hailey Reinhart, another success story who emerged from season 10, wrote, “Sending love to you & your families, Scotty 💓”

Season 10 finalist James Durbin chimed in, “All of my love to you and your family, Scotty. That's heartbreaking”

Fans were stunned by McCreery's double loss, including one who wrote, “I'm heartbroken for you and your families…. I have no words for losing both grandmothers in one day. Sending lots of prayers and hugs. 🙏🏻”

Another wrote, “Oh my gosh so sorry losing both Grandma's on the same day is just unbelievable. 🙏🙏”

McCreery, who's been on tour in Great Britain, was scheduled to perform in Fort Loramie, Ohio, on July 10 and Manchester, Iowa, on July 11. One who attended his July 10 concert wrote on his Instagram post, “Your concert was amazing tonight and a good memorial to your grandmas! 💕💕”

Kelly Clarkson may have one of the most popular daytime talk shows in the U.S., but great ratings and Emmy Awards may not be enough to keep the first-ever “American Idol” winner happy behind the scenes. Rumors have swirled for months that Clarkson has wanted to spend more time with her kids, and that “insanely complicated” personal matters have been impacting her stress levels. 

After months of rumors that Clarkson has been unhappy at “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” an insider told People on July 10, 2025, that she is seriously considering making changes when her contract ends after the show's seventh season, which premieres in the fall. 

The news came just hours after Clarkson and her team received eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Daytime Talk Series and Outstanding Daytime Talk Series Host, per Billboard. 

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

“The Kelly Clarkson Show” launched in 2019, but production moved from Los Angeles to New York in 2023 after Clarkson's bitter divorce from Brendan Blackstock was finalized. The change came after Clarkson decided it was best for her and the former couple's two kids — Remington “Remy” Alexander, now nine, and daughter River Rose, 10 — to have a fresh start somewhere new. 

The inside source who spoke with People said, “After her divorce, she wanted to focus on balance and not burnout.”

However, the source continued, “Daytime TV is still demanding. She's thinking that she might need a shift next year when her contract is up. She still has time to figure out what's best for her career and family. She was never one to rush into things.”

During the sixth season of her talk show, there was widespread speculation about Clarkson after she missed two weeks of episodes in March without explanation, requiring other celebrities to fill in for her at the last minute. 

In addition to pulling her away from quality time with her kids, her talk show schedule has made it hard to tour and create new music, although she did release the new single “Where Have You Been” in the spring of 2025. 

At an Atlantic City, New Jersey, concert in May, Page Six reported that Clarkson told the audience, “We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job.”

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

Although Clarkson may be frustrated behind the scenes, Emmy voters clearly can't tell, because they just gave her and her team eight Daytime Emmy nominations, announced on July 10. 

According to People, “The Kelly Clarkson Show” has won 22 Emmys since it launched in 2019, per People, including three for Clarkson as a host. 

Clarkson has some tough competition in the category, including against another “American Idol” alum — season three powerhouse finalist Jennifer Hudson, whose talk show was nominated for three awards, including for Outstanding Talk Series and Host. Other hosts nominated in 2025 are Jenna Bush Hager and Hoda Kotb, Drew Barrymore, and Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos.

Stellan Skarsgård Saying the Director ‘Cried When Hitler Died' Reopens the Issue","https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/ingmar-bergman-nazi-supporter-explainer-stellan-skarsgard-1235137955/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Few actors today can toggle between massive blockbusters, like “Dune,” and small-scale auteurist works, such as Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” with the ease of Stellan Skarsgård. And few are quite as candid when they open up.

As reported by Variety from the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, where the actor was promoting “Sentimental Value” and on hand for a tribute, Skarsgård made some startling comments about Ingmar Bergman, whom the Swedish actor worked for on a 1986 stage production of August Strindberg's “A Dream Play.”

The actor talked about his personal dislike of Bergman, whom he found to be tyrannical and manipulative. Skarsgård links Bergman's attitude as a director to the fact that Bergman was a Nazi supporter during World War II. This may be new information to more casual cinephiles now, but Bergman's Nazi sympathies are widely known. Bergman never hid this, and admitted his affinity for Nazism was not just a teenage infatuation — it was only when the Holocaust's atrocities were revealed at World War II's end that he completely disavowed Hitler and Nazism.

“Bergman was manipulative,” Skarsgård said. “He was a Nazi during the war and the only person I know who cried when Hitler died. We kept excusing him, but I have a feeling he had a very weird outlook on other people. [He thought] some people were not worthy. You felt it, when he was manipulating others. He wasn't nice.”

 










Most admirers of Bergman have accepted the director's disavowal of Nazism following the war. But Bergman was 26 when Hitler took his own life in 1945, and Bergman had already been a prolific stage director and had even written his first movie, “Torment,” for the director Alf Sjöberg, by that point. Sweden had been officially neutral during the war, though various figures in its government were sympathetic to Hitler and the Nazi regime. Bergman himself went to great lengths not to excuse, ignore, or explain away his Nazi sympathies.

Bergman acknowledged seeing Hitler in person on a family trip to Weimar, Germany, in 1934 when he was 16. “Hitler was unbelievably charismatic. He electrified the crowd,” Bergman told author Maria Pia-Boethius (as reported by the BBC), who wrote a book about what Sweden's neutrality really meant during the war. And he noted that his family put a photo of Hitler by the future director's bed afterward. “The Nazism I had seen seemed fun and youthful.”

The director also acknowledged his support for Nazism in his own 1987 memoir, “The Magic Lantern,” where he wrote, “For many years, I was on Hitler's side, delighted by his success and saddened by his defeats.” And he admitted to Pia-Boethius that “when the doors to the concentration camps were thrown open … I was suddenly ripped of my innocence.”

 










This is not a portrait of an unrepentant Nazi. And any cinephile can see Bergman's anguish over the horrors of war in “Winter Light,” “The Silence,” and “Shame.”

Much of Skarsgård's distaste for Bergman seems to be personal. At Karlovy Vary, he also said, “My complicated relationship with Bergman has to do with him not being a very nice guy. He was a nice director, but you can still denounce a person as an asshole. Caravaggio was probably an asshole as well, but he did great paintings.”

This follows comments he made in 2012 to The Guardian's Xan Brooks, where Skarsgård spoke similarly, including of Bergman that “I didn't want him near my life.”

To his credit, Skarsgård is almost certainly not saying that Bergman's body of work should be dismissed the way that Cannes tried to dismiss his own longtime collaborator Lars von Trier — in 2011, Cannes officially declared von Trier “persona non grata” for calling himself a Nazi in an instantly infamous press conference promoting his film “Melancholia.” Skarsgård expressed an aversion to language-policing in his talk.

“Everyone in that room knew he was not a Nazi, that he was the opposite, and yet they all used it as a headline. And then people who only read headlines thought he was a Nazi. He just told a bad joke. Lars grew up with a Jewish father, and when his mother was dying, she told him he wasn't his real father. It was her boss, who was a German,” the Swedish actor said in defense of von Trier.

 










“When I meet people, especially in the U.S., they still [ask about von Trier's Nazi comment at Cannes]. You have so many banned words over there. My kids can say any words they want – it depends on what their intention is.”

However, that Skarsgård's comments about Bergman came up in the context of von Trier, it almost seems like the actor is saying, “Why is one director persona non grata and another not?” And it's also important to recognize the full context that Bergman's Nazi sympathies in his youth are something he strongly turned against.

Editor's Note: This story contains spoilers for “Too Much,” now streaming on Netflix.

Lena Dunham is back in the spotlight, and eight years after the conclusion of “Girls,” we missed her. We've all known Dunham to be a voice of a generation, and she's now packing all her years of celebrity into her latest magnum opus: “Too Much.”

Sure, “Too Much” is a critically acclaimed return to smart rom-coms with female audiences in mind. Did we expect anything less from Dunham? No. What is different, though, is the inclusion of nods to her own (at times, infamous) viral moments. This is Dunham laying bare for audiences once more — and only her true fans, raised being way too online, would get all the references to her lore.

 








Related Stories Wisconsin Just Passed New Tax Credits for Film and TV with Bipartisan Support — Read That Again Larry David Teams with the Obamas for ‘Curb'-Like Take on U.S. History in New HBO Sketch Series 

Dunham has promoted “Too Much” as a semi-autobiographical series. “Hacks” breakout star Megan Stalter plays the Dunham-esque Jessica, who relocates from New York to London to start fresh after a breakup. Jessica soon meets musician Felix (Will Sharpe), who challenges her to reevaluate her 30-something crisis. Dunham co-created the series with her real-life husband, Luis Felber, who also serves as an executive producer and provides original music. Despite unknowingly having crossed paths with Felber at the SXSW premiere of “Girls,” Dunham didn't know Felber until moving to London (she has since stated that she will not return to live in NYC).

 










Dunham is the creator, writer, and executive producer who directs eight out of 10 episodes. It's the packed punches of “oh my gosh, is that really supposed to be [redacted] playing [redacted]?!” that make “Too Much” not only must-see TV, but required viewing for anyone who witnessed Dunham endure the firestorm of media scrutiny amid her “Girls” fame. (“I always joke that I need a T-shirt that says, ‘I survived New York media in 2012 and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' And all I got was this lousy PTSD,” Dunham recently said.) Even Dunham's own late dog gets a nod via Jessica's onscreen pooch, Astrid.

Dunham detailed her cameo selection during the 2025 Tribeca Festival, per THR. “I always try to write with somebody in mind. It just helps me when I'm writing, and usually it's somebody either that I admire or somebody that I already have a really great collaborative relationship with, and then you just kind of write them. And my goal is always: I love this person, so what is going to get them to come do a role, a couple episodes in a half-hour TV show like this?” she said. 

“It isn't like, you know, Christopher Nolan is calling to invite you to do ‘The Odyssey.‘ This is very specific. And so my goal is [to] always write them a different kind of part than you've seen them do before, or write them something that's so in their wheelhouse that they're like, ‘It's just going to be so fun to come in and crush it.' But no in between; no vanilla. I'd rather go bold and send them something where they're like, ‘Why the fuck did you send me that?' than make them feel like they're getting handed the same part that they get to do every time. I'm still shocked that all these schedules worked and all these people came together because everyone on the show is who I wrote the role for.”

 










This is Dunham's mic drop moment, the final say on the record of her highly publicized relationships, by way of Netflix. Now, excuse us as we build our own Greg Kornacki board for the Dunham cinematic universe below.

Rita Wilson, who played Marnie's (Allison Williams) unhinged mother on “Girls,” is now Jessica's (Stalter) and Nora's (Dunham) narcissistic mom Lois. Who else could it be?

This one is also self-explanatory: Rannells is a fellow “Girls” alum, and after first playing Hannah's (Dunham) ex-turned-gay-bestie Elijah, he's now cast as Jessica's (Stalter) brother-in-law and Nora's (Dunham) husband Jameson, who leaves her to explore his pansexuality.

The “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “The Penguin” alum plays, with no doubt in our minds, a stand-in for Dunham's long-term ex, musician and music producer Jack Antonoff — though Dunham insists Michael Zegen's character is an “amalgamation” of all her exes. Antonoff and Dunham dated for five years during her “Girls” fame (the series ran from 2012 to 2017). Taylor Swift and Lorde collaborator Antonoff parted ways with Dunham in 2018. “Too Much” does not shy away from showcasing the dissolution of a partnership; the series includes a slew of claims against both the characters, with Stalter's Jessica having to emotionally escape the twisted relationship with Zegen's Zev. There is a Swift needle drop, with “Bigger Than the Whole Sky,” which makes sense as Swift and Dunham have remained good friends.

 










“Too Much” the series ends with Jessica marrying supposed bad boy and Brit indie rocker Felix, played by “The White Lotus” Season 2 breakout Will Sharpe. The parallels to Dunham's own relationship with musician Luis Felber (who records under the moniker Attawalpa, among ties to other bands) are obvious: Dunham moved to London in early 2021, where she quickly met and fell in love with Felber before marrying him later that year.

Dunham's IRL close friend Ratajkowski plays Zegen's friend-turned-fiancée, Wendy Jones, whom he leaves Jessica for. So, is Ratajkowski's role based on Antonoff's real-life fiancée, actress Margaret Qualley? Or, for those who couldn't help but follow the Antonoff-Swift squad lore, is she a combo of Qualley and Lorde?

OK, so not only did Andrew Scott star in Dunham's “Catherine Called Birdy,” but he apparently also helped cast Stalter in “Too Much.” Dunham told Glamour that Scott first introduced her to Stalter's comedy videos. “He's always ahead of the crowd, and he had fanned out and had a coffee with her,” Dunham said. “[He] basically said, ‘You two have to meet, you have something to make together.' I trust him implicitly, and went home and watched everything she'd ever made — and of course ‘Hacks,' which is divine in its own right.”

 










Now, who is Scott's pompous, divorced, scarf-clad director character supposed to be? We have our theories (emphasis on the sartorial choice of scarves!) but none of them are British…so dare we put them here? Regardless, former Hot Priest Scott's cameo, including him crying into Stalter's stocking-less thigh, is divine. 

Harrington, like Dunham, was also a staple of HBO at the time of “Girls,” so they probably crossed paths at press events over the years. However, it is Harrington's uncanny resemblance to Dunham's “Girls” co-star Christopher Abbott that has audiences' jaws on the floor when Harrington plays Stalter's deceased dad in a flashback. Abbott famously left “Girls” due to creative differences with Dunham; he returned in 2016 to briefly reprise his role of Charlie, but has said he would not return to “Girls” if the show were rebooted.

Dunham singled out “Mulholland Drive” icon Watts as one of her ideal collaborators during the 2025 Tribeca Festival, according to THR. It most likely helped that Watts recently co-starred with Sharpe in “Emmanuelle.” Dunham said that she wanted Watts to return to the comedic roles that she took on early in her career. “I thought, let me write her something that's like, not an elegant lady role, that's like an elegant lady to the left role, like an elegant lady who's railing cocaine role,” Dunham said. “I want to speak to the thing I think you don't get to do, which is be the funniest fucking person in the world, because you also happen to look like a beautiful British aristocrat, and so people don't always know to ask that of you.” 

 










Now, Watts plays Ann, Jessica's boss' (Richard E. Grant) wife, who becomes a mentor to her over the course of a crazy coke-fueled dinner party.

No one can forget that the beloved Grant played Jessa's (Jemima Kirke) drug-addled boyfriend in rehab on “Girls.” This time, Grant stars as Jessica's (Stalter) boss Jonno, who is married to Ann (Watts).

Dunham co-starred alongside Fry for “Treasure.” Now, he plays Felix's father, Simon, in “Too Much” (Fry was Dunham's dad in the 2024 father-daughter road trip movie “Treasure,” co-starring Dunham).

While Bravo plays Jessica's (Stalter) fashionable fellow American coworker Kim, this isn't Bravo's first time working with Dunham. Bravo acted in “Camping,” which Dunham co-created; Bravo also directs Episode 8 of “Too Much,” “One Wedding and a Sex Pest.”

Dunham has frequently called “Cheers” alum Perlman her “comic idol,” while Perlman cited Dunham as one of the most powerful women in Hollywood in 2014. Dunham and Perlman's recent “Barbie” co-star America Ferrera also made a viral speech against then-Presidential nominee Donald Trump together in 2016. Now, Perlman is playing Dunham and Stalter's grandmother Dottie onscreen.

 










When casting the most beautiful, most likable, and therefore most threatening ex for your latest love interest, “Blue Is the Warmest Color” and “Passages” star Exarchopoulos would be the ideal actress every time. And because it's Dunham, of course, she landed the star. Exarchopoulos plays Polly, the too-good-to-be-hated former lover and now best friend of Felix (Will Sharpe). Despite Dunham not collaborating with Exarchopoulos before, the actress is a standout supporting character.

All episodes of “Too Much” are now streaming on Netflix.

One year after “Brat Summer,” Chappell Roan's rise to stardom, and a full six-month period where the lyrics “That's that me espresso” were stuck in every American's head, 2025 pop music has proven disappointingly ordinary. With the charts staler than ever and little new releases to enjoy on the horizon, pop excellence has to be found in unconventional places. 

Enter: Huntr/x, a K-pop trio with banging leather outfits and a likable lineup that slots into the classic “Powerpuff Girls” mold: there's the childish and sweet “Bubbles” type Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), the tough and sarcastic “Buttercup” type Mira (May Hong), and the “Blossom”-esque earnest type-A leader Rumi (Arden Cho). Since June, the group has blown up in America with an album at No. 3 on Billboard and a hit single climbing up the Hot 100. It's a particularly impressive feat for a group that isn't actually “real,” instead hailing from Netflix‘s animated musical, “Kpop Demon Hunters.”

Since premiering on Netflix in June 20 to relatively little promotion, “Kpop Demon Hunters” has, via word and mouth and social media, blossomed into a bona fide success for the streamer and Sony Pictures Animation. As of this writing, it's the No. 1 film on the site, and its soundtrack album — featuring the catchy multilingual earworms performed by Huntr/x and their rival group Saja Boys — has produced moderate hits (the song “Your Idol” managed to reach no. 1 on the US Spotify chart, surpassing BTS' “Dynamite” as the biggest song on the chart). 

 










In many respects, the film's success isn't exactly a surprise, reflecting on the widening market for kpop and the many fans of Asian animation that are primed to enjoy a western product that takes obvious inspiration from anime in its visual style. But thankfully, “Kpop Demon Hunters” isn't just a cynical attempt from Sony to cash in on a cultural trend: in the hands of directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, it's a endearing, beautifully animated crowdpleaser, with a dorkily sincere love for the pop culture phenomena it embeds itself in.  

The film's screenplay — credited to Kang, Appelhans, Danya Jimenez, and Hannah McMechan — thankfully doesn't waste too much time on setting up or over-explaining the film's somewhat silly mythology. Each generation, a new trio of women has risen up to take on the mantle of maintaining the Honmoon, a magical barrier that seals demons from the human world, with the power of song. In modern times, that translates to the trio being the hottest girl group in South Korea, with legions of fans at every concert to buy merch and squeal like babies as they perform under the bright lights. 

Smartly, “Kpop Demon Hunters” picks up with the three women already having long come into their own as Demon Hunters, giving room for them to bounce off each other as friends. That's a very good thing, because it allows for fun, knowing jokes about the Kpop industry — from the rabid fandoms to the corny variety shows burgeoning stars are forced to take part in — and because the cast chemistry between the three women is a huge part of what makes the film such a delight. Statuesque goddesses on stage but utter goofballs in the privacy of their home, Huntr/x's  personalities might be archetypical, but a combination of the three actresses' vocal performances and lively writing makes them likable and relatable as they slurp self-branded instant noodles and complain about the hiatus Rumi keeps pushing them back from taking. 

 










Comedic moments are where the animation — a mix of the sharp style of Sony's “Spider-Verse” films with some clear Eastern influence — also shines the brightest. The action is well-choreographed, and the on-stage performances are convincing replicas of real K-pop girl groups, but nothing in the film is as delightful as the way the animators contort the faces of the leads with some manga inspired faces and reactions. In a standout moment, when the girls first encounter the Saja Boys — their rivals not just on the charts but on the battlefield, a band of monsters sent to destroy the Honmoon from the film's unfortunately generic demon lord — Mira and Zoey's eyes shift from red-eyed cartoon hearts to a pair of six-pack abs to popping corn, in a hilarious PG-friendly depiction of abject thirst. 

The Saja Boys are memorable creations of their own, an over-the-top collection of shaggy haircuts, dewy faces, and bright streetwear that instantly invokes the heartthrobs of BTS or Stray Kids. They're mostly anonymous grunts, though, with the exception of the dark-haired and soft-voiced leader Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), who immediately clashes with Rumi on a more personal level than just being on opposite sides of a demon/hunter war, which belies an obvious attraction. For Rumi, stressed out about finally fully strengthening the barrier and carrying a secret she keeps hidden from both of her friends, Jinu — with his own complicated backstory — becomes a safe space where she can finally feel like herself.    

 










Like much of the film's storyline, this star-crossed romance draws inspiration and beats from dozens of coming-of-age fantasies you've watched or read before, a more chaste version of Buffy and Angel, but “Kpop Demon Hunters” still makes it work. Cho and Ahn create believably compelling chemistry together, and their relationship gives an otherwise lighthearted adventure some much needed depth and weight. 

Introducing the Saja Boys also allows the directors an excuse to cram the film with more music numbers, most of which were written by real professionals in the K-pop industry: contributors include Ejae (who also provides Rumi's singing voice), who has worked on songs for girl groups like Twice and Red Velvet, as well as prolific Kpop producer Teddy Park. The result isn't necessarily a full collection of bangers: a few (opening song “How It's Done,” “Your Idol”) lean towards the generic and blend together too easily. But they're eminently believable as real K-pop songs you can stream in the real world, and the highlights — including Saja Boys bouncy intro number “Soda Pop” and Huntr/x's big inspirational ballad “Golden” — are spectacular. 

 










What's more impressive about the music in the film is how the directors find smart, varied ways to stage the songs. Some numbers like “How It's Done” are performed as the girls are fighting demons, while others like “Golden” are presented via music videos emulating the high-budget endeavors of real-world groups. “Takedown,” a nasty diss track, gets introduced in a montage as the girls create it, while “Soda Pop” is a spirited dance number. When Rumi and Jinu have a moment of understanding, they launch into a short love duet. The film's versatility with how it flexes its musical muscles makes the K-pop trappings more than just a goofy gimmick but a central and vital component of its storytelling.      

If there's a fatal flaw to “Kpop Demon Hunters,” it's that there's almost too little of it. The film's quick pace and short runtime — subtract the end credits, and it barely lasts an hour and 25 minutes — is a boon at points, as the film moves on from it's stuffier plot points. At other times, it glides a little too quickly away from depth. The film sticks to Rumi as the lead for expediency, giving Mira and Zoey short shrift storyline wise, while also not digging nearly enough into the resentment Rumi feels towards former hunter and surrogate mother figure Celine (Yunjin Kim). The rushed climax also lands as slightly underwhelming, an overly easy resolution that doesn't give these lovable girls the ending they deserve.

 










That said, who's to say it is the end? The last shot of the film seems begging for a sequel to be made, and the film's success feels like it could very well become a reality. And it'd be welcome too, giving the charming fantasy Kpop world of the film another chance to shine. Until then, fans will just have to keep streaming “Golden” as they await Huntr/x's comeback. 

“Kpop Demon Hunters” is currently streaming on Netflix.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","5 Takeaways From Justin Bieber's New Album SWAG","https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/takeaways-from-justin-bieber-new-album-swag/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:11:15 GMT","

It's 2025, and the buzziest underground rap stars are rocking #BEENTRILL snapbacks while unironically penning Tumblr love stories. A Playboi Carti song built around a sample of Rich Kidz's “Bend Over” spent two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. And, on Thursday afternoon, Justin Bieber announced that his 7th studio album, succinctly titled SWAG, would be released at midnight. Is it safe to declare it a kushandlyrikz summer?

Bieber seems to have been preparing for one, spending the past few months hitting the studio with Lil B, sparking up to classic Clams Casino beats, and hopping on Instagram Live to preview raw, improvisational snippets over minimalist beats that wouldn't be out of place on a MySpace-era Soulja Boy mixtape. Though recording sessions for SWAG reportedly concluded in April, it's not unlikely that its sudden release was influenced by the cultural ubiquity of his awkward and appropriative, yet admittedly iconic catchphrase, “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business,” levied at paparazzi in mid-June. Best to unlock the swag while the iron's hot.

Despite its title, however, SWAG is free of any sounds even vaguely reminiscent of the ringtone era. Instead, he's enlisted producers Eddie Benjamin and Carter Lang to provide much of the record's '80s-inspired, reverb-laden backing, tapping Mk.gee and Dijon to lend some experimental edge. Compared to Bieber's previous outings, there's a distinct emphasis on organic textures and acoustic guitar, aiming for raw intimacy and stadium, or maybe megachurch-sized hooks at the same time. Here are five takeaways from the album.

SWAG's production is often cavernous, though not quite in the polished, neon-lit vein of a Weeknd album. Instead, there's a focus on dusty timbres, blown-out drums, and live instrumentation, all echoing into infinity. Mk.gee's fingerprints are felt throughout, even when he's not explicitly credited as a track's producer, with technically intricate guitar lines weaving through the mix. “First Place” pairs compressed, distorted drum programming with synth leads that would sound at home in an abandoned shopping mall food court, while “Daisies” leans fully into guitar-heavy blue-eyed soul. “Go Baby” occasionally resembles contemporary Bon Iver records with its watery keys and dreamy vocal stacks, which isn't a huge surprise given their shared collaborator in Dijon.

Even SWAG's marquee collaborations with rappers are subject to the moody, spacious sound palette, to strange and inventive effect. On “Way It Is,” Gunna waxes romantic about designer shopping sprees over Vangelis-esque pads, and there's a definite charm to hearing Sexyy Red's freaked-out verse echo into an expanse of cinematic synth work. A late-album team-up with Cash Cobain borders on chillwave with its clattering snare rolls and washed-out arpeggios. And is Eddie Benjamin doing a baby-voiced Carti impression on that same track?

Aesthetically aligned with Bieber's tendency to embark on lengthy Instagram vagueposting sprees full of camera roll dumps and grainy snapshots, SWAG aims for a semblance of rawness and digital authenticity. The bluesy jam session “Glory Voice Memo” and the acoustic number “Zuma House” are unfinished demos that seem to be uploaded straight from a phone, while the buzzy strumming and chipmunked lead vocal take on “Yukon” conjure the post-digital grit of early Alex G or XXXTentacion in campfire song mode.

Bieber's newfound friendship with cloud rap elder statesman and Based luminary Lil B yielded SWAG's most eccentric (albeit swaggiest) track, “Dadz Love,” a downtempo interlude backed by a muffled breakbeat and a single, looped chord. It's a fascinating exercise in minimalism: Bieber riffs on the same winkingly ambiguous phrase, which is either “that's love,” “dad's love,” or both, while Lil B engages in spoken-word proselytization, petitioning for unity and love as his voice warps and ricochets in the stereo field, Black Ark style.

Comedian Druski makes not one, not two, but three separate appearances on skits throughout SWAG, playing the role of Bieber's therapist and/or confidant. Here are their three most absurd lines of dialogue:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Justin Bieber Surprise-Releases New Album Swag : Listen","https://pitchfork.com/news/justin-bieber-surprise-releases-new-album-swag-listen/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 04:13:24 GMT","

Justin Bieber has surprise-released a new album called Swag. The album features Dijon, Lil B, Sexyy Red, the comedian Druski, Gunna, Cash Cobain, 2 Chainz, and others. Production comes from Dijon, Mk.gee, Knox Fortune, Daniel Caesar, and more, and a key songwriter across the album is Tobias Jesso Jr. Listen to the album below.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bieber had been hosting “jam sessions” at his Los Angeles home in recent months. The publication also reported that the singer decamped to Iceland to jam, “vibe out,” and finish his album.

One of the new album's collaborators, Mk.gee, had previously spoken about his work with Bieber for a New York Times feature. “He's searching,” the guitarist told The Times' Joe Coscarelli last year. “Anything that comes out of his mouth: That's pop music,” he continued. “You can really do pretty wild stuff behind that, just because it represents something.”

Swag is Bieber's seventh studio album and first since 2021's Justice. He began his Justice World Tour the next year, but he had to cancel it early due to health issues. The tour cancellation apparently led to financial issues with his then-manager Scooter Braun, who allegedly helped Bieber cover the more than $20 million that the singer owed to the tour's promoter, AEG Presents. Bieber and Braun recently settled their dispute, according to The Hollywood Reporter and TMZ.

In 2023, Bieber sold his catalog to Recognition Music Group (then known as Hipgnosis) for a reported $200 million. It marked the company's largest catalog acquisition at the time.

Bieber has limited his musical output in the time since Justice. He teamed up with SZA on “Snooze (Acoustic),” Kehlani on “Up at Night,” and Omah Lay on “Attention,” to name a few of his collaborative efforts. He also shared the songs “Honest,” “I Feel Funny,” and “Beautiful Love (Free Fire).”

Justin Bieber soundtracked one of his promotional posts for Swag with Florida rapper Bossman Dlow's Mr Beat the Road standout “Talk My Shit.” Read more about the pop superstar's fascination with regional hip-hop in Alphonse Pierre's column “What the Hell Is Justin Bieber Doing on Rob49's ‘WTHelly?'”

To mark the occasion of their reunion, Clipse went on a historical press run blowing up their petty beefs and label drama with the theatricality of the promoters you used to find in the Deep South wrestling territories of the 20th century. This is an energy Pusha T and Malice are used to.

Twenty years ago, after the Virginia Beach brothers put out the classic Lord Willin', they were stuck in label purgatory and on a crusade against rap industry politics. Afraid of being left in the lurch, Clipse teamed up with Philly hardheads Ab-Liva and Sandman as the supergroup the Re-Up Gang, and started the We Got It 4 Cheap mixtape series. There, the snarling duo sharpened their colorful coke rap and aired their grievances. “To the hell with the label woes, suited-out CEOs,” says Pusha on the vintage Trackmasters beat, fed up with their record label doing them dirty. It built them a reputation as underdogs, as self-mythologizing showmen, and laid the groundwork for 2006's Hell Hath No Fury, where they became one of the defining rap duos of the era.

Back then, Pusha and Malice came by the chip on their shoulder honestly—now it's just a part of the Clipse experience. Let God Sort Em Out, the first Clipse album in nearly 16 years, works hard not only to be worthy of their comeback, but to make their comeback feel necessary. So here's Pharrell using PTO from his day job as the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton to reunite with Pusha and Malice and add some modern blockbuster polish to the Neptunes sound. And a splash of hammy balladry from John Legend. And Instagram gossip page fodder in the form of deciphering which lyrics are aimed at who. For some reason, LGSEO wants to convince us of the importance and relevance of Clipse, like they're not already fuckin' Clipse.

Maybe it's that the brothers, savvy as ever, have picked up on the fact that mainstream rap albums are now split into two categories: The spectacles and everything else. Pusha and Malice have always sided with the former anyway. “We ain't throwing these raps together and trying to throw out an album or throw out a mixtape with 30 songs on it,” Malice said years ago. “And have all your drunken friends with their hats backwards rapping on it.”

LGSEO is an extremely considered and intentional album with features that will appease the three corners of Clipse fandom: For the diehards, Ab-Liva is on here “playing in the snow like Rudolph.” For the East Coast drug rap aficionados, Griselda's Stove God Cooks drops in for a sleepy hook on “F.I.C.O.” Repping the Neptunes classicists is Tyler, the Creator trying to match Push and Malice's shit talk on “P.O.V.” (Clipse wipe the floor with him.) Pusha lays into the rappers treating the game like content creation and Malice references his spiritual journey: “I was the only one to walk away and really be free,” he raps. (One of my favorite parts of the project is the way Malice talks about his hiatus like he moved to the mountains to live with the monks.)

Just like the old days, the brothers bond over their cruel jokes, lavish motivation raps, and descriptions of the drug trade vivid enough to appear in a late-era Richard Price novel. At 52 (Malice) and 48 (Pusha), they're still pretty nice with it on the mic. Malice's voice is raspier now, though that only makes his wary sage energy more pronounced, as he references Bible verses and ties his drug-dealing fantasies to any pop culture reference that comes into his mind (The Revenant, I Am Legend, Lady Gaga).

Pusha's delivery has a pinch of wear but it's still smoothly villainous, dropping in disparaging remarks (calling his broke enemies “browsenaires” is up there) and flexes on the regular. “Inglorious Bastards” really captures the “fuck you” but with the sarcastically blown kiss feeling of the Re-Up Gang tapes—it could probably be on one of them if it had DJ tags and a monologue about his credit card purchases. In one moment Pusha's way out of pocket (“Me just being me, respect to PnB I probably never eat at Roscoe's,” he barks on “So Far Ahead”), and in the next, he's interrogating an emotion most wouldn't outside of therapy: “See you were checkin' boxes/I was checkin' my mentions,” he says on “The Birds Don't Sing,” feeling the guilt of being so fixated on the rapper lifestyle that he didn't realize his mother was dying.

Holding back the comeback is Pharrell. In 2025, everything he touches feels so corporate, a far cry from the stargazing sound of the Neptunes and N.E.R.D. He was never an amazing singer, but his imperfect falsetto made songs cool. That's not the case here: The choir effect of “So Far Ahead” is emotionless, and his twangy melodies on “Chains & Whips” belong in something like the heavy-handed musical sequence in Sinners, not behind Pusha bragging about his watch collection.

Even more of a buzzkill are the beats. At the Neptunes' peak, you could hear traces of Larry Smith, Dre, Erick Sermon, and more inside their singular intergalactic funk—the synth on “Frontin'” that sounds like futuristic Death Row, the mind-blowing rhythm of “Superthug.” These Pharrell instrumentals on LGSEO don't have that nerdy imagination. Instead you get a lot of stuffy stadium bass with an HR-approved bounce that sounds like it was recorded in Pharrell's Louis Vuitton office in Paris—probably because it was. It makes the album feel like an ad for his next collection. And to be honest, the Clipse reunion has been like that since “Chains & Whips” premiered on the LV runway two years ago.

The best beats on LGSEO are the ones that just do old Neptunes at half-speed. You know, the click-clack of the percussion on “All Things Considered,” the blast of apocalyptic synths with an eerie Hell Hath No Fury edge on “Let God Sort Em Out/Chandeliers,” which gets cut off for a tediously triumphant beat switch so Nas can do Nas. Also, “E.B.I.T.D.A.,” which is a little funky, with its spaced-out In My Mind sparkle. The whimsical touch of the beat opens up Clipse's imagination. “I'm sleepwalkin' y'all don't dream enough/My third passport I ain't seen enough,” raps Push. One of the elements that separated the duo from the million rappers getting off coke punchlines on Smack DVDs was that their realism was matched by the head-in-the-clouds spirit of a kid looking through the bins at a record store for the first time. The cosmic Neptunes beats were big in getting them there, but Pharrell's newfound opulence flattens that side of them.

In the past, Pharrell's personality came through in beats that could be funny, like the tongue-click of “Drop It Like It's Hot,” or weird, such as the droning hyphy of “Mr. Me Too.” Now, he has this efficient professionalism, a way of making music that aims to satisfy Clipse fans who are just happy to see him and the boys back together again. Let God Sort Em Out coasts on the history they share with each other and with us, settling for good enough. Every now and then on the album, you'll hear this tag telling us that the music is “culturally inappropriate.” I wish it actually was.

What's clear is that Pharrell's heart isn't in it, the same way Pusha and Malice's hearts aren't in their disses. “You cried in front of me, you died in front of me/Calabasas took your bitch and your pride in front of me,” raps Pusha, seemingly disgusted at the thought of Travis Scott on “So Be It.” But Clipse are a feeling, and I don't feel that they really care that much about what Travis, or Kanye, or, uh, Jim Jones have going on.

This is all a distraction from what Pusha and Malice actually do well: rap. It's no question that they've still got love for the form and that their brotherhood is tied deeply to the genre. I think of “M.T.B.T.T.F.,” one of the rare Pharrell beats with oomph, where they both whip out an a capella flow that channels everyone from Biggie to Kool G Rap. It's high on their usual lyrical theatrics, but they're not trying too hard to grab headlines. “You niggas is screenwriters, we dreamwriters/Took chains and touched change like King Midas,” raps Malice from the gut. Just Pusha and Malice getting sinister and mythic over a hard beat. I'll take that.

Scroll far back enough on d.silvestre's SoundCloud and you can still hear his first tracks: a handful of shoddily multitracked Alex G-esque lo-fi guitar demos from 2018. It wasn't until he stumbled upon DJ Magrones' “AUTOMOTIVO CADE AS INFLUENCER” that d.silvestre fell in love with Brazilian funk. Since his first funk releases in 2022, the Rondônia-born producer, a.k.a. Douglas Silvestre, has steadily developed his own signatures, DJed for thousands alongside major contemporaries in the São Paulo funk scene, and become heralded in English-language press as a leading experimentalist in funk and mandelão.

A recent and extreme subgenre of Brazilian funk, mandelão originates from the Baile do Mandela party in the Praia Grande area of São Paulo. Funk artists like MC Bin Laden spent the 2010s working distorted productions and brasher vocals into the Miami bass–inspired sound pioneered by aughts funk producers like DJ Marlboro and rappers like Tati Quebra Barraco. Mandelão's reliance on minimalist, aggressive low ends and harsh monophonic leads definitively severed the sound from its lineage. Whereas Northern artists have frequently borrowed ideas from Brazilian funk—see, for instance, M.I.A. and Diplo's often voyeuristic interpretations on records like “Bucky Done Gun” and Piracy Funds Terrorism—funk and mandelão have remained fairly insulated from outside influence, given mandelão's reliance on louder, more repetitive, and more extreme elements. O Que as Mulheres Querem marks a notable horizontal expansion for mandelão and funk in general, incorporating a wider array of traditional club influences beneath d.silvestre's trademark rumble and screech.

d.silvestre's early records were focused on developing his own take on mandelão. He first achieved a truly distinct sound with tracks like “OAKLEY OAKLEY OAKLEY” and the seven-minute megamix “Set Estragado 1.0.” The violent distortion and nagging repetition could feel juvenile at times, but the weaponized excess was nonetheless electrifying. O Que as Mulheres Querem maintains many of the qualities of D.SILVESTRE and O Inimigo Agora É Outro, Vol. 2, allowing extreme bass hits, vocal chops, or squealing leads to overwhelm within specific moments or frequencies, rather than dialing the entire sonic range to 11. On O Que as Mulheres Querem, hints of Rustie, PC Music, and big-room tech-house pepper space on top of the grueling bass assault. “Sem Moralismo” struts like a Disclosure track, though that duo could only dream of coming up with sounds this anarchic. “ELA TRAVA” revolves around a contracting bassline that could be a PC Music club tool. A bulk of the tracks feature co-production from funk veteran LUCAS KID, whose style shares more common ground with North American club experimentalists like Nick León and umru than mandelão chieftans like DJ K or d.silvestre himself.

Funk's team-sport character is apparent not only from d.silvestre's tracklists but also the crowded DJ lineups he typically appears on. O Que as Mulheres Querem marks d.silvestre's first release under the Submundo 808 label and party series, where he regularly performs for thousands alongside popular contemporaries like DJ RaMeMes, Kenan e Kel, and Caio Prince. Like his previous records, O Que as Mulheres Querem is littered with guest MCs and producers from the local funk scene, including 17-year-old MC LELE 011, who the producer has called his favorite guest MC, but there's not much to distinguish the different vocalists; virtually all the rappers deliver their lines with a bratty tone and uncomplicated cadence. d.silvestre fries, chops, and splatters their bars and hooks across his tracks as though they were just more playthings in his digital toy chest. The lone track with no vocalist, “OQAMQ,” is the record's shortest and weakest, bringing little complexity to its stripped-down drum-machine loop.

Though some of d.silvestre's incorporations of Northern club sounds can feel clunky, jarring elements don't typically stick around for long enough to remain in memory; the tech-house hats on “Olha o Tamanho Dessa Onda” last mere seconds before a distorted acid bass commands the rest of the track. d.silvestre's commitment to mandelão fundamentals makes it unlikely O Que as Mulheres Querem will be taken as an olive branch by hesitant foreign audiences—but then again, the very idea of compromise seems alien to the doggedly hermetic scene. d.silvestre recently told the sample-pack platform Splice that as he pushes his sound to become “the maximum of d.silvestre's sound, it ends up becoming universal,” potentially resonating with listeners of any nationality. In that sense, O Que as Mulheres Querem's overtures to global club styles feel less like an attempt to cross over than to draw international listeners into his own unrelenting world.

More than a few times, my hubris has shot me in the foot with a spliff in my hand. The last time I got too fried, I thought I was gonna end up deaf at a basement show my homie's hardcore band was playing. I still remember how I felt hearing those punishing riffs seep through the restroom door: overwhelmed, neurotic, strangely invigorated. I knew then that'd be the last time I put myself through some shit like that.

Turns out I was wrong. The new tape from Tennessee-based SoundCloud deviant MikeBrokeasf, EM0THUG, brought me right back to that bone-chilling feeling. Not because I was stoned again, and not because the music sounds similar, but because the textures are so brazen and unrelenting. At this fucked-up intersection of Drukqs, trance music, and swag rap, I completely understand if you're inclined to turn around and never look back. But if you do find enjoyment in EM0THUG, then congratulations—you are more turnt than the average listener. “Break a nigga's speakers/Don't play me in yo' car,” Mike quips on the 90-second opener. Aptly titled “808 Speaker Breakers RIP Speaker Knockers,” it comes with brutal waves of bass and alarmous techno blips that mutate half a dozen times as MikeBrokeasf raps about not being broke. Consider yourself warned.

MikeBrokeasf has messed around with plugg music and raggedy electronica since the early 2020s, when he was known as percosits. The shroom-riddled, sex-crazed “in my polo shirt,” from 2023's Swag School, is a clear predecessor of EM0THUG's haywire robotics. Over squelching blips and chimes, Mike's freewheeling delivery is steeped in rap-game gluttony: Xanax bars and lean cups, Hedi Dior and pretty girls. Despite just being 19 minutes long, EM0THUG at its most left-field is grating and unforgiving. Everything is borne out of carnal, off-the-cuff sadism. Sometimes it's unnecessary. You feel it on “Juice,” a track whose screwfaced, “U Guessed It”-type buildup leads to a flagrant rhyme with “maggots,” which, yeah. You feel it in the rabid (kinda cool) breakbeats on “ACiD MuSiK” and “Im a Emo Thug” that could've been ripped from Squarepusher. It's the soundtrack to greening out at a chaotic houseparty: The clanging pots and pans, chintzy record scratches, and throbbing Jersey club kicks on lead single “3.5s and 808s” make Carti's “OPM BABI” sound as easygoing as Norah Jones.

EM0THUG becomes more palatable when it allows its melodies to swell and take shape. Standout “I Slay Demons” is built around menacing synth keys that stutter and slink in reverse before ballooning into a lambent lead melody. MikeBrokeasf paints every surface with crude, acidic Auto-Tune bursts, turning rap clichés into punchy soundbites. “I'm like Ant Edwards/I don't fuck with none of my kids,” he chirps before dedicating half the song to his “young rich emo dick.” “Purple Dreams” shifts between Eurodance starbursts and spritzes of twinkly MIDI as Mike takes to crooning. As he sings to a girl about leaving the function together, his vocal runs remind me of when Uzi used to make cutesy, drug-tinged love songs. “Yeah don't act fanned out, keep it cool,” Mike belts. “I fuck wit your vibe, fuck wit youuu.”

Bumping EM0THUG is like opening a bag of gummy worms on a full stomach. You know exactly what kind of carnage is waiting for you at the bottom of that bag, but you'll find some joy on your way there. In a sea of kids trying mad hard to look like they don't care about structure, MikeBrokeasf genuinely does not give two shits about structure. Dude probably grew up writing “Thank You Based God” on his desk in math class. Take the electro-armageddon of “Walk In,” a track that sounds like it might've been recorded in a single take. The piercing synth and restless one-liners land exactly where they're intended: deep inside your hippocampus, urging you to run headfirst into that wall.

Blackpink have officially released “Jump,” a new song that they debuted at the opening night of their Deadline World Tour. Teddy, Diplo, 24, Zikai, Claudia Valentina, Jumpa, Malachiii, and Jesse Bluu co-wrote “Jump,” and Diplo, 24, Boaz van de Beatz, Zecca, and Ape Drums co-produced the song. Dave Meyers directed the accompanying music video. Watch it below.

“Jump” is the first new song from Blackpink since August 2023's “The Girls (Blackpink the Game OST).” Since then, the K-pop band's members—Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa—have each focused on their respective solo careers. Rosé was the first of the group to share a solo album, dropping Rosie in December 2024. Jisoo soon followed, in February 2025, with her mini-album Amortage. Next came Lisa's Alter Ego, and then Jennie's Ruby.

Blackpink began their Deadline World Tour on Saturday, July 5, in their native South Korea. They will play North American shows in July, and the tour will stretch into the beginning of 2026. See all of Blackpink's upcoming tour dates below.

	Matthew Cunningham-Cook



This story is being published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy.


	Major retirement systems in blue states — where many governors and attorneys general are fighting hard to counter extreme and likely illegal actions by the Trump administration — have invested billions of dollars in some of the biggest corporate supporters of those actions, a review by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has found. 


	Since his inauguration in January, President Donald Trump has focused his ire on blue states in a number of ways. He's closed Department of Health and Human Services regional offices in states where he lost the last election, attacked “state overreach” on climate mitigation policies he opposes, and threatened to withhold federal funds from universities located in Democratic-led states that voted against him in 2024. He has also attempted to withhold already allocated funding to blue states on the basis of their immigration policies, deployed National Guard troops and the Marines in California over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and sent masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain immigrants, primarily in blue state “sanctuary cities.” 

	











	Trump has made no effort to hide his campaign of retribution, posting to Truth Social after June's “No Kings” protests across the country that he intended to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York… and other such Cities, [which] are the core of the Democrat Power Center.” 

	











	Blue state attorneys general have responded with more than 30 lawsuits against the Trump administration's unconstitutional moves. But despite these high-stakes battles, public pension funds in California, New York, and Illinois have invested more than $6.1 billion in six companies that bankrolled Trump's election or are deeply involved in carrying out his authoritarian agenda.

	The investments made by pension funds are made with limited input from the public sector workers that contribute to them — a fact that labor experts believe is a major problem for corporate accountability. Many public sector workers have protested and urged their pension funds to divest from Tesla in recent months as Elon Musk-backed cuts have wreaked havoc in communities across the country. 


	The following corporations have been helping the president execute some of his most controversial and authoritarian policies this year: 


	Tesla CEO Elon Musk pumped $290 million into helping elect Trump and Republicans last year, spending far more on the election than any other billionaire donor. The president then rewarded Musk by keeping him at his side throughout the transition and anointing him head of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a controversial, chaos-generating special operation best epitomized by Musk wielding a chainsaw as he abolished and halted the work of whole agencies and gleefully reduced the federal workforce by about 250,000 federal workers, the majority of whom were represented by unions. 


	Since departing the DOGE effort at the end of May, Musk and Trump have butted heads, but the world's richest man still reaped massive dividends from the effort, largely from gutting agencies that were investigating him. Investors have raised concerns about Tesla's lofty valuations in the aftermath of his public split with Trump. State retirement systems in California, New York, and Illinois have $3.7 billion invested in Tesla.


	Valor Equity is run by Musk's friend and private equity manager Antonio Gracias, who has worked with DOGE in an attempt to dig up evidence of voting by immigrants through controversial access to once private Social Security data. Valor Equity manages billions of dollars for blue state pension funds — while also investing in Musk company SpaceX and the drone maker Anduril, which hope to be awarded contracts to help build Trump's proposed $830-billion, Israel-inspired Golden Dome missile defense shield. The recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” included a provision that mandated that federal funding for border surveillance towers go to companies with the exact specifications provided by Anduril.

	SpaceX has also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to invalidate the National Labor Relations Act, setting up a potential abrogation of the cornerstone of labor rights in the U.S. by the ultra-conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Valor Equity has also invested in xAI, which owns Musk's platform X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 8, controversy emerged as Grok, xAI's AI chatbot integrated with X, began spouting pro-Hitler propaganda. California, Illinois, and New York retirement systems have $1.3 billion invested in Valor Equity funds.


	Right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel's company Palantir is building a national database to help the Trump administration better amass information on everyone living in the U.S., with the company having already received $113 million in federal funds as of the end of May, according to recent reporting by The New York Times. 


	The tech company was also awarded an additional $795 million Defense Department contract in May, and has received a new $30 million contract from ICE to more closely track immigrants in the U.S. In total, the pension funds surveyed have $745 million invested with Palantir. 


	Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, a designer and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who became a “close friend” of Musk's and still owns a seven percent stake in his vacation and short-term rental firm, has been heavily involved with DOGE since the beginning and now hopes to replace Musk in leading the department's ongoing effort to slash the federal workforce. The 43-year-old billionaire also sits on Tesla's board and was a longtime Democratic donor before voting for Trump in 2024. The pension funds surveyed have $330 million invested in Airbnb stock.


	GEO Group, one of the two components of the major private prison duopoly, received a $1 billion contract with ICE in 2025. On a recent earnings call, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley remarked on the lucrative opportunity presented by Trump's mass deportation agenda.


	“This is a unique moment in our company's history,” he said. “We believe we are well positioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders.” 


	GEO Group is being sued for illegal labor trafficking related to work performed by immigrant detainees, and major concerns have been raised about conditions inside of GEO facilities. GEO Group subsidiaries contributed $1.3 million to a pro-Trump super PAC in 2024, and another $500,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. The Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund and the New York State Teachers' Retirement System have $3.9 million invested with GEO Group.

	











	The CEO of the private prison firm CoreCivic stated on a recent earnings call, “Our team has always been mission and outcomes-focused, but this is such a significant moment of time in our company's history. Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now.” 


	The firm recently received a no-bid contract to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Kansas that had been effectively shuttered by Biden administration policies, after donating $500,000 to the Trump inaugural committee. Stocks in both GEO Group and CoreCivic have soared following passage of Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will pump another $45 billion into immigration detention capacity and transportation over the next few years. The Illinois Municipal and New York State Teachers' funds have $8.4 million in CoreCivic holdings. 


	The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), the country's largest pension fund, and the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), the country's second-largest pension fund, have received calls to divest from Tesla (as well as from the broader military-industrial complex). 


	Other public pension funds in the U.S. and abroad have already taken action to pull their investments in Tesla and other anti-labor corporations. The pension fund for public sector workers in purple Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, recently voted to stop buying new Tesla shares and begin the divestment process from the carmaker. On June 13, the Swedish pension fund AP7 announced its intention to sell its entire $1.4 billion stake in the automaker, stating that “AP7 has decided to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of labor rights in the United States.” 


	In March, Denmark's Akademiker Pension also announced its intentions to divest in Tesla over labor rights issues. In January, Europe's largest pension, the Dutch ABP fund, divested from Tesla, as well as from Meta and Alphabet, over environmental, social, and governance concerns. Other Dutch pension funds had divested from Tesla prior to this year due to labor rights concerns. In October, the Norwegian asset manager Storebrand announced its intentions to sell Palantir stock due to their concerns that its practices violate human rights law. 


	Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley, a Democrat, told CMD that “there's a real fiduciary issue here…. Tesla's client base is Democrats, people who care about the environment. Then [Musk] goes and [effectively] alienates all of his customers. [So] all fiduciaries should be looking at this — at the very least telling active managers to not invest in Tesla… until [the company] makes some changes,” including agreeing to a neutrality agreement with labor unions. (Given Musk's ongoing feud with Trump, he may well alienate Republican customers, too.)

	











	On April 2, Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.6 million-member American Federation of Teachers, sent a letter to state chief fiduciary officers urging them to examine risks inherent to investing in Tesla by “communicating with the money managers that manage Tesla stock on behalf of your state and its retirement funds to ask them what steps they are taking to safeguard retirement assets.”


	The typical defense from public pension fund managers who are held to account for investments considered contrary to the public interest is that they have a fiduciary duty to pensioners that trumps all other concerns, and that this obligation includes diversification. In a 2017 statement, CalPERS claimed that divestment “limits investment opportunities, decreasing diversification, limiting returns, and increasing risk in our investment portfolio.” 


	But the definition of fiduciary duty is notoriously fuzzy, asTed Siedle, a former attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), points out. 


	“There's an argument that anything can be a breach of fiduciary duty or consistent with fiduciary duty,” he told CMD. “Public pension funds are not governed by any federal fiduciary standard, and [there are] scant state standards, which means that any argument can be made that a particular investment is consistent with or violates fiduciary duties.”


	Samir Sonti, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York, told CMD that the flexible definition of fiduciary duty is frequently used as a dodge against divestment and keeps many managers from taking action.


	“In the eyes of many, pension fund managers' fiduciary duty has been reduced to the notion that whatever can deliver the quickest [return on investment] is in the interest of the fund,” said Sonti. “What this misses is that often what promises to deliver the quickest [profit] also poses existential threats to the labor movement, public pensions, and the public sector more broadly. It's incumbent on those who oversee pension funds to recognize the real threats… that DOGE and the Trump administration more broadly present to their existence.”


	Forty years ago, pension funds were far more conservative, investing the bulk of their capital only in stocks and bonds. Yet the types of risky investments being made today — namely private equity, in which the 10 largest U.S. pension funds have invested over $300 billion, and which are subject to losing all of their value — continue to pass fiduciary muster at most pension funds, even those with managers who have fiercely rejected arguments in favor of divestment.

	











	Siedle points out that there is extremely little public information about this enormous sum of money pumped into the industry. “If you're going to manage public money, you must be subject to public scrutiny,” he said. “The private equity industry has successfully gone city by city, and state by state, arguing that their offering documents are proprietary and contain trade secrets,” excluding them from public records laws, meaning that the public lacks critical information about this increasingly influential industry. 


	What are the barriers to pension funds divesting from pro-Trump companies? Mike McCarthy, a professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz who studies the labor movement and pension funds, noted the “tremendous lack of democracy in these funds,” adding: “There's a lack of any oversight from workers about how these funds are invested.”


	McCarthy pointed to a $34-billion Dutch pension fund for retail sector workers that has a far more robust process for engaging its members and beneficiaries in investment practices than do most American pension funds. 


	Several years ago, the Dutch pension fund brought beneficiaries and members together for a multi-day discussion about how the fund was invested. A randomly selected group of participants chose to invest more in social good and public housing. “There was an explicit recognition in these recommendations that [beneficiaries would] be willing to give up a certain return on investment,” McCarthy said. “We just don't have that [kind of process] here.”

	Given the excesses of the current Trump administration, McCarthy called on public sector union members to be more vocal about the need to take control over the way their pensions are invested. Some of these unions have been outspoken, but others have historically been more reticent to criticize the investment strategy of their public pension fund managers. 


	“I think public sector unions should demand control over their investments,” said McCarthy. “Historically, the money that has gone into these funds has been considered deferred wages. It's their investment. They own it, but they don't control it.”

	In the official trailer for Billy Joel: And So It Goes, the musician considers a reality in which “Uptown Girl” was a Mozart piece. It's not entirely farfetched. His history as a musician started with listening to classical music. Besides, the singer and songwriter has learned not to count out the impossible. “Sometimes it's alien to me — this guy, Billy Joel. I don't know who that is, or what that is,” he says in the clip from the two-part HBO documentary. “I'm reminded of it when I go walk on the street. Oh, right, I'm that guy.”


	Joel doesn't have an explanation for how his first band, the Hassles, were ever successful (“I don't know one person that liked what we were doing”) or how he ended up dating the supermodel Christie Brinkley (“Me? I'm from Hicksville”). Still, he thinks he has the secret to the music mostly figured out. “If there was a skeleton key to unlocking what's behind the songs, it's my relationship with others,” he said.


	In the documentary, Joel will reflect on how his upbringing influenced his songwriting. “I'm still trying to put the pieces together,” he says in one scene. “I didn't know my father at all from eight years old until I was in my 20s. I've had a lot of hard lessons in my life.” There's trauma that lingers, but he learned how to flip it into music magic.

	Paul McCartney appears in the trailer to recall his first encounter with the singer, saying, “When I first heard Billy Joel, it was like, wait a minute. ‘Who's this?'” Even Bruce Springsteen popped in to admit, “Billy's melodies are better than mine.” For P!nk, Joel prevailed because “he cares about the human experience” and “he wrote songs that mattered.”

	Joel learned “that life is a fight,” and wore his songs like armor. “I think music saved my life. It gave me a reason to live,” he says. “Everything I've done and everything I've lived through has somehow found its way into my music.”


And So It Goes premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June. Joel was unable to attend the screening due to his recent brain disorder diagnosis. The first part of the film directed by Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin will premiere on HBO on Friday, July 18 at 8 p.m. EST followed part two on Friday, July 25.=

	When a California jury handed hip-hop mogul T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris an eye-popping $71.4 million award at a civil trial that pitted the couple's pop group OMG Girlz against a line of candy-colored plastic dolls, even Tiny was blown away.


	“I mean, wow. They did more than I thought they would,” she told Rolling Stone, referring to the generous jurors as she left the courthouse last September. “They blessed us more than beyond.”


	Three weeks later, T.I. appeared on an Atlanta radio station and announced his retirement from live performance. “I do not need the money anymore,” the rapper born Clifford Harris said. “I don't want people to pay me to hop around and sweat for their entertainment anymore.”


	After three trials spanning almost two years, it seemed like the couple's long battle was over. They proved toy titan MGA Entertainment stole the name, neon hair, and distinct fashions of their teen trio for seven dolls in MGA's wildly popular line of the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. dolls. And jurors found the infringement was willful.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But the war wasn't over. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that the largest chunk of the award — the $53.6 million awarded for punitive damages — was not supported by the evidence. He said the couple had a choice. They could take $1 for punitive damages on top of the $17.9 million compensatory damages and walk away, or they could opt for yet another new trial. On Thursday, the couple's lawyer rejected the $1, setting the stage for a fourth jury to hear evidence in the case.

	











	So how exactly did we get here after so much time and money already spent in court? It's been a long road stretching back decades. Here's your timeline to get up to speed:


MGA Launches Bratz Dolls, May 21, 2001


	MGA catapulted itself into the top ranks of toy manufacturing when it introduced its first line of wide-eyed and culturally diverse Bratz dolls. The original quartet of 10-inch dolls were Yasmin (Latina), Cloe (white), Jade (East Asian), and Sasha (Black). Company CEO Isaac Larian would go on the credit MGA with having “invented diversity in dolls.” Bratz toys became a billion-dollar brand within two years and were credited with revolutionizing a corner of the market long dominated by Mattel's Barbie.

 The OMG Girlz Are Formed, 2009


	A member of the Nineties R&B group Xscape as well as a songwriter known for the TLC hit “No Scrubs,” Tiny switched gears to management and formed the first version of the OMG Girlz with daughter Zonnique Pullins, Bahja Rodriguez, and other temporary members including Lil Wayne's daughter Reginae Carter. The group made its TV debut on Tiny's BET reality show Tiny and Toya. After Carter left, the group evolved into a trio with Pullins, Rodriguez, and new core member Breaunna Womack. The OMG Girlz later appeared on the 2012 VH1 show T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, and they were nominated for the Outstanding New Artist award at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards.


MGA Debuts L.O.L. Surprise! Dolls, Dec. 7, 2016


	When MGA launched its set of miniature collectible dolls known as L.O.L. Surprise!, the line became the company's new best-selling juggernaut. The blockbuster dolls quickly filled the void left by the waning popularity of the Bratz line. Famously dressed in crop tops, fishnet stockings and miniskirts, the Bratz toys were called out by the American Psychological Association for “sexualizing” young girls. The new L.O.L. Surprise! line featured smaller, brighter and less-edgy models sold in blind packaging that made each surprise “unboxing,” and its rush of feel-good neurotransmitters, part of the fun.

MGA Introduces the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. Line at Center of Case, July 10, 2019


	Looking to expand its new powerhouse product line, MGA released its L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. Outrageous Millennial Girls line with bigger dolls marketed as the big sisters of its prior offerings. Like the original line, the new dolls were sold in opaque packaging. But getting back to more of a Bratz aesthetic, the company added more articulation and more elaborate, fashion-forward outfits.

	











The Harrises Send Cease-and-Desist Letter, Dec. 8, 2020


	Testifying at trial, Tiny said she learned about the MGA dolls in late 2020 when someone texted her a photo showing a particular doll named “Chillax” on sale at Target. She said the doll's distinctive white and black two-piece costume was a clear copy of an outfit the OMG Girlz sported on their 2013 All Around The World tour. The doll also had neon blue hair. Tiny said she called Bahja Rodriguez's mom, who “immediately went crazy.” After that, Tiny contacted her lawyers, and the cease-and-desist letter accusing MGA of infringement was sent.


MGA Files Preemptive Lawsuit, Dec. 22, 2020


	After receiving the letter accusing it of copying the OMG Girlz's signature look, MGA rushed to federal court and asked a judge to step in and affirm that it owned everything about its L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. dolls and did nothing wrong. In the 10-page complaint, MGA said its L.O.L. Surprise! products were among the bestselling toys in the U.S. It also claimed OMG Girlz disbanded in 2015, so there was “no likelihood of confusion that the OMG Girlz sponsored or are associated with L.O.L. Surprise!”


T.I. and Tiny File Counterclaim, Feb. 22, 2021


	The Harrises, on behalf of the OMG Girlz, answered the lawsuit and filed a counterclaim alleging MGA illegally copied the trade dress, name and brand of the OMG Girlz without consent. They said Larian and MGA “engaged in both cultural appropriation and outright theft of the intellectual property, brand and image of a musical recording group of young multicultural women.”


First Trial, Jan. 25, 2023


	The first attempt to reach a verdict ended in a mistrial after jurors heard barred testimony accusing the toy company of “racist cultural appropriation.” U.S. District Court Judge James V. Selna made a pre-trial ruling that the Harrises had to steer clear of their claims that Larian engaged in a “routine practice” of “using his doll business to misappropriate the likeness of Black female artists.” So it was a violation when a consumer testified on video that she “stopped purchasing” MGA's dolls when she learned the OMG Girlz were not affiliated with the toys. The woman said she “did not want to support a company that steals from African Americans and their ideas.”

T.I. & Tiny are in a SoCal courtroom for start of civil trial over claim L.O.L. doll maker copied the “name, image & trade dress” of their girl group OMG GirlzTiny's daughter Zonnique Pullins is in the group & here todayHere's pic of member Bahja Rodriguez & one of the dolls pic.twitter.com/fOzHd2jafE


Second Trial, May 9, 2023


	A second trial in the case started in Santa Ana, California, with Judge Selna at the helm again. Two weeks later, a jury returned a verdict in favor of MGA. The jury found that the OMG Girlz had not proven that the L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G. doll line infringed the OMG Girlz' colorful trade dress or misappropriated the OMG Girlz' name, likeness, or identity.

	











Verdict Overturned, June 8, 2023


	The U.S. Supreme Court issued a major ruling that found the First Amendment didn't necessarily protect a dog toy company that created a humorous chew toy that looked like a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The ruling led Judge Selna to find that one of the jury instructions related to the Harrises' trade dress claim was erroneous. He granted the Harrises the right to another trial.


Third Trial Begins, Sept. 3, 2024


	When the Harrises started their third trial, they narrowed the scope of their claims to just seven dolls out of the dozens they previously challenged. T.I. and Tiny both took the witness stand, but it was MGA designer Lora Stephens whose testimony may have been the most significant. She told jurors she knew about the OMG Girlz before she started working at MGA in 2017 and that she followed Tiny on Instagram. She also had a photo of Womack on her Pinterest board, though the inspiration board had approximately 1,200 images total. Stephens admitted MGA had not asked her about her knowledge of OMG Girlz before the company responded to a discovery request in the case saying no employees knew about the group before the lawsuit.


New Verdict Awards Harrises $71 million, Sept. 23, 2024


	The jury found MGA infringed on the OMG Girlz' trade dress with respect to all seven dolls: Chillax, Roller Chick, Metal Chick, Bhad Gurl, Prism, Miss Divine, and Runaway Diva. The jury also found the same seven dolls misappropriated the OMG Girlz' name, likeness, or identity. The panel awarded $17,872,253 in compensatory damages and $53,616,759 in punitive damages. “I think justice was served. I think it's a testament to the relentlessness and resilience of my wife, daughter, and nieces,” T.I. told Rolling Stone by phone, minutes after the verdict. “We're just happy we were able to come out on top and fight for creatives and our intellectual property that large corporations seem to think is just public domain and free for all to come and grab and use.”


MGA Challenge, May 27, 2025


	MGA filed a motion claiming “the staggering amount of the punitive award” violated its right to due process. The company asked Judge Selna to step in and vacate the “constitutionally excessive” award or, at a minimum, order a new trial.


Punitive Damages Award Gutted, July 8, 2025

	Judge Selna issued a ruling that effectively slashed the $53.6 million punitive award down to $1 while leaving the $17.9 million award for compensatory damages in place. While he faulted Larian for the “belittling” way he treated the Harrises, the judge said that the evidence at trial, in his opinion, failed to show MGA designers “willfully” copied the OMG Girlz. He described Larian as an Iranian immigrant who proudly sold a “diverse line of dolls” well before launching his L.O.L. Surprise! line.

	











	As Rolling Stone previously reported, Judge Selna gave the Harrises the option of rejecting his proposed $1 in punitive damages and going for another trial. His ruling did not clarify the contours such a trial would take. In a statement to Rolling Stone, the lead lawyer for T.I. and Tiny said he believed it would be only a “mini-trial” on the issue of whether MGA acted “willfully” and should be on the hook for some new amount of punitive damages. “We expect another jury will be similarly offended by MGA's maliciousness and copying,” the lawyer, John Keville, said. A day later, on July 9, the Harrises filed paperwork confirming they wanted to try again with a fourth trial.

Lando Norris is sitting in a London hotel room and unboxing a Labubu. 


	Only it's not an official Labubu on this day (because who can find one in this economy?) but rather a similar blind box from the viral bag charm's parent company, POP MART. Norris has just been handed a Care Bears series blind box to open, and he playfully teases the ripping of the packaging, drawing it out just long enough for dramatic effect.


	“I actually don't have a Labubu yet,” the F1 driver tells the room, which on this day has no less than a dozen important-looking people in it, all decked out in papaya-colored McLaren gear and blue Hilton hotel badges. Norris closes his eyes, flashes a smile, then pulls a clover-green Care Bear from the box. “Thank you so much,” he says. “This'll be my lucky charm for the weekend.”


	Three days later, Norris is behind the wheel of his chrome-colored McLaren at the British Grand Prix, where he overtakes teammate Oscar Piastri on lap 44 and hangs on to claim the checkered flag eight laps later. It's the British driver's maiden win at his home track and it gives McLaren its first F1 victory at Silverstone since Lewis Hamilton in 2008. Lucky Lando indeed.




	Of course those who have followed Lando Norris' career know there's more than luck involved when it comes to his rapid rise through the Formula 1 ranks, which culminated in him suddenly competing for the Driver's Championship against Max Verstappen last year, pushing the four-time World Champ up until the third-to-last race of the season. This season, Norris is second in the standings, just a few points behind Piastri, as McLaren looks to repeat as Constructor's Champs. Though he's been labeled in the past by some as “immature” and “arrogant,” Norris has silenced critics — and perhaps his own self doubt — with impressive showings both on — and off — the track.




	The growth was evident in an Instagram message Norris posted following his Silverstone win. “A weekend I'll remember forever,” he wrote, “made even better by having the people who've been with me since day one all there to enjoy it too.”



A post shared by Lando Norris (@lando)


	The F1 star's newfound hospitality also takes shape in a new activation between McLaren Racing and Hilton, the global hospitality brand that has been a partner of the F1 team for 20 years. To celebrate the occasion, Norris recently helped to unveil the hotel's “Stay Like McLaren Racing” suite at The Trafalgar St. James London, Curio Collection by Hilton.


	Created in collaboration with the McLaren Formula 1 Team, the suite features two rooms of racing-inspired gear, decor and activations, all decked out in McLaren's signature “papaya” colorway. While one room offers a bed and living space (complete with a welcome package and virtual greeting from team principal Zak Brown), the other room features a “heritage hub,” with twin racing simulators, a “pit wall” airing race day replays, an in-room bar, and scores of new and retro McLaren merch (including Norris and Oscar Piastri uniforms hanging from replica lockers). 


	Guests also receive a smoothie delivery inspired by the drivers each morning: Norris' “Energy Smoothie” features papaya, natch, along with mango, ginger and electrolytes, while Piastri's “Morning Change” smoothie uses bananas, berries, milk, honey and Optimum Nutrition protein.


	Fans can book a night at the “Stay Like McLaren Racing” suite from now until July 20, just in time to celebrate Norris' recent win at the the Formula 1 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Hilton will offer other “Hilton Honors Experiences” to Hilton Honors members throughout the year.




	For the Bristol-born Norris, winning at nearby Silverstone was more than a dream come true — it was proof that his years of hard work and dedication are finally paying off. It was also a reminder for the 25-year-old to give himself grace and sometimes, to just let the chips fall where they may.


	“Sometimes you're confident and you're excited for a race, but it's not like you can be completely prepared for it,” he says. “You don't know what's going to happen. So you just have to wing it at times and go with the flow.”


	Three days before taking victory at Silverstone, Norris talked to Rolling Stone about balancing off-track partnerships with on-track performance, re-shaping his winning mindset, and how, six years into his Formula 1 career, he's already thinking about his legacy.




We're here in London at your home race. What are your earliest memories of Silverstone?


	The first time I ever went to this Formula 1 race with McLaren was 2017 I think, which was one of my first appearances with McLaren as part of the team and it was as cool as you can get because it was at Silverstone.


	But my first-ever one, I honestly can't remember how old I was — I was probably 10 — and it was my dad, my brother and myself, just us three. We went on a Thursday or Friday. I think we were racing at a cart track nearby and we went during one of the days or halfway through the day, just to kind of get a quick look. I was so small I could barely see because I couldn't see over any of the barriers, and we didn't have like grandstand tickets or anything, so I barely got to see much. But that was like my first smell and taste of what it was like to be there on a race weekend. We waited outside the paddock where the gates are, and the drivers are coming out, and I remember I had my race helmet and we tried to get as many people to sign it as possible. And at home now, I've still got that very, very, very first helmet I ever had with some signatures from the drivers.


Who did you see? Who signed it?


	I think the best one I had was Jenson [Button]. I got maybe four or five drivers and a couple of — at the time, I didn't even know who they were — but it was probably like team managers or something and that was cool for me, you know, to get that first experience. Then there were some drivers that well… were not so nice, but I don't want to say who.


You can put them on blast in Rolling Stone right now.


	No, no, I never talk about someone because sometimes, drivers can be in — even for myself — you can not be in the best mood or you're in a rush or something. So you know, there are times when maybe I don't sign as much stuff as I should, but because of different situations. So I never talk bad about someone.


We're here at Silverstone with Hilton, who are one of the McLaren Racing partners. What is it about this partnership that resonates with you?


	Traveling is pretty much half of our time and like half of our job. The most important thing, especially for myself, is rest and recovery. In my list of priorities and how I can make sure I'm as prepared as can be for a race, sleep is probably one of, if not the highest. And for the team, especially when we're traveling all over the world in different time zones, Hilton is there to try and make us feel as comfortable as possible, not just for me, but for the over 100 people that normally travel every single weekend.




Do you have specific routines or rituals to help you fall asleep?


	Everyone wants a good night's sleep and clearly, everyone has their own preferences. Hilton's always very good at trying to understand what everyone likes in particular. For me, I like the more blacked-out room, where you don't see the daylight in bed. I'm also particular about the temperature of a room. I want it as cold as possible. The minimum. I just don't like heat.


	Sometimes I take my own pillow with me, but sometimes I tell them what I like — for me, I like quite a firm pillow. Too soft and then it wraps around too much [pointing to neck]. For us, the neck is one of the most important things, so I can never afford to wake up with a bad neck because I slept funny. Trying to keep that consistency is one of the most important things.


	And then I like little snacks, like mints and Kinders and subtle things that aren't needed, but just nice to have.


Do you like working on these brand partnerships or do they sometimes get in the way of training?


	Well you want someone who actively wants to try and make your team and your situation better. And then you want to obviously be able to give something back in return. For us, one of those big things is our fans and our supporters, because without them, we don't have Formula 1. So we are always trying to have a good situation [with partners] where we can help each other, but at the same time we can give more access to the fans, the supporters of McLaren, because they're very, very important to us.


	As drivers, we know we have to be part of all of these things, so the more attractive and cool they can make it for us, the more it's going to be better for everyone, right? We're drivers, you know, not actors or anything. So the more fun it can be for us, the more of a positive it's going to be for the fans, for the partners, and for the team.


This is your sixth year as a full-time Formula 1 driver. How do you think your mindset or awareness has changed?


	I think you get so used to it being normal, and you kind of get used to waking up on a Sunday, knowing that it's race day. I remember the first year or two in Formula 1, I would wake up on a Sunday and be like, ‘Oh God!' You're kind of excited, nervous… you don't know what's going to happen because there are a lot of new situations. Now I'm able to anticipate much better what might happen, and I'm able to narrow down a lot more of the situations I might be in. So that's just experience. 




Do you still get nervous before a race?


	There are still times when I'm obviously more anxious, more nervous, all of these things, and then maybe not feeling as comfortable or confident or whatever. But then you've got to try and know when those times are and turn it into excitement, and then the excitement turns into confidence when you kind of have a good plan in place. Knowing how to turn different situations into a positive one is really the main thing. But I don't think you can avoid ever being overly excited or nervous or anxious at times. I think sometimes you've just got to roll with it.


What is your attack plan like when you get to the track each weekend?


	I think for some things, it's good to have a very good plan. But at the same time, with racing, you can have plenty of plans in place, but we're also human at the end of it, so you can't plan for what everyone else is going to do. And I think those are sometimes the exciting races, especially when they say there's rain or it's drying out. Yes, it's nerve racking, but it's also exciting because there's opportunity for everyone, including yourself. I think other races where it's just going to be completely dry or whatever, it's much easier to put a decent plan in place and try and execute that. But when it's like this weekend, where it's probably going to rain for maybe half the race or something, that's one where you're like, ‘Okay, what's going to happen?' 


Do you like driving in the rain?


	Some of the time, those conditions are the most scary, nerve-racking conditions, especially when you might be on slicks in the wet [rain]. I say scary and nerve-racking because it's so easy to crash and so easy to be off, and for everything to just be gone. But it's also a time when there's more opportunity than ever before. So it's really playing with fire and it's a very risk-reward game, and sometimes those are the most exciting.


Since this is for Rolling Stone, would you say you're a big music guy?


	I like music. Whenever I'm in my room, whenever I go for a run, whenever I'm in the car — not the race car, but in the other car — I'll be listening to music. But I also like to have some peace and quiet every now and then because everything is so noisy. There are always so many people [around] so having some some quietness is good, but I'm a music guy. 


What's like, your shout-out-loud, roll-down-the-windows song?


	I mean, I'm more chill than anything, so it'll be like a country song. 




Who's your favorite country singer?


	The easy one is Zach Bryan. But I'm not very good at artist names.


We talked about mindset earlier, but what is a lesson that you've learned recently?


	I think one of the best things you learn in Formula 1 is that there are so many people that work within a team — over a thousand people work with McLaren. And what I'm learning is just to utilize the people that you have around you. In Formula 1, you have several people assigned to every single thing that you can think of. So everyone there has a specialty and is an expert in different areas. 


	So it's about knowing when to not just think that you can do it, but knowing when to go, ‘Okay, maybe I need to speak to this person, maybe they can help,' or ‘Maybe they've experienced it before.' Sometimes I would love to think that I got it and I can do it and I don't need to [ask for help]. I think you learn that everyone there has something that they can offer to help you. And sometimes vice versa, you know, you'll help them. But I think that's probably one of the best things I've learned.

“Some people want to be remembered as the ‘best driver ever.' But I don't know, I feel like eventually everyone forgets.”


You have so many young fans that look up to you, though of course, you're still young yourself. But I wonder, do you ever think ahead to what you would want your legacy to be?


	I guess the only thing that I want is for people to know the kind of person I was, rather than anything else. I'm not fussed about having a legacy or being remembered as being one of the best drivers or anything. It's just something that I'm not too bothered by. You know, some people are different. Some people want to be remembered as the ‘best driver ever.' But I don't know, I feel like eventually everyone forgets. So for me, there's no use. There's no excitement for me in thinking of those things. 




	For me, it's just trying to achieve the things that I want to achieve in my career and in my life, and share those moments with others. And then just be remembered for being the person that I am, more than the driver that I was.

	On paper, Lena Dunham and Megan Stalter seem like an ideal creative match for their new Netflix comedy Too Much. Dunham is the co-creator and star of Girls, the acclaimed (if polarizing) HBO comedy about Hannah, a young woman with a knack for making situations uncomfortable in a hurry. Stalter, meanwhile, has spent the last few years on Hacks playing Hollywood assistant turned talent manager Kayla, a character with a lack of self-awareness that rivals Hannah's. Dunham doesn't act much anymore (though she has a small role in Too Much), which means she needs someone else to channel her particular blend of comic neuroses and emotional bull-in-a-china-shop tendencies. 


	Enter Stalter, who in Too Much plays Jessica, a TV-commercial producer just out of a long-term relationship with Zev (Michael Zegen). In an attempt to move past her anger and confusion over the breakup, she takes an assignment that will temporarily relocate her from New York to London. She's fixated on Zev's new girlfriend, an influencer named Wendy Jones (Emily Ratajowski), and regularly records private Instagram videos where she directly addresses Wendy and brags about how well she's doing since the breakup. But she can't let memories of Zev go, which complicates both her work and her new romance with Felix (Will Sharpe, from The White Lotus Season Two), a struggling musician with a mysterious past. 

	











	There's a lot to like about Too Much, which Dunham co-created with her musician husband, Luis Felber. Sharpe is incredibly charming as Felix, a character who feels very specific and lived-in. The dramatic beats of Jessica and Felix's messy courtship land effectively, and Stalter and Sharpe have strong chemistry. Dunham, who writes and directs many of the episodes, is highly skilled at comic set pieces, and there's at least one big laugh-out-loud sequence in each installment.

	But Jessica herself is a trickier proposition. On Girls, Dunham had a handle on exactly how oblivious or canny Hannah was meant to be at any given moment, and the shifts between the two modes felt natural. With Too Much, this toggling is more jarring. At times, it feels as if Dunham wants Stalter to play Jessica as a woman who is trying very hard to not embody the series' title. At others, it can feel like Stalter is just doing a slightly less ridiculous version of Kayla. The two modes never quite come together, making it harder to engage with either the more sincere moments or the most absurd ones, because Jessica can come across as two largely disconnected people.

	Dunham wears her influences on her sleeve. The show's main title graphic evokes the logo from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which was also about a woman in her thirties starting over in a new city after leaving a long relationship. Andrew Rannells plays Jameson, the estranged husband of Jessica's older sister Nora — played by Dunham, in a Girls reunion with Rannells (they were exes there, too) — and Jessica's colleague, who encourages her to give England a try because “you love movies where women fan themselves and die of tuberculosis and shit!” Each episode's title is a riff on a famous romantic movie: “Nonsense & Sensibility,” “Ignore Sunrise,” “One Wedding and a Sex Pest,” etc. In one installment, Jessica is excited to walk through Notting Hill and pose in front of a blue door like Hugh Grant's from the film, while Felix, who grew up around the kinds of broken kids who lived in the neighborhood, is less enchanted. And calling her own character Nora is almost certainly a tribute to Dunham's idol and friend, rom-com master Nora Ephron.


	Rounding out the cast, Rita Wilson and Rhea Perlman also have recurring roles as, respectively, Jessica's mother and grandmother, who live in the same house as Nora and her adolescent son due to various financial troubles. The family scenes feel largely detached from Jessica's story, and like little more than an excuse for Dunham to work with actors she admires. But those scenes tend to be very funny, and funny forgives a lot. Ditto for subplots about Jessica's co-workers, including director Janicza Bravo (Zola) as a fellow expat exploring her sexuality, the great Richard E. Grant as Jessica's uptight boss, Andrew Scott as a pretentious director, and Naomi Watts as Grant's seemingly perfect wife.

	The material about the ebbs and flows of the relationship between Jessica and Felix, two damaged people who only seem to feel truly comfortable with one another, is excellent. There's a scene in an early episode where Felix gives his portable CD player to Jessica so she can listen to a mix he made for her, insisting that she's under no pressure to like any of the songs. For several minutes, the two of them are just lying wordlessly in bed next to one another, and the connection between them is palpable, despite them not doing anything at all. 


	And the show's most reliable source of comedy is Jessica's understandable sense of discomfort and confusion with how Felix remains on great terms with his exes, all of whom seem so charismatic and sex-positive (particularly French actor Adele Exarchopoulos as one of several women Felix knows named Polly) she can never quite tell if they want to keep sleeping with him — and, for that matter, whether he wouldn't mind doing that, too. Her anxiety then leads to her overindulging with alcohol or drugs, including one episode where she takes way too much ketamine and asks, “Am I the Meghan Markle of, like, fat white bitches?” And since Felix is sober after a long period of self-destructive behavior himself, this creates some interesting tension.

	But whether with Felix or on her own, Jessica is a bit all over the map, with her behavior frequently feeling like it's meant to meet the needs of a particular scene or joke rather than as a consistent throughline for the season. Maybe this is on Dunham as writer-director, or on Stalter, or a bit of both, but that inconsistency leaves Too Much feeling like less than the sum of its impressive parts.  


All 10 episodes of Too Much are now streaming on Netflix. I've seen the whole season.

	As a teenage musician, Jon Batiste used to call himself “a new-age blues artist.” Now, many genre-jumps later, he's taking a deeply enjoyable left turn towards roots music on his seventh studio album, Aug. 22's Big Money — and reminding the world he's always been a bluesman at heart. “I'm just now making an explicit Americana blues statement,” Batiste says, “but for me, it's at the beginning. It's always the undercurrent. I think about everything that I have done, and it all is in some way a form of homage to the blues.”


	The album ranges from a full-on Sly Stone homage on the Andra Day duet “Lean on My Love” to the title track's mutated Chess Records R&B to the entirely unexpected rockabilly romp of “Pinnacle,” with Batiste playing at least as much guitar as piano throughout the album. As a whole, you could call it Americana, or simply rock & roll — and Batiste sees the album as part of a recent wave of Black cultural reclamation, a “repatriation process” that also includes Beyoncé‘s Cowboy Carter (which he guested on while he was in the middle of recording this album) and even Ryan Coogler's Sinners.

	











	 ”American history has oftentimes gone through this pattern of something being born and then it being transferred to anyone else other than Black folks,” Batiste says. “I had the honor to play with the Rolling Stones, and I know Paul [McCartney]. I love the Beatles, but how did this thing called rock & roll that was invented by a bunch of black sharecroppers and farmers in the South and then spearheaded by Little Richard and Fats Domino and Chuck Berry end up being [seen as] the result of the British Invasion? Rock & roll became our national music and became the face of our youth culture and national culture — and a white face at that — when, self-admittedly, they were playing songs and speaking to the ideas of these Black Americans.”

	The album was born in spontaneous moments on Batiste's tour last year, his first real outing as a solo artist. “I would run into people on the road and we'd go into sessions,” he says. “Every song is a performance. It's me playing and singing at the same time with the band. All of us in the same room, breathing the same air, creating onto the tape.” Batiste is also launching a tour behind Big Money, kicking off Aug. 27 in Kansas City, MO and stopping at 30 venues throughout the country.

	Five of the album's nine tracks feature production by frequent Jay-Z collaborator No ID.  “Music is so monolithic these days,” No ID says. “It's tough to find people who have learned it enough to understand it from multiple perspectives, culturally. Jon is not just a genius-level player, but he's a highly educated and scientific thinker…. Because I had an opportunity to work with someone so skilled and diverse, we weren't in a box in terms of what we could do and what audience we could target. Jon is the most fun human I've ever worked in the studio with.” It was No ID's idea to give the album's final song, “Angels,” an airy reggae feel, and it ended up becoming a callback to the globetrotting sound of Batiste's last album of originals, 2023's World Music Radio.


Big Money‘s capitalism-tweaking title track (and first single) offers a broader mission statement for the album, as sung by Batiste and The Womack Sisters, who happen to be Sam Cooke's granddaughters: “Might as well live for something you can feel/ Might as well live for something real.” As that lyric suggests, Batiste sees his organic approach as, in part, a rejoinder to the rise of A.I. music:  ”I think about this album being a direct statement of the importance of people keeping these traditions alive,” he says. “AI is not going to ever replace this sort of practice. But I do fear that in the short term we'll forget what this means, and why it's important, unless artists make statements that are definitively of the essence of communal expression in the traditions of our music, and make them in a way that's relevant to the contemporary mind and contemporary culture.”

	One of the album's most striking moments is Batiste's piano-and-voice living-room duet with Randy Newman on “Lonely Avenue,” a bluesy Doc Pomus-penned ballad that Ray Charles made famous in the Fifties. The song was an unexpected product of the friendship Batiste has struck up recently with Newman, 81, who has faced serious health struggles in recent years — they initially bonded over their mutual gigs scoring Pixar movies, and soon started talking about New Orleans music and more. Newman hadn't been singing or playing much, but when Batiste started playing piano at the older man's house, he suddenly started singing along. On his next visit, Batiste came with recording equipment. “He was coming alive right before us,” he says.

	











	Batiste hopes other musicians follow Big Money‘s roots-conscious approach. “We have such a profoundly rich cultural inheritance in America that many of us don't know of, don't fully embrace, don't fully understand,” he says. “And artists just have to keep making statements that point back to that and counter things that are trying to dilute that or erase it.”

“Trust” showcases an unexpected evolution in Innellea's sonic palette, incorporating breakbeat elements that transform the energy in ways that have been captivating audiences across his recent performances. It sees Innellea join forces with SCRIPT, the 26-year-old producer behind standout Afterlife track “On The Low” and viral hit “Where I'm From,” standing tall on the newly launched label's strengthening ethos of fostering connections between established and emerging talent in the scene. SCRIPT, based in California, has quickly gained recognition across the American festival circuit, performing at major events like EDC Las Vegas, EDC Orlando, Electric Zoo, and Seismic Dance Event.

The track has already proven its potency as a secret weapon in Innellea's live sets, with its distinctive breakbeat section creating moments of pure dancefloor euphoria. Whether deployed during peak-time intensity or deeper atmospheric segments, “Trust” delivers what Innellea describes as “unmistakable impact” every time it drops.



This collaborative ethos has defined the Finding Home project since its inception, with the full 12-track compilation aiming to weave together diverse artistic perspectives into a cohesive exploration of connection and belonging. The album's September 5th release will complete a journey that began with community involvement through belonging's dedicated Telegram channel, where fans help shape everything from artwork selection to single choices. Innellea recently expanded belonging's community-driven vision with the launch of the belonging ‘Inclusion Series', his new DJ mix podcast series. The first installment sees the label-head take the reins with a mix of energetic IDs, his favorite current dancefloor weapons, and another taste of what's to come in Finding Home

With “Trust,” Innellea and SCRIPT have created something that transcends traditional collaboration, forging a piece that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant – exactly the kind of authentic connection that Finding Home was designed to celebrate.

ABOUT INNELLEA – A visionary live act, DJ, and producer who fuses melancholic, cinematic soundscapes with relentless percussive energy. His performances embody the spirit between indie and global dance, blending underground dynamism with genre-bending creativity and erupting into experimental breakouts that defy conventional boundaries. That's what he also captures in his own record label, “belonging”. It´s more than a label: it's a community for music, art, and the shared human experience that connects them. A space dedicated to the feeling of finding home.

Christian Vasquez, Senior Project Architect and Business Development Executive at National Engineering Bureau (NEB), has been re-elected President of the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) Dubai Chapter for the 2025–2026 fiscal year.

Influential developers and real estate giants like Emaar, DP World, Sobha Realty, Majid Al Futtaim, Aldar, and Expo City Dubai also participated. The event's prestige was further amplified by the presence of dignitaries and representatives from Dubai Municipality, TECOM Group, the Philippine Consulate General in Dubai & Northern Emirates, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Middle East, and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gulf Chapter.

A Leading Professional Network in Dubai and Beyond

UAP Dubai stands as a dynamic and influential professional community of over 500 licensed architects, all accredited by the Philippine Professional Regulatory Commission, making significant contributions across architectural firms, government agencies, contractors, and developers throughout the region.

Supernatural‘s most memorable episodes are also the most heartbreaking.


	By Ananyaa Bhowmik

Supernatural was never about monsters or epic lore, or angels and the apocalypse. At its core, the series was about family, plus freewill vs the vagaries of fate. It was the Impala and impossible choices. And two brothers who found hope in heartbreak, tenderness despite the trauma, and each other at the end and beginning of every fight and fall. Don't get me wrong, it was great fun to watch them hunt wendigos and go up against angels and befuddle Crowley (Mark Sheppard) time and again. But the moments, the episodes that really stuck were the ones that often left us a weeping mess on the floor for days. 

Like all good scars, these episodes remind us of their presence in the unlikeliest moments, hurting just like the day they were first branded in our memories:

This was one of the first episodes that made me stop seeing Supernatural as just a fun monster show. Dean (Jensen Ackles) sitting beside Sam's (Jared Padalecki) lifeless body, completely shattered, was heartbreak in real time. His voice cracks, his words stumble. There's no cool hunter facade here, just raw, unbearable grief. You feel every second of his desperation, every ounce of love that drives him to make a deal that will cost him everything.

What made it worse was knowing this wasn't just about saving Sam. It was about Dean not knowing how to be without him. That demon deal was the beginning of a long, painful spiral, and we didn't even realize it yet. This episode perfectly encapsulates the heart of the show: the Winchesters choosing each other over and over, even when it destroys them. 

This one crept up on me. Sam opens his heart a little, which is rare enough, and we get to see him with someone who brings out his gentle, hopeful side. But of course, it's Supernatural, so that sliver of happiness is short-lived. When Madison (Emmanuelle Vaugier) asks Sam to kill her before she loses control, the heartbreak is quiet, personal. 

The part that truly stuck with me was how Dean waits outside, giving Sam space but carrying the weight too. You see him flinch when he hears the gunshot. The silence that follows is deafening. It's one of those moments where the show reminds you that saving people doesn't always feel like winning. It's duty in the face of heartbreak. It's mourning yet doing the right thing anyway.

This episode feels like a series finale because it was meant to be one, and emotionally, it absolutely delivers. Everything leads up to that final confrontation between Sam/Lucifer and Dean. Sam manages to break through by remembering something so simple: the toy army man stuck in the Impala's ashtray. It's a simple reminder that even in a show filled with angels and demons, it's the human moments and connections that matter most.

What was especially heartbreaking to watch was Dean's decision to be there for Sam, even if it meant watching him fall into Hell. And then that final scene with Sam standing outside Lisa (Cindy Sampson) and Ben's (Nicholas Elia) home, just watching. Not saying anything because he didn't need to for us to understand the silent heartbreak of seeing Dean happy, truly happy in a life that he's not a part of anymore.

You start this one thinking maybe, just maybe, they'll pull it off. Jo (Alona Tal), Ellen (Samantha Ferris), the Colt, Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino) in their sights. There's momentum, there's fire. And then Jo is hurt, and you realize no one is safe. Her death would've been hard enough, but Ellen choosing to die with her daughter? That's where it hits the hardest. Their goodbye is one of the most tender, courageous moments the show ever gave us.

The aftermath is just as powerful. The way they look when Bobby (Jim Beaver) throws their photo into the fire speaks volumes for their grief. It's devastating in its simplicity. The show doesn't dwell on their pain with monologues or dramatic scoring, it just lets it be. And somehow, that restraint makes it hit harder.

Even in a show full of death and loss, I think no one expected Bobby to really die. He was always the rock, the one who holds the fort and keeps the porchlight on so the boys could always find their way home. But then the show did the unthinkable. But not before ripping our hearts out in the moments before he is gone. His regrets, his grief, his love for the boys — it all came pouring out as he wandered through his memories. Watching him revisit his childhood trauma and the quiet joy of watching a young Dean play catch was gutting. 

And then came the moment he woke up just long enough to say “Idjits.” Classic Bobby. But behind that laugh was something deep and devastating. After all, that wasn't just a nickname. It was love. It was goodbye. It was everything Bobby wanted to say without getting sentimental. And when the flatline came, it wasn't just his heart stopping. It felt like ours did too.

So much of Season 8 is about guilt, distance, and the unspoken tension between the brothers, and the finale cracks it all wide open. As Sam prepares to finish the trials, fully ready to die, Dean begs him not to. Not as a soldier, not as a hunter, but as a brother. 

For once, there's no yelling or blaming. Just fear, love, and vulnerability. The moment feels hard-earned. After a whole season of the two drifting apart, we see them choose each other again, despite everything. It's when we realise all over again that the show's real magic isn't in the spells or sigils. It's in the strength of family, in love that doesn't quit, even and especially when it gets hard.

This episode is a slow emotional burn. Sam and Dean die and end up in Heaven, but instead of paradise, they're thrown into their own fractured memories. This is when Dean realises a heartbreaking truth. While Sam's happiest moments are when he's away from the family, Dean's are filled with them. And that disconnect? It's jarring. You realize these two have loved each other fiercely, but never exactly understood each other.

It doesn't end in a fight. The realisation just sits there. Uncomfortable. Honest. You realise that Dean is losing faith in the one thing he thought he could always count on, that it's him and Sam against the world, apocalypse or not. This episode doesn't give you easy answers. There is resentment; there is love. And there is the uncomfortable realisation that, while the boys have always had each others' backs, their unique traumas shaped them into two very different people, creating a palpable distance between them, one they aren't sure they can bridge this time. 

This episode is about a heartbreak that spans generations. When Sam and Dean go back in time to protect their parents from Anna (Julie McNiven), it becomes clear this isn't just a mission. It's a rare chance to see the family they lost. Watching them interact with a young Mary (Amy Jaclyn Gumenick) and John (Matthew Joseph Cohen), knowing everything the latter don't, hurts in ways I didn't expect. 

And when Mary realises the truth, that her sons are standing in front of her, all grown up, it's gut-wrenching. You can see the fear in her eyes. She realises she's marked for tragedy, and that her children will carry that burden long after she's gone. It's a moment of clarity that hurts more than any monster ever could. 

This episode picks up in the aftermath of Season 1. Dean's stuck in a ghost-like limbo, watching his family struggle to keep him alive. John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), for all his flaws, is suddenly more vulnerable than we've ever seen him. When he makes that deal with the demon to save Dean, it's heartrending, not because he dies, but because it's the one time we seem to act purely out of fatherly love since Mary's (Samantha Smith) passing.

And yet he still can't say it outright. Instead, after making Dean promise to take care of Sam and apologizing for making him grow up too fast, he whispers something in Dean's ear. Then he's gone, leaving a hollow ache behind. We don't hear his final words, but Dean's reaction says enough. That silence was louder than any reveal could've been. It's a messy, emotional episode that captures what the Winchesters are all about: doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, and carrying the fallout forever.

Say what you want about the final season, but “Carry On” delivered the emotional closure we didn't know we needed. Dean dying on just another hunt, with his brother by his side, was oddly fitting. There is no blaze of glory. No apocalyptic implications. Just a Hunter going down the only way he knows — fighting. Every word he says to Sam shows his obvious pride in his younger brother. But it also shows he is tired. So, Sam tells him it's okay, because that's the only way Dean would stop holding on.

In the scenes that follow, we watch Sam grow old without him, every moment chipping away at our hearts. And then it's his time. When his son, Dean (Spencer Borgeson), tells him it's okay to let go, and he does, we realise that things had finally come full circle. The end is nothing grand. It's a hug and a reunion and a rest well-earned.

He previously predicted Donald Trump's second term and BLM 

Nicolas Aujula, a psychic who is said to have accurately predicted the COVID-19 pandemic, has made a series of horrifying claims about 2025, and perhaps most shockingly, one of them has already come true.

Whether you believe it or not, there's something strikingly alluring about predictions. From Baba Vanga's almost supernatural accuracy to Nostradamus' foretellings about global economic collapse, I will never refuse a brief – and somewhat shaky – look into the future.

A post shared by Therapist Astrologer Filmmaker (@nicolasaujula)



South London's Nicolas Aujula, who claims to have accurately predicted everything from Donald Trump's 2024 Presidency to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, has possessed the ability to see the future since he was 17 years old.

His first prediction for 2025 is that sometime “from the middle of the year”, WW3 will kick off. Considering the prevalence of WW3-themed articles right now, and growing conflicts in several areas of the world, this is proboably a prediction we were all expecting. With that in mind, here are the safest countries in the world.

Nicolas further noted how 2025 will be “a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world, where we will see horrific acts of human evil and violence towards each other in the name of religion and nationalism.”

We humans have never shied away from “horrific acts of human evil”, but in 2025 so far, we've had: Alligator Alcatraz, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, the continued persecution of Trans people, Diddy's trial, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, and the rise of Reform UK. Yeah, 2025 has been pretty sh*t.

On the subject of slightly fluffier predictions, albeit still depressing, Nicolas accurately predicted the breakdown of Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's nine-year relationship. The couple officially separated earlier this month, despite being seen on holiday together just this week.

“Katy Perry will have marriage problems in 2025, and Cate Blanchett has a successful year,” he said. “I've had visions of her bagging a lot of awards for her work.”

Can he predict that I will become a billionaire?

Entertainment Critic

Another day, another Stephen King adaptation—this time, of the prolific author's 2019 thriller The Institute. 

The story of a group of children who are kidnapped by a mysterious organization for seemingly malevolent purposes, King's novel is a hybrid of his own Firestarter and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. From its unique terminology to its cold, menacing atmosphere, Benjamin Cavell's MGM+ series (July 13) is as faithful as they come. 

Yet like its source, it's a saga that's short on real sparks, treading such well-worn supernatural territory that even the best efforts of stars Ben Barnes and Mary Louise Parker aren't enough to make it more than a passable entry in the ever-burgeoning King-to-screen catalogue.

From the outside, 14-year-old Jake Ellis (Joe Freeman) looks like the rest of his Timberwolves-loving Minneapolis peers. In reality, however, he's a child prodigy who's on the cusp of receiving an opportunity to attend MIT that will force his parents to uproot their lives and relocate to New England. That's not to be, since one evening Jake is snatched from his bed, and when he awakens, he's in a facsimile of his room that exists in a cold gray building. 

Emerging into a hallway that's covered in strange elementary school-style posters, Jake meets Kalisha (Simone Miller), who explains that he's now a resident of The Institute, whose pre-adult residents are all either TK (telekinetic) or TP (telepathic). Given that objects have a funny habit of moving around Jake when he's upset, this isn't altogether stunning news to the kid, and he's soon welcomed into a group that includes trusting George (Arien So), nervous Iris (Birva Pandya), and rebellious Nicky (Fionn Laird).

As Jake learns, the Institute is run by cunning head honcho Ms. Sigsby (Parker), her ruthless chief of security Stackhouse (Julian Richings), and rational Dr. Hendricks (Robert Joy), who with the assistance of sadistic orderly Tony (Jason Diaz) conducts tests on the kids that are designed to instigate and enhance their extraordinary powers—and, in the best case scenario, reveal them to be PCs (precogs) who can see the future. 

All of this takes place in the Institute's Front Half, after which the captive children graduate to the facility's Back Half and then, supposedly, gain their freedom. Nicky doesn't buy that story, and neither does Luke. From the outset, he's skeptical about everything sold by Ms. Sigsby, whom Parker embodies with a superficial positivity that reeks of deception, not to mention derangement—the latter of which is underscored by an early scene in which, upon returning home from work, she soothes herself by burning her leg with a red-hot wire hanger.

Strange, sinister things are afoot at the Institute, and Cavell's series doles out hints about the organization's true motives at an enticing pace. Those revelations are at once horrible and complex, as well as thematically related to the recent ordeal plaguing former cop Tim Jamieson (Barnes). 

Arriving in small-town Maine with few belongings and no overt purpose, Tim successfully gets a job as the police department's “night knocker,” whose job it is to nocturnally patrol the enclave's streets. This is Tim's way of feeling useful after a traumatic incident in which he shot and killed a kid who was threatening to shoot up a mall. During the course of his duties, he meets officer Wendy (Hannah Galway), to whom he slowly grows closer, and local homeless crank Annie (Mary Walsh), whose intriguing conspiracy theories involve the Institute and psychic phenomena.

Tim and Jake's paths are destined to cross, but The Institute is most captivating when focusing on the latter's plight, which involves bizarre experiments known as “Shots for Dots” that make subjects disturbingly sick and weak. The Institute's combination of pragmatism and cruelty cloaks the proceedings in ominousness, as do Parker and Richings as bureaucratic cogs in a machine that's ultimately cast in quasi-Holocaust terms.

Instead of just a one-note boogeyman nightmare, the show complicates matters by giving its villains a potentially altruistic reason for their monstrousness. While the moral questions raised by their conduct (and motivations) are ultimately discarded in a way that suggests no one involved really cared about them, they nonetheless add a tantalizing layer to the otherwise straightforward material.

What holds The Institute back from generating more suspense is its performances, especially from its greener cast members. Freeman is competent, if lacking the charisma required to elicit real engagement with his suffering. The same goes for Viggo Hanvelt as Avery, the newest and youngest Institute victim, whose abilities are so great that they afford Luke and company a chance to break out of the Institute. 

Their functional turns are a burden the series can't totally overcome, and the visually unimaginative direction by Jack Bender, Brad Turner, and Jeff Renfroe doesn't do them any favor—and, at times, seems to actively work against them. As with the Lumineers' morose credit-sequence cover of Tears for Fears' “Shout,” the flat action is gloomy to a fault.

Like the best-selling novel upon which it's based, The Institute feels a tad too much like reheated leftovers. Stackhouse and Tony are psychos that we've seen before, Tim is the sort of good-hearted hero that King has favored since Salem's Lot, and the plot weaves together its strands in a fashion that will be intensely familiar to the writer's Constant Readers. 

This isn't to knock those conventions (which remain sturdy and entertaining) so much as to wish that the narrative at hand were more animated and surprising. Even its climactic tragedies feel of a piece with King's prior output—and, in this instance, don't hit as hard as they should as a result of the proceedings' ho-hum Institute protagonists.

Despite its weaknesses, The Institute captures the eerie, constricting mood of the Institute as well as King's issue with the idea that the ends justify the means—even if, perhaps, those means really are in service of the greater good. It's also, by design, an efficiently structured and thankfully self-contained affair, all the way to a finale that leaves little wiggle room for any (unnecessary) follow-up. It may be a middle-of-the-road tale from the Master of Horror, but that's still better than most.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AI is upending the streaming wars. Amazon Prime Video may be poised to benefit.","https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-amazon-prime-video-content-spending-netflix-youtube-morgan-stanley-2025-7","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:22:00 GMT","

YouTube and Netflix look poised to keep their gold and silver medals in the streaming wars as AI upends Hollywood, allowing for more personalized content and supercharged recommendations.

But Amazon Prime Video is well-positioned for bronze, if not an even better spot on the podium.

Amazon could be saving billions, among the most in the industry, in programming costs this year by using AI, according to a chart in a July 10 note by Morgan Stanley media analysts.

Their estimate is based on Amazon saving about 10% in production costs on scripted originals in its mammoth programming budget, which Morgan Stanley projects will be $24 billion in 2025.

However, the vast majority of that budget will be spent on content that already exists, as licensed movies and shows make up a massive chunk of Prime Video's library. A smaller slice will go toward Amazon's steadily expanding sports portfolio.

AI could eventually bring down costs of making scripted TV and films by 30%, wrote Ben Swinburne, who led the team of Morgan Stanley analysts. Even in that best-case scenario, he said that studios may not save much more than 10% in total programming costs, assuming that new shows and movies are 50% to 60% of their costs.

Media giants will likely spend heavily on AI tools, but Morgan Stanley thinks that investment will soon pay for itself.

""Leveraging Gen AI tools will not be free,"" Swinburne wrote. ""Technology adoption may incur investment costs either from licensing the technology or developing in-house productivity tools. However, the net effect could be a reduction in production costs.""

Hollywood is on edge about AI, and for good reason. Any cost savings for studios likely means less money in someone's pocket, whether they're an animator, graphics designer, or voice actor.

But AI companies and tech gurus won't be the only winners in this brave new world.

Morgan Stanley believes sports rights will continue to soar in value, even as the pay-TV bundle steadily erodes. Sports rights deals have already risen 10% per year since the pandemic to a third of total industry spending, potentially because live games appear to be generative AI-proof — unlike movies or TV shows.

If media companies use AI to save money on scripted content, they'll have more financial firepower, which could further intensify bidding wars over live sports rights.

""We expect a large proportion of those savings reinvested elsewhere in the value chain, including marketing, talent costs, and sports rights,"" Swinburne wrote. ""Sports rights are already seeing the benefit of budget shifts away from TV & film.""

Ballooning sports rights costs would be especially painful for Fox, NBC-parent Comcast, and Disney, which have the heaviest sports exposure as a percentage of their programming budget.

By contrast, tech giants like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and Apple have put the lion's share of their content budgets elsewhere, even though they've all upped their investments in sports.

So if AI makes scripted content costs shrink and sports rights values surge, as Morgan Stanley expects, then those deep-pocketed disruptors are likely to get even richer.

A Brightline train in Miami.

Brightline Trains Florida, the Fortress Investment Group-backed passenger railroad, plans to defer a July 15 interest payment on its 10% and 12% unrated tax-exempt bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Brightline notified holders of the delay through the Depository Trust Company, said the people who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak publicly. The incident is not considered an event of default, according to bond documents. A default only occurs if the railroad misses three consecutive interest payments, the documents state.

Homo economicus, or the ""economic man,"" is an idea that depicts humans as rational beings. This assumption has been used to construct models of the economy and, more broadly, society.

The great flaw in that theory is the supposition of logic in humans. We know, on an everyday basis, how flimsy that notion is. We need to keep our blood cholesterol in check, but the crunch of that fried chicken is irresistible.

On Thursday, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of shooting over the budget to renovate the central bank's headquarters by roughly $700 million.

In the same breath, he also questioned why there weren't any ""rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more"" constructed, as was originally planned.

To be fair, if all the allegations are true — that the promised luxury features factored into the budget had been omitted while costs have busted expectations — that would constitute mismanagement. At this point, however, either the budget or the fountain's got to give.

The accusation, more fundamentally, raises the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump — who has engaged in multiple tirades against Powell — will use this incident to boot the Fed chair.

The idea of ""homo economicus"" was widely criticized in the late 20th century. Through psychological experiments, economists have proven no human is fully rational. But, really, did they have to go to such lengths?

Trump announces 35% tariffs on Canada. In his letter, Trump highlighted how the country ""retaliated with its own Tariffs"" in March after the White House imposed fentanyl-related levies on it. In response, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said the government will defend its workers and businesses.

The White House accuses Powell of mismanagement. Trump's budget chief said that Powell had misled Congress about the renovation of the central bank's headquarters. It raises the question of whether Trump would use the incident to remove Powell.

Norway's Tesla obsession defies Europe's Musk backlash

Tesla recorded a 54% year-on-year jump in new car sales in Norway in June, according to data from the Norwegian Road Federation, fueled by a 115.3% yearly increase in registrations for its revamped Model Y sports utility vehicle.

The Tesla Model Y appears to be especially popular in Norway because of its competitive price and the fact that it meets local demand for large luggage space, high-ground clearance, all-wheel drive and a tow hitch, said Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association.

Western Europe is “losing” the economic competition with its main rivals, China and the US, and is struggling with a shortage of globally competitive companies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said.



Since 2022, when the EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian energy over the Ukraine conflict, growth across the bloc has stagnated. Germany, once its economic powerhouse, is now experiencing its third year of economic downturn.



Moscow has argued that EU restrictions are self-defeating, causing surging energy prices and weakening the bloc's economy.



Dimon, CEO of one of the world's largest banks, cautioned EU leaders at an event in Dublin hosted by the Irish Foreign Ministry on Thursday that Europe has lost its competitive edge compared to the US and is facing a growing crisis in economic competitiveness.



“You're losing,” he said. “Europe has gone from 90% [of] US GDP to 65% over 10 or 15 years.”



“We've got this huge strong market and our companies are big and successful, have huge kinds of scale that are global. You have that, but less and less.”

The JP Morgan boss has repeatedly expressed concerns about the state of Europe's economy. 



Earlier this year, Dimon told Financial Times that Europe needed to “do more” to remain competitive, noting that GDP per person had dropped from around 70% of America's to 50%, which he deemed “not sustainable.”



Dimon's warning comes as European NATO members say they need to ramp up their military budgets to deter an alleged threat from Russia. 



NATO countries have recently pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP over the next decade, more than double the longstanding target of 2%.



Moscow denies posing any danger to these nations, accusing Western officials of exploiting fear to rationalize budget increases and cover a decline in living standards.

            A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to US drug trafficking charges. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to enter a plea deal.
    


            Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the United States.
    


            As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.
    


            Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.
    


            Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.
    


            Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.
    


            Guzman Lopez's sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with US authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.
    


            Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.”
    


            “Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.
    


US prosecutors won't seek death penalty for son of Mexican drug cartel leader ‘El Chapo'



            Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.”
    


            “In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”
    


            Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the US government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.”
    


            “This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.”
    


Relatives of El Chapo enter US as part of ‘negotiation,' Mexico's security secretary says



            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.
    


Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel.
    


            Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea.
    


            Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the US on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

            Taping your mouth shut for sleep has gone mainstream. Spurred on by celebrity endorsements and social media influencers, it's now a billion-dollar industry. On TikTok, for example, the endorsements are widespread.



            One influencer claims mouth tape is the “beauty tip of life” that has changed the appearance of her face and jaw for the better.
    


            Another TikToker assures her followers that using mouth tape is “not a placebo effect — I've slept so much better since using this,” while someone else insists mouth tapers will “wake up more energized,” adding that “it helps with anxiety, and … if you snore, it helps with, like, not snoring.”
    


            One woman couldn't even recall why she started taping her mouth for sleep: “Truth be told, I don't know. I saw a TikTok about it, and I can't remember what the benefits were. But it helps me stay asleep!”
    


            Mouth taping has become an internet star even though science has yet to prove its benefit — and has shown it can do harm.
    


            “The purported benefits that are being touted for this — improving apnea, improving snoring, making your nose look better, making your jaw look better — it just doesn't come out in the wash that that actually is what's happening,” said sleep specialist Dr. Brian Rotenberg, professor of otolaryngology – head and neck surgery at Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in London, Ontario.
    


            If you're one of the roughly 30 million Americans with sleep apnea, mouth taping could seriously restrict airflow, thus depriving your brain and body of critically needed oxygen, according to experts.
    


Sleep apnea is a dangerous condition in which people stop breathing for up to a minute multiple times an hour. In severe cases, people stop breathing hundreds of times each night.
    


            About 23.5 million of those who have sleep apnea in the US are undiagnosed, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Yet the condition can lead to heart disease, diabetes, stroke, depression and even premature death if left untreated.
    


            A recent analysis by Rotenberg and his colleagues found taping or sealing the mouth closed or strapping the chin to keep the mouth closed “could pose a serious risk of asphyxiation in the presence of nasal obstruction or regurgitation.”
    


            Nasal obstructions can make it difficult to breathe through the nose as well, so reaching for mouth tape without first checking with a sleep specialist is unwise, experts say.
    


            “There's so many other reasons we can't breathe through our nose — deviated septum, nasal polyps, even in some cases, nasal tumors can happen,” Rotenberg said.
    


            “A large number of people would rather turn to Instagram or TikTok or other sources of information rather than their physician or nurse practitioner to actually make a diagnosis.”
    


            The goal for most mouth tape aficionados is to breathe through the nose, which experts say is healthier. Fine hairs in your nose called cilia filter out dust, allergens, germs and environmental debris.
    


            Nose breathing also moisturizes incoming air, while dry air breathed in through the mouth can irritate the lungs, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine, pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at Huntington Health in Pasadena, California.
    


            “Nasal breathing may lower blood pressure by increasing nitric oxide, a compound in your body that can be helpful for keeping your blood pressure under control,” Dasgupta said.
    


            In addition, breathing through the nose is relaxing, which is why it is often recommended, along with yoga and meditation, as a way to promote sleep.
    


            Mouth tapers won't experience these benefits, however, unless they first learn to properly place their tongue in the mouth, said Ann Kearney, a speech language pathologist at Stanford University School of Medicine.
    


            “It's a little frustrating for me when people just think they can tape their mouth shut and that's it — that's not the point,” Kearney said. “The tongue has to be up and in the forward position or you're not going to get the benefits of the nasal breathing.”
    


            To do that, put the tip of your tongue directly behind your front teeth and then relax the tongue along the upper palate of your mouth and keep it there, she said. Another way to explain it: Try to say the word “the,” but don't remove your tongue from your teeth. Then relax the tongue along the top of the mouth.
    


            If the tongue isn't moved up and forward, “the base of tongue is back in the airway, which causes more of an obstruction,” Kearney said. “But when you get it up and forward, it opens that airway and allows for easier nasal breathing.”
    


            If you do decide to use mouth tape — after you're checked out by a doctor, of course — you need only a 2-inch piece of thin medical-grade tape, she said.
    


            “I've heard crazy things on social media where people are using duct tape or taking the big piece of tape and really covering their mouth,” Kearney said. “It's not necessary.”

Since disaster that has killed at least 120 people, Trump has remained quiet about promises to axe relief agency

US politics live – latest updates

During a trip on Friday to look at the devastation caused by the catastrophic flooding in Texas, Donald Trump spoke of the young girls who died at a summer camp and the coast guard crew that saved 169 children there, saying of the disaster that he has “never seen anything like this”.

The trip comes as he has remained conspicuously quiet about his previous promises to do away with the federal agency in charge of disaster relief.

The Washington Post reported on Friday that the Trump administration has backed away from plans to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but administration officials continue to dodge questions about the agency's future and many are still calling for serious reforms, potentially sending much of its work to the states.

Since the 4 July disaster, which has killed at least 120 people, the president and his top aides have focused on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of what occurred and the human tragedy involved rather than the government-slashing crusade that has been popular with Trump's core supporters.

“Nobody ever saw a thing like this coming,” Trump told NBC News on Thursday, adding, “This is a once-in-every-200-year deal.” He has also suggested he would have been ready to visit Texas within hours but did not want to burden authorities still searching for the more than 170 people who are still missing.

Trump's shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though Trump has made slashing the federal workforce and charging ally-turned-antagonist Elon Musk with dramatically shrinking the size of government centerpieces of his administration's opening months.

The president traveled to Texas on Air Force One with Melania Trump, the first lady, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Scott Turner, the housing secretary, the small business administrator Kelly Loeffler, and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas, among others. Trump is expected to do an aerial tour of some of the hard-hit areas.

Before arriving at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he delivered remarks, the president and his motorcade stopped at an area near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville next to an overturned tractor-trailer and downed trees. Damage appeared to be more extensive near the riverbank. Trump, his wife and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, took a briefing about flooding there from local officials.

It is relatively common for presidents visiting disaster sites to tour the damage by air, a move that can ease the logistical burdens on authorities on the ground.

Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, observed the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina and Hurricane Milton in Florida last fall by air before meeting with disaster response officials and victims on the ground.

Trump, though, has also used past disaster response efforts to launch political attacks. While still a candidate trying to win back the presidency, Trump made his own visit to North Carolina after Helene last year and accused the Biden administration of blocking disaster aid to victims in Republican-heavy areas.

During his first weekend back in the White House, Trump again visited North Carolina to survey Helene damage and toured the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. But he also used those trips to sharply criticize the Biden administration and California officials.

During Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Trump praised the federal flooding response. Turning to Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, which oversees Fema, he said: “You had people there as fast as anybody's ever seen.”

Noem described traveling to Texas and seeing heartbreaking scenes, including around Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 people were killed.

“The parents that were looking for their children and picking up their daughter's stuffed animals out of the mud and finding their daughter's shoe that might be laying in the cabin,” she said.

Noem said that “just hugging and comforting people matters a lot” and “this is a time for all of us in this country to remember that we were created to serve each other”.

But the secretary is also co-chairing a Fema review council charged with submitting suggestions for how to overhaul the agency in coming months.

“We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. The state does,” Noem told Trump on Tuesday.

She also referenced the administration's government-reducing efforts, saying: ”We're cutting through the paperwork of the old Fema. Streamlining it, much like your vision of how Fema should operate.”

Pressed this week on whether the White House will continue to work to shutter Fema, Karoline Leavitt would not say.

“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” the White House press secretary said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”

Before Trump left on Friday, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, similarly dodged questions from reporters at the the White House about Fema's future – instead noting that the agency has billions of dollars in its reserves “to continue to pay for necessary expenses” and that the president has promised Texas, “Anything it needs, it will get.”

“We also want Fema to be reformed,” Vought added. “The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies, no different than any other opportunity to have better government.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President hints at ‘major announcement' on Monday after halting arms shipments due to dwindling stockpiles

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump appears poised to deliver weapons to Ukraine by selling them first to Nato allies in a major policy shift for his administration amid frustrations with Vladimir Putin over stalling negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

During an interview with NBC News, Trump said he will probably have a “major announcement” on Russia on Monday and confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine.

Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on the same day for a week-long trip that comes after the US temporarily halted weapons shipments to Ukraine as part of a Pentagon review of dwindling stockpiles of crucial munitions including Patriot air defense missiles.

The White House has now sought to distance itself from the decision, and Trump has suggested he is ready to greenlight a major military aid package for Ukraine via Nato, reversing a previous policy of reducing support to the Ukrainian government to force Kyiv to sue for peace.

“I think I'll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,” Trump said during the interview with NBC News, which aired on Thursday evening. “I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

During the interview, Trump laid out a plan by which the US could sell weapons to Nato and then they could be sent on to Ukraine. Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine.

“So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv.

Germany and other member states of the security bloc had spoken publicly about ongoing negotiations to purchase weapons from the United States to transfer to Ukraine.

Ukraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions.

The Axios news website said that some officials had said the US would only sell Ukraine “defensive” weapons, while others said the package could also include “offensive” weapons such as the Himars missiles.

Yet a key stumbling block remains US military production. The US only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon's military plans, the Guardian revealed this month, and fulfilling new orders can take years depending on the priority level given to the contract.

Kellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump's inauguration.

During the interview, Trump also endorsed the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally seen as a leader of Russia hawks in the legislature. Graham has said that the bill would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil and other goods, potentially targeting China and India.

after newsletter promotion

Congressional insiders have told the Guardian that there is strong support for Ukraine in both the House of Representatives and the Senate but that they would require Trump's political backing in order to pass the bill.

“They're going to pass a very major and very biting sanctions bill, but it's up to the president as to whether or not he wants to exercise it,” Trump said during the interview, his first explicit endorsement of the bill.

Experts have said that the bill would give Trump new methods to target Russia, but that he could also tighten enforcement or issue other sanctions unilaterally without waiting for authorization from Congress.

Trump has said in the past that he admires Putin but he increasingly has vented frustration over the lack of progress in peace talks and the continued airstrikes against Ukrainian cities.

On Wednesday night, Russia launched almost 400 Shahed drones and decoys, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles, in strikes against Kyiv that killed two and caused fires across the Ukrainian capital.

“We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting this week. “He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine on July 10 destroyed a Russian command post and killed five Russian soldiers in occupied Melitopol in a joint operation by military intelligence (HUR) and partisans, the intelligence agency said.

The southern city of Melitopol in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. 

Russian forces established a logistics base in the city, serving as a hub for personnel and military vehicles. The explosion took place as Russian National Guard soldiers stationed there were unloading a military vehicle, the statement read.

""As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station — intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces — was also destroyed,"" the agency said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

Ukrainian partisan groups, alongside Ukrainian intelligence officers, routinely execute covert missions within Russian-occupied territories to degrade the operational capacity of Russian forces.

The Atesh partisan group on July 10 sabotaged the railways in the Russian city of Volgograd and in the Russian-occupied settlement of Uvarove in Crimea in order to limit Russia's ammunition supplies to the front line and reduce the intensity of Russian assaults.

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent the attack had destroyed a section of a key pipeline supplying Russian military-industrial facilities in Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, and Sverdlovsk oblasts.

Ukraine and the EU will allocate 100 million euro ($117 million) to boost battlefield-driven solutions under the newly-launched BraveTech EU initiative, announced at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 11. 

Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, war has become a daily reality for thousands of Ukrainian children. Some Ukrainian military units, such as the Azov Brigade, offer boot camps for teenagers to teach them the basics of self-defense, first aid, dry firing, and other survival skills — helping them prepare for both the realities of today and the uncertainties of the future.



Russian authorities confirmed that Colonel Sergei Ilyin, commander of Russia's 155th Marine Brigade, has been buried, without disclosing the cause of death.

A Russian attack against the southern city of Odesa injured at least eight people and damaged residential areas, local authorities reported.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 53 over Kursk Oblast and 13 over Tula Oblast.

""As a result of the explosion, a satellite communication hardware station—intended by Russian military leadership to coordinate occupying forces—was also destroyed,"" Ukraine's military intelligence said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Rob McClelland, president of The McClelland Financial Group, and his 26-year-old daughter Georgia launched a podcast to help Gen Z and Millennial Canadians set themselves up for long-term financial security.BADGAL GRAPHICZ/Supplied

Good morning. Judging by the wave of out-of-office replies in my inbox, many of you are on vacation this week. If that's you, thanks for reading from the beach, cottage, or wherever you're relaxing. If you're not on vacation, welcome to the club. Today's edition features an insightful Q&A you won't want to miss.

A lot of young Canadians don't know where to start with financial planning and many are too embarrassed to ask. Professional advice can be expensive, and the internet is a minefield of conflicting tips and self-styled “finfluencers” who don't always have their followers' best interests in mind. 

One new podcast is trying to address that problem. Am I Rich Yet?, co-hosted by veteran financial adviser Rob McClelland and his 26-year-old daughter Georgia breaks down financial basics in a way that's clear, practical and tailored to Gen Z and millennials.

In our e-mail conversation, Rob and Georgia discussed why they chose to focus on younger Canadians, the role of social media in the money conversation, and what it's like working together as a father-daughter team. Here's an edited version of our exchange.

Q: Let's start at the beginning. Personally and professionally, what led the two of you to launch this podcast together?

Rob: I'd recently decided to retire based on a health diagnosis. I knew I still had a lot to give. I had experience not only as a financial adviser, but also creating podcasts. My original plan was to develop a podcast for young advisers to help them become more efficient and pass on the lessons I wish I'd learned earlier in my own career. Then, my daughter Georgia suggested that I do a podcast for millennials and Generation Z and the struggles they are having. I thought it was a great idea. 

Georgia: I had just returned home to Toronto for a six-week break. I'm currently completing my master of business at the University of Sydney in Australia. On the plane ride home, I wrote down a few goals for my time off. First, continue planning out my next career move. Second, come up with a passion project to keep me busy during the downtime. It needed to be something fun, and something I hadn't done before. After one afternoon where we had a conversation about the podcast, I knew this was it.

Q: There's no shortage of money content out there, but a lot of it skips over the basics, such as how to actually save as a young person when everything's so expensive. Why did you decide to focus this show on helping younger Canadians, rather than speaking to seasoned investors?

R: I have three kids who fit the profile. One who is a saver, one who is a spender, and one who is still figuring out which one she is. As an adviser, although we knew we had to help the next generation, it was always difficult to justify it financially. Unfortunately, they just don't have enough money to pay the bills for an adviser. There is lots of content out there on more detailed strategies, building portfolios and doing planning, but less that covers the basics.

G: When we looked into what content was already out there, we realized that most of it was U.S.-focused. We saw an opportunity to create something tailored to Canadians. I knew the need was out there because I felt it myself. To test the proof of concept, I reached out to 100 people in my network who fit the demographic and asked them to send in the questions they'd ask a financial adviser. Within 48 hours, we had over 150 responses. The demand was clear, so we built the series around those questions.

Q: More young people are turning to TikTok and YouTube for financial advice. What do you make of that?

R: I think it's a great sign that young Canadians are clearly eager to learn. The problem is, there's no filter on that content. Some of the advice out there is solid, but a lot of it is dangerously bad. What we're offering comes from over 30 years of experience helping thousands of people build real financial success. Not many voices on TikTok or YouTube can say that. 

G: He's right. I've been exposed to some pretty questionable advice on social media, but I've been lucky enough to have had a sounding board (my dad) to guide me away from it. We all know how powerful social media is in getting messages out − for better or for worse − and we wanted to take the opportunity to contribute to some of that good.

Q: Money isn't always easy to talk about within families, so what's it like being a father-daughter duo diving into this stuff every week?

R: Because I was a financial adviser, talking about money has never been that difficult for me. For both Georgia and I, I've found that the conversation has been relatively easy. She's been really helpful in making sure the messaging and wording is palatable for people in her generation. Asking me to repeat things, or explain something differently.

G: Agreed. Like any two people working together on a project there were certain things we disagreed on, but I'd say as a whole we did a pretty good job at compromising and letting go of little things that weren't worth arguing about. We had a lot of laughs. Maybe my dad would disagree …

Q: Rob, you've spent decades helping Canadians manage their money. But what's something you're learning for the first time now that you're doing this podcast with Georgia?

R: The thing I've learned most about this podcast is that so much of this knowledge is in my head already. That's what happens when you've done over 1,500 meetings with clients over the years. I think the other important thing is that I've had to simplify things for clients. It's no different for this age group. Sometimes it does feel strange to explain what an RRSP is, but the reality is probably less than 25 per cent of Canadians could explain it. We forget that the language we use every day in our profession or from school can feel like a completely different language to someone just starting out.

Q: Georgia, you're tapped into what your peers are going through financially. What's the number one thing your friends are stressed about when it comes to money?

G: Housing, 100 per cent. The idea of owning real estate feels out of reach for so many of us. The prices in the cities we actually want to live in feel like this massive mountain we'll never be able to climb. And because we're all so connected now, if you see people your age who have managed to buy property, it's hard not to feel like you're already behind. That comparison creates a lot of stress, and for some people, it becomes so discouraging that they just look away from saving altogether. But that's a myth we're trying to challenge in our podcast.

The real story behind pension plan membership in Canada? The gulf between public and private sectors

More Canadians are enrolled in workplace pension plans, but there's still a big gap between private and public sectors. A recent report from Statistics Canada found that 7.2 million Canadians were active members of a registered pension plan in 2023, up 4.2 per cent from the year before. But most of those with defined benefit plans − the gold standard for predictable retirement income − are still in the public sector.

Why it matters: Access to workplace pensions is improving, but the gap in retirement security between public- and private-sector workers remains wide.

Retired social worker Sheila Baslaw, 92, took up writing after retirement and recently co-authored a children's book.Ashley Fraser/The Globe and Mail

 This 92-year-old retiree is doing things on her own terms.

The situation: Sheila Baslaw retired from a career in social work in 1997. After her husband passed away in 2016, she dived into exploring new passions, painting, diving deeper into Jewish history, and even having her bat mitzvah at age 67. “What I love about retirement is having the freedom to do what I want, when I want,” she said. “It's intoxicating.”

The numbers: Ms. Baslaw draws from a healthy RRIF and receives a small workplace pension. She took CPP and OAS as soon as she retired and mainly lives off her pension, keeping her savings intact.

Her advice: Ms. Baslaw encourages soon-to-be retirees to discover what truly interests them and make the time to pursue it. Also, she said to seek out friends of different ages and backgrounds.

🏦 Big banks' sales targets may influence advisers' product recommendations. A survey by regulators found some advisers may feel pushed to sell products that weren't in their clients' best interests. Nearly half of advisers said bank scorecards (a tool used to track adviser performance) influenced their recommendations.

🤑 A rising number of Canadians are millionaires. So why don't they feel rich? The number of “everyday millionaires,” those with wealth between US$1-million and US$5-million, has quadrupled globally since 2000, reaching nearly 52 million people. But a lot of the money is tied up in housing, which skews how “rich” people actually feel.

🏡 A fight over a family cottage just cost two executors $21,000 out of pocket. After being removed as trustees for mishandling an estate and triggering a major tax bill, they appealed … and lost. Ontario's top court said the appeal wasn't in the estate's best interest and ruled the pair personally liable for legal costs.

🔥 People are obsessed with payday routine videos. These simple, oddly satisfying clips feature creators tallying their monthly income and expenses, everything from rent and savings to takeout and beauty treatments. For some viewers, they're reassuring. For others, they spark spending guilt. Either way, they're hard to stop watching.

💊 Do a midyear check on your workplace benefits. We're more than halfway through 2025 (yes, really). Have unused massage credits? Book that appointment. Still haven't seen the dentist? Time to go. Make the most of what's already available to you − your December self will thank you.

Pictures show Democrats like Chuck Schumer standing next to Netanyahu, smiling.

A bipartisan group of senators representing an eighth of the Senate posed for photos and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to the U.S. this week, sparking criticism over senators' smiles next to a man wanted in the Hague for alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Netanyahu met with senators on Wednesday, with leaders for both parties, Senators John Thune (R-South Dakota) and Chuck Schumer (D-New York) in attendance. Lawmakers proudly posted photos of the meeting, saying that they discussed the genocide in Gaza and praised Israel and the U.S.'s war on Iran during the meeting.

Netanyahu also met with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the latter of whom said in a post on social media that the two “discussed America's commitment to Israel's security and our shared goal of achieving a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.”

Pictures of the Senate meeting also showed Senators Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Jon Husted (R-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), and Adam Schiff (D-California). 

The lawmakers posed next to a table set with food and drinks. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has already drawn criticism for being on vacation in Greece amid the devastating floods in his state last week, was also at the meeting.

Lawmakers have drawn criticism for meeting with Netanyahu as his government moves toward expelling all Palestinians from Gaza, through death or force. Earlier this week, Netanyahu's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, told reporters that he has instructed the military to plan for confining all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp where they won't be allowed to leave — a plan likened to concentration camps by advocates for Palestinian rights.

“Yesterday these Senators took part in a photo-op with Netanyahu, who is wanted for war crimes. Shameful,” wrote the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project in a post on social media.

“Genocide is bipartisan,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan).

“In a just world, every one of these Democratic senators would be primaried — especially the hypocritical Cory Booker who is wisely trying to hide his face in this picture,” said Zeteo Editor-in-Chief Mehdi Hasan. Indeed, Booker and Klobuchar are standing behind other senators in photos posted online.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for the arrest of Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November. But both officials have since visited the White House, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, with U.S. officials purposefully defying the Hague.

In fact, earlier this week, the U.S. State Department threatened the ICC in a UN meeting ahead of Netanyahu's visit, demanding that it drop the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant and terminate “all investigations and all arrest warrants” against Israel. 

Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump this week to discuss a proposal for a temporary ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, despite agreement from both parties on the objectives of the genocide, Netanyahu left Washington without the parties announcing a deal. Netanyahu has been accused numerous times of purposely sabotaging ceasefire talks in order to prolong the genocide and stay in power.

As work stoppages spread, the Teamsters' president says a waste disposal company is at “war” with sanitation workers.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

A local sanitation workers strike that began on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company.

The Teamsters said in an email on Friday that about 550 sanitation workers were on strike in multiple cities while 1,600 others refused to cross picket line extensions in solidarity with the strikers at local Republic Services sites in Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Washington State, and California. For example, workers in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better pay at a regional landfill near Stockton.

“Republic Services has been threatening a war with American workers for years — and now, they've got one,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien in a statement on Wednesday.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

While trash collection has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports. The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health issue.

In a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country, and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the picket line to job sites beyond Boston.

Republic Services did not respond to a request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters Local 25 “when they are ready to re-engage.”

“We will continue to focus on providing service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. “We call on Teamsters' leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal acts, and resolve this situation.”

The right to join a union and go on strike is protected by federal labor law, so it's unclear what “criminal acts” Republic Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O'Brien said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services “abuses and underpays” sanitation workers serving communities across the country. 

“They burn massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O'Brien said. “The Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide, and we will get the wages and benefits we've earned, come hell or high water.”

In a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has resorted to “union-busting tactics” and “illegal threats” in order to provoke a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we've ever come across.”

“Republic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,” Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9.

The war of words comes as work stoppages spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic Services.

“To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of Republic's strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,” said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division, in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.”

While Truthout was unable to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders last year.

Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California, said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services. Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line, and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in Boston extended its picket line this week. Alvarez and fellow workers are responsible for safely transporting hazardous materials, and their contract with Republic Services expires next year.

“The reason we support one another is there is strength in numbers,” Alvarez told Truthout in an interview.

Mineros said sanitation and waste management workers perform “dangerous, high-stakes jobs” that protect local communities and the environment from pollution and hazardous waste.

“They deserve a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said.

Meanwhile, after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State, Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.

The deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports. Union leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing an 8 percent annual increase. The average salary for a sanitation worker is $46,000 a year in Philadelphia, which the union argues is not a living wage.

Greg Boulware, president of the AFSCME local representing public workers in Philadelphia, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the strike is over and “nobody's happy” as he left negotiations with the city on Wednesday. If the rank and file reject the deal, Boulware said the strike could potentially resume.

“We felt our clock was running out,” Boulware said.

President Donald Trump says migrants would need to know “how to run away from an alligator” to flee the new detention center he's visiting in a remote area of the Florida Everglades.

MIAMI (AP) — Worms in the food. Toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste. Days without a shower or prescription medicine. Mosquitoes and insects everywhere. Lights on all night. Air conditioners that suddenly shut off in the tropical heat. Detainees forced to use recorded phone lines to speak with their lawyers and loved ones.

Only days after President Donald Trump toured a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” these are some of the conditions described by people held inside. 

Attorneys, advocates, detainees and families are speaking out about the makeshift migrant detention center Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration raced to build on an isolated airstrip surrounded by swampland. The center began accepting detainees on July 2.

“These are human beings who have inherent rights, and they have a right to dignity,” said immigration attorney Josephine Arroyo. “And they're violating a lot of their rights by putting them there.”

Government officials have adamantly disputed the conditions described by detainees, their attorneys and family members, but have provided few details, and have denied access to the media. A televised tour for Trump and DeSantis showed rows of chain-link cages, each containing dozens of bunkbeds, under large white tents.

“The reporting on the conditions in the facility is completely false. The facility meets all required standards and is in good working order,” said Stephanie Hartman, a spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which built the center.

A group of Democratic lawmakers sued the DeSantis administration for access. The administration is allowing a site visit by state legislators and members of Congress on Saturday, July 12. 

Families and attorneys who spoke with The Associated Press relayed detainees' accounts of a place they say is unsanitary and lacks adequate medical care, pushing some into a state of extreme distress.

Such conditions make other immigration detention centers where advocates and staff have warned of unsanitary confinements, medical neglect and a lack of food and water seem “advanced,” said immigration attorney Atara Eig.

Trump and his allies have praised this detention center's harshness and remoteness as befitting the “worst of the worst” and as a national model for the deterrence needed to persuade immigrants to “self-deport” from the United States.

But among those locked inside the chain-link enclosures are people with no criminal records, and at least one teenage boy, attorneys told the AP.

Immigration attorney Katie Blankenship described a concerning lack of medical care at the facility, relaying an account from a 35-year-old Cuban client who told his wife that detainees go days without a shower. The toilets are in the same space as the bunkbeds and can't handle their needs, she said.

The wife, a 28-year-old green card holder and the mother of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, relayed his complaints to the AP. Fearing government retaliation against her and her detained husband, she asked not to be identified.

“They have no way to bathe, no way to wash their mouths, the toilet overflows and the floor is flooded with pee and poop,” the woman told the AP. “They eat once a day and have two minutes to eat. The meals have worms,” she added.

The woman said the detainees “all went on a hunger strike” on Thursday night to protest the conditions.

“There are days when I don't know anything about him until the evening,” she said, describing waiting for his calls, interrupted every three minutes by an announcement that the conversation is being recorded.

The detainees' attorneys say their due process rights are among numerous constitutional protections being denied.

Blankenship is among the lawyers who have been refused access. After traveling to the remote facility and waiting for hours to speak with her clients, including a 15-year-old Mexican boy with no criminal charges, she was turned away by a security guard who told her to wait for a phone call in 48 hours that would notify her when she could return.

“I said, well, what's the phone number that I can follow up with that? There is none,” Blankenship recalled. “You have due process obligations, and this is a violation of it.”

Arroyo's client, a 36-year-old Mexican man who came to the U.S. as a child, has been detained at the center since July 5 after being picked up for driving with a suspended license in Florida's Orange County. He's a beneficiary of the DACA program, created to protect young adults who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and to provide them with work authorization.

Blankenship's Cuban client paid a bond and was told he'd be freed on a criminal charge in Miami, only to be detained and transferred to the Everglades. 

Eig has been seeking the release of a client in his 50s with no criminal record and a stay of removal, meaning the government can't legally deport him while he appeals. But she hasn't been able to get a bond hearing. She's heard that an immigration court inside the Krome Detention Center in Miami “may be hearing cases” from the Everglades facility, but as of Friday, they were still waiting.

“Jurisdiction remains an issue,” Eig said, adding “the issue of who's in charge over there is very concerning.”

CHICAGO (AP) — A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to U.S. drug trafficking charges, becoming the first of the drug lord's sons to enter a plea deal.

Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the U.S.

As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.

Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.

Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.

Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.

Guzman Lopez's sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with U.S. authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.




Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.”

“Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.

Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.”

“In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”

Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the U.S. government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.”

“This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.”

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the U.S. government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.

Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel. 

Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but had signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea. 

Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U.S. on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

JACOB LAKE, Ariz. (AP) — Visitors and staff at two national parks in the U.S. West have been evacuated because of wildfires.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (418 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed Thursday morning after lighting sparked blazes on both rims, the park said. The wildfire on the South Rim has burned 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers), with no containment of the perimeter. The park is closed until further notice.

The conditions there have been ripe for wildfire with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday.

Firefighters saved the visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn.

The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed Thursday because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby.

The fire began Wednesday evening after a thunderstorm moved through the area, fire officials said. It has burned about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) with zero containment. 

About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joelle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place.

According to a safety director, three paint buckets filled to the brim with uranium ore were stored in the National Park's Museum Collections Building.

The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is temporarily closed as mandatory evacuation orders remain in effect due to a wildfire near the park. 

The White Sage Fire, near Jacob Lake, prompted the National Park Service to evacuate all North Rim visitors ""immediately"" on Thursday night. 

As of Thursday night, the fire had burned about 1,000 acres and remains active with no containment, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

What happens anywhere—including moves toward authoritarianism—can also happen here.

This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors' weekly guide to the best in books. Sign up for it here.

As a Soviet Jewish immigrant, the son of Reagan-loving anti-Communists, I grew up in a kind of secular religion: American exceptionalism. I was raised to believe that the evils of tyranny—ones as mundane as toilet-paper lines or as horrific as the Holocaust—could only have happened far away or long ago, in places without democracy or capitalism. Gradually, I became aware of arguments that the U.S. was exceptional in far less desirable ways, too: poorer health outcomes, higher murder rates, and greater inequality when compared with similarly prosperous nations. What I notice now, as a journalist working during the second Trump administration, is that for all the ways that America is unlike other nations, in crucial ways it is just like any other place: What happens anywhere—including moves toward authoritarianism—can also happen here. This idea underpins two recent essays in The Atlantic.

First, here are four new articles from the Atlantic's Books section:

In her immersive work of nonfiction, A Flower Traveled in My Blood, Haley Cohen Gilliland documents the decades-long struggle to recover children who, during Argentina's Dirty War, were snatched away from detained dissidents (many of whom were murdered) and given to supporters of the regime. In an Atlantic essay about the book published this week, Julia M. Klein highlights Gilliland's insistence that this specific case bears cautionary lessons for many societies. Klein, who as a reporter witnessed Argentina's still-incomplete reckoning with its atrocities, finds that the U.S. “government's turn to sudden, legally questionable seizures” of immigrants, “often by unidentified masked men,” reminds her of past abuses across South America. “When tyrants threaten, more people and institutions may cower than resist,” Klein writes, drawing on the experience of Argentines and others who saw state terror. “The loss of checks on state violence can be catastrophic; and no one knows who the next victim will be.”

The lessons in America, América, Greg Grandin's sweeping history of the Western Hemisphere after many of its nations gained independence from Europe's empires, are less ominous—perhaps surprisingly so, considering the strongmen and civil wars that tend to dominate American media portrayals of those countries. “As some historians talk about Trump as a strongman in the Latin American mold, perhaps the region has something to teach us about democracy,” Carolina A. Miranda wrote a couple of weeks ago in an article about Grandin's book. Miranda noted that many democratic concepts, including birthright citizenship, were pioneered in the region before spreading across the world. “Grandin's narrative upends the idea of Latin America as perpetual victim,” Miranda wrote—along with the image of the U.S. as “a forbearing parent” shepherding its wayward southern neighbors. Instead, she suggested, Latin American constitutions and liberation movements have incubated principles that might help guide Americans.

I might never let go entirely of the faith I grew up with, a core belief that the world has much to learn from the American example and from the freedoms Americans are promised. But I also believe we have much to learn—and not just through cautionary tales. We may not have universal health care or ample high-speed rail like some of our wealthy peer nations, but over the past few decades I have seen these concepts seriously contemplated—even, in some places, enacted—by policy makers who look to other countries for ideas. These modest experiments have strengthened my belief that the U.S. is not exceptional in every way. Bad things that have happened elsewhere can happen here—and so can changes that make life better.

Between ‘the Drive to Forget and the Obligation to Remember'

Argentina's unfinished reckoning shows how difficult it can be to recover from state terror.

A Visit From the Goon Squad, by Jennifer Egan

Egan's rightly lauded collection of linked stories found its way into my hands just as I was crawling out of a midlife mess in which I was making a lot of questionable choices. The book drops in on a highly populated world revolving around the music business, and for obvious reasons, I found myself drawn to the endearingly disastrous producer's assistant Sasha. Paradoxically, her story gave me a tremendous sense of hope that, regardless of my mistakes in the moment, everything would be okay in the end. We first meet her as a 20-something living in New York who steals a wallet while on a date. We see her teenage years as a runaway sex worker in Europe, watch her as a misanthropic college student, and ultimately glimpse her as a content and loving mother, living in California and channeling her love of music and curiosity into her children as well as artwork of her own. Sasha's life, like mine—and like all of ours—is full of low moments, but while those times shape us, they don't need to define us.  — Xochitl Gonzalez

She Was More Than the Next Marilyn Monroe

By Mayukh Sen

Taken at face value, Mansfield's life might seem like the tragedy of a woman who struggled to break away from her reputation. The recently released HBO documentary My Mom Jayne, directed by her youngest daughter, the actor Mariska Hargitay—who was 3 when her mother died and would become a household name as the hard-boiled Olivia Benson on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit—invites viewers to reconsider that framing. Although the film acknowledges the injustice of Mansfield's unfulfilled artistic potential, it also dignifies Mansfield as both actor and mother. The result is an affectionate tribute to a woman often impugned as Monroe's dime-store variant; it also doubles as a portrait of Hollywood's studio system in a state of free fall. Mansfield was a shrewd navigator of the industry's politics—until they changed so drastically that she could not keep pace with them.

President Donald Trump's tariffs on Asian trading partners may ultimately pose less of a threat to regional markets than investors initially feared, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Although the tariffs are expected to have a lingering impact, they could actually support investor confidence. But investors need clarity on what's coming, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Thursday note. 

""The fundamental growth impact may not be as negative as markets feared in early 2Q and the actual tariff announcements may serve as a risk-positive 'clearing event', even if the rates imposed are somewhat above current baseline expectations,"" the analysts wrote.

Goldman points to market uncertainty — not the tariffs themselves — as the major concern for investors.

""Market performance has been impacted significantly by uncertainty regarding the level of tariffs that may be imposed and the frequent changes to the policy outlook,"" the analysts wrote.

They added that a stable and predictable tariff regime could actually improve investor risk appetite.

Trump has notified around two dozen countries that new levies on their goods will begin on August 1 unless new trade deals are reached.

Goldman Sachs' analysts said the impact of the US's tariffs may not be as severe as feared, given the differences among regions and sectors.

North Asian markets in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan would face the highest revenue exposure to the US within Asian equity markets.

By contrast, Southeast Asian markets and domestically oriented sectors — including utilities, banks, telecoms, and real estate — are far less exposed.

""The impact of tariffs will therefore not be evenly distributed,"" the analysts added.

Still, downside risks remain. Regional earnings could drop by 1% for every 5 percentage-point increase in tariffs, Goldman Sachs' analysis shows.

""Earnings forecasts for a given market could be impacted through the direct exposure of revenues to the US, the tariff pass-through rate, and the sensitivity of listed companies to the domestic growth backdrop,"" they wrote.

Lower US short-term interest rates and a weaker dollar could partially offset the damage.

The Federal Reserve's easing cycle may drive investors toward higher-yielding assets in Asia. A weaker dollar could also help Asian firms that rely on dollar-denominated borrowing, indirectly supporting growth.

Asia markets sold off sharply after Trump made his first tariff announcement on ""Liberation Day"" but mostly recovered. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 is up about 1% year to date, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 25% thanks to an extra boost from a Chinese AI-driven surge.

This is it, folks. Amazon Prime Day finally ends tonight after its longest-ever four-day run. That doesn't mean you should casually browse or stash items in your basket until the last minute, as we've seen plenty of items sell out.

After all, having something in your basket doesn't mean it's reserved for you until the end of the day. So, as much as it's nice to wrap up a transaction in one go when shopping for multiple items, it might not be a risk worth taking today.

We've compared prices across thousands of deals this week, and below, you'll find highlights of some of our favorite picks from our collection of reviews and buying guides. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts.

I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Past sales have seen them dip to $160, but you're generally looking at $180-$200 for a standard discount during more low-key sales.

The audio quality and noise-cancelling both received massive upgrades over the first-gen Pros. If you have the original Pro 2s with the Lightning cable, the only difference besides the charging port is added dust resistance, so I'd hold off for the next-gen Pros rather than pick these up. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though.

Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro.

This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus.

Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers.

OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. Hopefully, they're a bit more on it than Apple's utterly botched Siri Apple Intelligence rollout.

So why the Echo Pop? It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's a nice size for a nightstand or a little music speaker on your desk. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below.

The entire Echo line is on sale for Prime Day until Friday, including the ones with a display at Amazon.

This is a neat (and cheap!) device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers).

Typical uses include activating lamps or electric fans. Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills.

If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't be any help unless you can leave it in 'on mode' - like a physical light switch on a lamp.

Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. I have both, and I swap between them regularly, so there's no bad option here.

I use the Paperwhite the most because the larger screen means fewer page turns. I also like the flush screen design, which prevents dust or hair from tucking into the bezel, which is a tiny issue with the cheaper model.

The Paperwhite has a few premium touches that make it worth the price, especially when it's on sale like this. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. The adjustable warm-light feature makes the screen easier on the eyes and can be tweaked to a soft golden glow, which is very pleasing on the eye as it looks like an old paperback.

As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus.

If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line.

Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2"" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen.

I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag.

This version comes with the Premium Pen (which costs extra on the last-gen model), an eraser button on the top, and a programmable shortcut key.

If you have the original Scribe, I'd skip this one, as the design has not changed significantly, and both have the same software upgrades. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. That said, I can barely read my own handwriting, so I can cut it some slack here.

Philips Hue is the most recognizable brand in the smart lighting game, and the vast range of colors available via the app on these super-long-lasting bulbs makes them my top pick whenever anyone asks me about them.

They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. These are certainly items I'd say are vulnerable to price hikes if the tariffs hit.

Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit.

They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200.

Oura is the biggest name in smart rings and is our go-to pick, even over Samsung's Galaxy Ring. If you're looking for a subtle health tracker that looks pretty cool as well, you can't go wrong here. Multiple sizes and colors are on sale today.

The Oura can track various fitness and wellness metrics, including sleep, heart rate, steps, and other activities. Many find wearing a smartwatch all the time, especially when sleeping, is a bit much. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too.

Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more.

I've been drawing as a hobby since I was young, but digital art was always one of my weak points — until I picked up an Apple Pencil. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. Even when not drawing, the accessory makes note-taking and photo editing so much easier and precise. — Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

If you want a super cheap pair of wireless earbuds, Amazon's own brand Echo Buds are way better than they should be, especially at $20 today.

You won't get fancy features like waterproofing or noise-cancelling, but they are sweat-resistant and come with a 5-hour charge (20 hours including the charging case). So, as a cheap pair of buds for exercise, they're certainly worth a look, especially if you've been prone to losing buds in the past.

I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100.

I've been very happy with it so far. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. It's a little heavy in handheld mode, but I feel I've got a real bargain compared to the amount of money you'd spend on a brand like Dyson.

That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. If you're in a small carpet-free apartment, though, I think you're better off with the Tikom. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. 

Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home.

Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. You can program different pre-set heights for sitting and standing for more than one user. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see.

Govee's outdoor lights have been a huge hit. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights.

As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area.

I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Plus, you can add more attachments, like a pasta maker, if you want.

Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. With the help of the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, which is also 25% off for Prime Day, I can use it to make all the coffee and espresso drinks I love, hot or iced. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate.

This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen.

No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. While it can't filter large quantities of water for a group, it's a must-have for solo adventurers.

It sees sales somewhat regularly throughout the year, but right now, it's down to its all-time lowest price of $10. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water.

If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side.

The pillow's medium firmness offers the perfect amount of pressure relief around the neck and shoulders for back and side sleepers, helping you maintain spine alignment throughout the night. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good.

I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all.

Though it's pretty common to find it on sale during most deal events, it's not until something like Prime Day that it drops to its lowest price. Seriously, if you're at all on the fence, let me join the chorus of recommendations for this pillow. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type.

Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals.

If you're the type of person who likes to style your hair with a sleek, straight blowout one day and voluminous waves the next, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer is the only tool you'll ever need. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage.

At 60% off, the One-Step 2.0 is one of the best Prime Day deals over 50% off we've seen this year. You're unlikely to find it at a better price, at least until Black Friday. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling.

The no-frills Original Wet Brush is genuinely one of the hero products of my lifetime. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I picked this up on a whim at least a decade ago, and I've never been without one ever since.

I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. At just $6, it's a steal.

Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm excels at both, which is why it's the best lip balm we've ever tested.

Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can.

Any dermatologist will tell you to keep your hands off any breakouts, but if you're guilty of pimple popping, these acne patches might just save you. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit.

The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. For Prime Day, grab a 72-pack for $24.

As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Clinique Black Honey has been a cult favorite for decades, and for good reason. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying.

The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. Plus, it's buildable, so you can take it from day to night with just a few swipes. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it.

For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year.

Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. Rather than a typical gloss tube, it's a buttery balm that glides on smoothly and even nourishes your skin.

My eyelids get oily throughout the day, and due to my almond eye shape, I have a lot of creasing around my outer corners. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine.

I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. - Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

This stylish and comfy sweatsuit is a near-perfect dupe of the Spanx Air Essentials set for a fraction of the price, earning it a top spot in our best sweatsuits guide. The stretchy and silky fabric feels extremely high-quality for the price, which we were impressed with in our full review.

The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks.

A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end.

We love the Ultraboost Light's fit. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. At 55% off, you'll be hard-pressed to find this pair at a better price.

[Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick

My Rothy's flats have been a staple in my closet ever since I got them. They're incredibly lightweight and made with sustainable materials. Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day.

The Square Mary Jane, one of our favorite Mary Janes, is the best Rothy's deal we've seen for Prime Day. All four colors are $60 off, so grab a pair or a couple.

One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested.

The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. It would make a great companion on any trip or a day at the office.

These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures.

These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price.

Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. However, some offers are one-day 'daily deals', while others will only last as long as the stock does.

Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours.

No, but most are. Some items are just on a general discount, and we've spotted quite a few like that this year.

The majority are locked behind Prime membership. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over.

Very difficult to say. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday.

Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise.

This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later.

The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

The JPMorgan Chase & Co. headquarters in New York.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has told financial-technology companies that it will start charging fees amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to their customers' bank account information – a move that threatens to upend the industry's business models.

The largest US bank has sent pricing sheets to data aggregators — which connect banks and fintechs — outlining the new charges, according to people familiar with the matter. The fees vary depending on how companies use the information, with higher levies tied to payments-focused companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.

President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' delivers a temporary higher limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. But the phaseout, or income-based benefit reduction, could trigger a tax surprise for some higher earners, experts say.

If you itemize tax breaks, you can claim the SALT deduction, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. Trump's legislation raises the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 starting in 2025, with a 1% yearly increase through 2029, before reverting to $10,000 in 2030. 

However, the $40,000 SALT cap starts to phase out once modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, exceeds $500,000. The SALT limit drops to $10,000 once MAGI reaches $600,000. MAGI is adjusted gross income with some tax breaks added back in. 

This phaseout can create a ""SALT torpedo"" — an artificially high tax rate — when MAGI falls between $500,000 and $600,000, certified public accountant Jeff Levine said in a LinkedIn post this week.

In some cases, you could pay a 45.5% federal tax rate on earnings between those thresholds, experts say.

Here's how the ""SALT torpedo"" works and who could be impacted, according to tax experts.

Under Trump's legislation, the SALT deduction limit for 2025 is now $30,000 higher. But a 30% phaseout kicks in once MAGI exceeds $500,000 for 2025.

Between $500,000 and $600,000, ""you're losing 30% for every dollar"" of benefit between those thresholds, said certified financial planner Jim Guarino, managing director at Baker Newman Noyes in Woburn, Massachusetts. He is also a CPA.

At $600,000, if you multiply the extra $100,000 of income by 30%, that's a $30,000 benefit reduction, which drops the $40,000 SALT cap back to $10,000.

With the 30% SALT deduction phaseout between $500,000 and $600,000 of MAGI, some individuals could pay a higher-than-expected tax on earnings between those thresholds, according to Robert Keebler, a CPA with tax advisory firm Keebler & Associates in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Between $500,000 and $600,000, you're increasing taxable income while losing part of the SALT deduction, which raises your effective tax rate — the percent of taxable income you pay.

If taxable income rises while the SALT deduction falls, your effective tax rate on income between $500,000 and $600,000 could far exceed your regular income tax rate, Keebler said in a LinkedIn post last week.

""It's definitely a quirky little phaseout provision,"" Andy Whitehair, a CPA and a director with Baker Tilly's Washington tax council practice, told CNBC. ""When people start actually crunching numbers, they might be in for some surprises.""

Whitehair also shared a basic example of the phaseout on LinkedIn this week.

If your income is $500,000 and you subtract $75,000 of itemized deductions (including $40,000 for SALT), your taxable income is $425,000.

By contrast, $600,000 of income would drop the SALT deduction to $10,000, which reduces itemized deductions to $45,000, and raises taxable income to $555,000.

When comparing taxable income for each example, the true difference is $130,000 with the $30,000 lost SALT deduction. If you multiply that by the 35% tax bracket, you get $45,500.

In this simplified example, there is $45,500 more federal tax owed by earning $100,000 more, which is 45.5%, Whitehair said.

If your 2025 earnings could be near $500,000, you should run projections with a tax advisor and weigh strategies to reduce MAGI, experts say.

With the steep tax penalty between $500,000 and $600,000, you may reconsider Roth individual retirement conversions, incurring large capital gains or other moves that could boost your income, according to Keebler.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has added ""coffee entrepreneur"" to his already packed resume.

The three-time Super Bowl champion has invested in Throne Sport Coffee, adding to the 29-year-old superstar's portfolio off the field.

As his Chiefs and the rest of the NFL gear up for the upcoming season, Mahomes spoke to CNBC about his interest in coffee, his growing investment portfolio in sports properties, stadium politics in Kansas City and his take on an 18-game NFL season.

Mahomes became the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee in May 2024, with an undisclosed stake.

Today, he's not only an investor, but also the brand's lead pitchman and product tester — and a daily drinker.

""It actually started in my first year in the NFL,"" Mahomes told CNBC of his coffee habit. ""I was in a lot of meetings, and coffee became a functional need. But then I started to really love it, especially black coffee.""

When founder, CEO and beverage industry veteran Mike Fedele approached him with a ready-to-drink option designed to be a healthier caffeine boost, he said it felt like a natural fit for him.

""I really fell in love with just the taste and trying to make sure that what I was putting into my body was good,"" Mahomes said.

Fedele, who has worked with major brands like Coca-Cola and BodyArmor, said Throne stands out because it has 10 grams of protein and 40% less sugar than competitors. Throne Sport Coffee has about 50 calories in it with 1 gram of sugar.

For comparison, a ready-to-drink Starbucks Frappuccino can have as many as 300 calories and 47 grams of sugar.

""Given how frequently people that care about what they're putting into their bodies consume coffee, I felt there needed to be a better for you option,"" he said.

Mahomes said his daily caffeine habit includes three coffees a day: one when he wakes up, another before meetings and a third ahead of afternoon prep.

""It's probably too much,"" he laughed, ""but with Throne, I know I'm putting something clean in my body, no junk, no sugar, and added electrolytes, and B vitamins.""

On game days? He said he tones it down to just one or two.

The ready-to-drink coffee market is a rapidly growing category. Americans spent $17.7 billion on the category in 2023, according to Technomic.

Despite its growth prospects, Throne is competing in a crowded coffee space, with coffee shop competitors rounding out their ready-to-drink offering. Starbucks announced this week that it is expanding its ready-to-drink lineup, citing the latest consumer trends and growth of the category.

Throne is just one part of Mahomes' growing investment portfolio. The three-time Super Bowl MVP also holds minority stakes in MLB's Kansas City Royals, Sporting Kansas City of the MLS and the NWSL's KC Current, along with Alpine F1.

""I love sports. I love how they bring people together: families, communities. That's what I want to invest in,"" Mahomes said.

So does that mean he's eyeing a future ownership stake in the Chiefs?

""That would be cool,"" he said. ""Hopefully a long time from now, but yeah, I'd love to be a part of the team after I'm done playing. They've done so much for me.""

The Chiefs' stadium future is still undecided, as the franchise is deciding whether to renovate Arrowhead Stadium or build a new stadium in Kansas. Mahomes didn't say where he would prefer the team to play.

""Arrowhead is special. You feel the history. But wherever we play, the fans will show up,"" he said.

The Chiefs were recently granted a one-year extension to make a decision on their future stadium.

On leaguewide issues, Mahomes said he's cautious about proposals for an 18-game NFL season and international expansion, including the Chiefs' Week 1 game in Brazil.

""More games are tough on the body. If we're going to go to 18, we need more bye weeks. Same with international games, planning matters.""

COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The Putnam County Sheriff's Office is investigating multiple scams involving Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs.

PCSO reports that the scammers are requesting payments in the form of Bitcoin by depositing money in cryptocurrency ATMs.

“Scammers may claim the payment is needed for overdue bills, missed court dates, or a family emergency,” PCSO said. “Scammers may also claim to be local law enforcement, public officials, or government agencies.”

BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT) has announced the establishment of a $1 million strategic reserve in Ethereum (ETH), marking its first step toward expanding its presence in Ethereum's on-chain financial infrastructure. This strategic initiative represents BTCT's evolution from a crypto mining company to an on-chain financial infrastructure participant.

CEO Siguang Peng emphasized that this initial investment positions the company for future opportunities in decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. The decision is driven by Ethereum's dominant position in stablecoin infrastructure, high transaction volumes, and growing institutional adoption.

Das Unternehmen plant, seine ETH-Bestände entsprechend der Marktentwicklungen und Netzwerk-Updates weiter zu erhöhen.

BTCT's $1M Ethereum reserve signals strategic pivot toward DeFi infrastructure participation, positioning for stablecoin and tokenization opportunities.

BTCT's announcement of a $1 million Ethereum strategic reserve represents a calculated pivot in their business strategy. This initial investment signals the company's transition from a traditional crypto mining operation to a participant in on-chain financial infrastructure, particularly targeting the booming stablecoin ecosystem where Ethereum serves as the dominant settlement layer.

The strategic rationale centers on Ethereum's critical position in decentralized finance - over half of major stablecoins including USDT and USDC operate on Ethereum, creating massive transaction volumes approaching traditional financial rails. By establishing this reserve, BTCT is positioning itself to potentially capitalize on multiple value-creation opportunities:

This move aligns with emerging institutional trends where mining and blockchain companies diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The $1 million allocation appears to be just the first phase, with management indicating plans to ""scale that position"" and ""continuously augment its ETH holdings"" based on market developments.

The timing coincides with several technical catalysts that could enhance Ethereum's fundamental value proposition, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade, mature Layer-2 scaling solutions, and increasing regulatory clarity. Rather than merely holding cryptocurrency as a speculative asset, BTCT is strategically positioning to leverage Ethereum's programmable capabilities for potential revenue generation and infrastructure participation.

SINGAPORE, July 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BTC Digital Ltd. (""BTCT"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: BTCT), a leading blockchain technology company, today announced that it has established a strategic reserve of $1 million in Ethereum (ETH). This milestone marks the first phase of BTCT's broader initiative to deepen its exposure to Ethereum's on–chain financial infrastructure and to position the Company for long–term growth in the emerging digital–asset era.

""As the stablecoin market continues its explosive growth, Ethereum has emerged as the foundation of on–chain USD settlement and value transfer,"" said Mr. Siguang Peng, CEO of BTCT. ""By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. This strategic move strengthens our technological edge, enhances market confidence, and optimizes capital deployment.""

Key Drivers of BTCT's Ethereum Reserve Strategy:

Looking AheadBuilding on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from ""hash–rate provider"" to ""on–chain financial infrastructure participant."" The Company intends to continuously augment its ETH holdings in alignment with market developments and network upgrades. BTCT believes that Ethereum, akin to ""digital gold,"" will remain indispensable—not only as a stablecoin settlement hub but also as a catalyst for decentralized payments, asset tokenization, and the next wave of global financial interoperability.

With the market up across the board and Bitcoin breaking through multiple new all-time highs over the past two days, large-cap OG Layer 1 (L1) tokens in the top-20 — namely XRP, DOGE, ADA and XLM — are soaring.

Stellar's XLM, the 16th-largest crypto asset by market cap, leads the pack in terms of daily gains, up more than 25% on the day and 55% on the week. 

Cardano's ADA, ranking 11th, is up 15% on the day and 28% on the week, while Ripple's XRP gained nearly 12% on the day and 24% on the week No. 8 Dogecoin's DOGE is matching XRP on daily and weekly gains.

The four L1 assets, which often move together, are leading the charge in terms of 24-hour gains today among the top-20 — a strong signal of retail momentum, as these assets represent some of the longest-standing large-cap cryptocurrencies. While XLM may not always be considered part of that group, it does often move with them.

The top more crypto-native L1 assets are also making moves today in the broader market rally, albeit smaller ones. That said, their market capitalizations are so high that they don't always move quickly. 

ETH up 6% on the day and 18% on the week, breaking through $3,000 for the first time in over five months. BNB is up 3% on the day and 5% on the week, while SOL is up 4% on the day and 12% on the week. Newcomer Hyperliquid's HYPE is keeping pace with ETH, up 8% on the day and 19% on the week.

Other newer altcoins, like decentralized exchange (DEX) focused L1 Sei (SEI) and synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA), are up substantially more than these. SEI is up 19% on the day and 26% on the week, while ENA is up 17% on the day and 35% on the week.

Recent research from Delphi Digital showed that so-called crypto “dinos” — including XRP and ADA, alongside Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and IOTA — together performed better than more-hyped sector assets, like AI and DePIN tokens, since early January.

PENGU token jumped as much as 13% after Coinbase updated its official X profile picture to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, according to Binance data.

Coinbase's new profile photo comes on the heels of Alex, formerly with Binance, taking on the role of Head of Crypto Twitter Communications to enhance the firm's public messaging and community ties.

Alex took over our account for an hour. Now we're taking him over forever.

Welcome to Coinbase, @AlexOnchain.

(Legally we're required to point out that Alex has not technically joined forever and has a very normal employment contract with the company.) https://t.co/DmkNn2wwfd

— Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) July 11, 2025

“Normal job announcements are boring. I had to do something different, and a twitter takeover felt right,” Alex said in a Friday statement.

“The new focus is making comms more social native – direct, transparent and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct. They're already working on it, and I've joined to be a part of that change,” he added.

At the time of writing, PENGU changed hands at around $0.023, up over 20% in the last 24 hours. The token has regained upward momentum since Wednesday, as Bitcoin's rally has lifted the overall crypto market.

In addition, positive regulatory developments, with the SEC having recently acknowledged Canary Capital's spot PENGU ETF application, also helped boost its momentum.

This week, bitcoin hit a new all-time-high (above $118K) on the back of strong ETF flows and at least $280 million in new bitcoin treasury investments.

Treasury projects are also cropping up for Ethereum and Solana. Notably, Joseph Lubin's SharpLink ETH treasury bought 10,000 ETH for that project, and Bitmine announced plans to raise $2 billion for more ETH buying. Off that strong signal, large-cap “alts” like ETH and SOL saw near year-to-date highs, carrying other hot projects like SUI higher as well.

It was a week when the crypto markets seemed to be enjoying themselves as new legislation nears and investment flows from new institutional sources.

The U.S. House said it would take up the Senate version of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, making final passage easier. And industry leaders met on Capitol Hill to lobby for a comprehensive “Market Structure” bill.

It wasn't all plain sailing for innovators in the space. Robinhood faced skepticism over its tokenized stock plans, and then the Florida AG launched a lawsuit claiming the fintech engaged in deceptive crypto pricing. 

The Trump family's own crypto dealings continued to make news. Trump Media announced a multi-asset ETF application. And, Tron founder Justin Sun bought $100 million of $TRUMP and promised to help the memecoin go big in Asia and Africa.

Next week (dubbed ""Crypto Week"") promises to be historic for crypto news. The House considers stablecoin and market structure legislation and the Senate has a hearing planned on digital asset taxation. First a trickle, then a flood.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Plans Probe into Geoengineering

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has said she will hold a hearing on geoengineering as conspiracy theories have swirled around cloud seeding after the recent floods in Texas

CLIMATEWIRE | On a day when the EPA administrator elevated concerns about weather modification as his agency downplayed those worries, an outspoken House Republican said she would hold a hearing on the issue.

In a statement provided to POLITICO's E&E News, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she plans to use her perch as a subcommittee chair on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel to investigate geoengineering, a nascent field in which chemicals are dispersed in the air to lower temperatures.

“Let's be clear: Weather modification is no longer a ‘conspiracy theory.' It's real, it's happening, and the American people deserve a voice,” said Greene, who in the past has peddled fringe theories.

Such baseless assertions have been widespread in the aftermath of the deadly floods in Texas this past weekend, including that cloud seeding may have played a role in the disaster.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin released a video empathizing with people who have questions about contrails and geoengineering, which have been fodder for online conspiracists. He did not mention the floods in Texas; the new EPA webpages mostly debunked ""chemtrails"" and other such theories.

In her statement Thursday, Greene said that she planned to hold a hearing of her DOGE subcommittee ""on this critical issue and advancing my legislation to make it a felony to inject, release, or disperse chemicals into the atmosphere for the purpose of altering weather, climate, temperature, or sunlight.”

Moreover, this past weekend, Greene posted on social media that she planned to introduce legislation to bar such weather-changing technology. She said she was heartened by EPA's actions.

In his video Thursday, Zeldin said, “To anyone who's ever looked up to the streaks in the sky and asked, 'What the heck is going on?' or seen headlines about private actors and even governments looking to blot out the sun in the name of stopping global warming, we've endeavored to answer all of your questions at the links on your screen.""

He added, “In fact, EPA shares many of the same concerns when it comes to potential threats to human health and the environment, especially from solar geoengineering activities.”

Democratic lawmakers mocked the EPA administrator for discussing contrails — the benign condensation often seen from aircraft. One called him “a full-on kook.”

In her statement, Greene said she spoke with Zeldin on Thursday morning. “I'm glad weather modification and geoengineering are finally getting the attention and transparency they deserve, and I'm greatly appreciative to the Trump administration for it,” the lawmaker said.

Some have suspected cloud seeding could have caused the drenching rain in Kerr County, Texas, leading to flooding that killed more than 100 people.

That has been deemed impossible by experts, The Washington Post reported, and dismissed by elected officials, including Republicans in the state.

“Let's put an end to the conspiracy theories and stop blaming others,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement Wednesday.

Your Garbage Has a ‘Wild Afterlife' on the International Black Market

Alexander Clapp, author of new nonfiction book Waste Wars, tracks the worldwide black market trade of our garbage

By Brianne Kane edited by Andrea Gawrylewski

Sorting your trash and recycling is common practice: break down the cardboard boxes, separate the compostable material and plastics and put them into the correct containers, put the trash on the curb, and you're done. But what happens next is where the story gets interesting. A billion-dollar industry exists around moving countless tons of waste from wealthy countries to poorer ones. For two years journalist Alexander Clapp lived out of a backpack and visited the smelliest parts of the most beautiful places on Earth—looking for hidden dump sites in the Venezuelan jungle and scaling mountains of trash in Ghana—for his new book Waste Wars: The Wild Afterlife of Your Trash. He tracks the massive scope of waste management, from top-level international relations to underground whisper networks, and reveals the dirty underbelly of what happens to our trash.

Scientific American spoke with Clapp about the people who break apart and sort our trash all over the world, the growth of the global waste economy and the future of waste management.

Can you tell me where our exported garbage and not-quite-recyclable goods end up?

It would depend what type of trash we're talking about, when we're talking about it or from which country it's being discarded. But a lot of global trash over the last 30 to 40 years has been going to poor countries under the guise that it's being recycled. That trash will get broken down, or someone will attempt to make some use out of it—to extract some profit from it—and that's an extremely dangerous and often lethal process where all sorts of contaminants and forever chemicals enter local ecosystems. They go into the air, they go into the water, and they do huge amounts of damage—damage to, disproportionately, the most vulnerable populations in the world.

Why would one country ever, under any circumstances, buy the garbage from another country? Is someone getting scammed, or is there a legitimate reason to buy boatloads of biological, technological or toxic waste?

That is one of the reasons why I got interested in this topic. We send our waste to the very countries that cannot handle their own domestic waste outputs. I think the dichotomy that's worth keeping in mind with the waste trade is that it's not necessarily rich countries versus poor countries; within poor countries, you have importers who are actually buying the waste for pennies, and they are very much part of the problem. The most important thing to understand about the waste trade is that in the 1980s many poor countries felt that they had no option other than to import waste from the so-called global north. They were heavily indebted; they were desperate for factories, ports, industry of any kind. And so I think there's a really insipid, disturbing history of how and why the waste trade began.

Which leads to the question—how much money is actually involved in this global waste economy?

Let's say it costs $140 to put a ton of old plastic in a landfill. A waste broker would actually have to pay the landfill in order to bury that plastic. But what if instead you could sell that plastic to an importer in Malaysia for a few dollars? Then you're not paying $140; you're actually making $2 or $3. That said, a lot of the waste trade, by nature, is operating underground. If you're sending waste to another country, you're not calling it trash on any export document—you're calling it recyclable material. One thing that I hope my book encourages or leads people to question is how much of our waste is actually moving around the world.

What are you most interested in regarding the future of this waste economy and of waste management on a global scale?

I think what's really interesting about the global waste trade is that in many ways it's like the global drug trade. You see organized crime groups that are getting more and more involved in the waste trade because, frankly, the supply of this stuff is endless. The punishment if you get caught moving waste is negligible. I think the future of waste export and waste movement is organized crime. I think they're going to see this as a monumentally lucrative opportunity.

What was the most shocking story you uncovered while researching for this book?

The most shocking story probably was with the cruise ship-dismantling industry in Türkiye. On the Aegean coast of Türkiye, there's a [town] called Aliağa where American cruise ship companies disproportionately send a lot of their ships to be dismantled. And you would think that the process of deconstructing a cruise ship would be mechanically refined, but it's actually kind of this maniacal process done almost entirely by hand where you have armies of helmeted men filing into these cruise ships and breaking this stuff up. One thing that I found was that most of the men who get recruited into doing this work have little idea of what they're doing. They've never seen the ocean before. They were recruited from the middle of Türkiye and given a week's worth of training. It's absolutely excruciating.

What was the most surprisingly common occurrence across all of your research?

In terms of the most common story that I would hear, it's the extent to which in poor countries trash, and especially plastic, is just regarded as another commodity. Generally [the people I encountered didn't] think about this stuff as a potentially toxic substance. That was shocking to me. In places such as Java and [other parts of] Indonesia, hundreds of tons of Western plastic are imported every week and used as fuel in tofu factories, and then that tofu gets exported around the world's most populous island [Java]. I was just struck by how kind of pedestrian it seems to just burn plastic in places to get rid of it or to find some use for it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Mathematicians Say There's a Number So Big, It's Literally the Edge of Human Knowledge","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a65357535/busy-beaver-six/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

We've found the first five Busy Beaver numbers, but the sixth may be bigger than the number of atoms in the universe.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For most people, the term “busy beaver” brings to mind a tireless worker or (for the biologists among us) an absolutely vital ecosystem engineer. However, for mathematicians, “busy beaver” takes on a similar-yet-unique meaning. True to the moniker's original intent, the idea represents a lot of work, but it's work pointed at a question. As computer scientists Christopher Moore puts it in a video for Quanta Magazine, “What's the longest, most-complicated thing [a computer] can do, and then stop?” In other words, what's the longest function a computer can run that does not just run forever, stuck in an infinite loop?

The solution to this question is called the Busy Beaver number, or BB(n), where the n represents a number of instructions called ‘states' that a set of computers—specifically, a type of simple computer called a Turing machine—has to follow. Each state produces a certain number of programs, and each program gets its own Turing machine, so things get complicated fast. BB(1), which has just 1 state, necessitates the use of 25 Turing machines. For decades, many mathematicians believed that solving the Busy Beaver number to four states was the upper limit, but a group of experts managed to confirmed the BB(5) solution in 2024 (on Discord, of all places). Now, participants in that same Busy Beaver Challenge are learning fascinating truths about the next frontier—BB(6)—and how it just might represent the very edge of mathematics, according to a new report by New Scientist.

First, a brief explanation. The aforementioned BB(1), which is the simplest version of the BB(n) problem, uses just one set of rules and produces only two outcomes—infinitely moving across the tape, or stopping at the first number. Because 1 is the most amount of steps that any of the 25 Turing machines of BB(1) will complete before finishing its program (known as halting), the answer to BB(1) is 1. As the number of states increases, so do the steps and the number of Turing machines needed to run the programs, meaning that each subsequent BB(n) is exponentially more taxing to solve. BB(2) and  BB(3) are 6 and 21 respectively, but BB(4) is 107 and takes seven billion different Turing machines to solve. Granted, many of these machines continue on indefinitely and can be discarded, but many do not. 

The Busy Beaver number was first formulated by the Hungarian mathematician Tiber Radó in 1962, and 12 years passed before computer scientist Allen Brady determined that BB(4) runs for 107 steps before halting. For decades, this seemed like the absolute limit of what was discernible, but then mathematicians solved BB(5) in 2024 after sifting through 17 trillion (with a t) possible Turing machines. The answer? An astounding 47,176,870 steps. Quanta Magazine has an excellent explainer about how this was achieved.

But finally solving BB(5) presented the next obvious question: What about BB(6)? Of course, adding just one more rule makes the problem beyond super exponentially harder, as BB(6) is estimated to require 60 quadrillion Turing machines. 

“The Busy Beaver problem gives you a very concrete scale for pondering the frontier of mathematical knowledge,” computer scientist Tristan Stérin, who helped start the Busy Beaver Challenge in 2022, told New Scientist. 

In a new post, anonymous user “mxdys”—who was instrumental in finally confirming BB(5)—wrote that the answer to BB(6) is likely so unfathomably large that the number itself likely needs its own explanation, as it's likely too big to describe via exponentiation. Instead, it relies on tetration (written as, say, yx, as opposed to exponentiation's xy) in which where the exponent is also iterated, creating a tower of exponents. As Scott Aaronson, an American computer scientist who helped define BB(5), notes on his blog, that means 1510 can be thought of as “10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15 times.”

As mxdys notes, BB(6) is at least 2 tetrated to the 2 tetrated to the 2 tetrated to the 9. One mathematician speaking with New Scientist said that it's likely that the number of all atoms in the universe would look “puny” by comparison. While these large numbers boggle the mind, they also tell mathematicians about the limitations of the foundation of modern mathematics—known as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC)—as well slippery mathematical concepts like the Collatz conjecture. 

It's unlikely that mathematicians will ever solve BB(6), but if the Busy Beaver Challenge is any evidence, that fact likely won't stop them from trying.

The competition between these two mega-retailers is heating up for discounts on one of our favorite tool brands. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

We regularly spot plenty of our favorite tested tool brands on sale—but Milwaukee isn't one of them. So when we find deals on the iconic red and black cordless drills, reciprocating saws, and impact drivers, we pay attention. 

Unless you're living under a rock, no doubt you've been busy shopping Amazon Prime Day, which kicked off earlier this week and runs through tomorrow, Friday, July 11. We're doing the same—particularly for DeWalt tools. But when we did a side-by-side comparison of sales on Milwaukee tools, it turns out that Walmart had the deeper discounts, with savings up to 50 percent off. 

For example, our favorite cordless angle grinder is currently 44 percent off at Walmart (compared to a mere 21 percent off on Amazon). The angle grinder's max speed is a solid 5,800 rpm, and the tool features an impressive lineup of safety features, including overload protection and an electronic clutch. 

""It also comes equipped with a removable side handle that gives you tremendous control over the tool to keep you safe and your cuts accurate and straight,"" says Tony Carrick, one of our tool experts in his favorite Milwaukee tools story.   

Milwaukee's two-pack of high-output batteries is another great deal, currently an impressive 50 percent off—a savings of $150—at Walmart. These 18-volt batteries are compatible with over 150 M18 cordless tools and have a 6-amp-hour capacity. They also come with overload protection and a three-year warranty. 

And finally, you can't beat 40 percent off this mid-torque impact wrench at Walmart. ""It produces 550 foot-pounds of fastening and 650 foot-pounds of loosening torque, yet it measures just six inches long and weighs only five pounds when loaded with the recommended 5Ah battery,""  Carrick says. 

If you need more tools to round out your arsenal, check out these other discounts on Milwaukee tools we've vetted.  

At just 4.9 inches long, this is the most compact tool in its class. It also has customizable speed and torque settings. 

This kit comes with an included battery pack. That makes it a better value than the Amazon kit, which lacks one. 

""This driver puts out tremendous power with a max torque of 2,000 inch-pounds and runs at a top speed of 3,900 RPM,"" says Carrick.

The hammer drill is only 6.9 inches in length to get into tight spaces, and the impact driver's trigger is ultra-responsive for precise fastening.

Antarctic bed topography influences how the overlying ice sheet responds to climate change and provides a record of long-term glacial history. However, knowledge of the processes that governed the development of the landscape before glacial inception and how this modulated subsequent ice-sheet evolution remains limited. Here we use radio-echo sounding to reveal extensive flat surfaces beneath the ice margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land, East Antarctica. When their elevations are isostatically adjusted for unloading of the present-day ice load, these surfaces cluster at 200–450 metres above sea level and dip gently in an offshore direction. We show that the surfaces are fragments of a once-contiguous coastal plain formed by fluvial erosion, which dates from between the separation of East Antarctica from Australia (~100–80 Ma) and the onset of Southern Hemisphere ice-sheet glaciation (~34 Ma). The preservation of these landforms indicates a lack of intense, selective erosion of the surfaces throughout Antarctica's glacial history. Fast-flowing ice has instead been directed through inherited tectonic structures and fluvial valleys, leading to the incision of overdeepened subglacial troughs between the flat surfaces and thus modulating the responsiveness of the ice sheet to climate change.

Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and its contribution to global sea-level rise, have accelerated in recent decades1. While much focus has been on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet2,3, recent studies have highlighted the potential vulnerability of parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), which contains ~90% of the 58 metres sea-level equivalent held in Antarctica4,5. The EAIS sector between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land (70° E to 160° E) is of especial importance because the sub-ice topography contains two large low-lying basins and numerous deep troughs (Fig. 1a)4 that may render the ice margin susceptible to rapid and irreversible retreat via marine ice-sheet instability processes6. This margin has experienced ice-shelf thinning since the 1970s7 and is predicted to be a potentially major contributor to future sea-level rise by numerical ice-sheet models8,9,10. However, substantial uncertainty persists regarding the projected extent and rate of future ice thinning and margin retreat11.

Thick black lines mark the locations of RES profiles shown in panels b–e. Geographical features mentioned in the text are labelled. Inset shows the study area (red box) within Antarctica. b, Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2017 CHINARE (CHA2) survey24 (profile B–B'). c, Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2019 Operation IceBridge survey25 (profile C–C'). d, Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2009 ICECAP survey15 (profile D–D'). e, Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2019 Operation IceBridge survey25 (profile E–E'). In each radargram, the solid line marks the ice surface; the major reflector below is the bed topography. Elevations are relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid. Flight line ID numbers are labelled.

Two primary sources of this uncertainty are (1) insufficient knowledge of basal conditions (for example, morphology, temperature, friction and hydrology), which influence ice dynamics and therefore sea-level rise12, and (2) limited understanding of long-term EAIS evolution, including its response to past episodes of ocean–atmosphere warming that serve as analogues for contemporary climate change13. Addressing both is crucial for improving the ability of numerical ice-sheet models to robustly project future change14.

The land surface beneath the EAIS provides a valuable record of ice-sheet behaviour since its inception (~34 million years ago (Ma)) and the geological processes that have shaped the basal environment15,16,17. Across the continents that were formerly connected to East Antarctica in the supercontinent of Gondwana (Africa, India and Australia), the geomorphological record provides the foundation for understanding the tectonic, erosional and climatic history that has influenced long-term landscape development18. In Antarctica, airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys are used to measure ice thickness and bed elevation19 and generate kilometre-resolution gridded bed products4,20 (Fig. 1a). However, the gridding process causes critical geomorphological information to be lost or obscured21. Direct measurements of East Antarctic bed topography derived from RES therefore provide a vital opportunity to better understand past, present and future EAIS behaviour22.

In this study, we examine RES data from multiple surveys and discover coherent pre-glacial surfaces preserved around the 3,500-km-long margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land. Analysis of the distribution, elevation and morphology of the surfaces enables us to constrain the basal conditions and long-term behaviour of the EAIS margin and demonstrates that geological processes that operated millions of years ago continue to play a critical role in contemporary EAIS behaviour.

To characterize the subglacial topography of the study area, we combined bed elevation measurements from four airborne RES surveys: (1) WISE-ISODYN (Wilkes Basin/Transantarctic Mountains System Exploration–Icehouse Earth: Stability or Dynamism?) 2005–0623, (2) ICECAP (International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling) 2009–1315, (3) CHINARE (Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition) CHA1–4 2015–1924 and (4) OIB (Operation IceBridge) 201925 (Extended Data Fig. 1). The exact along-track sampling rate depends on the radar platform but is typically ~20 m; the vertical resolution is ~5–10 m (Extended Data Table 1). The coverage of these surveys enabled us to conduct a systematic analysis of the regional bed topography (Methods), which revealed a series of conspicuous low-angle (gradient < 1°), low-relief (internal relief < 200 m) surfaces, hereafter referred to as ‘flat surfaces'.

We mapped 31 flat surfaces around the East Antarctic margin from Princess Elizabeth Land to George V Land (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2). Individual surfaces are characterized by internally consistent elevations and morphologies across 10s to 100s of kilometres, with low-amplitude (<200 m) surficial roughness (Fig. 1b–e). In places, the surfaces are incised by valleys up to 1 km deep and bordered by steep-sided subglacial troughs (Fig. 1). The surfaces range from 200 to 50,000 km2 in area and in total comprise ~40% of the perimeter of the EAIS between 70° E and 160° E. On the inland side of the flat surfaces, there is a transition to rougher, higher-elevation topography (Extended Data Fig. 2). The majority of the surfaces are overlain by 500–1,500 m of ice, with a minority located farther into the continental interior and situated beneath ice up to 2,500 m thick4 (Supplementary Text 1).

a, In situ bed elevations of the 31 flat surfaces mapped around the EAIS margin (limits marked in white). Bed elevations were extracted from RES profiles and filtered to remove points that deviate from the local mode by at least ±50 m (that is, valleys or inselbergs). b, Rebounded bed elevations of the flat surfaces. Rebounded elevations were computed by adding the in situ elevations to the total isostatic response to the complete removal of the EAIS27. All elevations are relative to present-day global mean sea level (the EIGEN-6C4 geoid). Vectors indicate the dip direction of the surfaces, with vector lengths proportional to the dip angle. Blue line marks the −1,000 m bathymetric contour4, indicating the position of the continental shelf edge. Insets show the corresponding frequency distributions of elevation (that is, hypsometries). Purple stars mark the surface outcrops in the Bunger Hills and Vestfold Hills. Red line in panel a shows 16 RES profile segments used to construct a near-continuous profile around the EAIS margin.

We quantified flat-surface morphology using the RES-derived bed elevation measurements (Fig. 2). Hypsometry (frequency distribution of elevations) shows that, beneath the modern EAIS, the surfaces are situated at a wide range of elevations between −900 and +300 m relative to global mean sea level (Fig. 2a), with a standard deviation of 300 m and a negative excess kurtosis (−0.98). The surfaces are horizontal or gently sloping (<1°) with no systematic alignment in dip direction (Fig. 2a). Across all 31 surfaces, the modal local topographic relief (range of elevations within a 5-km moving window) is ~100 m (Extended Data Fig. 3), with an interquartile range of 80–210 m. Although ice-free land is rare in East Antarctica, isolated coastal outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills (Fig. 2) exhibit near-identical elevations26 and local relief to the adjacent subglacial flat surfaces, and likely represent exposed fragments of the surfaces on their coastward edges (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Notably, when flat-surface elevations are isostatically adjusted for the complete removal of the EAIS27 (Methods and Supplementary Text 1 and 2), the hypsometric distribution is characterized by a well-defined modal peak at +200–450 m (Fig. 2b) and a reduced standard deviation of 135 m. The hypsometric distribution has a positive excess kurtosis (0.57) and a skewness of −0.21; this asymmetry reflects the presence of valleys incised into the flat surfaces (Fig. 1). Moreover, when adjusted for EAIS removal, the dips of the surfaces systematically align orthogonal to the coast, with gentle coastward dip angles of up to 0.8° (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5). This applies to all surfaces proximal to the coast; the surfaces farther into the interior of the Wilkes and Sabrina Subglacial Basins show a more complex pattern of dips, which may reflect differences in inherited morphology, erosive history and/or local tectonic deformation.

Bedrock geology does not appear to exert a strong control on flat-surface elevation or morphology in East Antarctica. Regional geology comprises primarily Archaean–Proterozoic crystalline gneisses, with intervening Palaeozoic–Mesozoic orogenic belts, igneous intrusive provinces and rift basins28,29. Flat surfaces are present within each geological province, and some surfaces cut across geological boundaries (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6). While we note a slight increase in modal flat-surface elevation moving westwards around the margin (Extended Data Fig. 6), Gaussian mixture model cluster analysis indicates that the flat surfaces comprise a single, statistically consistent, population according to their elevations and morphologies (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7).

Horizontal dashed line marks the 100 m yr−1 contour, an approximate threshold of fast flow. b, Ice surface and bed elevation from 16 RES profiles used to construct the transect. Flat surfaces are highlighted in purple. Dashed lines mark sections of bed overlain by floating ice shelves; sub-shelf bathymetry from BedMachine4 version 3. Red/blue shading indicates the model-predicted basal thermal state of the EAIS32; red, basal ice within 2 °C of the pressure melting point (that is, ‘warm-based'); blue, basal ice >2 °C below the pressure melting point (that is, ‘cold-based'). Horizontal bars between panels a and b mark the extents of the major geological provinces along the transect28,29.

Ice-surface velocities above the flat surfaces are consistently low; only five surfaces have a mean overlying flow speed of >50 m yr−1, and none exceeds 100 m yr−1 (ref. 30). Fast ice flows around the flat surfaces and through the intervening deep troughs that host major outlets, including the Mertz, Totten and Denman Glaciers (Fig. 3a). Observational constraints from radar attenuation rates and bed-echo power in George V Land and Adélie Land indicate that the flat surfaces in these regions are typically situated beneath ice that is probably cold-based (that is, frozen bed) whereas the adjacent troughs probably host warm-based ice (that is, thawed bed;31 Extended Data Fig. 8). Ice-sheet model predictions of modern basal temperatures also indicate that the basal thermal state of the ice overlying the flat surfaces is cold-based, with warm-based ice in the intervening topographic lows32 (Fig. 3b).

We interpret the flat surfaces to have originated as pre-glacial fluvial planation surfaces. The reasons for this are threefold. First, the strong clustering of rebounded elevations around the entire margin (Fig. 2b) is indicative of surface formation via a single process operating in the absence of the ice sheet. Second, the gentle coastward dips of the surfaces (Fig. 2b) are consistent with coastal plains formed by planation to base level by river systems, as observed along former Gondwanan passive margins such as southern Australia and southwest Africa33. Third, the flat surfaces cut across the regional geological structure (Fig. 3b), indicating that they are not the expression of an exhumed geological surface such as an erosion-resistant stratigraphic horizon.

We discount both marine and ice-sheet planation as primary formation mechanisms for the flat surfaces as there are no modern analogues for the generation of coherent, morphologically consistent flat surfaces over such large distances (3,500 km) in an inland setting via these processes. The surfaces extend too far inland and above sea level to have been eroded by wave action or truncated by grounding-zone/ice-shelf fluctuations, and neither process can account for the consistent coastward overall dips of the surfaces. We also discount the surfaces being sediment-draped depositional features because of their observed high-frequency, low-amplitude roughness (Fig. 1b–e). This is indicative of erosion of coherent bedrock. Indeed, the exposed continuations of the flat surfaces in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills comprise Archaean–Proterozoic crystalline gneisses34.

The first-order topography of this sector of the East Antarctic margin closely resembles that of its conjugate in southern Australia. Both are characterized by low elevations and gradients along much of their length and high terrain at their eastern end (Fig. 4). The narrow, unimodal hypsometric distributions of both margins are also closely comparable (Fig. 4c). As is the case for many passive margins, the southern Australian margin (which has escaped Cenozoic glaciation) is characterized by a low-relief coastal plain, which formed via long-term fluvial planation18 following its separation from East Antarctica. We suggest a similar fluvial origin for the flat surfaces mapped along the East Antarctic conjugate margin.

Box plots mark the mean (circle), median (central line), interquartile range (box) and 5th and 95th percentiles (outer bars).

Although we interpret the first-order morphology (that is, elevations and overall dips) of the flat surfaces as being fluvial in origin, we emphasize that the second-order morphology (that is, surficial roughness) was probably generated by ice. This is evidenced by the geomorphology of the Bunger and Vestfold Hills, which closely resemble ‘knock-and-lochan' topography formed via the removal of regolith and ‘etching' of the bedrock surface by areal scouring beneath warm-based ice35,36 (Extended Data Fig. 4). The local relief of the subglacial surfaces (80–210 m) is ~100 m larger than the local relief of the southern Australian conjugate margin (Fig. 4d) and is consistent with the exposed outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills. In landscapes of areal scour elsewhere on Earth (for example, former ice-sheet beds such as Baffin Island; Fig. 4d), the depth of scouring is <100 m (ref. 36). This indicates that the flat surfaces have been subjected to scouring, which increased their internal relief by up to 100 m.

Scouring of the flat surfaces by warm-based ice probably occurred earlier in the history of the EAIS. This is evidenced by the presence of localized Pliocene (~4 Ma) shallow marine deposits that drape the coastal surfaces in the Vestfold (and neighbouring Larsemann) Hills and are not scoured37, which shows that the scouring (and the flat surfaces themselves) pre-date the Pliocene. Although it is difficult to further constrain the age of scouring, there is evidence for limited EAIS erosion under a progressively arid polar climate since the mid-Miocene5,22. We suggest that the erosive events occurred under the more dynamic ice sheets of the Oligocene/early Miocene38,39, although more recent erosive modification cannot be discounted.

Selective incision of deep glacial troughs divided the once-contiguous surface into the multiple coherent fragments observed today (Fig. 3b). This selectivity of glacial erosion is evidenced by the correlation between the positions of these troughs and the thickest sequences of post-34 Ma offshore sediment40. Indeed, the continental shelf width (a proxy for the amount of sediment progradation) is narrower in front of the flat surfaces than the intervening deep troughs (Fig. 2) (ref. 41), indicating that the surfaces have not experienced substantial glacial erosion. The continuity of the flat surfaces either side of the intervening deep troughs (Fig. 3b) also indicates that they pre-date trough incision. This incision probably commenced soon after ~34 Ma (ref. 42), and possibly several million years earlier38, which places a lower bound on the timing of original surface planation by fluvial systems.

Sediment provenance studies show that, before break-up, trans-Gondwanan fluvial pathways extended from central East Antarctica to northwestern Australia (via Wilkes Land and southwestern Australia; Fig. 5a)43. This indicates that there was early connectivity of the already relatively low-lying Antarctic and Australian fluvial landscapes, which may have started to develop as early as the Triassic period44. Relative motion between the continents commenced at ~160 Ma, and seafloor spreading onset is dated at ~100–80 Ma (ref. 45). Following continental break-up, minor post-rift uplift and the formation of a new (lower) base level would have triggered enhanced erosion, with fluvial systems grading the landscape to base level as a seaway formed between East Antarctica and Australia. We envisage that this process formed a contiguous coastward-dipping planation surface around the East Antarctic margin, as well as reorganization of pre-break-up fluvial pathways. Indeed, the Yilgarn Plateau in southwestern Australia (Fig. 4a) contains palaeochannels of middle Eocene age (~45 Ma) with an inland-facing palaeo-drainage direction46, a pattern probably caused by minor escarpment uplift (Fig. 5b). We therefore infer that East Antarctic flat-surface planation post-dated Australia–Antarctica separation (~80 Ma) and pre-dated EAIS inception (~34 Ma).

a, Before Gondwana break-up (pre-160 Ma), transcontinental fluvial drainage systems flowed from the highlands of interior East Antarctica to the northwestern coast of Australia43. b, Following continental break-up and seafloor spreading onset at ~80 Ma, a small (~200 m) escarpment formed along parts of the southern Australian margin, and an interior drainage network was established on the inland side. In East Antarctica, rivers eroded down to the new base level, forming a low-lying, seaward-dipping coastal plain. c, After ~34 Ma, Australia's climate became increasingly arid, and the interior drainage network became extinct. A limestone seabed became subaerially exposed during the Miocene, forming the Nullarbor Plain59. Following ice-sheet growth, remnants of the East Antarctic fluvial planation surface were surficially scoured by ice, but the first-order inherited fluvial structure was preserved due to prevailing low subglacial erosion rates in these areas. Contemporaneously, fast-flowing, warm-based ice selectively exploited existing structural weaknesses (red dashed lines) and/or river valleys to erode deep glacial troughs between the flat-surface fragments.

The seaward edges of the East Antarctic flat surfaces (under ice-free conditions; Fig. 2b) are consistently ~150 m above present-day sea level, providing an approximate indication of base level at the time of formation. Although the surfaces may have subsequently been vertically displaced by processes including post-rift thermal subsidence and the isostatic response to glacial trough erosion and offshore sediment deposition, calculations show that the contributions of these processes would have been minor (<50 m; Supplementary Text 3–5). Moreover, these processes generate displacements with opposite signs that partially cancel out. Importantly, these processes cannot account for the consistent elevations and gentle coastward dips of the flat surfaces. A base level 150 ± 50 m higher than today is in broad agreement with estimates of global sea level for the Palaeocene to early Eocene (~66–48 Ma; Supplementary Text 2)47,48.

Our findings demonstrate that tectonic and surface processes that operated millions of years ago have been crucial in preconditioning the behaviour of the EAIS margin, including its most sensitive outlets. Contemporary ice flow is focused through the deep troughs between the remnants of the pre-glacial fluvial planation surface30 (Fig. 3). Inherited geological structures and/or weaknesses may have been exploited by pre-glacial river valleys and in turn by early outlet glaciers when the EAIS first expanded to continental scale38. Preferential steering of ice and basal meltwater49,50 would facilitate selective incision of existing topographic lows to form the overdeepened troughs observed today (Fig. 5). The deep troughs now host fast-flowing glaciers such as Totten, Mertz and Denman (Fig. 3), which are vulnerable to retreat via marine ice instability feedbacks owing to their topography4.

The presence of extensive pre-glacial surfaces between the deep troughs has important implications for long-term ice behaviour. To have preserved these surfaces with minor modification (that is, scouring) since at least ~34 Ma, the long-term average basal conditions of these parts of the EAIS must have been conducive to low erosion rates (that is, cold-based and/or slow-moving; Fig. 5)51. Generation of high-frequency, low-amplitude roughness across the surfaces via areal scour can only have been short-lived and/or intermittent; otherwise, the surfaces would not exhibit such consistent rebounded elevations and coastward dips around the entire margin. The surfaces therefore act as a new constraint for basal thermal state around the EAIS margin, which is one of the key factors that govern the rate of basal sliding and onset of fast ice flow but is poorly understood and differs between ice-sheet models31.

The observation that the sub-ice flat surfaces are contiguous with outcrops in the Bunger and Vestfold Hills enables us to further constrain basal conditions across a large, grounding-zone proximal sector of the EAIS margin. On the basis of the geology of these exposed areas52, we infer the presence of hard, crystalline bedrock across the flat surfaces adjacent to these outcrops. These lithologies are typically associated with relatively high basal friction, low permeability and low erodibility12. Other flat surfaces, particularly those within Wilkes and Sabrina Subglacial Basins, may instead comprise coherent sedimentary rock29.

We hypothesize that the flat surfaces would play a stabilizing role during past and future grounding-zone retreat. As the ice margin retreats and thins, increased flotation of ice may occur within the low-lying troughs (Fig. 3). However, ice would probably remain grounded on the flat surfaces, which stand 1–2 km higher than the adjacent troughs (Fig. 3b), resulting in the formation of ice rises53. Grounding may be reinforced as the flat surfaces increase in elevation due to the regional isostatic response to ice unloading, depending on the rebound rate27,53. Indeed, ice rises underlain by flat-topped bathymetric highs are observed in the Weddell and Ross Sea embayments21,53,54, and some flat surfaces mapped in this study currently host ice rises, including the Law Dome (Fig. 4)53. Ice rises act as pinning points and buttress the inland ice, reducing mass flux to the ocean and inhibiting grounding-zone retreat55,56, and can also increase local accumulation rates57. However, ice-rise formation may not be fully captured in continental-scale ice-sheet models8,9,10, particularly if ice shelves are not retained during grounding-zone retreat. Limited model resolution and/or uncertainties surrounding the parameterization of processes that determine grounding-zone position (for example, marine ice-sheet instability, ice-cliff calving, ice-shelf hydrofracturing and glacial isostatic adjustment) may also contribute to this issue6. The spatial distribution of the mapped flat surfaces may facilitate the formation of ice rises capable of slowing the rate of grounding-zone retreat during warmer climates.

We emphasize the need for further exploration of the influence of the flat surfaces on ice dynamics during past warmer climates, for example, through acquisition of offshore records, onshore bedrock sampling and testing of numerical ice models that apply appropriate physics at a resolution sufficient to resolve grounding-zone dynamics and ice-rise formation. This will help further resolve the nature of past EAIS margin retreat, with important implications for projections of future ice change and sea-level rise in a warming world.

We used RES data to map subglacial flat surfaces around the margin of East Antarctica between Princess Elizabeth Land (70° E) and George V Land (160° E). We used geolocated ice thickness data acquired during four airborne RES surveys:

WISE-ISODYN23

ICECAP15

CHINARE24

OIB25

Given the close similarity of the along-track sampling rates and vertical resolutions of each of the four survey platforms (Extended Data Table 1), all along-track ice thickness measurements were integrated into a single database with no additional processing. The latitude and longitude of each sample point were projected into polar stereographic (EPSG:3031) eastings and northings. These coordinates were in turn used to compute the along-track Cartesian distance for each survey line. Bed elevations were determined by subtracting ice thickness from the ice-surface elevation; for each survey, elevations are referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid. To ensure all bed elevations were referenced to global mean sea level, we shifted them onto the EIGEN-6C4 geoid using the BedMachine Antarctica geoid height correction4. To ensure consistency across the entire dataset and to avoid aliasing of high-frequency variations in elevation, we upsampled the bed elevation data along each survey line to a uniform along-track spacing of 10 m.

To locate candidate flat surfaces, we performed a first-pass visual inspection of each survey line in the compiled bed elevation dataset and noted sections of the profiles characterized by coherent, low-relief, low-angle topography. We then fitted a linear polynomial (in the least-squares sense) to each of these one-dimensional (distance versus elevation) profile segments, which ranged in length from ~10 to ~200 km. This polynomial was used to estimate the overall gradient from the start to the end of the profile. We imposed a condition that any segment with a gradient exceeding 1° was excluded from our inventory. We note that the flight lines have a range of azimuths (Extended Data Fig. 1) and will typically not be oriented along the direction of steepest gradient of a two-dimensional topographic surface, but because this will result in an underestimation of the gradient at this stage, ‘borderline' low-angle surfaces will be included (rather than excluded) in this first-pass compilation.

We also estimated the local-scale relief within the candidate flat surfaces by computing the moving minimum and moving maximum elevations within a 5 km window passed along the profile segments. The difference between the moving minimum and maximum provides an indication of the local-scale (that is, <5 km) relief (that is, range in elevations) across the flat-surface segments. We imposed a condition that any segment with a median local relief exceeding 200 m was excluded. Any segment not excluded by these two conditions was considered to be a segment of a low-angle, low-relief (that is, ‘flat') surface. In total, we identified 538 such segments within the full RES dataset. We then plotted the spatial extent of these segments and manually digitized polygons demarcating the two-dimensional extent of 31 separate flat surfaces within the study area.

To characterize flat-surface morphology, we extracted the bed elevation points from the 538 segments, each of which is assigned to one of the 31 separate flat surfaces. Each segment profile was detrended by subtracting a linear polynomial (fitted in the least-squares sense) from the observed bed elevations. We then identified the modal detrended elevation by grouping the elevations into 10 m bins. The segments were then modal filtered by removing any point deviating from the mode by more than 50 m. These points constitute valleys incised into the modal surface or peaks protruding above it. The remaining points were considered to represent the contiguous flat surface itself and were restored to their true elevations by re-adding the linear polynomial. These restored modal-filtered elevations were used to determine the hypsometry—the frequency distribution of elevation across all the flat surfaces—using a bin size of 50 m.

We then determined the average dip of each of the 31 flat surfaces by fitting a two-dimensional plane to all modal-filtered elevation points within each polygon via linear regression. By including all the elevation point data within each surface and fitting a two-dimensional plane, we addressed the issue of individual flight lines not recording the ‘true dip' of the surface. Although the flight lines are not isotropic, each flat surface is sampled by multiple flight lines oriented in multiple directions (for example, Extended Data Fig. 5), and the fitted planar surfaces are therefore sufficiently well constrained to robustly extract the true dip. The angle and azimuth of steepest descent of the plane were extracted as the overall dip and dip direction of the surface, respectively. We also computed the along-track local-scale relief and the median value within each of the 31 flat surfaces, using the method described in the previous section.

We then repeated the preceding analysis for bed elevations that were adjusted for the isostatic response to the complete unloading of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. To do so, we used a recent calculation of the isostatic response to complete deglaciation27, which was computed using a flexed elastic plate model60, BedMachine v.3 ice thickness4, and a laterally variable effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere61. Although the continent-scale ice thickness grid will deviate from the local radar-derived ice thickness, these differences will be minor (<100 m), and the flexural response to ice unloading is a long-wavelength signal, so the local differences in flexure are negligible. The correction also accounts for the equilibration of the ongoing response to Antarctic ice-mass change since the Last Glacial Maximum and feedbacks associated with loading of areas below sea level by water. For simplicity, rebounded bed elevations are referenced to present-day global mean sea level.

For comparison, we also computed the hypsometry and local-scale (5-km-window) relief for southern Australia (a fluvial passive margin) and Baffin Island, Canada (a glaciated passive margin) using the same methods as described for East Antarctica. In the case of Baffin Island, the value of using a former ice-sheet bed in the Northern Hemisphere is that it represents the effects of glacial modification (via areal scouring) of an existing landscape. Topography data for these regions were taken from the Copernicus global 90-m-resolution digital elevation model62. We note that the conjugate margin for the flat surfaces in Princess Elizabeth Land is the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 4), but this area (modern-day Bangladesh) is dominated by large volumes of Cenozoic sedimentation in the Himalayan foreland basin, meaning there is no longer any meaningful comparison with the topography of East Antarctica.

To determine the similarity in morphology between the 31 flat surfaces and to ascertain whether the surfaces could be divided into multiple statistically distinct groups, we performed cluster analysis using the Gaussian mixture model63. The Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes that an N-dimensional sample of data can be described by a mixture of a finite number, k, of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. It therefore allows the number of statistically distinct clusters within the dataset to be identified. For this modelling, we assembled a two-dimensional dataset with 31 entries, comprising the mean rebounded elevation and the median local relief for each flat surface.

The Gaussian mixture model implements the expectation-maximization algorithm, an iterative process that assigns each datapoint to a cluster by maximizing the posterior probability that the datapoint belongs to its assigned cluster. We initialized the model by choosing starting means and covariances for the k Gaussian components using the k-means++ algorithm64. This selects the mean of the first component at random from the data and then chooses subsequent means from a weighted distribution of the data, favouring points farther away from the existing means. Initial mixing proportions are assumed to be uniform. The model first computes the probability of each point having been generated by each of the initialized Gaussian components. The parameters and mixing proportions of the Gaussian components are then adjusted iteratively to maximize the likelihood (posterior probability) across all datapoints. We allowed a maximum of 500 iterations to ensure convergence to a local optimum and restricted the covariance matrices to be diagonal.

To identify the optimum number of components to describe the flat-surface dataset and thereby assess the number of clusters within the data, we performed Gaussian mixture modelling for k = 1, 2, 3 and 4 components. For each of the four models, we computed the Bayes information criterion (BIC)65, which is an approximation of the integrated likelihood of the converged model. The BIC is defined as twice the negative log of the maximized model likelihood penalized by the addition of the number of unknown parameters multiplied by the log of the number of datapoints. This penalty term is to prevent overfitting of the data by continually increasing model complexity by adding an ever-greater number of parameters. A lower BIC indicates a better-fitting model. We found that the BIC value was lowest (685) for k = 1 and progressively increased as more components were added, indicating that the data are best fitted by a single Gaussian distribution and are not statistically separable into clusters. This result was insensitive to whether the covariance matrices were full or diagonal, and we found that convergence was achieved within 50 iterations for each model.

The plate tectonic reconstruction of the pre-break-up positions of the East Antarctic and Australian plates at 157 Ma was performed using GPlates software58 and a recent plate tectonic model66. The East Antarctic continental shelf area was manually cropped to avoid overlap with adjacent continents and aid visualization.

Lines show survey extents for four campaigns: (a) WISE-ISODYN (2005–06)23, (b) ICECAP (2009–13)15, (c) CHINARE CHA1–4 (2015–19)24; survey lines after 2019 are not included, (d) Operation IceBridge (2019)25; survey lines from pre-2019 were predominantly flown over the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, and Weddell Sea region, so are not shown here.

(a) Bed elevation of the study area (as shown in Fig. 1a). (b) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2012 ICECAP survey15 (profile B-B'). (c) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2011 ICECAP survey15 (profile C-C'). (d) Elevation-corrected radargram from the 2019 Operation IceBridge survey25 (profile D-D'). The profiles show the transition from the low-relief flat surfaces to the higher, rougher topography on their inland side (inland edges of the flat surfaces are marked by the red arrows). In each radargram, the solid line marks the ice surface; the major reflector below is the bed topography. Elevations are relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid. Flight line ID numbers are labelled.

(a) Local-scale relief of the 31 flat surfaces mapped around the EAIS margin (limits marked in white). Local-scale relief was determined by computing the difference between the moving minimum and moving maximum bed elevations within a 5 km window passed along RES profile segments. Inset shows the corresponding frequency distribution of relief. (b) Median local-scale relief for each flat surface. Bold numbers indicate the surface ID numbers (see Extended Data Table 2). Note that the colour scales in the two panels are different.

(a) Bed elevation of the exposed Vestfold Hills and contiguous subglacial flat surface. (b) Profile of ice surface (black) and bed (red) elevation across the Vestfold Hills along profile X–X' (location shown in panel a). Bed elevation was derived from ICECAP RES survey line IR2HI2_2012327_ICP5_JKB2h_F07T02a; ice surface and land elevation were derived from the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA)26. (c) Hillshaded REMA topography of the Vestfold Hills. Contour interval is 50 metres. (d) Sentinel-2b Level-1C imagery of the Vestfold Hills (image extent marked in panel a) acquired on 30th January 2024. (e) Bed elevation of the exposed Bunger Hills and contiguous subglacial flat surface. (f) Profile of ice surface (black) and bed (red) elevation across the Bunger Hills along profile Y–Y' (location shown in panel e). Bed elevation was derived from ICECAP RES survey line IR2HI2_2011002_ASB_JKB2d_GL0152a; ice surface and land elevation were derived from REMA. (g) Hillshaded REMA topography of the Bunger Hills. Contour interval is 50 metres (panel extent marked in panel h). (h) Sentinel-2b Level-1C imagery of the Bunger Hills (image extent marked in panel e) acquired on 9th March 2023.

(a) Modal filtered, ice-free (rebounded) bed elevation of a flat surface. Contour interval is 50 m. (b) Fitting of a 2D plane to all elevation points within the flat surface (black) via linear regression. Colour scale matches that shown in panel a. (c) The angle and azimuth of steepest descent of this plane were extracted and used to compute the surface-averaged dip angle and dip direction.

(a) Map of first-order geological provinces28,29. Dashed lines mark boundaries between the provinces. Purple stars mark the flat surface outcrops in the Bunger Hills (BH) and Vestfold Hills (VH). Red line shows 16 RES profile segments used to construct a near-continuous profile around the EAIS margin (Fig. 3). (b–g) histograms of the rebounded bed elevations of the flat surfaces within each of the geological provinces. For simplicity, the Vestfold Terrane and Prydz Province have been grouped together (b) as have the Charcot Terrane and Knox Rift / Bunger Hills (c). The modal and mean flat surface elevations for each province are labelled, as is the standard deviation.

The morphology of each flat surface is quantified by its mean rebounded (ice-free) elevation and median local relief. (a) One-component (k = 1) mixture model, (b) Two-component (k = 2) mixture model, (c) Three-component (k = 3) mixture model, (d) Four-component (k = 4) mixture model. Circles represent the 31 flat surface fragments mapped in this study (colours correspond to geological provinces; see Extended Data Fig. 6). Contours represent the probability distribution of the Gaussian component(s) in each of the four mixture models. BIC = Bayes Information Criterion; a lower BIC indicates a better-fitting model (see Methods).

(a) Predicted basal thermal state along RES lines31. Colours represent the probability of the basal ice being frozen (0) or thawed (1); the map shown is an aggregate of four different combinations of labelling and radar processing31. White polygons mark the flat surfaces. (b) Predicted basal temperatures derived from simulations of the present-day Antarctic Ice Sheet generated using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)32. Temperatures are divided into four bins: (i) at the pressure melting point (PMP), (ii) less than 2 °C below the PMP, (iii) between 2° and 5 °C below the PMP, and (iv) more than 5 °C below the PMP.

Ageing is an important risk factor for cancer incidence and augments cancer progression. A shared hallmark of ageing and cancer is metabolic reprogramming, which has been suggested to be not only a cause but also a consequence of ageing. Strikingly, many age-regulated pathways are known to also drive tumour progression, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming connects ageing and tumorigenic processes and shapes whether malignant phenotypes manifest, thrive and evolve. With the rising average age of the world population, understanding how age-related changes in the body influence cancer progression is of paramount importance. In this Perspective, we discuss the metabolic changes that occur with ageing and their potential links with tumour initiation and progression and the development of metastatic disease. Finally, we discuss age-induced metabolic divergences that cause racial disparities and their consequences for the tumorigenic process.

After Elon Musk's departure from DC, the future of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency seemed uncertain. But DOGE's work continues unabated—its influence spreading farther and deeper into federal government agencies. WIRED's Makena Kelly and Vittoria Elliott share with Leah Feiger what they found through their reporting.

If you listen to and enjoy our episodes, please rate the show and leave a review on your podcast app of choice. It really helps other people find us. Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's senior politics editor, Leah Feiger, filling in for Zoë. Today on the show, DOGE 2.0. As you may recall, in late May, Elon Musk announced that he and other top leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, would be leaving. This was around the time that President Trump and Musk had a bit of a public spat.

[Archival audio]: Oh, man, the girls are fighting, aren't they?

Leah Feiger: While Musk has officially left DC, DOGE is continuing its whole-scale assault on federal agencies. I'm joined by my colleagues, senior writers Makena Kelly and Vittoria Elliott here at WIRED. Welcome to Uncanny Valley.

Vittoria Elliott: Hi, Leah.

Makena Kelly: Hey, it's great to be here.

Leah Feiger: Let's get into it right from the gate so our listeners can get their bearings. Who exactly is Edward “Big Balls” Coristine?

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. He is one of the young, inexperienced DOGE staffers, he is 19 years old. The thing that makes Coristine so unique is that, like this handful of really young engineers, most of them under the age of 25 and the majority under the age of 30, he has been deployed across multiple government agencies. We've seen him show up at USAID, at the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, all these different places. I cannot stress how highly uncommon it would be for someone to have access to sensitive data or systems, or even be working across that many agencies at once. When we're talking about people in high-level government roles who might be touching sensitive information like Social Security numbers or immigration status, or might be asking information that you would need years and years and years of experience and a security clearance of some kind to get to, or at least some kind of background check. I think Edward Coristine was emblematic of the way in which DOGE was this haphazard project, with young, inexperienced people doing some of the most consequential work in government with very little oversight.

Makena Kelly: Yeah. That's why, at the end of June, when we saw that his name had disappeared from one of our internal directories that we try and keep an eye on, it seemed like maybe the end of DOGE or maybe the end of Coristine was imminent. Then we go to the White House, the White House tells us that, “Oh, yeah, he's gone. He just resigned this week.” Then a couple days later, we're hearing from sources at the Social Security Administration, “No, no, no, he's here. He's at SSA.” That got us into the direction of where the reporting led for DOGE 2.0. Where it's not necessarily as if we have this huge group of DOGE folks who are sleeping at the GSA offices anymore. They are becoming employees, full-time employees at the agencies that I guess have decided to keep them.

Leah Feiger: In Coristine's case, what exactly is he doing at the Social Security Administration? Do we know?

Makena Kelly: At this point, we don't really have a clear picture of what it is that he's doing. From our reporting and the sources that we've been speaking to, the work that's going on at SSA is more focused on something called the Numident Database. That's one of the databases that is huge, has a bunch of information about everyone in the country. The information that SSA has is incredibly important.

Leah Feiger: So much of this with Coristine is incredibly emblematic of what you guys have been reporting with DOGE 2.0. These inside details that DOGE is actually just quietly getting inserted into all of these agencies in a different way. Which, in so many cases, ends up being entirely chaotic, disruptive, and destructive.

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. What we found is that, while they may not call it DOGE anymore, DOGE is still really DOGEing, but in this more sprawling way. And in this way where they have always been inserted across agencies. From what we understood, there wasn't a ton of coordination between them, but now it's even more so, where it seems like the answer is that a lot of the people who are remaining as part of DOGE are really getting absorbed into agencies. I think Aram Moghaddassi, who is now at the Social Security Administration, is a really great example, where he came in as part of this DOGE strike force, and now he's the CIO.

Leah Feiger: Right. Makena, you also found that people were actually being told to not call DOGE operatives DOGE anymore, right? Talk about being secretly integrated.

Makena Kelly: Yeah. I feel like this was something that was bubbling up for the last couple months, but really hit recently with Elon Musk of course formally leaving government. At the Department of Veteran Affairs, for example, a lot of people who worked there were being told that these DOGE people are just employees of the agency and they should be considered their own colleagues. They're not this outside force any longer. Then at the USDA, the Department of Agriculture, specifically, some of these tech workers were told that members of what was previously the Department of Government Efficiency, they should now call them the USDA Digital Service. Which is really funny when you remember that DOGE took over what was previously called the US Digital Services.

Leah Feiger: It's just so wild to me. That's not really a different department, or is it a rebranding of DOGE as we've known it?

Makena Kelly: At this point, it's very unclear. Every agency, from what I've gathered, is handling things a little bit differently. But I think the trend is that you should treat these people as our colleagues, they're not this foreign strike force any longer, and you shouldn't be freaked out if they start asking you to do things or trying to work alongside you.

Leah Feiger: Right. You guys also reported, and we've talked about a couple of them, Moghaddassi amongst them, but of DOGE folks who've really been integrated into new agencies recently?

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. There was a man named John Solly, who has been at SSA for quite a while and is still getting more and more embedded in the agency's internal org chart. Luke Farritor, one of the original young engineers, has now appeared at the Department of Labor. We've seen a bunch of people who have connections to either Musk or Palantir, the company founded by Peter Thiel which is a major government and defense contractor that's been trying to vacuum up a bunch of contracts in the new Trump administration, are now chief information officers at different agencies. The projects that they introduced, even if some people have cycled out, many of those projects are continuing.

Leah Feiger: Unreal. Yeah, that's the thing is that these projects, they have not cut. Musk walked out of DC and things did not end.

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. If anything, experts we spoke to said that DOGE was actually a really great cover for some of the most unpopular goals of the Trump administration. Cutting federal workers, really reducing the federal workforce, really ramping up use of AI, that's all stuff that people like Russ Vought have wanted to do for a while. The fact that DOGE was the entity that came in and broke the seal while really taking a lot of the heat off of Trump himself was kind of a gift.

Leah Feiger: That makes sense to me. Who is leading DOGE right now? Do we know?

Makena Kelly: It's, to me, very unclear. From my reporting, it seems like Amy Gleason, who was supposed to be the acting administrator of the US DOGE Service now, isn't as involved. Her leadership is still very much focused on these legacy USDS folks and the projects that they were working on for several years now. There has been talk about Gebbia, who is a cofounder of Airbnb, taking on the role as leader of DOGE, but that sounds like something he doesn't even want to be a part of. If he does, he wants it to be a larger group, an advisory council. Not just one person who can take all of the blame if DOGE ends up screwing up again. But one of the more important parts of the reporting we did this week was that Steve Davis, a lieutenant to Elon Musk, did a ton of work for him, helped set up the Twitter acquisition in 2022, all of this work, he is still communicating with people. On Signal, in other ways, who are currently with DOGE or are currently working on DOGE projects across government.

Leah Feiger: Wow. I can't believe that he's still around.

Vittoria Elliott: Well, that's at least what we're hearing. Keep in mind that most of communication that, at least from what we understand from my conversations with Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE member, is that pretty much all of the organization's work happened over Signal. We have a pretty clear understanding that this entity really runs off this encrypted messaging app where you can auto-delete messages. It's not that difficult to imagine that it would be very easy for someone like Davis to maintain contact with all these people in the same way they were doing when he was functionally in government. Both Sahil and some people that Makena spoke to have indicated that Davis remains in contact with certain people who are working on DOGE projects.

Makena Kelly: Not even just Davis, but Musk himself. Even though he's exited government, he runs one of the most powerful social media platforms where he can just say whatever he wants. People at DOGE, we know as part of our reporting of uncovering them, that they have Twitter accounts or actively use the app, if not worked for it. Elon can just post whatever he wants and maybe these folks in government get a clue about how to continue to be on Elon's good side if they were to exit government at some point in time and want to return to one of his businesses.

Leah Feiger: We're going to take a quick break, but next up we're going to dive into DOGE's current hiring spree and controversial government contracts. Makena, Tori, you have been giving us the lay of the land on DOGE 2.0, this fun man-spreading across the federal government. DOGE, as in this so-called agency, they're also still expanding and hiring, right?

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. Here's the thing. The executive order that established DOGE as we have really reported on it and thought about it, which is the strike force of people from the tech industry coming into the government, doing these cuts, starting these projects, that's one part of it. But it also repurposed what was known as the US Digital Service, which was an existing entity to bring in people with tech backgrounds to modernize the government, it transformed that into the US DOGE Service. That entity, which is as Makena mentioned, headed by Amy Gleason, is still hiring, desperately looking for people because they lost a lot of people at the beginning of the administration.

Makena Kelly: Recently, I was speaking to some sources and it was somewhere between 150 and 200 folks who were a part of USDS prior to DOGE, and now they're around about 30 people.

Leah Feiger: Wow!

Makena Kelly: They are struggling to maintain headcount.

Leah Feiger: Oh, that's wild. And you guys reported they're hiring tech workers in development, operations, software, product, and they're being promised these really lucrative contracts, right?

Vittoria Elliott: Well, lucrative for government. A lot of people in the tech industry would probably say that what USDS or a government job pays is not as much as they would hope to make for their skill set at a startup for instance. But yeah, for government work, it's at the highest end of the pay scale. Someone with a lot of experience could make close to $200,000.

Leah Feiger: Wow. Tell me about some of the new DOGE names that our listeners should know about.

Makena Kelly: Yeah. I think specifically at the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, that was basically the first agency that DOGE took over, there's a handful of new folks. The one that really stands out though is this man Yat Choi. He is formerly an engineer at Airbnb. We don't know specifically if there's any close relationship between him and Gebbia, who is the cofounder of the app. But, man, is Choi a character. His name on Instagram is Yatshitcray.

Leah Feiger: Awesome, awesome. Love to have this person in charge of our government functionalities.

Makena Kelly: He's a SoundCloud musician and he makes some TikTok videos. One in which he is covered in a blanket, and seemingly saying that he loves what DOGE is doing with USAID in cutting all of its contracts and funding. Even before joining DOGE, it seemed like he was really interested in the mission, and you can see that across his social media.

Leah Feiger: Interesting. He's also Canadian, right?

Makena Kelly: Yes. He is first and foremost, a character, but also appears to be a non-US citizen.

Vittoria Elliott: To clarify, it's pretty uncommon for people who are not US citizens to be able to work in government. There often are only certain special exceptions. Baris Akis, who is one of Musk's closest advisers and who Sahil Lavingia told us was a recruiter for DOGE, was, as The Atlantic reported, prevented from joining the actual official DOGE effort in government because he is a Turkish citizen. That does not appear to have kept him from informally or somewhat covertly participating in the project. I think it's really important to note that it is pretty uncommon for non-US citizens to hold civil service type of jobs and it's only in special cases.

Leah Feiger: Talk us through some of these controversial initiatives that are full steam ahead at the moment.

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. One is a project that started at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The project seeks to use AI to flag certain regulations or sub-regulations to be rolled back. What that means is that the AI is crawling through thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and flagging things for HUD workers to review as either in compliance with this executive order to roll back regulation or make justifications about why they want to keep or why they feel they need to keep that regulation. As one HUD worker told me, the AI is pretty shitty and it's really time-consuming. But this is a project that was headed by a DOGE operative Chris Sweet at HUD, who appears to still be taking meetings there to push this project forward. It's seemingly not limited to HUD. We received memos from the VA that show that they're also being asked to turn over and compile all their regulatory and sub-regulatory documents in preparation for an AI to crawl through that as well.

Makena Kelly: Another one of the major projects that is still ongoing is taking place at the IRS, where a bunch of engineers are working on what has been called a ""mega API layer."" Essentially, trying to connect all of the database systems within IRS into one space that can be easily searchable and possibly shared across different agencies. Sam Corcos, he is a former health tech founder, he is a DOGE affiliate, and now he's become the chief information officer of the Treasury. Now he's in a really major leadership role at an agency that now is hoping to connect all of this data together. They brought on Palantir to help create this entire system.

Leah Feiger: It's wild to me because obviously, on one hand, you have Musk and DOGE or former DOGE staffers in these government positions, and on the other are these government contracts that also link back to some of Musk's interests. Palantir's co-founder Peter Thiel and Musk are longtime allies. It's wild to see this all coalesce into a very similar thing.

Makena Kelly: Yeah. It's difficult to know if there was some kind of master plan in all of this. But I think one thing is for certain, though. That all of the chaos that DOGE has wrought has created a ton of opportunity for Elon Musk and his close associates.

Vittoria Elliott: In the words of Peter Baelish, ""Chaos is a ladder.""

Leah Feiger: No, those are really good points. I also want to note that, as you guys were reporting this story, the White House, the VA, Elon Musk, John Solly, Rohan Chen, Yat Choi, Steve Davis, no one responded to our requests for comment. We talked about DOGE 1.0, the Musk version. We've been talking about DOGE 2.0 and we're only seven months into this, into DOGE generally. Should be be expecting a DOGE 3.0 this year? What is the next upgrade like?

Vittoria Elliott: We don't really know. But what we can see here is a pattern of outsourcing to tech companies that are advantageous to the tech industry. For instance, as Makena mentioned, Palantir has been brought on to help with this big mega API project at the IRS. When you cut a bunch of contracts at an agency, that work still needs to get done, Palantir is there and ready. Similarly, we see other startups like Anduril, the defense startup that has been back by Andreessen Horowitz, that is looking for more and more defense contracts. In the instance of the Treasury, for instance we saw a young engineer hired named Rohan Chen. He had previously worked at a company called Ramp, which was also backed by Peter Thiel. It's a payment system and the General Services Administration is considering using Ramp to manage its internal payment system. I think what we're really seeing in maybe a third iteration of DOGE is that we're going to see more and more of this fusion between these companies that are in the tech space that have backing from people who were either involved with or supported the DOGE effort, and seeing those companies as being the preferred vendors for the Trump administration, and seeing much more fusion between the tech industry and government through these outsourcing contracts.

Leah Feiger: When we come back, we'll share our recommendations for what to check out on WIRED.com this week. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Before we take off, Makena, Tori, tell our listeners what they absolutely should read on WIRED.com today. Tori, what do you have for us?

Vittoria Elliott: Our colleague Kate Knibbs wrote about the looming malnutrition crisis in the wake of USAID cuts. I think this is really important because if you've ever worked abroad, Leah and I have both worked in some capacity in international development or around those circles, you know exactly how important US food aid is. A, it's really helpful for farmers to have the US government buy their excess crops and ship them overseas, it provides a really important market for US farmers. But in humanitarian crises like we're seeing all over the world right now, US food is a real lifeline for people in dire situations. What Kate's reporting found is that because USAID was so severely cut by the Trump administration and DOGE, this food is sitting in warehouses, going to waste, and in places like South Sudan, children are going hungry. I think it's a really great example of the way in which these systems that are not super-visible to the average, every day person in the US are so critical to other people around the world, and frankly really help the US' diplomatic position as a powerful and supportive entity to a lot of people.

Leah Feiger: Good recommendation. Highly, highly agree. Makena, how about you?

Makena Kelly: Yeah. This week has been quite the week for Grok.

Leah Feiger: Ugh.

Makena Kelly: Elon Musk's chatbot, it went complete Hitler-mode this week and said some very just horrifying, anti-Semitic posts online. But I think I would recommend everyone read after all of this is Paresh Dave's reporting on Grok 4, the brand new version of this chatbot that is being released after this absolute chaos of a week for Elon and his company.

Vittoria Elliott: Leah, what is your pick for this week?

Leah Feiger: Okay. It is incredibly different than both of yours, which I think is a good thing, and a slightly lighter note to end us out on. Elana Klein wrote an article about Zillow and how people are looking up how much their friends' houses cost, and this entire culture around it. It's in the culture section, it is such a good read. Everyone is very gossipy, and fun, and obsessed with finding information about their friends' net worth. Highly recommend.

Makena Kelly: I will say I'm guilty of this!

Leah Feiger: Yeah, of course you are. We all are.

Vittoria Elliott: I will say that, after going to a particular party once in the past year, my partner, after we left was like, ""You know, I'm beginning to believe that this person might have family money,"" as I looked up their Zillow thing.

Leah Feiger: All of these articles that we recommended are really WIRED at its finest as well. It's like, ""Oh, AI is Hitler now, USAID, DOGE, all of these crumbles. And also, Zillow, what's happening there? How can we use tech to spy on our friends and family?"" That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes.

Before we jump into the rest of the news, a word about Grok, the AI model created by xAI, an Elon Musk company that recently acquired his social media service X. Yes, this is related to transportation. 

Grok, which can analyze images and respond to questions, is meant to be a competitor to models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grok has become a centerpiece of X, where users interact with the AI chatbot. It's also become increasingly combative and gone on several antisemitic tirades, praised Hitler, and even made rape threats. (Those posts have been taken down.)

And just yesterday, AI reporter Max Zeff discovered that xAI's newest model, Grok 4, seems to consult social media posts from Musk's X account when answering questions about the Israel and Palestine conflict, abortion, immigration laws, and other controversial issues. 

How is any of this related to transportation? Grok is coming to Tesla vehicles as soon as next week, according to Musk. 

A well-known white hat hacker who uses the handle “Green the Only” dug into Tesla's firmware and made a few discoveries. For example, drivers will be able to choose certain Grok “personalities,” including ones that are NSFW (not safe for work), argumentative, kids story, sexy, therapist, unhinged, and more. He also found that “Grok currently requires premium connectivity and pairs into your existing account.”

In another episode of “Is it 2016?” Rivian micromobility spinout Also raised another $200 million with a post-money valuation of $1 billion. Yes, that's right, a micromobility company that has yet to reveal its first product. 

As we've reported before, there is a lot of hype and anticipation around Also — and Jony Ive's LoveFrom connection to the brand certainly helps raise its profile. 

Speaking of buzzy EVs that have raised eye-popping rounds, senior reporter Sean O'Kane interviewed the founders of Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles venture firm that launched five years ago and was an early investor in the Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto. Want to catch up on Slate Auto news? We created a handy Slate Auto timeline that covers all our scoops and news. We will update this regularly. 

Finnish e-motor startup Donut Lab raised €25 million ($29.2 million) in a seed funding round led by Risto Siilasmaa, the founder of cybersecurity company WithSecure (formerly F-Secure). Risto has also joined Donut Lab's board. 

INSHUR, an insurance products service focused on the on-demand economy, raised $35 million from Trinity Capital. The new funding will support INSHUR's continued expansion across the United States.

President Trump has nominated Jonathan Morrison to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Morrison has a history of tussling with Tesla.

Meanwhile, it looks like Tesla is trying to spread its robotaxi wings. The company applied to test and operate autonomous vehicles in Arizona in a bid to bring its fledgling robotaxi service to the Metro Phoenix area. Our story has a few interesting tidbits and explains the AV permitting process in Phoenix. One critical point: The company will also need a TNC permit to provide ride-hailing services. 

Musk also commented that robotaxis will come to the Bay Area once they receive regulatory approval in “a month or two.” There's just one issue with that: The California DMV, which regulates AVs, says Tesla hasn't even applied for a driverless testing or deployment permit yet. As of today, Tesla only has an autonomous vehicle testing permit for public road testing with a safety driver, which it's held since 2014. 

Waymo continues to expand, and not just geographically. The company is opening up its robotaxi service in Phoenix to teenagers. There are caveats here, namely that the teens can only sign up through a verified parent's account. And they have to be ages 14 to 17, so no 13-year-olds. That suggests Waymo wants to steer clear of middle schoolers and only provide service to those in high school. 

Meanwhile, Waymo is sniffing around New York City (a famously restrictive place for AVs) and Philadelphia. The company kicked off “road trips” in the two Northeastern cities. Road trips can be viewed as early testing, although in New York City the vehicles will all be manually driven and used to map and collect data. 

Several new EVs broke cover this past week: Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius took the upcoming all-electric GLC for a test ride; Subaru said it will reveal its new all-electric compact crossover SUV at 7:30 p.m. ET on July 17; and Volvo shared information about the carbon footprint of the all-electric ES90, which starts production later this summer. 

Meanwhile, I spent a few days in the 2026 Rivian quad-motor R1S and R1T. This is the second generation of the flagship EV and the EV maker's most expensive trim, which costs between $115,990 and $125,990, depending on the version. 

Check out the full article about my test drive, which digs into the tech behind the second-generation flagship EV.

Jio Platforms, the digital arm of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, has launched a virtual desktop service for set-top box users. This means that India's richest man, Reliance's chairman Mukesh Ambani, hopes to turn millions of TVs in the world's most populous country into PCs.

Called JioPC, the service offers a cloud-based PC experience through Jio's set-top box, which comes bundled for free with the telco's home broadband service or can be purchased separately for ₹5,499 ($64). Currently in free trial and available via waitlist, users can access the virtual desktop on their TV by plugging in a keyboard and mouse once they receive an invite and set up their account.

At present, the service has some limitations, including no support for external peripherals, such as cameras and printers. Similarly, it supports open source LibreOffice, which is pre-installed. To use Microsoft Office apps, users need to access them via the available browser.

That said, Ambani's move with JioPC looks promising — at least on paper.

Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, told TechCrunch that JioPC is a very effective way for the Mumbai-headquartered company to increase its user base, which already has over 488 million users.

Around 70% of Indian households have a TV, but only 15% of them own a PC, per Pathak. But Jio Platforms could have its hands full with marketing and explanations. “You need to convince people that you can still use a PC on your TV using the set-top box,” he stated.

India's active pay-TV set-top box user base stands at nearly 57 million, per government data. However, the traditional direct-to-home (DTH) TV market is shrinking as more consumers shift to internet-based services. As of March, the active DTH subscriber base had declined by 8% year-over-year, the data shows.

Prabhu Ram, vice president of the Industry Research Group (IRG) at CyberMedia Research (CMR), said with JioPC, Jio could onboard new set-top box users from underpenetrated rural and low-income segments.

“While its potential reach is broad, its success will depend on execution — especially in addressing connectivity gaps and digital literacy — and on its ability to scale beyond early adopters to effectively serve underserved communities,” he noted.

In Q1, India's overall PC market experienced over 8% year-over-year growth in shipments, reaching 3.3 million units — marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth, per IDC. However, PC penetration in the country remains relatively low, lagging behind key markets, including the U.S. and China, mainly due to limited disposable income and the widespread use of smartphones as primary computing devices.

Pathak stated that for Jio to reach potential PC buyers with JioPC, it would require partnerships with several app developers and productivity solution providers and ensure it has enough productivity apps to make the service valuable for consumers.

Companies including Microsoft and many other cloud providers have offered virtual desktop services targeting enterprise customers for some time. However, Jio's move represents the first serious consumer-oriented move, Ram said.

I think it's quite plausible that Anthropic is bleeding out ~100/month on token costs per $20/month user, and even at 80% margin, this is just merely breakeven. Their limited capacity also means that they are _losing_ the opportunity to sell the same capacity at a per-token marginal profit. I think the only plausible endgame here is that Anthropic uses the usage data to RL-finetune Claude Code to the point where it is actually worth a $200/month subscription.Enjoy the $20/month Claude Pro plan while it lasts; I don't really see it sticking around for more than a year at best.

Here's one way they could get around their own privacy policy: keep track of what % of Claude-generated code is retained in the codebase over time (as an indicator of how high-quality / bug-free the code was); A/B test variations of Claude Code to see which variations have higher retention percentages.No usage data is retained, no code is retained, no data is used (other than a single floating point number) and yet they get to improve their product atop your usage patterns.Here's another idea: use a summarization model to transform your session transcript into a set of bits saying ""user was satisfied/dissatisfied with this conversation"", ""user indicated that claude was doing something dangerous"", ""user indicated that claude was doing something overly complicated / too simple"", ""user interrupted claude"", ""user indicated claude should remember something in CLAUDE.md"", etc. etc. and then train on these auxiliary signals, without ever seeing the original code or usage data.

I am very confused why this means Anthropic is bleeding out. The most important thing is that Anthropic has a thing people love. And can raise the price just fine.

But I don't blame the foundation model platforms for giving users a taste and then rolling back the features / quantity of tokens per $ after giving them a taste. They needed to get started somewhere and they were able to offer an amazing product for an affordable price.It's not until after the heaviest users start to abuse the subscription tier they are on that the platform understands how their product scales.

Their real fear should be that Google has a signficant cost edge in AI inference and will be able to offer Gemini CLI at a much cheaper rate than they will even if Gemini CLI isn't quite as good.

reply

In any case: author does not factor in Anthropic's potential gross margins on the tokens via the API. He assumes if $10,000 is consumed via the Claude Code API tokens, then Anthropic must be losing $10,000.We don't know. What's their cost of inference?

Ed acknowledges that we don't know their inference costs in the article. But unless they made a Deepseek level of breakthrough in serving through API, they are either breaking even or losing money at each call.There is a race to the bottom and survival of the deepest pockets right now in the field.

That's what they said about Uber, too, but it's still around.

reply

Well, they are around because they increased the prices for customers, reduced the pay for gig-workers and added ads.

reply

reply

Comparing Uber to Anthropic is not correct, because their cost models are not the same. Uber has mainly labor cost which is low-skill and high-volume, followed by service costs which are high-skill but low-volume. Which leaves a lot of room for optimization.Anthropic has very big bills to pay, and those bills will only go up as they scale. In depth analysis of frontier model companies is difficult, since they are private and secretive.

It is ""unpopular"" to say this, especially this bluntly, but low-skill labor can be made as cheap as you want it to be. If my numbers aren't wrong, average Uber/Lyft worker works for less than hourly local minimum wage (don't say tips, ~80% of Uber customers don't tip). But they accept it because of lack of opportunity, flexibility of gig jobs, and potential for working many jobs.

There's absolutely a floor at which point drivers will revolt, especially since they know how much the rider is paying.

Covering tech news, you sometimes feel like the million-mile-per-hour footrace of Silicon Valley will inevitably result in a Wile E. Coyote-style calamity. There's a part of me that craves a little more sincerity and willingness for self-reflection. When we actually receive it, the result is a little more cringe-worthy. Intel's new boss, Lip-Bu Tan, reportedly told staff the company was—effectively—cooked. That doesn't sound great, but for one of Intel's once-biggest partners, Apple, it may be a sign it can take it a little easier with the relentless yearly release schedule.

We won't see any new MacBook Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's regular Apple leaker Mark Gurman, who says Apple may delay these devices to the first half of 2026. In the last few years, Apple has launched a new MacBook Air in the first few months of the year before offering a new Pro model in the fall. As much as I wish this supposed delay was to finagle a new Mac design, Gurman suggests new MacBook Pros with M5 chips will still have the same design as every other Apple laptop we've seen since 2021. The rumored OLED display that promises far better contrast and colors reportedly won't arrive until 2027.

There is some precedent for a delay. In 2023, Apple pushed out its M2 MacBook Pro in January. Later in October, the company debuted the M3 MacBook Pro 14- and 16-inch models in an all-black color at its “Scary Fast” event. Last year's M4 MacBook Pro launch was a slightly more subdued affair. According to Gurman's anonymous sources, there are new iPad Airs with M3 chips that would accompany a replacement for the baseline $350 iPad. We could see those as early as March or April 2026, so long as the launch timeline doesn't go awry. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro could be upgraded with an M5 chip and arrive as soon as October.

While Apple wanted to keep its Macs in the oven, it apparently has no issues with its iPhone release schedule. There's a supposed follow-up to the iPhone 16e on the way in the form of a $600 iPhone 17e. Maybe this upcoming model can finally nix the notch for the floating Dynamic Island seen in most modern iPhones. Gurman says the sequel to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17, is still slated for fall to launch alongside iOS 26. We'll also see Apple Watch upgrades and—if the stars align—a new Vision Pro headset that may finally be more comfortable to wear.

Apple's been on a roll with its MacBooks since it dropped Intel CPUs in favor of its own ARM-based M-series chips in 2020. The latest M4 designs outclass most other Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm chips in pure benchmark performance, though Apple has been sitting on its laurels for far too long. Current MacBook Air and Pro models are visually indistinct from year to year. They have the same displays, keyboards, and notch cutout for the webcam and microphone. Apple is ending support for all older Intel-based Macs, but anybody not still using an Intel-based Mac has little reason to upgrade.

Intel was also caught off-guard by the proliferation of AI and Nvidia's dominance of the AI training chip market. Those woes stacked so high they eventually led to the ouster of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan, who's now in the driver's seat, reportedly told staff that “we are not in the top 10 semiconductor companies” compared to 30 years ago. According to The Oregonian, based on a leaked internal message to staff, Tan said turning the ship around will be a “marathon” and cited the need to be smaller and more agile to compete. Intel is reportedly cutting thousands of workers across all sectors, and more could find their head on the chopping block in the next few months.

If big tech companies would actually slow down with their rapid release schedule and instead focus on making sure their core products offer a real reason for consumers to upgrade, then we'd all benefit. However, Gurman suggested the new release timing was an attempt to “get back to more consistent revenue growth.” Mac sales have slumped in recent months, but changing the release timing doesn't necessarily make any device more enticing, especially if it's practically the same damn thing as one released the year before, and the year before that, and the year before that…

Silicon Motion plans to formally introduce its MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller with a PCIe 6.0 x4 host interface at the upcoming FMS 2025 conference next month, according to a leak by ITHome. The new controller will enable drives with sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s and random read/write throughput of a whopping 7M IOPS.

Silicon Motion's MonTitan SM8466 SSD controller for enterprise SSD will feature 16 NAND channels supporting all the upcoming types of 3D NAND memory, as revealed by Wallace C. Kou, chief executive of Silicon Motion, in an interview with Tom's Hardware published last month. The controller will be used to build drives with up to 512 TB capacity that will feature sequential read speeds of up to 28 GB/s as well as random read/write performance up to 7M 4K IOPS.

Performance of SM8466-based SSDs will by far exceed not only that of the best client SSDs, but also virtually all available enterprise-grade drives.

In terms of capabilities, the SM8466 is expected to be compliant with an NVMe 2.0+ specification, as well as the OCP NVMe SSD Spec 2.5, making it suitable for hyperscale and cloud deployments. It includes SR-IOV/MPF for virtualization, SMART monitoring, and end-to-end data protection. Security features include Secure Boot, AES-256 encryption, TCG Opal compliance, and firmware attestation, a set that offers strong safeguards for sensitive enterprise environments.

As reported, SMI plans to use TSMC's 4nm-class fabrication process to build the SM8466 controller.

The leaked slide from the SMI presentation reveals general specifications of Silicon Motion's MonTitan SM8466, but does not disclose when exactly actual drives powered by the controller will emerge. According to the chief executive of SMI, the company expects its partner to start shipping their SM8466-based products sometime in late 2026 – early 2027, which will coincide with the ramp of next-generation AI servers based on Nvidia's Rubin GPUs for AI and HPC.

In fact, SMI believes that AI will be the main application that will take advantage of PCIe Gen6 drives, as traditional storage applications will not take advantage of such drives until 2026 – 2027. As for client PCs, Kou expects SSDs with a PCIe 6.0 x4 to address PC OEMs only in 2030 or later.

Ugreen's retractable USB-C power blocks are the ultimate impulse purchase, with prices as low as $19.99

I travel a lot, be it by plane or by car, so my laptop bag is often filled with various cables, wall adapters, battery power bricks, and USB cables. However, I'm trying to consolidate as many of my components as possible. So, when browsing around Amazon looking to see if there was anything I could score for myself for Prime Day, my eye was immediately drawn to two listings from Ugreen: 65-watt and 45-watt retractable USB-C charging blocks priced at $34.99 and $19.99, respectively.

Ugreen is a name I'm familiar with, as I have one of the company's USB-C to 2.5 GbE adapters that I keep in my travel bag, just in case. But the retractable power bricks intrigued me for multiple reasons.

I currently use Apple 29- and 70-watt USB-C power adapters to charge my devices on the go. Of course, you can only charge one device at a time with these adapters. However, Ugreen's power bricks allow me to charge up to three devices. In my usage case, I could imagine using the 65-watt USB-C power brick to charge my MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch (or AirPods) simultaneously.

This 65-watt GaN II fast charger includes a retractable USB-C cable, a USB-C port, and a USB-A port to handle all of your mobile devices.

The second thing that intrigued me is the integrated retractable 2.3-foot USB-C cable. There's no need to worry if I remembered to bring along a USB-C cable; it's already attached and stows away when not needed. It doesn't get any better than that. My track record is mostly good with retractable cables, so I'm crossing my fingers on the long-term durability here.

UGREEN's 45-watt GaN II fast charger can top off three devices simultaneously using a retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports.

Finally, the overall size of these Ugreen retractable power bricks is a big draw. Compared to my 75-watt Apple adapter, these things are much smaller in comparison, due in part to the use of Gallium Nitride (GaN) power transistors. The 65-watt version has straight-through power plugs, while the 45-watt version uses retractable plugs to further reduce its profile in your bag.

The 65-watt version includes the retractable USB-C cable, one USB-C port, and one USB-A port, while the 45-watt version has the retractable USB-C cable and two USB-C ports.

With pricing as low as $19.99, Ugreen's retractable USB-C charging blocks were an immediate impulse buy for me. I bought one of each, and they're bound to be a helpful addition to my travel bag and will help cut down on cable/charger clutter.

Deborah Brauser

 July 11, 2025  

The gap between a brain's chronological age and its predicted age on brain imaging appears to be a strong mediator of risk factors for cognitive decline, especially in individuals with cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), new research suggested.

In a cross-sectional study of more than 2000 participants, researchers used machine learning and brain scans to create a prediction model. An individual's “brain age gap” (BAG) was then determined by subtracting the chronological brain age from the predicted brain age.

Results showed that a higher number of cognitive impairment risk factors were associated with lower cognitive performance scores — and that a larger BAG may influence this relationship, with the strongest effects observed in participants with CeVD.

In individuals with more markers of CeVD, such as microbleeds and infarcts, the BAG significantly influenced the link between cognitive impairment risk factors and overall cognitive function — particularly affecting executive function and language abilities.

“This suggests that accelerated brain aging, as measured by BAG, plays a disproportionate role in cognitive vulnerability among individuals with vascular pathology,” study co-investigator Saima Hilal, MD, PhD, assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, Singapore, told Medscape Medical News.

“While we expected BAG to have some mediating effect, the domain-specific nature of this influence was unexpected,” Hilal added.

The findings were published online on June 18 in Neurology.

The investigators initiated the study to explore how the BAG neuroimaging-derived biomarker might help explain a connection between known risk factors for cognitive impairment and actual cognitive decline, particularly in Southeast Asian populations, Hilal reported.

“Prior research has largely focused on Western cohorts, leaving a gap in understanding how [CeVD], which is highly prevalent in Asia, may interact with BAG to affect cognition,” she said.

Additionally, she noted that CeVD often coexists with Alzheimer's pathology in individuals from Southeast Asia. Understanding whether BAG could serve as a mediator in that relationship “could enhance early risk stratification and open new avenues for targeted cognitive interventions in at-risk populations,” Hilal said.

The researchers reviewed medical records for more than 2000 participants (mean age, 66 years; 53% men; 60% with no cognitive impairment) from the Singapore community and memory clinics to identify cognitive impairment risk factors.

For this, they used the Cognitive Impairment Scoring System (CISS), which consisted of 11 sociodemographic and vascular factors, including age, education, smoking status, blood pressure, and history of diabetes.

The investigators also measured cognitive performance using tests that assessed overall global cognition, executive function, language, memory, attention, visuomotor speed — which is the ability to coordinate visual information with motor actions — and visuoconstruction, which involves coordinating fine motor skills with spatial abilities.

Within the study population, 1437 did not have dementia and 646 served as the matched control group. All individuals had undergone structural MRIs.

CeVD burden was determined using markers associated with small and large vessel disease and cognitive dysfunction, including lacunar and cortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities.

Results showed a significant association between a higher CISS score (showing more impairment risk factors) and lower performance across all cognitive domains measured, especially visuomotor speed (β = -2.7; P < .001) and visuoconstruction (β = -3.0; P < .001). 

In the full patient population, BAG significantly influenced the relationship between CISS score and global cognition (proportion mediated, 9%; P < .05), especially the domains of language (18%; P = .001) and visuoconstruction (10%; P = .008).

The effect was even stronger for those with high CeVD burden. In this group, the association between CISS score and overall global cognition was significantly mediated by BAG (20%; P = .01), as were executive function (34%; P = .03) and language abilities (27%; P = .008).

There were no significant effects in the low-CeVD-burden group.

“These findings underscore the importance of stratifying by vascular burden and considering domain-specific outcomes when investigating brain aging,” Hilal said.

“For clinicians, the key message is that the brain age gap can serve as a meaningful intermediate biomarker linking modifiable risk factors to cognitive decline,” she added.

The investigators noted, however, that the study's focus on a Southeast Asian population only could limit the generalizability of the findings.

“Future longitudinal studies should verify these relationships and explore additional factors not captured in our model,” they wrote.

The study was funded by the National University of Singapore, the National Medical Research Council Singapore, and the Singapore Ministry of Education. The investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships.

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ – Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber believes the FIFA Club World Cup this summer has been an “absolute terrific success,” and has set the stage for an exciting World Cup 2026 next summer.

Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain and English Premier League standouts Chelsea will play in the Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium.

Garber will attend the final – his sixth of the tournament after attending games in Miami, Atlanta and Philadelphia and both semifinal matches at MetLife Stadium in the last week.

“The Club World Cup was the story this summer in sport. And I think I'm pleased to see that three of our teams were part of that story,” Garber told USA TODAY Sports on Friday, July 11.

“I think it did what it was intended to do – to launch something new, take some risk, show some courage, and then set the stage for 2026, which will be another example of soccer and football at its very best. I think the 2026 World Cup will be the most spectacular event in the history of our country.”

Three MLS teams – Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC – participated in the first-of-its-kind tournament, featuring 32 of the best soccer clubs in the world.

While Seattle and LAFC were unable to win any of their three group-stage matches, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami helped clinch the first win by a North American club against a European side when they beat FC Porto in Atlanta on June 19.

Inter Miami was eliminated by PSG in the Round of 16, which created a dream matchup for FIFA and MLS – Messi faced his former team in a game that would never be played outside of a friendly before the Club World Cup.

“The beauty of the Club World Cup is our teams had an opportunity to stand and go toe to toe with the top teams in the world,” Garber said.

Garber said there have been at least 3 million people who attended soccer matches this summer, watching either the Club World Cup or the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer.

MLS games have also been ongoing following the group stages in both tournaments, and Garber believes another “half a million” people are expected to attend Leagues Cup matches when the tournament between MLS and LIGA MX clubs from Mexico begins later this month.

“I think all of us at MLS for a generation now have been trying to build what we call ‘a real soccer nation' – a country that has strong understanding of the sport, and supports their local clubs, supports their national teams, comes out and passionately celebrates like the rest of the world.

“I think Club World Cup was a great platform to tell that story. I thought it was fantastic. I hope to see it come back,” Garber added.

Despite rumors the U.S. could host the Club World Cup again in 2029, there's no decision yet on where the next edition of the tournament will be played.

FIFA saw 2.4 million fans attend Club World Cup matches with an average of 38,000 fans, and 21 of the 62 matches already played saw at least 50,000 fans. While empty seats were a major storyline, the tournament used NFL-sized stadiums instead of solely soccer-specific stadiums to host more fans.

MLS – which is celebrating its 30th season in 2025 – helped FIFA promote and market the event, while seven MLS training facilities hosted club practices, and four of the league's soccer-specific stadiums hosted select matches during the tournament.

“I think it's been a great, proud moment for everybody that's involved in soccer here in the United States. We showed the world that this country is a soccer nation with passionate fans, and spectacular stadiums, and a knowledgeable fan base,” Garber said.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

	The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain is just two days away, and Rolling Stone has an exclusive first look at the high-tech stage set up for the halftime show starring Doja Cat, Tems, and J Balvin. 


	Global Citizen, which is leading the charge of the halftime show with Coldplay's Chris Martin, was tasked with creating a stage in the stands to avoid affecting the real grass installed at MetLife Stadium for the big game. In place of an on-pitch performance, FIFA and Global Citizen built out a massive stage on the upper stands of the venue.


	Global Citizen brought in 40,000 pounds of staging, scenery, and structural truss, all carried by hand by 100 stagehands to the stands and brought to the venue by six semi-trucks. The stage features 4,000 feet of pipe bracing, LED displays with nearly 16 million pixels.


	“The innovative stage design we created for MetLife Stadium both preserves the integrity of the pitch and promises to deliver the kind of performances our global audience will never forget,” Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen, tells Rolling Stone. “By building our platform high in the stands, we ensured that the newly installed natural grass remains untouched while delivering an unforgettable show that is designed to be time-efficient and visually stunning.”

	











	With the halftime show and its partnership with FIFA, Global Citizen aims to raise $100 million for global education access. “This show will bring us closer to ensuring that children everywhere have access to quality education,” says Evans.

	The show away from the pitch allows the performance to run for the full 15-minute event and eliminates the need for setup between halves. The event will feature a fully global lineup with Tems representing Africa, J Balvin waving the Colombian flag for South America, Emmanuel Kelly repping Australia, and Doja Cat representing North America.

A post shared by FIFA Club World Cup (@fifaclubworldcup)


	“I'm proud to represent America on this unique stage that will bring people from all corners of the world together,” Doja Cat tells Rolling Stone. “I'm also extremely grateful to continue to support global education efforts by raising funds for the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund. I know the energy on Sunday at MetLife is going to be unreal.”

	Along with holding up the flag for his native Australia, Kelly — who has opened for Coldplay in the past — shares his excitement for representing differently-abled people. “Being part of the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup Final Halftime Show is more than a personal milestone—it's a moment of visibility and hope for every differently-abled child who's ever been told ‘no,'” Kelly says. “I'm honored to represent Australia on a global stage and proud to be part of a show that's not only breaking ground in entertainment but helping change lives through the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund.”

Chelsea beat Fluminense of Brazil to reach Sunday's Club World Cup final

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said he has felt ""dizzy"" while playing in ""very dangerous"" heat at the Club World Cup in the United States. 

The 24-year-old has featured in all six of Chelsea's matches en route to the final against Paris St-Germain in New Jersey on Sunday.

Three of Chelsea's games were played in temperatures described as ""extreme heat"", with local weather warnings urging people against involvement in strenuous physical activity or being outside. 

In New Jersey, where Sunday's final takes place, temperatures have reached 38C in recent days.

Manager Enzo Maresca has complained it is ""impossible"" to have a normal training session because of the heat, despite reaching the final of the lucrative and newly-expanded tournament. 

When asked about the experience of playing at the Club World Cup, Fernandez said: ""Honestly, the heat is incredible. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. 

""Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous. Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. 

""The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.""

Players and managers have also complained about afternoon kick-off times throughout the tournament, which are designed in part to help TV audiences in Europe and Africa watch matches at convenient times. 

Fernandez, who is likely to be in Argentina's squad at the 2026 World Cup across North America, added: ""Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?""

PSG manager Luis Enrique said ""it is not good for the show"" before their 4-0 semi-final win over Real Madrid on Wednesday. 

Chelsea defender Levi Colwill added: ""Some places have been really hot, the last round was hot and I was stuck watching it and I was thinking: 'wow, this is so tough.' I felt bad for them but they managed it really well.""

Earlier this month, players' union Fifpro said it believed that Chelsea's game v ES Tunis in Philadelphia should have been delayed or postponed because of the heat.

On Thursday, former Germany striker Jurgen Klinsmann, now on Fifa's technical study group, recalled punishing conditions in Dallas during the 1994 World Cup in the United States, but said teams must adapt. 

""The heat is difficult. If you play in 90 degree [Fahrenheit; 32C] heat then you are going to suffer,"" Klinsmann said. ""I played in Dallas at 120 degrees [49C] and I was dying! 

""We were leading 3-0 at half time, then South Korea came back and made it 3-2 and if we had been on the pitch for another five minutes it would have been 3-3.

""But do I go to Qatar like Germany and complain, complain and bring karma - and then go home early? The teams here now and the teams here next summer who get the draw here in July and July next summer will have to adapt.

""But there will be two teams in the game. It's not always nice, especially for European teams but they will have to adapt.""

In a statement on the heat last week, Fifa said: ""Heat conditions are a serious topic that affect football globally. 

""At the Club World Cup some significant and progressive measures are being taken to protect the players from the heat. For instance, cooling breaks were implemented in 31 out of 54 matches so far.

""Discussions on how to deal with heat conditions need to take place collectively and Fifa stands ready to facilitate this dialogue, including through the task force on player welfare, and to receive constructive input from all stakeholders on how to further enhance heat management. 

""In all of this, the protection of players must be at the centre.""

Temperatures made Argentinian lie down in semi-final

He brands playing conditions in US as ‘very dangerous'

Enzo Fernández has said that the high temperatures at the Club World Cup are dangerous and revealed that he needed to lie down during Chelsea's win over Fluminense because the heat left him feeling “really dizzy”.

The Argentina midfielder is the latest player to criticise the tournament's scheduling and call for Fifa to make changes before the World Cup takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US next summer.

Challenging weather conditions in the US have been a major talking point during the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. Thunderstorms have caused delays to games, and teams have also had to deal with mid-afternoon kick-offs in intense heat.

Temperatures were high when Chelsea faced Fluminense at 3pm in the first semi-final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last Thursday. Local authorities had issued a heat warning and Fernández, who was conducting media duties before Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final, saying that he needed treatment in the second half will heap pressure on Fifa to consider late kick-off times at the 2026 World Cup.

“The heat is incredible,” Fernández said. “The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.

“Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?”

Levi Colwill agreed that the heat has led to slower games. “If you turn the game into a basketball match in this heat, it's not going to help anyone,” the Chelsea centre-back said. “You have to control the ball way more, pick the right times to attack and try to score.”

There was an attempt to ask Fernández, who spoke and fielded questions exclusively in Spanish, about him singing a homophobic and racist song after Argentina's Copa América triumph last year, but the 24-year-old did not appear to understand the question.

Chelsea continue their charge towards the FIFA Club World Cup title when they lock horns with Paris Saint-Germain in the competition's final this Sunday. 

The Blues have produced impressive performances en route to the showpiece event, dispatching of Benfica in their first knockout stage encounter before back-to-back victories over Brazilian sides Pameiras and Fluminense. They have overcome stern tests but are yet to come up against opposition as powerful as PSG. 

Chelsea will be significant underdogs for their upcoming battle with the reigning European champions, who have sauntered to the final via eye-catching victories over Atlético Madrid, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. Enzo Maresca will need to devise a foolproof plan to topple the French giants at MetLife Stadium. 

Here's how Chelsea can conquer the relentless PSG machine. 

Watch the FIFA Club World Cup live and on-demand here

Any side facing this sensational iteration of PSG would be foolish not to prepare for an onslaught. Chelsea's myriad of attacking threats could prove pivotal in deciding Sunday's affair but they won't have the opportunity to make a telling contribution should the Blues neglect their defensive responsibilities against the world's best attack. 

Maresca will need to ensure his side drop their defensive line against PSG, not allowing the Ligue 1 champions space to exploit in behind. A defence-first approach is essential to stifle Luis Enrique's men, who were three goals to the good after just 24 minutes of their semi-final with Real Madrid. Chelsea must stay in the match for as long as humanly possible. 

Selecting the correct personnel will be integral to Chelsea's fight against the odds. Reece James must start at right-back ahead of Malo Gusto in a bid to thwart Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, while Levi Colwill's return from suspension will help the Blues deny 2025 Ballon d'Or favourite Ousmane Dembélé. 

Maresca could even select two defensive-minded midfielders in the double pivot, with Roméo Lavia perhaps partnering Moisés Caicedo to provide extra cover—if both injury doubts are passed fit. The two wingers, likely Pedro Neto and Christopher Nkunku, must run themselves into the ground to ensure Chelsea's defence isn't overrun by PSG's wide men and flying full-backs.

PSG's midfield is essential to their dominance. The electric forward triumvirate often steal the headlines but it's the calm, possession-heavy football played in the engine room that creates the foundation on which the attackers can strut their stuff and decide matches. 

Vitinha, Fabián Ruiz and João Neves have formed an exceptional trident in the centre of the pitch that offers perfect balance between defence, attack and possession. They all have brilliant distribution, while Vitinha's tempo-setting abilities allow Ruiz and Neves to offer even more attacking threat for PSG. 

Chelsea must harry and press PSG's midfield within an inch of its life if they have any hopes of overcoming the French side, not allowing the classy trio to conduct things. If the likes of Caicedo and Enzo Fernández can smother their midfield counterparts and deny them space, there is a chance they can keep PSG at bay long enough to produce a sucker punch at the other end. 

PSG don't have many weaknesses but they will be without one crucial player on Sunday: Willian Pacho. The centre-back, who has formed an exceptional partnership with Marquinhos in the heart of defence, is suspended for the showpiece event after being dismissed in the quarter-final of the competition, while one of his potential replacements, Lucas Hernández, is also banned for the clash. 

Lucas Beraldo played admirably during PSG's 4–0 win over Real Madrid in the last four but he's a far less physically imposing presence than Pacho. Whether it be Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson or João Pedro, Chelsea could exploit the drop in quality at centre half, with the latter perhaps getting the nod after his sensational double against Fluminense.

According to Jose Felix Diaz's report in MARCA, the iconic Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid is expected to host the final of the 2030 FIFA World Cup, following an agreement reached between FIFA and Real Madrid. 

While the decision has not yet been made official, sources close to the situation have confirmed that the deal is in place.

The 2030 World Cup will be a historic one, as it will be jointly hosted by Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Within Spain, cities like A Coruna, Barcelona, Bilbao, Las Palmas, Madrid, Málaga, San Sebastian, Sevilla, and Zaragoza are set to host matches. 

But when it comes to the grand finale, the Santiago Bernabeu has emerged as the frontrunner.

FIFA's strong working relationship with Real Madrid has been a key factor in this decision. Over the years, both entities have shared a smooth and cooperative partnership, and this latest development is another sign of their growing alignment.

Barcelona had also put forward their own bid to host the final at the newly renovated Spotify Camp Nou. 

Club vice-president Elena Fort had officially stated last month that Barcelona's home stadium deserves the honour of staging the World Cup final, saying, 

“Everyone has the right to play their cards, but the Camp Nou is worthy of hosting the final of a World Cup.”

However, the project to complete the new Camp Nou has faced multiple delays and uncertainties, which appear to have weakened the city's bid. 

Though the World Cup is still five years away, FIFA is said to be prioritising infrastructure stability and readiness, areas where Madrid currently holds the upper hand.

With Real Madrid's renovated Bernabeu already hosting high-profile matches and events successfully, and with its central location and modern facilities, it now looks set to welcome the biggest match in world football come 2030.

The future of Rodrygo has become a key talking point at Real Madrid lately as the forward continues to fail in his bid to impress new coach Xabi Alonso.

The Brazilian didn't have the best of time in the FIFA Club World Cup, often being overshadowed by Arda Guler.

Rodrygo's role in the first-team may dilute further once new signing Franco Mastantuono joins hte Real Madrid camp in August.

This has led to intense speculation over Rodrygo's future, with the likes of Arsenal, PSG and Manchester City interested in his services.

Saudi Arabia, too, have been linked with a move for the Real Madrid winger, but Fabrizio Romano has recently refuted all the speculation.

However, despite all the speculation linking him with a move away from Santiago Bernabeu, Rodrygo is determined to stay at Real Madrid.

This is according to MARCA, which suggests that the Brazilian is keen on remaining at Real Madrid and fighting for his place in the first-team.

Despite all the rumours, no one in the Real Madrid camp has asked him to leave and with his contract not expiring until 2028, the Brazilian has no desire of leaving either.

However, Rodrygo's prolonged spell at Los Blancos will not bode well for the club knowing the player's value is bound to go down if he fails to gain regular game-time under Xabi Alonso.

The new Real Madrid coach has already made it clear that he would prefer players such as Guler to be orchestrating things in the final third and that he isn't afraid to try out new things.

Keeping that in mind, it will be interesting to see if Real Madrid eventually consider a sale of the Brazilian international, perhaps later in the summer.

Jannik Sinner is the No 1 men's player in world tennis

Mary in Windsor

Both the men's (ATP) and women's (WTA) rankings are based on points earned as part of a rolling 52-week cumulative process, with positions used to determine seedings at tournaments.

The men's rankings are formed from a maximum of 20 tournaments, while the women's are from 18.

In the men's game, those 20 qualifying tournaments consist of the four Grand Slams, the ATP Finals, the eight mandatory ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, then the seven best performances at lower ranked-tournaments - including non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 events, all ATP 500 series and all ATP 250 series.

For players not qualifying for the ATP Finals, 19 tournaments are counted.

In the women's game, their 18 tournaments consist of the four Grand Slams, the ATP Finals, six WTA 1000 mandatory combined/virtually combined tournaments, one WTA 1000 mandatory tournaments consisting of WTA only players, then seven results from other events.

The number  drops to 17 if they fail to reach the ATP Finals.

Ranking points are accumulated via wins and progression through tournaments, with higher-ranked events worth more points.

The ranking of a player's opponent is generally not factored in when determining points.

The only exception is the United Cup, where points for both the ATP and WTA rankings are awarded based on the rankings of the opponents beaten.

Sam

The general consensus is it is all to do with rhythm and comfort.

Flavio Cobolli said at Wimbledon was ""normal"" for players to keep tennis balls in their shorts, adding it felt more ""comfortable"".

Teenager Mirra Andreeva said it was ""easier to keep the focus between serves"" - as having a ball more readily available means the second serve is sooner.

Ben Shelton agreed with both, saying ""it takes a lot of time"" for him to select the balls at the start of service, so having to do it again would disrupt his rhythm.

""There's only two players I can think of off the top of my head that get the ball for their second serve from the ball kids, and that's Venus Williams and Casper Ruud,"" former player Naomi Broady told BBC Sport.

""We're very superstitious as tennis players. You see the routines before the first serve, so taking the ball out of your shorts before your second serve becomes part of that same routine.""

Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer hold the record for the longest men's Wimbledon final

Clive in Coatbridge

The longest men's singles final at Wimbledon was in 2019 between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

The match lasted four hours and 57 minutes, with Djokovic winning 7-6 (7-5) 1-6 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 13-12 (7-3).

Prior to that, the longest men's Wimbledon final was in 2008 between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, which was four hours and 48 minutes.

The longest women's singles final was in 2005 between Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport.

The match, which Williams won 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 9-7, lasted two hours and 45 minutes.

David in The Wirral

One player who does not practise sliding on grass is defending men's Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Speaking to BBC Sport, he said he was sliding on grass at Queen's prior to the start of Wimbledon, but it was a ""natural"" skill and added: ""You put your muscle injury at risk so in the practices, I don't do it.""

Another who does not practise sliding is Liudmila Samsonova. She said she felt that male players were ""better"" at sliding as they are ""physically stronger"".

""I think the men are sliding more than the women, because they have more strength in their legs and everything,"" said Samsonova. 

""They are more explosive, they are physically more stronger than us, so I think they can do that better than us.""

World number one Aryna Sabalenka was beaten in the semi-finals on Thursday by Amanda Anisimova

Lizzie in Crediton

Following her quarter-final win over Laura Siegemund, world number one Aryna Sabalenka revealed what she said to the German.

""I said, like, 'Whoa, girl, that's impressive - really great game' and she was congratulating me because it was a really emotional moment,"" said Sabalenka.

""I couldn't really put words together, but I just tried to tell her it was a really great match.""

Britain's Alfie Hewett - defending wheelchair singles and doubles champion - said he finds it a ""really awkward interaction"".

""If you've won, you can't really say 'good match' because it feels like a double insult. 

""Typically that is what you would say, you'd say: 'Good match, thank you.' Don't know what you'd be thanking them for, playing not as good? It's a really weird one!

""It depends on the relationship as well. I know quite a lot of the guys on tour, so it'll be like: 'You'll get me next time.' Or it could be 'good luck in the doubles', or something cheeky like that.""

Darren in Leicester

The All England Lawn Tennis Club has said the later start times compared to the other courts is in order to maximise the potential to have both show courts at full capacity when players come out.

Partly it is to give spectators the chance to explore the grounds before play on the show courts - and to maximise the experience of having a 'day out at Wimbledon'.

That includes sampling the facilities, watching action on the outside courts, as well as taking in traditions that include strawberries and cream.

Staggered start times also help to manage the flow of spectators around the grounds at Wimbledon across the whole day.

""Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a ‘Roland-Garros press conference,'"" the world No. 1 quipped after losing to Amanda Anisimova.ByAssociated PressPublished Jul 10, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 10, 2025

LONDON (AP) — As if there were any doubt whether Aryna Sabalenka's loss in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday brought to mind her loss in the French Open final — and its aftermath — a month ago, she made it quite clear right away.""Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a ‘Roland-Garros press conference,'"" the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said when she arrived for her question-and-answer session with reporters after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Centre Court, ""so anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now.""It was delivered as a punch line, knowing full well that the three-time Grand Slam champion was widely criticized for her words following a three-set loss to Coco Gauff with the trophy at stake in Paris.There was plenty of online venom directed Sabalenka's way.So much so, that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff, then offered a public mea culpa, before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club.

""I just don't want to face that hate again,"" Sabalenka said Thursday. ""We're all people. We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal.

So used to overpowering opponents, Sabalenka ran into someone who hits as big a ball as she does.""She was more brave today,"" Sabalenka said. ""Maybe when I was just trying to stay in the point, she was going for all. She was playing more aggressive.""There were other things about Anisimova that Sabalenka acknowledged were irritating.During one exchange, for example, Anisimova let out a shout before a point was over, and Sabalenka thought it was a premature celebration.""I was, like, I mean, ‘That's a bit too early.' Then she kind of (angered me), saying that, oh, that's what she does all the time,"" Sabalenka said. ""I was grateful that she actually said that,"" because it helped bring out more fight.

Asked about that moment, Anisimova said: ""I wasn't celebrating. It was just a long grunt, I guess. I don't really know what was the deal there, to be honest, because I didn't feel like it was that interfering. But I tried to not do it again.""During another point, Anisimova benefited from the ball trickling over the tape of the net and, instead of the usual ""Sorry, not sorry"" gesture players often use by raising a hand when that happens, seemed to be celebrating.""I was like, ‘You don't want to say sorry?' She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match,"" Sabalenka said. ""If she doesn't feel like saying sorry — she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation? — that's on her.""As for what comes next for Sabalenka?""I never give up,"" she said, ""and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure.""

Tennis

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Iga Świątek is into her first Wimbledon final and is not messing around.

She dominated Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 Thursday to set up a meeting with Amanda Anisimova of the U.S., with the controlled, clinical aggression on both serve and return that has defined her tennis the past fortnight.

Neither Świątek nor Anisimova has reached this stage before, but the Pole is the vastly more experienced player. She is a five-time Grand Slam champion who has spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1, even if by her own extremely high standards, she has fallen on harder times of late. The win makes Swiatek the only active WTA Tour player to reach a Grand Slam final on all three surfaces and a victory on Saturday would be Świątek's first title anywhere since winning a fourth Roland Garros title in June 2024, in what will be only her second final in that time.

Świątek suggested afterward that she's been helped by not coming into Wimbledon as the French Open champion. “I think it's easier if you haven't won Roland Garros and also if you had more time to practice,” she said in a news conference.

“If I win Roland Garros and then I come here and everybody ask me already about (winning Wimbledon)… They put, like, super high expectations. It's not kind of logical for me.”

She continues to look like a different player to the one who struggled throughout stretches of the last year. Her ability to ride out difficult moments has been a particular feature of this Wimbledon run, in contrast to the way in which she had started letting tight matches run away from her, by overhitting when things got tight and sending herself into a doom loop of mistakes. It happened in her shock defeat to a redlining Yulia Putintseva, who made one unforced error in a 13-game stretch of their third-round meeting here last year.

Świątek was so good against Bencic that there weren't too many tight moments. It briefly looked like things might get interesting when consecutive double faults helped give Bencic a couple of break points at the start of the second set, but Świątek quickly closed the door and got back to serving efficiently and returning with devastating aggression.

She won 83 percent of first-serve points and made 90 percent of returns.

Those strong foundations gave Świątek the platform to produce the kind of masterclass that brought back memories of the 2022 version of her who won two Grand Slams and won 37 matches in a row. She played with variety when needed, volleying with confidence for instance, but she barely needed to veer from her Plan A because it was working so well.

“I definitely thought today was just a different level from Iga,” Bencic said in a news conference.

“She was completely on fire. Maybe I would have had to play my absolutely best tennis of my life and risk every shot to beat her today the way she played.

“She was just playing very, very fast, very accurate, serving great. Just didn't really let me in the match. She didn't allow me to play my game.”

After winning the first three games of the match, confidence was coursing through Świątek. Bencic took a little while to settle, not helped by a nasty-looking fall in the second set. Play was paused after a spectator required medical assistance in the crowd, but Świątek did not allow the break in her momentum to affect her.

In the final game of the first set, she chased down a drop shot and flicked away a forehand passing-shot winner; In the first point of the second, she crunched a forehand winner down the line to send the message that there was going to be no let up.

At the start of the next game she middled a crosscourt backhand return winner past her demoralized opponent. “She's in the zone,” nine-time champion Martina Navratilova said in commentary for the BBC.

Świątek herself used the same phrase to describe herself afterward, and explained what she has learned to appreciate on grass.

“I think there's no place to overthink here,” she said.

“You kind of have to follow your instincts. If that is going well and you can rely on them for sure if you feel comfortable, so this is kind of fun in some way and different than on other surfaces where you have more time to build the rally.”

A feature of watching Świątek during 2022, and whenever she's been at her best, is wondering not whether she will lose, but how many games her opponent will win. She streaked away to a 5-0 lead in the second set, before crunching a backhand return to bring up a first match point.

Bencic saved it, but Świątek secured a trademark bagel set a couple of points later with another backhand winner, after just 71 minutes on court.

This was a statement victory, and Anisimova need only listen to how in awe Bencic was afterwards to know how big a task she has Saturday.

She was derided for being the ultimate tennis “WAG” and accused of profiting from her boyfriend's successful career. But Morgan Riddle, the immaculately dressed girlfriend of Taylor Fritz who has graced Wimbledon with her fashion tips this past fortnight, is becoming something of a cult heroine in tennis. Not only that, she is being credited with elevating SW19's fashion game and attracting legions of younger fans to the sport.

Such is Riddle's influence that she was dubbed “the most famous woman in men's tennis” when she was splashed on the cover of The New York Times two years ago. Ever since she was profiled in Netflix's Break Point series in 2023, the cameras have trailed the glamorous former model, who is known for her “tenniscore chic”, wherever she goes.

She has been a regular face in Fritz's box and will be expected to make another dutiful appearance for his semi-final showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Friday, when the American fifth seed will need all the support he can get. But this glitzy 27-year-old is not simply content with playing the secondary role of cheerleader from the sidelines.

Curiously, it is at the All England Club where Riddle's authority is the strongest. In a savvy move, Wimbledon organisers snapped her up two summers ago to front a dedicated fashion blog called Wimbledon Threads – where she imparts sacred knowledge on the latest clothing trends and in-season outfits to don at the Championships.

This year, it has proved a popular hit after the social media trend “Inspired by Moorgs” took off, which involves Riddle re-sharing photos of glam fans who have opted for her look. It may not chime with tennis tradition, but it is working.

Radiating a picture-perfect vibe with her elegant outfits and flowing blonde locks, a cursory look at Riddle's social feeds would suggest she is an easy target for male attention. Her fanbase, though, is in fact predominantly female and she has previously talked about her desire to use her platforms and engaging content to make sport more welcoming to women.

She has 600,000 followers and counting on TikTok, close to half a million on Instagram and an additional 80,000 on YouTube – with 18 to 24-year-old women reportedly making up around 80 per cent across all of her platforms.

But how likely is it that these Riddle fangirls will become hardcore tennis aficionados? It is one thing to gorge on the latest fashion tips and trends fed to you by an influencer, but quite another to get hooked on a five-set epic between Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, let alone buy tickets to events.

“She's quite divisive,” claims 20-year-old tennis fan Stella Newman. “People who are into tennis just want to watch tennis and that's true when it comes to social media. Clips compiled of Alcaraz and Sinner hitting all their different winners, for example – that's the sort of tennis that I interact with. Tennis purists debating about who's the GOAT on social media aren't that concerned about Morgan Riddle. There's definitely a bit of a split.”

Wimbledon's own social-media footprint has seen considerable growth across its channels this year – notably TikTok – with video clips of on-court action among the tournament's highest-performing content. Perhaps one reason is the new crop of personalities the sport has to celebrate, from Alcaraz's immense likeability to Coco Gauff's striking ability to fuse athleisure with high-end fashion.

“Everyone knows who Alcaraz is – it's the same with Coco Gauff, who has lots of brand recognisability behind her,” says Newman. “For me, that feels more genuine than following someone like Morgan Riddle. Rivalries are important – for people my age they missed out on the rivalry of the so-called ‘big three' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Now everyone's thinking Sinner and Alcaraz are the next big thing, so they all want to cotton on to it.”

Still, Riddle's presence may be welcome given tennis is battling to stay relevant in light of the astronomical rise of padel – a racket sport popularised by a growing number of celebrities from Stormzy to David Beckham.

This American has taken the definition of “WAG” – that horribly outdated term designated to sportsmen's wives and girlfriends – to a completely new stratosphere. This is Morgan Riddle's world and even if she might be dividing opinion, there are a lot of people living it.

LONDON (AP) — Morgan Riddle's effect on Wimbledon semifinalist Taylor Fritz's rise in the rankings has been significant. He says so himself.

Riddle has been at the All England Club this year and others in her role as a fashion influencer, telling her hundreds of thousands of social media followers how tennis has become “the chicest sport in the world.” She's been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times' Style section.

She was seated at Centre Court on Friday for her boyfriend Fritz's match against Carlos Alcaraz.

Riddle frequently is at tournaments to cheer for him. They were featured in the Netflix tennis documentary “ Break Point.”

Riddle, 27, is a Minnesota native who attended Wagner College in New York City.

“By the end of my junior year, I had completed seven internships,” she said in a Wagner College video about the Class of 2019 member.

Riddle explained that the internships included gigs at a magazine, a newspaper, a government office, a coffee company startup and a real estate company, with tasks including social media.

Riddle and Fritz met about five years ago.

Fritz was the U.S. Open runner-up last September — his first appearance in a Grand Slam final — and reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in November.

He says it's important to have someone “push you in the right direction all the time, supporting you.” He spoke about Riddle's role after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals.

“There's an obvious correlation between my results and ranking and the time we've been together,” he said. “I would have to say she's been a big help to me, just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.”

Riddle has worked with the All England Club to create video segments called “Wimbledon Threads.”

Wearing brands such as Chanel and Jimmy Choo, she details trends like “tenniscore.”

“‘Tenniscore' isn't just about pleated skirts and vintage polos. It's about aspirational minimalism with a competitive edge,” she said in a video last week entitled “ How Wimbledon made tennis chic.”

She added that Wimbledon has “helped tennis become the chicest sport in the world.”

Riddle isn't afraid to throw a few zingers.

“Of course we're here for the tennis but what was once a strictly sporting event has also turned into a global fashion spectacle. I know some of you may not want to hear that but just because the fact annoys you, doesn't make it any less true,” she said.

That segment has 12,300 views as of Friday — a different Wimbledon video featuring a kid asking Aryna Sabalenka about pancakes has more than double that.

Riddle's clips on TikTok, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, are more popular. She also has more than 450,000 followers on Instagram.

Fritz often takes photos of her to post on social media.

“I've definitely gotten a lot better over the last couple of years but very reluctantly,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. “It's very embarrassing in public when I'm taking pictures (and) people are looking at me taking pictures of her. But you got to do what you got to do sometimes. She also takes good pictures of me.”

Grigor Dimitrov appears to be in good spirits after his unfortunate exit from Wimbledon on Monday. While en route to upsetting World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the round of 16, up 2-0 in sets, Dimitrov was forced to withdraw from the match with a partial pectoral tear.

Four days after the injury, the 34-year-old Bulgarian expressed his gratitude on social media while sharing a snap of him enjoying a meal from his hospital bed.

""Sometimes the heart wants to keep going … but the universe has a different plan for us,"" Dimitrov wrote.

""Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community ... your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.""

The agonizing exit derailed Dimitrov from achieving his first Grand Slam title. His injury is expected to keep him sidelined for the next three tournaments, including the US Open in late August.

Dimitrov stacked wins against Yoshihito Noshioka, Corentin Motet and Sebastian Ofner before leaving the tournament.

Sinner, who will face Novak Djokovic in the semifinals on Friday, said after the match that, ""I don't take this as a win at all.""

""He is an incredible player, we all saw this today,"" Sinner said of Dimitrov. ""It's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player, a good friend of mine — we understand each other very well off the court too. If there would be a chance that he would play in the next round, he would deserve [it]. But now I hope he has a speedy recovery.""

Dimitrov has won nine ATP singles titles, with his latest coming in 2024 when he defeated Alejandra Tabilo in the Laver Cup.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Grigor Dimitrov has described his withdrawal from his Wimbledon quarter-final against Jannik Sinner as “one of the most painful moments” of his career.

The Bulgarian was leading the world No 1 by two sets and seemed bound for the last four when he suffered a right pectoral muscle injury during the third set on Centre Court.

The 34-year-old has now been unable to complete a match in five grand slam tournaments during a career oft disrupted by injury, but this was a particularly tough moment given the level which he had found to leave Sinner, struggling himself with an elbow injury, on the brink of exit.

“Sometimes the heart wants to keep going… but the universe has a different plan for us,” Dimitrov posted on Instagram, accompanying a photo of him in a hospital bed.

“Having to withdraw from this match at Wimbledon was one of the most painful moments of my career.

“Thank you for the overwhelming wave of love — from family, friends, fans, colleagues, to the entire tennis community… your messages have genuinely lifted me through these hard times. Thank you all. Truly. Recovery starts now. I'll see you all soon.”

Serving at 2-2 in the third set, having won the first two sets 6-3, 7-5, Dimitrov went to ground holding the right hand side of his chest, having just hit an ace.

Dimitrov had suffered a similar fate at Wimbledon 12 months ago, when he had to retire from his match against Danil Medvedev due to an abductor tear.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a 'hate relationship' with Wimbledon after to failing to win her third semi-final on Centre Court on Thursday afternoon. 

The world No1 had been looking to compete in her third major final of the season after defeats at the Australian Open and Roland-Garros, but was thwarted by the No13 seed Amanda Anisimova in three knife's-edge sets. 

Last year saw the 27-year-old forced to withdraw on the eve of the tournament after suffering a shoulder injury, with Sabalenka then vowing to be back 'stronger than ever'. 

Instead, Sabalenka's heartbreak on grass continued, with the Belarusian having previously lost to Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 semi-final, and Ons Jabeur at the same stage two years later. 

When asked about whether her experience against the American star in the 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 defeat would make help make her a better Wimbledon champion in the future, Sabalenka was honest about the immediate difficulties she is facing in the aftermath of the loss. 

'It's tough, like you said, to think about that, but I really hope so,' Sabalenka said. 'I lost three semis, three tough ones. 

Aryna Sabalenka admitted that she has a choppy ongoing relationship with Wimbledon

The world No1 was defeated across three tight sets by American star Amanda Anisimova

In a challenging press conference after the match, Sabalenka tried to balance her good humour with bitter disappointment

'Then I was banned from playing (due to her nationality, in 2022). Then I was injured. So I have really more of a hate relationship right now with Wimbledon, but I really hope that one day I will, yeah, turn it around and have love relationship.

'Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it.

'Yeah, now it's tough, but I never give up, and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure.'

Sabalenka also revealed that she had almost let her tempter get the better of her and smashed up her racquets on-court. 

On-court in the final stages of the match, Sabalenka had crashed her racquet into her head briefly, but avoided a major fine by refusing to take her anger out on the grass. 

'We all can lose control over our emotions,' Sabalenka continued. 'It's absolutely normal. 

'Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start... I don't know... yelling, screaming, smashing the racquets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option, and it's not going to help me to stay in the match and to fight for my dream.

'Even right now I took a bit more time before doing my media just so I can be Aryna, not that crazy person that been on that media day at Roland-Garros.'

The 27-year-old has previously been defeated in three semi-finals at the SW19 tournament

But Sabalenka was keen the manage her sadness in light of the backlash she received after losing to Coco Gauff in Paris

Sabalenka's reference to the French Open final came after the US Open champion found herself at the centre of a media firestorm after she was accused of failing to acknowledge her opponent Coco Gauff's achievements in winning in Paris. 

The star later apologised both publicly and privately to Gauff, with the pair filming a TikTok dance together on Centre Court after the olive branch had been extended. 

But as much as Sabalenka was able to keep her emotions in check to a degree, she could not fully extinguish her trademark competitive fire. 

Sabalenka had declared that she was 'p****d off' by Anisimova for two of her celebrations on court during the tight match. 

The 23-year-old first appeared to celebrate a winner before the ball had bounced twice, as is custom, with Sabalenka questioning the umpire as to whether the noise was a 'hinderance'. 

Anisimova reportedly implied that was something that Sabalenka had done in the past, adding to the charged atmosphere. 

'I was just trying to chase the ball and, yeah, she was already celebrating it,' said Sabalenka. 'I was, like, I mean, that's a bit too early. Then she kind of p****d me off saying that, ""oh, that's what she does all the time.""

'I was grateful she actually said that because it actually helped me to keep fighting. I'm like, ""okay, now I'm going to show you the tennis."" So I came back because I got really angry in that moment.

The point which won Anisimova her fifth game of the final set occurred after the ball hit the top of the net and bounced over - which usually results in the player apologising to their opponent

But Anisimova (top) celebrated after winning the point, leaving Sabalenka (bottom) unamused

'So probably in the third set I should have remembered and it probably will help!'

Another celebration came in the closing stages of the match, when Anisimova's ball clipped the net cord and fell fortuitously over the other side - and rather than offering a brief, and likely insincere, apology, Anisimova clenched her fist to cheer the point won. 

A disgusted Sabalenka turned to her box before glaring at Anisimova and asking her why she didn't apologise.

'I just looked at her and, for sure, she didn't hear me, I was like ""You don't want to say sorry?"",' said Sabalenka. 'She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match.

'It's on her. If she doesn't feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation, that's on her.' 

But after match point, the hostilities quickly ebbed away, with the pair hugging at the net and Anisimova paying tribute to her opponent in her own press conference.  

Anisimova and Sabalenka put the match behind them to share a hug at the net at its end

Anisimova will now prepare for her first-ever Grand Slam final against Poland's Iga Swiatek

'This doesn't feel real right now,' said Anisimova. 'Aryna is such a tough competitor and I was absolutely dying out there. I don't know how I pulled it off, shes's an incredible competitor and an inspiration to me and to so many people.

'We have had so many tough battles and to come out on top and reach the final at Wimbledon is incredibly special.'

Anisimova will meet Iga Swiatek in Saturday's final in their first meeting on the professional tour. 

The duo previously met as juniors in a Fed Cup (now known as the Junior Billie Jean King Cup) match-up between USA and Poland, with Swiatek taking the 2016 match.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Sinner stops hindered Djokovic to set Alcaraz blockbuster Wimbledon final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-djokovic-wimbledon-2025-sf","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:18:45 GMT","

 Jannik Sinner swept aside Novak Djokovic on Friday to reach his maiden Wimbledon championship match and simultaneously earn the opportunity for a swift slice of major-final revenge. 

 The Italian eased past the physically struggling Djokovic 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-finals at the grass major to book a title showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. Last month, Sinner let slip three championship points against Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final, and the pair will now resume their rivalry Sunday on the All England Club's iconic Centre Court. 

 ”I can't believe it,” said Sinner, when asked about reaching his first Wimbledon final. “It's a tournament I always watched when I was young on television. I would never have imagined that I could play here in the final, so it's amazing. I know how much work me and my team are putting in. My dad and my brother arrived today, so it's even more special.” 

INTO HIS FIRST WIMBLEDON FINAL 🔥@janniksin takes out Djokovic in straight sets to reach his 5th Grand Slam final!@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/yhsE4R2Nl2

 Even with Djokovic's movement well below its trademark best after he sustained an injury late in his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli, Sinner was typically clinical in completing his one-hour, 55-minute last-four win. Aside from a lapse early in the third set that left him trailing 0-3, the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings was precise on serve and rock-solid from the baseline throughout. 

 “On my side, I served very well today,” reflected Sinner. “I felt great on court. I was moving much better today, and I think we all saw, especially in the third set, that he was a bit injured. He fell in the last couple of points in the quarter-finals. He was in a very difficult situation, but I tried to stay calm and tried to play the best tennis I can, especially in the important moments.” 

 By defeating Djokovic, Sinner completed the set of final appearances at all four Grand Slam events. He is the 11th man to complete that feat in the Open Era. The 23-year-old has now won five consecutive matches against Djokovic, a streak that includes Grand Slam semi-final triumphs (2024 Australian Open, 2025 Roland Garros and Wimbledon). 

 Doubts had surrounded Djokovic's fitness heading into Friday's semi-final after he fell in the final game against Cobolli on Wednesday. The seven-time champion subsequently cancelled his on-site practice scheduled for Thursday at Aorangi Park and, once the semi-final with Sinner began, he seemed to struggle with pushing off to get back into court if taken wide. 

 Sinner's own Wimbledon campaign became dogged with fitness issues after he slipped early in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov, who was later forced to retire when leading the World No. 1 by two sets. Sinner subsequently eased past Ben Shelton in the fourth round and his performance against Djokovic was another sign that he is back to firing on all cylinders. 

 The reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, Sinner delivered an early blow by breaking Djokovic's serve in the third game of the match, and he cruised to a two-set lead without any real peril. Sinner struck the ball cleanly off both wings and replicated the stunning serving display he had produced against Shelton. The World No. 1 dropped just 17 points on serve in the match, with eight of those coming in his first two service games of the third set. 

 Djokovic, won won just 17 per cent (5/30) of points behind his second serve overall, received a medical timeout on his left thigh at the end of the second set. The 38-year-old then quickly opened a 3-0 lead in the third, but he was unable to maintain his momentum. With Sinner dominant in the majority of extended rallies, the Italian reeled off five straight games and, although Djokovic fended off two match points to hold for 4-5, Sinner made no mistake in completing his win behind his own delivery. 



 Alcaraz leads Sinner 8-4 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series heading into Sunday's final, having won their five most-recent tour-level meetings. It is Sinner who triumphed in the only previous grass-court encounter between the two, however: The Italian registered a four-set win in the Wimbledon fourth round in 2022. 

 Sinner and Alcaraz facing off in another Grand Slam final marks the continued emergence of a new ‘Big Two' era and guarantees that after Sunday the pair will have shared the past seven major titles. The title showdown will also be crucial in the two players' battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Alcaraz currently leads Sinner by 2,240 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, but the Italian will reduce that significant deficit to 1,540 points by winning the title. 

 “We saw the last final. You never know,” said Sinner, when asked about the prospect of meeting Alcaraz. “It's a huge honour for me to share the court once again with Carlos. We try to push ourselves to the limit. He is for sure one of the players I look up to. I love watching him and we all agree what kind of talent he is. Hopefully it's going to be a good match like the last one.”

By reaching the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have achieved something that only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had previously done in the Open Era.

Sinner and Alcaraz are the only Roland Garros final opponents to meet again in the same season's Wimbledon championship besides Federer and Nadal, who did it in three consecutive years from 2006 through 2008.

Nadal lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires in all three years, adding to his eventual count of 14 trophies at the clay-court major. In 2006 and 2007, Federer responded by beating his rival in the Wimbledon final. In 2008, Nadal earned the crown at both tournaments.

Repeat Roland Garros & Wimbledon Finalists In Same Season (Open Era)




Alcaraz carries the momentum of an unforgettable victory at Roland Garros, where he saved three championship points before stunning Sinner in a  five-set thriller. The Spaniard has won 24 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Sinner has advanced to four straight Grand Slam finals, having won last year's US Open and this year's Australian Open. The Italian will compete for the Wimbledon trophy for the first time. 

The last time the same two men battled in consecutive major finals was at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2016, when Novak Djokovic defeated Andy Murray for two straight Slam titles.

Alcaraz leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and has won their past five meetings. This will be their second clash in a Grand Slam final.

Mika Hakkinen versus Michael Schumacher. McLaren versus Ferrari. The 2000 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps delivered another classic...

To mark F1's 75th anniversary celebrations, F1.com is counting down the sport's 25 greatest races with a new feature every week. While you may not agree with the order, we hope you enjoy the stories of these epic races that have helped make this sport what it is today. You can read the introduction to the series and see the list of races here.

At No. 17, Mika Hakkinen gives Mike Seymour his perspective of the dramatic, rain-hit 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, a weekend on which the Finn dominated Qualifying, spun out of the race lead in slippery conditions, and then hunted down Michael Schumacher before pulling off an overtake people still talk about to this day…

After becoming a two-time World Champion, I was full of confidence heading into the 2000 season. Again, Adrian Newey had designed our car, and again, it was very fast – even if it was very difficult to drive. I remember it being on a knife-edge.

Our start to the year was okay. We had some technical issues, which disturbed things, but going to the Belgian Grand Prix, I felt we would do well. I knew that our car would be quick at Spa-Francorchamps – and it was. Really, really, really quick!

When it came to Saturday's Qualifying session, I was able to maximise the performance of the car in every sector of the lap and take pole position by more than seven-tenths of a second.

Then the rain arrived on Sunday. When you're driving an F1 car in the wet, it's quite a scary experience, especially if your car is on a knife-edge. Everything went fine at the start; I got the lead, I was comfortable, but then I touched the kerb a little bit too much at Stavelot, lost control and spun…

Luckily, the engine was still running when I ended up on the grass. Of course, I saw Michael – ‘Neeeeeooooom!' – going flat-out past me. I said, ‘Oh my God'. But I was still confident. ‘I have a good car,' I thought to myself.

When those kind of things happen, you don't have time to think about it too much. ‘What did I do wrong?' You just have to focus, go back to the track, confirm that there is no damage anywhere on the car and put your foot down.

After that, I started hunting down Michael. I think he had a little bit more downforce than me, because he was very good in the middle sector of the track, which has quite a few corners. He was able to pull away a little bit there, but every time we went in a straight line, I was catching him in a big way.

I put in some incredible lap times and I knew I was going to catch Michael sooner or later, although I wasn't sure if I would be able to overtake him. I knew Michael, I knew how he raced, and he was a really tough guy to overtake. He didn't open the door for you.

If you tried to make an overtake on Michael the normal way, when you leave your braking to the last minute and put your nose in, it was probably going to end up in a crash. He was very aggressive in that kind of situation. The positive was that he was consistent!

When I finally caught Michael, I looked at where he was quick, where he was slow, what kind of tactic I had to adopt to be able to overtake him. I soon knew there was only one place where I had a chance to overtake him – the Kemmel Straight. But, to do that, I needed to go through Eau Rouge nearly flat-out.

With the race configuration, with tyres that were old, with a car that was already knackered… to go through Eau Rouge flat-out, I knew that it was a risk. But I had to take this risk to be able to overtake him.

Michael also knew that was the only place where I could overtake – and he kept closing the door. Even when I was next to him, he put me on the grass. I was like, ‘Michael, come on... I'm so much faster, don't defend, it's ridiculous. It's not going to end up a nice way if you continue defending'. But he continued defending.

Then there was a little bit of luck. I don't normally think about luck. You have to work on yourself, you have to work with the team, maximise everything that you can. In this case, it was luck that there was a backmarker – Ricardo Zonta – on that straight. I thought, ‘This is it. I have to use this opportunity now'.

Strangely, Ricardo was driving in the middle of the track. Not driving on the right, not on the left, but the middle. It was very unusual. When we approached him, Michael went left, which made sense, because the other side of the track was still a bit damp. I knew that Michael was going to aim for the dry line to help under braking for Les Combes.

As soon as it became clear that Michael was going to overtake on the left, I just went flat-out on the right. But I knew that I had to come back to Michael's line as soon as possible and be on the dry part of the track to hit the brakes. That's why the movement happened very quickly.

It was a great, great feeling when it all happened.

I really needed to focus hard afterwards. As soon as I got past the second sector and third sector with Michael still behind me, I said, ‘Ookay, that's it, now I'm going to put my foot down'. I didn't make any mistakes, Michael dropped back, and I was like, ‘Wow, this is cool'.

When the race was over, I went to see Michael about his defending. I'd known him for many years and we'd been racing each other for many years. We had some little incidents in the past, and these incidents didn't happen because, ‘Oops, sorry, I made a little mistake'.

I explained to Michael, ‘Look, this is not the way racing should happen. We are both competitors, we are both World Champions, let's build our respect on the racetrack that we fight nice and clearly'. Michael just said, ‘No, this is racing, Mika'.

Anyway, it's a long time ago. It's history. I'm not looking at this situation negatively. I had a chat with Michael, I understood his way of working, and that's it. We all do things differently…

In general, I think it was an incredible time for the sport. F1 today is mega, no question about it. But that period was special because Michael was at Ferrari, while there was McLaren as an English team with a German engine, helping this Finnish guy to beat a German driver…

In Germany, people were like, ‘Who are we going to support here? Are we going to support Mika or Michael? Michael is at Ferrari, Mika is using a Mercedes engine and doing commercials around Germany'. So, it was a very powerful fan base, and a friendly fan base in my opinion. It was a beautiful thing.

The fans are the most important in this business and, when I raced against Michael, it created a nice environment. We didn't argue in the media; we fought on the track – even if Michael was a bit aggressive sometimes!

The Star Wars creator will headline a panel on his Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, and will be joined by Guillermo del Toro and Queen Latifah.  


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	The king of the nerds is finally coming to Comic-Con.


George Lucas, whose Star Wars movies helped create many of the ideas of modern fandoms, is coming to San Diego Comic-Con for his first-ever panel.




	Lucas will be joined by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, and artist and Star Wars prequels production designer Doug Chiang for a panel that will explore the power of illustrated story and offer a sneak peek at the new Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.


	Queen Latifah, the Grammy- Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning actress and recording artist, will moderate the panel, which will take place Sunday in Hall H, the cavernous and storied arena in the San Diego Convention Centre.

					'Rogue One' Director Has No Plans to Make Another 'Star Wars' Movie: ""I'm Very Happy to Move on""		
			









	The panel of creators will discuss the role of narrative art in society while tracing humanity's innate desire to draw, animate and bring to life stories across the millennia.




			Popular on THR		







	“We are beyond thrilled to welcome George Lucas to Comic-Con for the very first time,” said David Glanzer, chief communications and strategy officer of Comic-Con. “Nearly five decades ago, Star Wars made one of its earliest public appearances at our convention, along with a booth featuring Howard Chaykin's now legendary Star Wars poster as a promotional item.


	“Now, to have Mr. Lucas return, this time to debut the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, is a true full-circle moment. His lifelong dedication to visual storytelling and world-building resonates deeply with us and our community, and the museum's mission to celebrate narrative art in all its forms perfectly reflects what Comic-Con has championed from the very beginning.”

	











	Star Wars has been tied to Comic Con since its earliest days although surprisingly Lucas has not made a pilgrimage to the geek mecca himself, preferring to let creatives or fan outreach executives make appearance.  


	A Star Wars panel was held in 1976, a year before the original movie was released, but the panelists included the makers of the not-yet launched Star Wars comic from Marvel, writer Roy Thomas and artist Chaykin. 


	And there have been many a panel on many aspects of Star Wars, although most were not of the headline-making variety. One exception was a panel in 2004 where Lucasfilm revealed Revenge as the Sith as the title for Star Wars: Episode III. Another was when Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill shared the stage in 2015 to unveil a peek at the first Star Wars: The Force Awakens, although that was now in the Disney era and Lucas was not part of that.


	The Lucas Museum is dedicated to illustrated storytelling across time, cultures, and media and its collection will include works by Norman Rockwell, Kadir Nelson, Jessie Willcox Smith, N. C. Wyeth, Beatrix Potter, Judy Baca, Frida Kahlo, and Maxfield Parrish. There will also be showcases for work by comic artists, including Winsor McCay, Jack Kirby, Frank Frazetta, Alison Bechdel, Chris Ware, and R. Crumb; and photographers Gordon Parks, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Dorothea Lange.


	The museum also houses the Lucas Archive, containing models, props, concept art, and costumes from Lucas's filmmaking career.

	











	Co-founded by  Lucas and Mellody Hobson and to be located in LA's Exposition Park, the museum is slated to open in 2026.

					By Rosy Cordero 

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Finn Little will reprise his Yellowstone character, Carter, as a series regular in the as-yet-untitled Beth and Rip spinoff for Paramount+, sources tell Deadline. He joins his former co-stars Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, who are leading the Taylor Sheridan series as their characters from the original series, Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, respectively.


As Deadline revealed in December, the show is expected to remain on the same present-day timeline, with the new offshoot sharing the most DNA with the mothership of any show in the universe to date.


	The original series follows the Dutton family that controls the largest contiguous cattle ranch in the United States. Reilly's Beth is John Dutton III's (Kevin Costner) daughter, a former head of acquisitions at the Schwartz & Meyer financial firm. Hauser's jaded ranch foreman Rip Wheeler, who first came to John Dutton as a young boy on the run after killing his stepfather to protect his mother, learned how to be a cowboy from John, who treated him like a son.

	Little debuted as Carter in Yellowstone‘s fourth season premiere, a role he continued until the series finale. His character is a troubled teen who met Beth at the hospital when she was visiting her ailing father, and where Carter's father was dying. After he loses his father due to drug addiction, Beth and Rip become his guardians, giving Carter work on their ranch. Beth, unable to have children due to a forced sterilization, is uninterested in being a mother. However, she and Rip form a bond with the hard-working young man who remained with them.

	











	Paramount+ declined to comment.


Yellowstone was co-created by Sheridan and John Linson, who executive produce with Art Linson, Costner, David C. Glasser, Bob Yari, Stephen Kay, Michael Friedman, Christina Voros and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.


	The Yellowstone Universe also includes prequels 1883 and 1923, both of which have concluded their runs. Two other upcoming offshoots join the Beth and Rip series on the slate: The Madison for Paramount+, led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals for CBS, led by Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, with additional universe entries 1944 and 6666 previously announced as being in development.


	Australian-born Little's credits also include the films The Surfer (2024), working opposite Nicolas Cage, the Taylor Sheridan-directed Those Who Wish Me Dead (2021), alongside Angelina Jolie and Jon Bernthal. His TV credits include roles in Netflix's Reckoning, with Milly Alcock and Sam Trammell, and Tidelands, also from the streamer. He also portrayed Noomi Rapace's son in the psychological thriller Angel of Mine. He is repped by Paradigm and Hansen Jacobson.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The White House's latest meme of Donald Trump is the president as Superman, coming just as Warner Bros/DC Studios releases James Gunn's mega-pic about the superhero.


	“THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP,” the White House account read, with Trump taking the place of David Corenswet from the movie's marketing material.

	The White House meme follows what has been a week of MAGA commentators and others on the right attacking Gunn's recent comments about the DC superhero. In an interview, the writer-director told the Times of London, “I mean, Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	That reference to Superman being an immigrant has been enough to get figures like Ben Shapiro and Jesse Watters claiming that Superman has “gone woke,” even though it is not clear if they have even seen the movie, which opens wide at the box office Friday. Shapiro has a history of seizing on Hollywood productions to gin up the culture wars, as he did with Barbie in 2023.


	The press office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, also seized on the attention, writing on X, “Superman was an undocumented immigrant.” Newsom has been challenging Trump's deployment of the National Guard amid protests over ICE raids.

	











	The governor posted a video of a raid on a cannibis farm in Camarillo, writing, “Kids running from tear gas, crying on the phone because their mother was just taken from the fields. Trump calls me ‘Newscum' — but he's the real scum.”

	Rodney Scott, commissioner at Customs and Border Patrol, responded that “10 juveniles were found at this marijuana facility – all illegal aliens, 8 of them unaccompanied. It's now under investigation for child labor violations. This is Newsom's California.”


	The governor replied, “California prosecutes child exploiters and traffickers. Trump tear-gasses children, rips them from their parents, and deports farmworkers. Priorities.”

	So far, the politics behind Superman, immigration and ICE don't seem to have depressed initial box office returns. Previews brought in $22.5 million on Thursday, per Deadline's Anthony D'Alessandro, a record for the director.

The irony for MAGA is that the champion for truth, justice and the American Way is essentially an undocumented immigrant probably illegally adopted by the Kents who raised their adopted alien son to uphold American values and respect every living creature and protect everyone from harm. Contrary to MAGA dogma.

I missed the episode where Superman demonstrated against the oppressors/racists in America that wouldn't give him free stuff..all while carrying a flag from the planet Krypton

I don't believe that Superman was an ingrate..in fact he loved America..Imagine that

Bingo.

A. Superman is literally a f*cking alien. 

B. Our president is literally a fascist idiot. And this meme is pathetic and gross…because there is absolutely nothing truthful about trump.

Would had made more sense if he was added to Lex Luthor LOL.

Please tell me that someone created a meme with his lard ass.

the deadline comments section is like a window into 2018.

What is your point?

that the world is moving on without you

I thought righties hated Superman because he is so “woke” in their terms? This new Superman movie is about kindness – something Trump would know nothing about.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	U.S. citizen Francis Charles Kaufmann, the self-proclaimed movie producer who is accused of murdering his partner and baby daughter in Rome, has been extradited to Italy from Greece. Italian media reported that Kaufmann arrived at the Rome airport of Ciampino on an Italian Air Force Falcon just before midday local time Friday. Kaufmann was originally arrested on the Greek island of Skiathos on June 13 on suspicion of killing his 28-year-old Russian partner Anastasia Trofimova and their 11-month-old daughter Andromeda, whose lifeless bodies were discovered in Rome's Villa Pamphili park on June 7.

	











	He denied the accusations in a hearing in Larissa in Greece shortly after his detention, saying: ” “I am innocent: I didn't kill them.”  The mother and child had reportedly accompanied Kaufmann to the Italian capital for meetings on a number of feature film projects he said he was trying to get off the ground.As reported by Deadline last month, it emerged in the wake of the murders and Kaufmann's arrest that he had been operating under a number of aliases and that many of his producer credits on IMDb were untrue. It also came to light that Kaufmann had secured a €863,595 ($996,112) tax credit from the Italian Ministry of Culture in 2020 for a feature entitled Stelle della Notte, which never got made, using the alias of Rexal Ford and a fake passport. Under rules around the Italian film tax credit, the application was handled by Rome-based company Coevolutions and Kaufmann did not have direct access to the monies, but one hypothesis is that he traveled to Rome to secure part of the payout.


	This revelation led to the resignation of Nicola Borrelli, the General Director of Cinema and Audiovisual at the Italian Ministry of Culture.  Kaufmann has now been transferred to a secure section of Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of Rome and a preliminary face-to-face hearing with Italian investigators is expected to take place next week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Tyler Perry accuser Derek Dixon explains why he came forward with allegations","https://www.avclub.com/tyler-perry-accuser-explains-lawsuit-allegations","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:41:00 GMT","

Tyler Perry accuser Derek Dixon came forward with his allegations because “I couldn't just let him get away with this,” he says in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “There are always attempts to resolve situations like this privately, but they never result in the type of change necessary to protect further victims. At the end of the day my absolute fear is that he will be able to continue doing this without any major consequences.”

Dixon has filed a lawsuit against Perry alleging sexual harassment and assault. He tells THR that Perry first singled him out when Dixon was working as an event coordinator in Atlanta and organized a party for Tyler Perry Studios. The connection led to an audition for The Oval spin-off Ruthless, landing a role which would eventually become a recurring spot on the flagship series. But Dixon claims that this good fortune came with unwanted attention, including incessant, inappropriate personal text messages (Per THR, the legal complaint includes texts from Perry commenting on Dixon's “thick” body, asking “Why do you twist your hips when you walk?”, noting that Dixon “liked being choked” after shooting a choking scene on the show, and telling Dixon he needed to “let someone hold you and make love to you”). 

Dixon recounts multiple instances where Perry crossed physical boundaries, once even getting into Dixon's bed uninvited when the actor was staying in Perry's guest house. Dixon says he attempted to defuse the situation by saying he wasn't looking for a sexual relationship, a situation that would repeat multiple times over the next few years. But he maintained a friendly relationship with Perry and continued to accept invitations because of Perry's power over his career, including a promise to shoot a comedy pilot that Dixon had written. 

In 2021, Dixon says Perry assaulted him at Perry's home, in a situation where Dixon believed he was going to be raped. Perry “forcefully pulled down my underwear and groped my bare ass,” Dixon recalls, adding “When I tried to pull my underwear back up, he grabbed my wrists to keep me from putting them back on. I couldn't believe what was happening.” Dixon says he managed to deescalate the situation, but was shaken; however, he “was too afraid to come forward” about it because of his career, particularly after a TPS coworker reminded him what was at stake. “I knew it would be awful. And I was right.”

Dixon eventually moved away from Atlanta to put distance between himself and Perry, ultimately quitting and filing a sexual harassment complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2024. In a statement to THR, a lawyer for Perry describes Dixon as an “individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,” adding, “Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.”

“I was an employee, and he was my boss,” Dixon says tells THR. “The fact that I'm an actor doesn't make me any less an employee. For a long time, I convinced myself that it was part of the industry, or that somehow I had to accept it to keep working. But eventually, I couldn't stay silent anymore.” You can read the full interview here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jed and Katey Duggar Are Expanding Faster Than Jim Bob and Michelle Ever Did","https://entertainmentnow.com/tlc/jed-katey-duggar-talk-growing-family/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:21:12 GMT","

When it comes to big families, the Duggars have long been the gold standard. But Jed Duggar and his wife Katey Duggar are already on track to outpace even Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's famously large brood. With four kids under the age of four—including newborn twins—the young couple has reached a major milestone faster than Jed's parents ever did.

The couple reflected on the rapid growth during an appearance on The Jinger & Jeremy Podcast. “We've known each other five years,” Katey shared. “So when we look at it like that, we're like, ‘Wow, this has been crazy.'”

Jeremy Vuolo didn't hesitate to ask the obvious: “So you guys are four in four years—are you going to keep going?”

Jed responded, “We're just praying about that,” while Katey added they're currently taking a “sabbatical” from growing the family. “We would love to just enjoy the kids we have right now for a good minute,” she said. “It's an insanely busy season, the little years—especially because we have two infants right now. It's just all hands on deck at all times, 24/7.”

Still, they admitted they “both have a number in mind.” Katey revealed, “We'd love to have five or six kids.”

As noted by TV Insider, Jim Bob and Michelle's fourth child, Jill Duggar, wasn't born until their eldest, Josh Duggar, was three years old. Jed and Katey? Their four little ones—Truett, 3, Nora, 2, and twins Elsie and Emma, 5 months—are all under the age of four.

A post shared by Jed Duggar (@jed_duggar)

Parenting four kids under four isn't easy, and Jed and Katey are the first to admit it—especially now that they've entered the world of twins. “When you have twins, you're both doing the same thing at the same time,” Katey explained. “It's not like, ‘I'll change them this time, you change them next time.' No, we're both changing them at the same time.”

The couple also opened up about naming their oldest, Truett. Some fans speculated it was a tribute to Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy—but that wasn't the case.

“We love Chick-fil-A,” Jed joked, “but that's not why we named him that.” Katey clarified, “The meaning of the name is ‘warrior for Christ,' and his middle name, Oliver, means ‘peace.' That's a solid name, and he's a solid kid.”

Their fast-growing family may be a handful, but they wouldn't have it any other way. As Jed wrote in his 2021 wedding tribute: “The thought of sharing the rest of my life with you makes me the happiest man in the world.”

“From the relatocam,” Schumer captioned the Instagram post, which quickly accumulated over 24,000 likes and an outpouring of supportive comments from fans and fellow celebrities. The comedian's playful reference to keeping things “relatable” connected with followers who have followed her transparent health journey.

A post shared by @amyschumer

Schumer's current wellness success stems from working closely with healthcare professionals to address multiple health concerns simultaneously. Earlier this year, she revealed her positive experience with Mounjaro, a medication that has helped her achieve sustainable results without the severe side effects she previously encountered.

“I wanted to share and keep it 100,” Schumer explained in a candid video. She emphasized the importance of transparency, noting: “It's not covered by insurance unless you have diabetes or like severe obesity, which most of the internet thinks I have. I'm having a really good experience with it, and I wanted to keep it real with you about that.”

The comedian's current treatment approach extends beyond weight management medication. During a telehealth consultation, medical professionals identified that she was experiencing perimenopause, leading to hormone therapy that dramatically improved her overall well-being.

“My hair is fuller, my skin is better, I have more energy,” Schumer shared with her followers, describing the comprehensive improvements she's experienced since beginning proper treatment for her perimenopausal symptoms.

Schumer's journey to finding effective treatment wasn't without obstacles. She previously experienced severe adverse reactions to Ozempic, which taught her about the importance of personalized medical care and genetic considerations in treatment planning.

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Schumer explained her unique genetic makeup affects her medication tolerance: “I have this gene, GDF15, which makes you extremely prone to nausea, which is why I was so sick during my pregnancy.”

Her previous experience with weight loss medication resulted in dramatic but unsustainable results. “I was, like, vomiting — and then you have no energy. But other people take it and they're all good. God bless them.” While she “lost 30 pounds so quick” and “looked great,” the severe side effects made daily activities impossible, as she couldn't “lift [her] head off the pillow.”

This challenging experience reinforced Schumer's commitment to honesty about celebrity health journeys. She has consistently advocated for transparency in Hollywood, previously calling out celebrities who fail to disclose the truth about their cosmetic procedures or weight loss methods.

“You are on Ozempic or one of those things or you got work done. Just stop,” she stated during a 2023 appearance on “Watch What Happens Live.” Her philosophy is to be real: “Be real with the people. When I got lipo, I said I got lipo.”

“Dancing with the Stars” alum Kendra Wilkinson is putting her love life on the back burner and focusing on her family and real estate career. The former “Girls Next Door” star, 40, shared on her Instagram story that she's not currently interested in dating.

“I don't have interest in men at the moment. Just work. Thank you for supporting my business,” Wilkinson wrote, alongside a beachside photo taken in Southern California, according to Us Weekly. 

Wilkinson, who competed on season 12 of “Dancing with the Stars” and is now a licensed real estate agent, also encouraged fans to refer potential clients her way. “You can support me by referring me to friends who are looking into moving,” she added.

The update comes after Wilkinson previously told Us Weekly in late 2024 that she wanted to find a “husband or boyfriend” and leave “boy toy land” behind. At the time, she joked, “I think I'm gonna crawl up from the dead here soon and look for this man of mine.”

By early 2025, however, Wilkinson admitted she was happy being alone and enjoyed her independence, though she remained open to love. “Am I happy as f— right now being alone? F— yeah,” she said in February. She added that her children — son Hank IV, 15, and daughter Alijah, 11 — and her real estate career are her top priorities.

“I'm still in real estate right now and doing a great job,” she said. “I feel confident I will find love again… but the best version of Kendra is here right now.”

A post shared by Kendra Wilkinson (@kendrawilkinson)

In a June interview with Fox News Digital, Wilkinson revealed her biggest regret: not launching her real estate career during her time living at the Playboy Mansion.

“I was surrounded by everyone — every celebrity, every billionaire,” she said, reflecting on missed opportunities while living with Hugh Hefner from 2004 to 2009.

Wilkinson began her real estate career in 2020, earned her license, and landed a job at The Agency before later moving to Douglas Elliman. She also starred in “Kendra Sells Hollywood”, a Discovery+ reality series that ran for two seasons.

Though she briefly announced she was leaving the industry in 2023, she later walked it back, saying the post came after a particularly difficult day. “I made a huge mistake,” she told People, confirming she was back in the field and juggling several deals.

A post shared by Kendra Wilkinson (@kendrawilkinson)

Wilkinson has been open about her mental health struggles following her 2018 divorce from Hank Baskett, per reports. After being hospitalized in 2023 due to a panic attack, she credited her recovery to a team of doctors and therapists.

“I was dying of depression,” she told People, recalling that she was later prescribed medication and began therapy. Today, she says she's focused on staying healthy and raising her kids. “I feel good, and I'm smiling,” she told Fox News Digital. “I never want to take my smile for granted.”

James Gunn's DC Studios reset “Superman” is flying toward a potential $150 million weekend debut at the box office, with $22 million already in the bank from Thursday previews. But now that we've finally seen it, IndieWire's “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio are here to debate the movie, which swaps Henry Cavill for newcomer David Corenswet as the kryptonite-averse hero who also goes by Clark Kent. (Read David Ehrlich's IndieWire review here.)

Anne was in New York this week to join Ryan in-studio at the IndieWire offices to discuss the movie and more, Ryan having just seen it at the Regal Times Square during the first afternoon 2 p.m. public screening. While Anne enjoyed the screwball-romantic chemistry between Corenswet and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” breakout Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Ryan loathed the experience and found it to be another serving of superhero slop as depressing as any other (despite some winky, cheeky banter). Like other superhero tentpoles before it, Gunn's new “Superman” descends into a 45-minute maelstrom of CGI nonsense, yet another good-vs.-evil battle that crosses times and dimensions and may be easy to follow (at least compared to other Marvel or DC final battles) but is ultimately hard to care about or invest in.

Corenswet is plenty handsome and charming as the character originated on the big screen by Christopher Reeve and created in the comics by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. But the fact is no Superman movie has been as good as Richard Donner's 1978 take, which Anne and Ryan can both agree on. (Same goes for another summer tentpole, “Jurassic World Rebirth,” another franchise wherein the first movie was the only true great one.) This “Superman” movie's message of good prevailing over evil grew tiresome for Ryan, but then again, what possible psychological nuance were we expecting from a fun-in-the-sun summer blockbuster? He felt exhausted and defeated, whereas Anne found things to like about what's going to be one of the season's biggest films, the casting especially.

 










Later in the episode, and since we took a break for Fourth of July, we finally parse the New York Times' list of the 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century, crowned by Bong Joon Ho's historic Best Picture winner “Parasite” at #1. We factor in some recency bias for that choice — though we aren't denying it's a fantastic film — as well as its timely take on class disparity that is strongly resonating in America today. (The Times' list of 500 participants included no film critics.) We offer up our own favorites, which veer wildly, though we both agree “No Country for Old Men” (#6 on the Times' list) is a lock for any best-of-century Top 10. (Also check out IndieWire's best films of the 2020s, which published earlier in June.)

Elsewhere, we take a look at new TV series including “Dept. Q,” a British crime thriller on Netflix from Scott Frank and Chandni Lakhani that Anne loves. Ryan, however, raves about “Girls” creator Lena Dunham's return to TV with “Too Much,” starring Megan Stalter as a Dunham-adjacent who moves to London and falls in with a quote-unquote bad boy (Will Sharpe) after a bad breakup. It's as much a send-up of millennial culture as it is a tribute to the great British romantic comedies of the '90s and aughts, like “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones's Diary.”

Writer/director Christian Swegal's “Sovereign” dramatizes the true story of the final days of sovereign citizens Jerry and Joe Kane before their 2010 flight from law enforcement ended in a violent exchange of gunfire. The film fits thematically into a cinematic continuum with recent releases like “Civil War” and “Warfare,” exploring the complexities of American life and belief systems at a time of heightened tribalism. But for fans of its star Nick Offerman, Jerry Kane also aligns with a handful of other roles — including in “Civil War”, where he played the President — where the outspoken progressive has portrayed characters with conservative or extreme right-wing ideologies.

Of course, Offerman is best known for playing Libertarian Ron Swanson for seven seasons on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation.” But the juxtaposition between — and conflation of — the actor's personal and professional lives has only grown more complicated since the show went off the air, not only offering Offerman more of these roles in both TV and film but forcing him to defend the highly meme-able Swanson from being co-opted by people with views the character would vociferously not share. Recently, for example, he felt compelled to respond to a post by Michael Flynn Jr., son of retired Lieutenant General and former Presidential candidate Michael Flynn, after he used a gif of Offerman as Ron to express criticism about Pride month.

 










Gathering in the long shadow of Swanson, this crop of (distantly) similar performances, including in HBO's “The Last of Us,” Ava DuVernay's “Origin,” Craig Gillespie's “Dumb Money,” and this summer's “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” evidences the actor's aptitude for inhabiting characters like these with a complexity that belies the great divide between their values and his own. Ahead of the July 11 release of “Sovereign,” Offerman spoke to IndieWire via Zoom about the opportunities he's been given as a result of being identified on screen with conservative roles, while maintaining an active and public role as a champion of liberal causes.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

IndieWire: “Sovereign” presents Jerry's belief system subtly, almost seductively. What, if anything, was the core quality that you zeroed in on when you started to build your performance?

Nick Offerman: In this time in our society … we're so divided, people are so emotionally biased, based in some part on misinformation. To see this really sympathetic portrayal of these victims of this kind of misinformation, and victims of the way our government is exclusionary toward the working class, like the way a family can end up homeless if you just roll the dice in the wrong way with your mortgage or medical bills, I said to my agent, “I think I have to do this movie.” Because my beliefs are sincerely rooted in a flawed human's attempts at decency — with equality for all, and discriminating against no one. And even the people who are actually running the country right now, telling us that the floodwaters stopped rising because of prayer, even those people, I want them to be healthy, and happy, and have good, productive lives. That's the marked difference, I think, in my political ideology, is there are a group of people who want everyone to have the same dignity and rights to life — even the assholes.

 










It's disappointing to think that philosophy is considered transgressive these days.

In wanting to be part of the medicinal force that is the arts, to use what powers I may or may not have in storytelling, when I finished reading the script, it made me think about the January 6 rioters … sure there are a lot of actual Nazis, but there are also a lot of Trump voters that are very good citizens who are getting bad information. And people are using our broken system for their profit, to such an extent that I feel like this film is an honest portrayal to humanize that struggle that people undergo.

You compassionately describe Jerry and Joe as victims. But he increasingly uses these philosophical beliefs to validate his own shortcomings. How do you draw the line where his victimhood ends and his culpability begins?

Christian [Swegal] grew up with a Sovereign citizen in his family. The movie is inspired by the true story of Jerry and Joe Kane, but there are scenes drawn from Christian's own experience as well. He's done such a beautiful job of embroidering the two together, and I remember specifically saying to him, at a certain point, “How do I justify Jerry? Is he a charlatan? Is he a mountebank? And how much of this is belief?” And he said, “In the case of people who take these ideologies to the mat — who literally die on these hills — they often cross the line into mental illness.” And that is the case with Jerry, that he got around to the delusional sensibility that these things are true, and that he is a victim who will defeat the government that is duping all the rest of us.

 










That was completely necessary for me to hear from the writer/director. It made sense. And again, it brings up the very interesting conundrum in our country, that religion is being leaned on so heavily in the public arena where we're officially not supposed to have religion. We're supposed to all get together and make our government without the church impinging upon the state, but nonetheless, so much legislation and so much policy. Again, it brings me back to what's going on in Texas right now: Somehow when our elected leaders fail, they somehow continue to get a pass time after time by saying, “I know you elected me to do this job, but I happen to be on vacation, so speak to God. That's what I do.”

Their constituents are out of luck.

For Jerry, Christianity is part of his ideology, but I think it's all part of a larger scapegoating that human weakness is susceptible to, where it's like, “Well, it can't be me in my failings. It has to be the government. It has to be God's plan.”

You are outspoken as a progressive on social media. But you have certainly in recent years taken on roles that fall into a similar wheelhouse as this. Is there a commonality, or a psychology that you've identified in some of these more right-wing, reactive characters that has helped you dial into them so effectively?
 










I've been asked this a couple of times recently, when I played the president in Alex Garland's “Civil War.” I am a well-fed, middle-aged white guy who went to college, so, sadly, there are a lot of roles for me, both in the protagonist and villain categories. I don't seek out anything in this particular wheelhouse. I don't feel like I have a bailiwick. Or if it is, it may include roles of this ilk, but also plumbers, lumberjacks, dads, farmers. But to think about why people continue to want to see me in this, I don't know the answer to that because I'm not the discerning eye choosing me.

But I do know that I'm grateful to be given the opportunity, because the mistakes of our civilization are so frustrating on a daily basis. We're just sprinting to hell in a handbasket at the moment. We're literally despoiling our public lands. I mean, just as fast as they can hand over the work of our hands to billionaire oligarchs is just really frustrating. And the way that I don't go on a killing spree, or go burn someone's building down, or blow up a bunch of embarrassing Cybertrucks, is to say, “OK, look at my next script.” When I tour your town and I sing a song about maybe we shouldn't be discriminatory to others, if I only sway one person, it's so worth it to me. And that's how I maintain my sanity. And so I feel like, if somehow because I played Ron Swanson, I can bring eyeballs to a project that wouldn't necessarily otherwise be there, maybe just slowly, that's part of the erosion of the bigotry in this country.

 










I imagine many of those downstream opportunities came as a result of your success playing Ron. It must be frustrating to see people co-opt him in contexts that contradict his values, much less yours.

Ron Swanson, a wonderful creation from much more brilliant minds than my own, people hold up for the wrong reasons, and take their own reading of this true Libertarian who was cool with everybody. And they somehow say, “Well, he had a shotgun, so he must be one of us.” Like, dumb people insist that Ron Swanson would've voted for Trump. And I don't deign to answer myself. I take it to Mike Schur, the main creator of Ron, and he said, “Swanson would've despised Trump, because Ron loved capitalism. And Trump made the stupidest move you could make as a capitalist, which is to go into public service.” He would think he's an absolute idiot. He would also despise him because he's disrespectful to women and many others. And that's just an example of all the people and value sets that Ron would despise, because Ron is a good person.

How, then, do you link your own beliefs with the roles you choose and work you do?

I enter into every conversation with fallibility. I don't know everything, or near an approximation of it, which is why I remain curious. There are groups of people who are being bombed, and we're sending people money and bombs so that they can kill other people's children. I want to side with the children. I approach every issue with that sensibility. When Zelensky came to the White House, this guy who's a sitcom star who became the leader of Ukraine just unmanned our President and our Vice President. He made them look like simpering schoolboys, just by exhibiting the values that we Americans purport to espouse. All he did was behave with character and allow them to completely humiliate themselves on such a public stage.

 










By doing a film like [“Sovereign”], I just recognized the value in trying to examine the humanity of all of these people, including the shitty people running our country. I invite people to look at them and say, “Do you really think they are interested in taking care of you, and the good of our communities? Is that really what Elon is after?”

You express such gratitude for these opportunities, but professionally speaking, is that success ever for you a double-edged sword in going, “As good as I am at doing this, I might like to play somebody who's maybe more openly a little more progressive than some of these characters?”

I'm over the moon with people who are really receiving [“Sovereign”] generously. But it kind of makes me pull my hair out that a lot of people's reviews open with “Nick Offerman takes Ron Swanson completely to…” Fill in the blank, as though my entire career is some variation on the theme of Ron Swanson. I know actors that have worse problems than that. But the interesting thing is, and part of my gratitude is founded upon the fact that I'm not Ryan Gosling. I don't have my pick of all of the things that are going on. I'm not a top-tier talent according to the business. I am so grateful that I keep getting material that I am inspired by. I never am made to take a job in order to pay my mortgage, where I'm like, “Well, this is just a good medium superhero thing.” I don't have to do that. Because I base my choices on good writing, I'm confident that it's not going to hurt me. So I feel so lucky I keep getting these really plum roles.

 










I took [MSNBC anchor] Lawrence O'Donnell to see the premiere [of “Sovereign”] at the Tribeca Film Festival, because as I suspected, he was over the moon about the film. And so gratifyingly, he said that he sees it in the sequence of “Civil War,” “Warfare,” and then this movie. And he said, “It's trying to do the same thing.” To be part of that conversation, and to be in something that Lawrence thinks was a good job, that's all the approbation I need, where I'm like, “OK, great. For better or worse, for whatever faults I have in my personal life, I feel like I'm making the right choices, as far as being part of the medicinal side of storytelling.”

At a very tribal time, you've navigated a narrow line between being publicly open about your political beliefs and working across a broad spectrum of roles. Does it become difficult to assess when the time is right for you to speak out about something?

Social media used to be a lot of fun. I mean, I met one of the greatest friends of my life, James Rebanks and his family, and we own a beef herd together in England. And now, basically since Trump arrived, and the MAGA sensibility, where people use social media to troll and for violence of many colors, I feel like it's an exercise in futility. I feel like if I'm loud on social media, it's preaching to the choir. So I'm going to continue to fill my work with my ideology, either overtly or indirectly, like playing a MAGA plumber in “Origin” or whatever.

 










I do very much curb myself, and I generally will only get loud on social media, [like] in the case of that thing recently with Michael Flynn Jr., where it was using my image and my character for hate. I'm going to say something about that. But even that, it's just dumb, because a troll like that guy, that's all he wants to do is use my platform to create clickbait and get more people signed on to take his supplements.

One of the things that you've been extraordinarily good at in your roles is presenting what appears to be a very traditional kind of masculinity, and then subverting it. You were very quick to credit Mike Schur about Ron Swanson's reaction to Trump, but do you feel like you're able to take any credit for that subversion, even if it's just in choosing the roles?

I don't feel like I need to take any credit, per se. The arc of my own messaging was so exponentially serviced by my big break in the role of Ron Swanson, where suddenly I was invited to colleges to perform my stand-up, which was not something I did. I was a theater actor. I wasn't a comedian. But I am really thrilled at the opportunity to go speak to thousands of college students, so I began to write material and then I began to write books. And here I am putting my sixth book out this fall. What I had to learn, and I think what any successful human has to learn, is that what you have is good enough. Who I am is good enough, warts and all. If anybody has been moved by my writing, it's a fucking miracle. But the fact that I can bring my shovel to the campaign of these great artists who make these shows. I know that I'm never going to create a TV series, but I'm so grateful that I can be of service to the incredible talents that do.

 










I feel like that gratitude and humility, again, are both these kinds of “traditional” masculine traits.

So it's funny, I never realized before I got cast as Ron Swanson that I would be accused of masculinity. I knew I was a guy, I was a carpenter, I was an athlete, and I am built in a certain way. But suddenly, people were like, “Speak to us as the paragon of masculinity. What are your thoughts?” And I was like, “Oh, fuck. I didn't realize I would somehow become the default, the go-to guy.” And so I looked around and said, “Well, I think, forget John Wayne. I think boys can make cupcakes and girls can swing a hammer.” But I think what you're looking at as masculinity, in a lot of ways, is just character or decency that everyone should aspire to. And in terms of masculine traits versus feminine, sure, if you want to be a protector, then do it with decency and with empathy. Try to hug someone before you punch them, is my policy.

“Sovereign” is now playing in select theaters.

George Lucas has been to the Met Gala, but he's never been to San Diego Comic-Con before. That's about to change, as an appearance for the “Star Wars” creator at the annual gathering has been announced for the forthcoming edition.

Lucas's appearance will take place on Sunday, July 27, in Hall H, and he'll be joined by director Guillermo del Toro and legendary Oscar-winning Lucasfilm Senior Vice President and Executive Design Director Doug Chiang for a conversation moderated by Queen Latifah. The panel will discuss Lucas's ultimate passion project, his forthcoming Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which will open in Los Angeles's Exposition Park in 2026.

The museum will feature Lucas's personal collection of work from story-focused artists such as N.C. Wyeth, Norman Rockwell, Frida Kahlo, and Beatrix Potter, as well as comic book artists Alison Bechdel and R. Crumb, and photographers Gordon Parks, Dorothea Lange, and Henri Cartier-Bresson. It will also house the Lucas Archive, with props and models from Lucas's filmmaking career.

 










It's easy to see how that intersection of media to power storytelling would fascinate mixed-media legend del Toro, and certainly Chiang. He won an Oscar as a visual effects supervisor on “Death Becomes Her.” In 1995, Lucas hired Chiang to oversee the look of the entire prequel trilogy to come, and he's stayed on with Lucasfilm even after its sale to Disney to shape and curate the look of “Star Wars” ever since. No one artist since Ralph McQuarrie has done more to shape the look of the franchise.

This panel will also be a remarkable full-circle moment: Yes, Lucas has never appeared at San Diego Comic-Con before. But “Star Wars” helped put San Diego Comic-Con on the map. Legendary publicist Charles Lippincott brought promotional materials for the original “Star Wars” film to Comic-Con in 1976, almost a full year before the film was released. Howard Chaykin's iconic “Star Wars” poster was on display then, and Lucasfilm told attendees a lot about what the film would be. They were not averse to major spoilers in those days: In fact, the novelization of “Star Wars” by Alan Dean Foster in December 1976, almost six months before the film came out.

David Glanzer, chief communications and strategy officer of Comic-Con, said in a statement: “We are beyond thrilled to welcome George Lucas to Comic-Con for the very first time. Nearly five decades ago, ‘Star Wars' made one of its earliest public appearances at our convention, along with a booth featuring Howard Chaykin's now legendary ‘Star Wars' poster as a promotional item. Now, to have Mr. Lucas return — this time to debut the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art — is a true full-circle moment. His lifelong dedication to visual storytelling and world-building resonates deeply with us and our community, and the museum's mission to celebrate narrative art in all its forms perfectly reflects what Comic-Con has championed from the very beginning.”

A film told from the rose-colored binoculars of an inquisitive child's perspective would never work without a strong child actor to anchor it. Enter Lexi Venter, the first-time performer Embeth Davidtz discovered for her feature debut, “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight,” an adaptation of Alexandra Fuller's 2001 memoir of a hardscrabble life as the youngest of a white Zimbabwean family living in civil-war-torn Rhodesia in the 1980s.

Davidtz told IndieWire she needed “a wild, untrained, feral, spontaneous creature” for her lead, and after working with a casting director who scouts for child reality could-be stars, she found Venter, who is a true revelation as Bobo. (As tired a prescriptive cliche as “revelation” may be to criticism around a debut actor.) Venter's performance, with a wild-eyedness that both captures Bobo's naivete as well as the fact that she has grown up too fast and seen all too much, is the emotional anchor of Davidtz's personal tale.

The “Schindler's List,” “Matilda,” and “Mad Men” star moved to South Africa around the same age as Bobo/Fuller, similarly observing casual and not-so-casual racism and violence as farm girl Bobo does in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Davidtz approaches the material not from an ethnographic or anthropological vantage — she's now, of course, a privileged woman who's brushed with Hollywood — but an eye-level emotional clarity. Despite its tongue-twister of a title, “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” is never confused on its journey toward an emotional impact.

 










As Fuller's award-winning memoir exists as a collection of memories, so too does the film “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” unfold impressionistically, Bobo catching observations of her prejudiced, alcoholic mother Nicola (Davidtz) and distant, soldier father Tim (Rob Van Vuuren) through gauzy curtains, under tables and bedsheets, the adults around her looming tall from her tiny frame of view. 

Free-flowing “Days of Heaven”-esque narration courtesy of Fuller's text is read by Vinter in voiceover, occasionally muddling whether the words are supposed to be from Bobo as a young girl (Venter is seven years old) or an older, wiser Fuller. It's a poetic, if disorienting, swirl of both. At one point, Bobo spies Nicola and Tim having giddy, delirious sex after he's returned from the hazardous bush, where he's been gunning down guerrilla fighters (“they're laughing and drinking brandy while moving furniture with their clothes off”). At another, after her father has left the farm yet again without saying goodbye, she realizes, “We are women without men now, which is a bad state of affairs.”

Bobo, disheveled and barefoot with unkempt hair, runs amok on the family's dilapidated Rhodesian grounds, cinematographer Willie Nel's camera keeping close behind her or even inhabiting her viewpoint. The film has a restless energy to match, with a rock soundtrack and a searching, handheld lens that goes  as in and out of focus as Bobo's grasp on her world does. 

 










Nicola, meanwhile, sleeps with an assault rifle when she's not dazed in a hangover after another night (or early afternoon) of heavy boozing, and her mother's racist vitriol toward the servants on the farm and lingerers around it are ones Bobo copies back to the one she's closest to, Sarah (Zikhona Bali). Davidtz's observations about how racism is often hereditary are the throughline that makes “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” a movie about children but not necessarily for them. Though rooting that intention in the eyes of a white child threatens to come at the dismissal of the Black Africans more directly affected.

Meanwhile, Bobo's older sister Vanessa (Anina Reed) is subject to the leering eyes and grabby hands of white men in the Rhodesian outpost, where raucous dance nights send Nicola drunkenly, coquettishly twirling into the arms of others while her husband is away, her children left dangerously to fend for themselves. Davidtz's performance is raw-emotioned — the strain of having only three hours a day for production in South Africa due to child labor restrictions (per Anne Thompson's IndieWire reporting) might have inadvertently made for a more distressed turn in front of the camera, and it's effective. What's fascinating about “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” being told from a child's eye is how that very eye never renders the adults in more childlike terms: Bobo sees and understands these people as an adult would.

 










Hovering on the horizon is the impending election that would turn Rhodesia into Zimbabwe, as African nationalists attempted to distance themselves from white colonial rule. With that tidal wave of a change is the inevitability that Tim will sell their farm. Davidtz's film ends where Fuller's memoir continued — what happened to her family after they left Rhodesia/Zimbabwe for East Africa — less limiting the perspective than whittling the material down to a workable, sizable story. The grand takeaway is Venter's astonishing turn. That kid's got a future, and it began with a filmmaker who knew how to direct her: with patient energy while also encouraging the freedom to play and seek and explore as Bobo does within her little big world.

“Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” opens from Sony Pictures Classics on Friday, July 11.

	Remember that old fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Princess and the Pea”? 


	Whether you're watching an animated retelling, reading the backstory of a limited edition Barbie doll, or streaming a bootleg version of the musical that once starred Sarah Jessica Parker, the story remains pretty consistent. To test if she's truly royalty — and worthy of marriage to a prince — a princess is given a bed heaped with a pile of mattresses. Secretly, her doubters place a single pea under the mattress on the bottom. When morning arrives and she tells her hosts that she was kept awake by an uncomfortable lump, it's taken as proof that she has the delicate senses of a true princess. While people on TikTok aren't conducting psychological sleep experiments on each other in the name of a monarchical system, they are making it clear that their dating sensibilities are just as delicate with the latest phrase du jour on the app: princess treatment. And as the discourse around it keeps stacking up, what started as a silly turn of phrase has devolved into an incomprehensible mess that's preventing people from noticing the much more insidious shift around them. 

	











	Online, the term “princess treatment” means above and beyond handling in a relationship setting. But what internet users can't seem to agree on is its application — what's anniversary behavior for one couple might be an average Tuesday for another . Enter the “bare minimum vs princess treatment” trend, a challenge where women ask their significant other where a particular task might land for them. The scenarios range from filling up a girlfriend's gas tank or giving her your jacket when she's cold to carrying her when her feet hurt or never letting her touch a door handle. Calling something “princess treatment” implies that it's an over-the-top request. If the girlfriend doesn't agree with their boyfriend, the men in question get an instant blast of water to the face.

EVERYTHING is the bare minimum 😤 ib: @Colton Connelly #andyandmichelle 

We just had to participate in this trend 😂😂 #bareminimum #princesstreatment #husbandandwife #marriagehumor #relationship #trend #fyp #couplecomedy #foryoupage 


	In addition to the sheer fun some women have with dousing their significant others with a garden hose, the trend has been characterized by countless disagreements in the comments section over what kind of treatment makes for a good relationship. But when housewife and content creator Courtney Palmer posted a video explaining her husband's princess treatment, what people managed to agree upon was that her video took the idea to an entirely new level. 


	“If I am at a restaurant with my husband, I do not talk to the hostess, I do not open any doors, and I do not order my food,” Palmer said in a video describing a typical date night. “I want him to order for me. I like when he orders for me. It's not that I'm not capable of ordering for myself, it's just a fun princess treatment sort of thing.” Palmer's video describing how she typically avoids eye contact with service staff, relying on her husband to speak for her, drew the ire of followers and a wave of comments calling the behavior problematic. “Me when I'm a prisoner,” read one comment. “It's giving cult or hostage situation,” said another. “They be like ‘princess treatment' but it's medieval times and you're locked in a castle.” 

I thought this was like a joke or like an aesthetic 🌸 #tradwife #princesstreament #comedy 

The princess treatment epidemic MUST be stopped! #princesstreatment #tradwives #tradwife #comedy 

Stand up 


	There were parodies aplenty, many from service workers and restaurant–themed accounts focused on how disconcerting a lack of eye contact would be during a shift. But the prevalent commentary was about the link between the seemingly controlling nature of Palmer's husband and the growing popularity of trad wife content creators. Trad wives — women who prioritize traditional gender roles and often project old-school fantasies of staying home with the kids, returning to the land, home cooking, and serving their husband — have played an outsized role on the internet in the past few years, marking the rise of conservative presences in digital spaces. These women, like Hannah Neeleman of Ballerina Farm, or even cooking creator Nara Smith, gain millions of followers by posting content themed around household management, from-scratch cooking, and child rearing — carefully noting that it's their personal choice while encouraging others to lean into their own divine feminine impulses.

	While everyone is decrying the death of feminism in Palmer's comments, she's raking in the cash. Posting about princess treatment isn't declaring what kind of feminist you are. It's a way to get attention — and its working. In an interview with People, she said she gained close to 24,000 followers from the success of the princess treatment video, which on its own received close to 4.5 million views. “Your softness isn't giving anyone control over you. It's giving a partner space to lead with that strength,” Palmer told People. “When I'm leaning into my grace, I invite him to rise as that protector, a provider, a partner, because that's what he wants to do. It works in a perfect balance and becomes that effortless, graceful, calm, peaceful lifestyle.”

	While people are patting each other on the back in Palmer's comments for being able to recognize red flags from a marriage influencer, what they're not realizing is that there's far more nebulous patterns slipping completely under the radar. Palmer's princess treatment video is simply the final boss of a TikTok practically terraformed by girl content. There's girl dinner, girl math, viral “we were girls together” sounds, the “looking for a man in finance” trend — all predicated on the underlying assumption that women need to be taken care of, protected, and are incapable of deep thought. 


	If you look at the comments on the “bare minimum vs princess treatment” challenges, the large majority jokingly side with the girlfriends, saying that women are in need of gentle treatment and pampering. And beyond the viral jokes littering Palmer's comments are thousands of seemingly serious comments calling her video just an example of how leaning into feminine roles can be self care. It's not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time that the Stanford Prison Experiment redux known as Love Island USA is streaming — where the biggest crime you can accuse someone of is not being “a girl's girl.” There's no good way to have subtle conversations around feminism online. But that doesn't mean princess treatment isn't important. The rise in trad wife popularity is occurring at the same time as a serious attack on reproductive rights in the United States. Calling out misogynistic content matters. But what the reaction to Palmer's video is showing that when posters take the fight to a singular comment section without challenging the patterns underneath it — everything stays the same.

Let's start with the facts. 

Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old practice of spraying tiny particles into a rain cloud in the hope of pushing it to rain or snow just a little more. It's used in nine states, mostly to fight droughts that can hurt farmers, community water supplies and even some factories. No one knows whether it actually works.

It's important to lay this information out up front because one of the unfortunate aspects of writing about conspiracy theories is that people tend to remember the claims but not the facts that they're false. It helps to start with the truth.

You're going to hear a lot about cloud seeding in the next few days. Much of it won't be factual.

That's because a loose group of online conspiracy theorists have latched onto cloud seeding as an explanation for the devastating Texas floods. As a longtime reporter, I might say something like ""there is no evidence for this claim"" or cite some higher authority to say it's not true. But this is an opinion column, so I'm going to just come out and say it: This is bonkers.

I'm going to just come out and say it: This is bonkers.

As I said at the beginning, no one knows whether cloud seeding even works. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in December found that studies of how much additional rain it produces ""ranged from 0 to 20 percent."" That's because clouds aren't like hamsters that you can set loose in a maze; they are incredibly complex natural phenomena. You can't just seed one cloud and not another cloud and measure how much rain came out because of seeding.

Even if the outliers are correct and cloud seeding can increase precipitation by as much as one-fifth, that would still not be enough to account for the 15 inches of rain that fell in Texas on July 3, more than double what had been forecast a day earlier. The cloud seeding that online theorists have seized on involved 70 grams of silver iodide sprayed into a cloud more than 100 miles away two days earlier, according to The Washington Post. They might as well blame a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil.

Nevertheless, the theory gained ground after it was cited by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., GOP House candidate Kandiss Taylor and former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. Greene even proposed a national cloud seeding ban. 

In what appears to have been an effort to combat the misinformation, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted online resources explaining the science behind cloud seeding, geoengineering and even the condensation trails left by planes flying at high altitudes. This is commendable. 

But unfortunately, the administration's rhetoric isn't well-suited for this kind of debunking. 

""Americans have questions about geoengineering and contrails,"" Zeldin wrote on X. ""They expect honesty and transparency from their government when seeking answers. For years, people who asked questions in good faith were dismissed, even vilified by the media and their own government. This ends today.""

That is the kind of tweet that you would write before claiming there's an invisible map to secret treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence. It's not what you write to promote a sober fact-check.

Remember when I started with the facts at the top of this column? That was because people who study conspiracy theories have found that it helps to use a ""truth sandwich"" that begins and ends with the facts, rather than highlight the conspiracy theories first and then rebut them. Unfortunately, the webpage that Zeldin promoted doesn't take that approach.

Noting that there have been ""myths and misconceptions"" about contrails for decades, the EPA site says it ""addresses head-on various claims that these occurrences are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather.""

It would have been better if the EPA started off by citing some facts, then noted that there have been conspiracy theories about it (without repeating the spurious claims) and then went back through the facts again. But saying that you're going to address the claims without actually addressing them right then and there is an invitation to misreading. 

The underlying problem is that Trump likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. 

The underlying problem here is that Zeldin's boss, President Donald Trump, likes to toy with conspiracy theories for political benefit. Over the years, he has made spurious claims about Barack Obama's birthplace, liberal donor George Soros, climate change and vaccines and cozied up to those who argue that there's a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who control the government.

Trump's words have helped foster an environment in which conspiracy theories flourish and even a government agency trying to debunk obvious misinformation hems and haws. Instead of just stating the truth, the leader of that government agency lionizes the conspiracy theorists as virtuous Americans who were targeted by an unnamed enemy, and he repeats their wildest claims. 

I don't know what to say about that, except to complete the truth sandwich by repeating the facts that I began with: Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old practice, used in nine states, to encourage precipitation. It may or may not even work, and it was definitely not the reason it flooded in Texas.

            A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to US drug trafficking charges. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to enter a plea deal.
    


            Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the United States.
    


            As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.
    


            Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed.
    


            Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed.
    


            Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal.
    


            Guzman Lopez's sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with US authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement.
    


            Lichtman said he didn't know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.”
    


            “Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said.
    


US prosecutors won't seek death penalty for son of Mexican drug cartel leader ‘El Chapo'



            Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.”
    


            “In this way, he has some control over who he's cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”
    


            Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the US government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.”
    


            “This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that's what they get from his cooperation.”
    


Relatives of El Chapo enter US as part of ‘negotiation,' Mexico's security secretary says



            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the US government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders.
    


Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel.
    


            Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea.
    


            Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the US on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.

Career diplomats and other staff begin receiving notices amid Trump administration cull of about 15% of workforce

US politics – live updates

The US state department has begun issuing the first of more than 1,350 termination notices as part of a huge reorganisation of America's diplomatic corps under the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, according to internal documents and US diplomats at the state department on Friday.

Career diplomats and other staff began to receive the notices on Friday morning, days after the supreme court lifted a ban on the Trump administration moving forward with mass firings of government employees that will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

“Hearing ‘I got mine!' around the floor,” one current state department employee told the Guardian.

In an internal email obtained by the Guardian on Friday, state department workers were told that nearly 3,000 employees would leave as part of a vast reorganisation meant to align the department's goals with Donald Trump's stated goal of putting America first.

“This [Reduction in Force] comprises 1,107 civil service and 246 Foreign Service employees with domestic assignments,” read the email. Another 1,600 employees are believed to have left the service via a voluntary redundancy scheme in recent months.

The state department had confirmed on Thursday that it planned to move forward with the layoffs.

The cull of approximately 15% of the state department workforce is unprecedented for the diplomatic corps, and confusion over the process as well as the temporary court injunction against mass firings of government employees have made the rollout even more chaotic.

“At a moment of great global instability – with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order – the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,” said a statement from the American Foreign Service Association, a professional group that represents US diplomats. “We oppose this decision in the strongest terms.”

“Morale has been rock-bottom since they announced [the reorganisation],” one US diplomat told the Guardian. “I think for some people the fact it is finally happening is a relief but it's awful,” the person added.

Some advocacy groups reported that the state department was unable to process the hundreds of RIFs simultaneously due to the limitations of internal systems.

“The state department has apparently encountered a problem with the RIF software that caps the number of emails that can be sent out at a time, so rather than one big RIF at 10.30am tomorrow, we may see ‘Rolling RIFs' throughout the day,” wrote Karl Stoltz, co-president of the Public Diplomacy Council of America, in an email to members.

A senior state department official said: “This is simply not true. Email systems always take time to roll these out, and the timeline has been consistent with expectations. We did not have plans for one big email blast at a specific time, and did not indicate any such time to the workforce.”

Members of the PDCA and other groups that support federal employees were expected to meet at the state department at 4pm on Friday in order to “clap out” employees who had received RIFs and to “protest the department's actions”.

A senior state department official on Thursday told journalists that the department was “going to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees and foreign service officers and civil servants who are affected by this.

“It's not easy for anyone,” the official said.

The layoffs were also criticised by Democratic senators, who said that the administration's decision “undermines our national security”.

“While there are targeted reforms that our government can pursue to maximize the impact of every tax dollar, that's not what this is,” read the statement, which was co-signed by 10 Democratic senators, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the US Senate foreign relations committee.

“There are active conflicts and humanitarian crises in Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza, Haiti and Myanmar – to name a few. Now is the time to strengthen our diplomatic hand, not weaken it. From pursuing peaceful resolutions to out-competing China diplomatically and economically, we can't afford to not have experienced diplomats at the table.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Bitcoin's new record lifts industry stocks ahead of ‘Crypto Week' in Washington","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-stocks-regulatory-optimism/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:55:27 GMT","

Regulatory clarity could encourage more companies to adopt bitcoin in their treasury strategies, analysts said.EDGAR SU/Reuters

U.S.-listed crypto stocks jumped on Friday as bitcoin surged to a record high in the run-up to a landmark week that could cement policy wins for the crypto industry.

Starting July 14, the House of Representatives will debate three major crypto bills that are likely to provide the industry the regulatory framework in the U.S. that it has long demanded.

The lawmakers will discuss the Genius Act, the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act during the “Crypto Week,” amid growing bets that the industry's strained ties with Washington is beginning to thaw.

This is a sharp reversal of fortune for a sector that had once threatened to flee offshore, citing a hostile environment and heavy-handed enforcement in the U.S.

“We expect capital that was previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty to re-enter,” said Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex. “Even if final passage stalls, the optics of legislative engagement are bullish.”

Bitcoin rallies to more highs on rising demand, friendly policies from Trump administration

Regulatory clarity could encourage more companies to adopt bitcoin in their treasury strategies, analysts said, similar to firms such as Strategy, which has accumulated the cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value.

“We're seeing bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance-sheet asset,” said Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen.

Bitcoin's surge has triggered a broader rally in the crypto market, with strong and sustained inflows into the related spot exchange-traded funds driving prices higher, he said.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was last up 4 per cent at US$118,071.19, taking its gains for the year to 26 per cent. The digital asset has surged nearly 41 per cent in the last three months.

Bitcoin buyer and holder Strategy rose 3.8 per cent, while crypto miners Riot Platforms, Hut 8 and Mara Holdings gained between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent.

“Investors are racing to take positions ahead of the extra publicity this event could attract,” said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, referring to the Crypto Week.

Rising confidence in bitcoin is now resulting in investors chasing higher returns in smaller tokens. Ether, the second-largest token, was last up 6.5 per cent, while XRP and Solana gained 12 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

The sector's total market value has swelled to about US$3.7-trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin's sharp rally has also drawn caution from some corners of the market.

As crypto gets embedded in the traditional financial system, some analysts warned the hype may be outpacing reality, as it starts to displace gold as the preferred hedge against equities.

“The (regulatory) backdrop has supported prices and attention has turned to bitcoin's role in portfolios, with some likening the crypto-asset to 'digital gold'. This moniker is likely premature,” said Dirk Willer, Citi's global head of macro, asset allocation and emerging market strategy.

With likely volatility ahead, some analysts have cautioned investors to pause and weigh their time horizons before jumping in.

“It's hard not to be optimistic about bitcoin at this moment in time, but the risk of a fall in price or short-term pullback still exists,” said Simon Peters, crypto analyst at online brokerage eToro.

Critics have argued the Trump administration is conceding too much to the crypto industry.

“I'm concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout that gives the crypto lobby exactly its wish list,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said earlier this week.

She urged Congress to bar public officials, including the President, from issuing, backing or profiting from crypto tokens.

Trump has faced criticism from political rivals and ethics experts over potential for conflicts of interest regarding his family's crypto ventures.

Dan Bongino is considering resigning from the FBI over the handling of the Epstein files.

The bureau's deputy director reportedly told people he was considering stepping down amid a clash with the department of justice over the handling of the case, CNN reported.

“It's accurate that Dan Bongino has told people he's considering resigning amid a major clash between the FBI and DoJ over the fallout from the Epstein memo. (It remains to be seen if he actually does.) 

“But hard to overstate the infighting happening over this the last few days as Maga anger has not let up,” Kaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent wrote on X.

Mr Bongino apparently also did not go into the office on Friday following an argument with the Pam Bondi, the attorney general, leading insiders to think he had quit.

He has come under fire for failing to release a tranche of evidence relating to the paedophile financier. 

Tensions within Mr Trump's Maga base threatened to boil over this week after the justice department and FBI concluded Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan prison cell in 2019, and did not maintain a “client list” of potential blackmail targets.

Sources told Axios that Mr Bongino had grown increasingly unhappy with Ms Bondi for overpromising to release a “client list” that she has since claimed never existed, saying she misspoke when referring to the list in a Fox News interview.

During a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the attorney general allegedly confronted Mr Bongino about a NewsNation article that claimed he and Kash Patel, the FBI director, had been prevented from releasing as much information about Epstein as they would have liked.

The pair are said to have had a “heated” argument in front of Mr Patel, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Taylor Budowich, the deputy chief of staff, during which Mr Bongino denied leaking to the press.

“Pam said her piece. Dan said his piece. It didn't end on friendly terms,” one person briefed on the heated discussion told Axios, adding that Mr Bongino left the meeting angry.

Mr Bongino, a former US Secret Service agent turned podcast host, has come in for a hammering from Maga supporters after claiming a video taken from outside Epstein's cell proved that no one had entered, and that he therefore took his own life.

A conspiracy theory believed by some within the Maga movement is that Epstein was murdered to prevent the names of high-profile associates being made public.

It is also rumoured that a “list” detailing these associates exists and was to be released by the Trump administration. The White House insists such a list does not exist.

The justice department and FBI on Monday released the 11-hour video in an effort to dispel rumours that the sex offender was murdered, but Maga hardliners noticed time stamps on the video skipped from 11.58pm to midnight, leading some to suspect foul play had taken place during what has been called the “missing minute”.

The discovery of the “missing minute”, caused by a lag when the surveillance system resets each evening, was blamed internally on Mr Bongino for his oversight, insiders told Axios.

Despite the DoJ presenting it as “raw” footage, it has since been claimed the video was likely modified using a professional editing tool, according to Metadata analysis by Wired.

“The fact is, Dan was for releasing the information with the video and had no problem until he got heat online,” a senior administration official told the news outlet.

“Bongino found the video with the missing minute. He vouched for it after a ‘thorough review,'” he said, “and he thought this would end the matter. When that didn't work, he lost his mind and ran out of DC”.

The White House blow up is the clearest sign yet of turmoil within the administration over its handling of the Epstein files, and raises the prospect of potential sackings.

One Bongino supporter told Axios: “Dan is not the bad guy here. He shouldn't take the fall.”

It comes as Maga firebrand Laura Loomer claimed Mr Bongino was “seriously thinking about resigning”. He has not commented on Ms Loomer's claims.

Ms Loomer, also wrote on X that Mr Bongino and Mr Patel were “furious” with Ms Bondi over her “lack of transparency” and called for the attorney general to be fired.

On Friday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, sought to quell rumours of a split, writing on X that he “worked closely with Patel and Bongino on the joint FBI and DoJ memo regarding the Epstein files”.

“All of us signed off on the contents of the memo and the conclusions stated in the memo,” he said. “The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false.”

Invenergy, a closely-held power developer, is calling on the Trump Administration to affirm its commitment to a $11 billion power line in the US Midwest after a US Senator from Missouri said he's secured a pledge from federal officials to halt the project.

The Grain Belt line would carry electricity generated by wind farms and other energy sources in Kansas across Missouri and Illinois to Indiana. The project is capable of delivering four nuclear power plants' worth of electricity and would be the highest capacity and second longest line in US history, according to the company.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 4% at $117,955.25, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $118,872.85. Ether rose 6%, crossing back above the $3,000 level for the first time since February.

On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest day of inflows of 2025 at $1.18 billion. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue.

The rally began more slowly on Wednesday, following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed a divergence among officials about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22.

""That's when we started to really take out the top range,"" said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. ""It's expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug,"" he added, nodding to the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which is expected to increase the federal deficit – and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.

This week's move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $550 million in short liquidations and ether more than $195 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.

Rates have been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That's when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the ""termination"" of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank's stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion.

Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen.

""Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not,"" Thielen said. ""So we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer.""

For the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain and its best week since April 25, while ether is up more than 21%, heading for its west week since May 9.

Bitcoin's explosive growth continues to outshine gold, stocks, and the dollar, with 100% of trading days profitable resulting in unmatched long term returns.

From the beginning, Bitcoin's rise has been nothing short of legendary. Priced at just $0.07 on August 17, 2010, it has skyrocketed $100,000+ into 2025, creating wealth, rewriting investment playbooks, and cementing its place as a cornerstone of the future financial system.

Bitcoin Magazine Pro data reveals that out of 5,442 total days since Bitcoin first began trading, 5,441 have been profitable when compared to today's price, an extraordinary 99.98% success rate. For those who believed early and held through the volatility, the reward has been historic.

The analysis of Bitcoin's daily price history also reveals that over 80 percent of all trading days have been profitable, meaning the current price is higher than the price on those days. This level of consistency has become a key reason why so many long term investors continue to hodl with confidence.

Since 2013, the global supply of money (M2) has grown from about $61 trillion to over $102 trillion. During that same period, Bitcoin's price jumped from around $113 to more than $118,000 at its peak. This trend shows a strong connection between the increase in global money supply and the rise in Bitcoin's value, supporting the idea that Bitcoin acts as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value.

According to Bitcoin Magazine Pro, if you had dollar cost averaged (DCA) $100 a month into Bitcoin over the past nine years, you'd be sitting on over $230,670 today, from just a $10,900 total investment, with a return of over 2,016%. 

In comparison, gold had returns of 103% which would have turned the investment of $10,900 into $22,152, Apple stock of 204% into $33,081, and Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) 56% into 16,993. Bitcoin easily surpasses the returns of traditional assets like gold, Apple stock, or the DJI.

The Dollar Cost Average Strategies tool from Bitcoin Magazine Pro helps users explore Bitcoin investments across different timeframes. By comparing Bitcoin's performance to assets like the US dollar, gold, Apple stock, and the DJI, the tool highlights Bitcoin's potential as a leading store of value within a diversified investment portfolio.

Apple is famously strict about discounts, and it rarely offers price drops even on the most affordable products. If you have to buy an AirTag, you'll usually pay $29 each on Apple's official website.

But this Prime Day, the prices are to be believed: a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for $64, which works out at about $16 an AirTag. To put it into perspective, four AirTags from Apple would run you $116 so this Prime Day discount is essentially… half price. The deal is only being offered to Prime members but if you aren't a member, you can just opt for the free 30-day trial in order to get access. If you don't need more than one, you can purchase the individual AirTag from Amazon for $20 rather than the normal price of $29.

If you want an easy way of keeping tabs on your most valuable items, Apple's AirTag is a great choice. The AirTag is designed to help you find your keys, wallet, purses, backpack, or whatever you want to keep tabs on. It's as simple to pair an AirTag as it is to say: just bring it close to your iPhone or iPad and a one-touch setup will link it to your Apple ID immediately. You can then use the Find My app to locate your item at any time.

The AirTag leverages Apple's massive Find My network and uses hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you find lost things. When your AirTag is out of Bluetooth range, it can still be tracked by nearby Apple devices with communication encrypted and anonymous to maintain your information security. Your location data will never be transferred or stored on the AirTag itself.

Precision Finding is another major advantage: It uses Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your lost item with compatible iPhone models. To find your keys throughout the house, you can make a sound from the internal speaker in the AirTag or ask Siri. If you've lost something in an airport or a coffee shop, you can put the AirTag in Lost Mode to receive a notification the instant it gets detected by another device on the Find My network.

The AirTag is meant to last with a replaceable battery that still works after over a year and an IP67 rating for water and dust protection. That is, you can forget about rain, spills, or everyday bumps and drops. It's very small and light so you can stick it in a wallet, attach it to your keys or stash it in your bag without it adding bulk.

At $67 for a 4-pack, this Prime Day deal is the best opportunity you'll find to upgrade (better than during Black Friday) your tracking game.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","What was different about Novak Djokovic as he walked off court at Wimbledon compared to Roland Garros","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/what-was-different-about-novak-djokovic-as-he-walked-off-court-at-wimbledon-compared-to-roland-garros/","Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:30:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic exited a Grand Slam at the semifinal stage for the third time this season, falling short against Jannik Sinner once more.

Just five weeks ago, Djokovic lost to Sinner 4-6, 5-7, 6-7 in the semifinals of the French Open.

Looking for revenge at SW19, it wasn't to be as Sinner defeated Djokovic in straight sets once again, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

At 38 years of age, it's hard to imagine Djokovic will be around for much longer, although one former WTA star doesn't think this is the last we will see of him at the All England Club.

Analysing his walk off the court, Laura Robson noticed something different about his demeanour, compared to what she saw in Paris recently.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match, Robson compared Djokovic's exit from Centre Court to his exit from Court Philippe Chatrier in June.

“There was more of a lingering goodbye at Roland Garros, a few weeks ago, he spent a bit more time on the court saying goodbye,” she said.

“But that actually felt like he plans to come back, that he wants another chance at this.”

Robson might be right, as Djokovic outlined his plans to return to Wimbledon in 2026 during his post-match press conference.

“I would be sad, but hopefully it's not my last match on Centre Court,” he said.

“I'm not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today. I'm planning to come back, definitely at least one more time.”

Djokovic will be 39 at Wimbledon in 2026, two years older than Ken Rosewall was at the 1972 Australian Open when he became the oldest player to win a Grand Slam title (37 years, 2 months), a record that stands to this day.

The Serb will need to find something from somewhere if he wants to avoid another defeat in 2026, as he looked some way off his younger rival in this year's semifinal.

It's tough to gauge whether it was a blistering start from Sinner or a slow start from Djokovic, as the Italian eased into a 6-3, 6-3 lead.

Briefly showing signs of life in the third, Djokovic led 3-0, but won just one more game, as Sinner came through to win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

Sharing his thoughts after the match, 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash suggested the ‘damage' was done in those opening two sets.

“Yeah, it was a bit unfortunate, it looked like the damage had been done by two blistering sets by [Jannik] Sinner,” he said.

“Novak [Djokovic] struggled after that, but incredible the standard of tennis that Sinner brought out in the first two sets, just an hour wasn't it, it was something else, full credit to him. 

“It was sad that Novak couldn't reach the level we were hoping for; we were all looking for an incredible four/five-set battle, but that's sport for you.”

The Serb just couldn't compete with Sinner on Centre Court, largely due to his troubles on second serve points.

Winning just 17% of his points behind his second serve to Sinner's 71%, Djokovic never really stood a chance of beating the world number one.

Perhaps the outcome of the match would have been different if Djokovic had been more convincing on second serve points, but the reality is, we will never know.

For Djokovic, it's now time to rest and recover before he takes a trip to North America for the US hard-court swing.

There's still work to be done for Sinner in London, however, as he now prepares to take on Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz will face each other for the 2025 Wimbledon men's championship after both won their semifinal matches on Friday.

Sinner dispatched Djokovic in straight sets 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. And the score indicates how one-sided the match was. Going into Friday's matchup, there was some question as to whether Djokovic hurt himself on a fall late in his quarterfinal match with Flavio Cobelli on Wednesday. Djokovic canceled his Thursday practice, which raised further concerns.

Those concerns were justified as Djokovic had difficulty moving side to side throughout. He particularly had trouble moving to his right, couldn't push off to get to returns and limped after points.

Djokovic appeared to recover after a medical timeout between the second and third sets and took a 3-0 lead. But Sinner wasn't fazed, eventually breaking serve and taking back control from a clearly hobbled Djokovic. On several points, Djokovic couldn't even attempt to reach Sinner's returns, especially if it meant changing direction.

In the earlier semifinal, Fritz provided a strong threat. The American played arguably the best match of his career, frequently overpowering Alcaraz with his serve. However, unless Fritz was controlling the match with his serve, Alcaraz was able to battle back.

The defending champion baffled Fritz with a variety of shots, feathering drop shots at the net and slicing backhands down the line to catch his opponent out of position. Fritz forced a tiebreaker in the final set, but Alcaraz never faltered. As he often demonstrates, he can raise his game as needed while the player on the other side hits a ceiling.

Alcaraz eventually knocked Fritz off 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6), pushing him into the Wimbledon final for the third straight year. Alcaraz has won the event the last two years, and will be looking for a third consecutive Wimbledon title Sunday against Sinner.

She was derided for being the ultimate tennis “WAG” and accused of profiting from her boyfriend's successful career. But Morgan Riddle, the immaculately dressed girlfriend of Taylor Fritz who has graced Wimbledon with her fashion tips this past fortnight, is becoming something of a cult heroine in tennis. Not only that, she is being credited with elevating SW19's fashion game and attracting legions of younger fans to the sport.

Such is Riddle's influence that she was dubbed “the most famous woman in men's tennis” when she was splashed on the cover of The New York Times two years ago. Ever since she was profiled in Netflix's Break Point series in 2023, the cameras have trailed the glamorous former model, who is known for her “tenniscore chic”, wherever she goes.

She has been a regular face in Fritz's box and will be expected to make another dutiful appearance for his semi-final showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Friday, when the American fifth seed will need all the support he can get. But this glitzy 27-year-old is not simply content with playing the secondary role of cheerleader from the sidelines.

Curiously, it is at the All England Club where Riddle's authority is the strongest. In a savvy move, Wimbledon organisers snapped her up two summers ago to front a dedicated fashion blog called Wimbledon Threads – where she imparts sacred knowledge on the latest clothing trends and in-season outfits to don at the Championships.

Wimbledon Threads with Morgan Riddle | Episode 1 https://t.co/AkbSOeQlbR The late Lt. Col. Frank Slade (Scent of a Woman, 1992) would likely call the show ""Wimbledon Threads with Daphne""

This year, it has proved a popular hit after the social media trend “Inspired by Moorgs” took off, which involves Riddle re-sharing photos of glam fans who have opted for her look. It may not chime with tennis tradition, but it is working.

Radiating a picture-perfect vibe with her elegant outfits and flowing blonde locks, a cursory look at Riddle's social feeds would suggest she is an easy target for male attention. Her fanbase, though, is in fact predominantly female and she has previously talked about her desire to use her platforms and engaging content to make sport more welcoming to women.

wimbledon day 4 🌱🤍🎾

She has 600,000 followers and counting on TikTok, close to half a million on Instagram and an additional 80,000 on YouTube – with 18 to 24-year-old women reportedly making up around 80 per cent across all of her platforms.

But how likely is it that these Riddle fangirls will become hardcore tennis aficionados? It is one thing to gorge on the latest fashion tips and trends fed to you by an influencer, but quite another to get hooked on a five-set epic between Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, let alone buy tickets to events.

“She's quite divisive,” claims 20-year-old tennis fan Stella Newman. “People who are into tennis just want to watch tennis and that's true when it comes to social media. Clips compiled of Alcaraz and Sinner hitting all their different winners, for example – that's the sort of tennis that I interact with. Tennis purists debating about who's the GOAT on social media aren't that concerned about Morgan Riddle. There's definitely a bit of a split.”

Wimbledon's own social-media footprint has seen considerable growth across its channels this year – notably TikTok – with video clips of on-court action among the tournament's highest-performing content. Perhaps one reason is the new crop of personalities the sport has to celebrate, from Alcaraz's immense likeability to Coco Gauff's striking ability to fuse athleisure with high-end fashion.

“Everyone knows who Alcaraz is – it's the same with Coco Gauff, who has lots of brand recognisability behind her,” says Newman. “For me, that feels more genuine than following someone like Morgan Riddle. Rivalries are important – for people my age they missed out on the rivalry of the so-called ‘big three' of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Now everyone's thinking Sinner and Alcaraz are the next big thing, so they all want to cotton on to it.”

Still, Riddle's presence may be welcome given tennis is battling to stay relevant in light of the astronomical rise of padel – a racket sport popularised by a growing number of celebrities from Stormzy to David Beckham.

This American has taken the definition of “WAG” – that horribly outdated term designated to sportsmen's wives and girlfriends – to a completely new stratosphere. This is Morgan Riddle's world and even if she might be dividing opinion, there are a lot of people living it.

Brad Pitt drives Lando Norris' F1 car for the first time

The APXGP car takes centre stage in F1 The Movie. We find out how it was created…

Stood on an industrial estate beneath the Gatwick Airport flightpath in the leafy southern counties of the United Kingdom, a thought crosses my mind: we're a long way from Hollywood.

And yet here, within an unassuming collection of warehouses and garages, lurks one of the stars of F1 The Movie – and no, it's not Brad Pitt. As I hop out of the way of a passing Porsche 993 about to be brutally carved up and cosmetic surgeried for another film, I catch sight of the gold nose cone of the APXGP car lurking in a garage.

The actual machine that Pitt and co-star Damson Idris – as the fictional, fractious team mates Sonny Hayes and Joshua Pearce – race in the Joe Kosinski-directed movie released internationally on June 25.

One of the privileges of this job is getting to stand close to bona fide Formula 1 cars, and as I enter the garage, there is that reverential zen feeling you get when you're close to these machines at rest, like entering the stable of a prized thoroughbred racehorse. Except that despite its looks, this beast is far less thoroughbred racehorse – and far more ‘mule in gladrags'…

It's the creation of Graham Kelly and his team at GK Evolution, the company the former motorsport engineer put together over 30 years ago to create vehicles for the silver screen.

Kelly's cinematic CV is staggering. From Bourne to Bond, and having even worked on one of the most revered stunt driving sequences of all time – in Ronin, directed by John Frankenheimer, the man behind the 1967 F1 classic Grand Prix – Kelly has been there and done that when it comes to making movies with fast cars in them.

Or at least he thought he had.

“This film came along and I couldn't really say no,” Kelly chuckles as we talk in his office, overlooking the work bays where his team are tooling over various pieces of automotive exotica. “I think I was the fourth person on the film.

“2022 was my first phone call and then that July I ended up at Silverstone with Jerry Bruckheimer and Joe Kosinski on a kind of recce at the race, which was interesting. Then it went away for a little bit. I went back to a film that I was on in Italy and it kind of just went very quiet. Then September I got a call saying, okay we're on, we want to go next season. They wanted to start shooting at Silverstone in ‘23.

“At this point we had no cast, no real concept, a couple of ideas. But one of the conversations that happened without me was with Lewis Hamilton, who introduced Joe to [Mercedes Team Principal] Toto Wolff – and there was a kind of a frisson of ideas that came out of that. And the idea was to build the cars.”

Kelly's concept for building the cars for F1 was simple: Mercedes' Applied Science division would create F1-style bodywork that could be bolted onto a Formula 2 chassis that had been stretched and widened with ‘spacers' to take it to near-F1 dimensions.

Having a glitzy car with no firepower, however, simply wouldn't cut it for the type of immersive driving that Kosinski had envisioned for the film, and thus the first APXGP car – the one on show in Kelly's garage today – was fitted with a genuine Mecachrome Formula 2 engine, giving the car full-on, motorsport-grade pace.

A further Mecachrome-engined car followed, along with two cars using GP3-era V6s – while Kelly also had a brainwave to create one electric chassis.

“Quite a lot of the film, it seemed, was going to be shot in the pit lane,” he says. “And this is where my background of film and my background of motor racing helped immensely, because I could see a problem straight away: we can't use a petrol engine in the pit lane. It would just explode!

“So we quickly put a whole electric 400-volt plan together… and truthfully that car saved our lives – it kept us filming all the time.”

Having fettled the car at both Silverstone and Spain's Ascari circuit, it was time for it to play at real race weekends, with the film team embedding themselves at actual Grands Prix – to the extent of even running the cars at the back of the field for the formation lap at the 2024 British Grand Prix.

However, here again the world of Hollywood bumped into the realities of motorsport.

“[Normally on a movie] we set a scene and then we have cars prepared to do that scene, and then we cut at the end of the road and reset back to ‘number one' [the original position] and we do it again, probably 20 times,“ says Kelly of his usual process of setting up driving scenes.

“Well Formula 1 cars, or race cars, can't do that. They can't sit there idling while we decide what we're going to do. It's kind of like, when they're running, they have to go, air has to go over the radiators and then they'll have to go and do a cool-down lap. And these are all of the issues that I was trying to wrangle with during the film process.

“I'm like, you can't just bring the cars in, you have to give them a cool lap, let them get some air over the brakes, otherwise they're going to be on fire when they come down the pit lane and everybody… was really struggling with the idea that we're now in the motorsport world.

“But it all came together in the end beautifully.”

Having fast cars on track was one thing. But for Joe Kosinski – fresh off the ultra-visceral Top Gun: Maverick project – to get the chase and following driving shots that he wanted, he also required a high-speed camera car – leading Kelly to recall one of his less happy memories from the shoot…

“It became very obvious that we didn't have a traditional camera car available to us that would keep up with these cars,” he says. “So we went through various options and we ended up with a horrendous thing from America which was an old LMP [Le Mans Prototype] car which was super quick but not quick in the corners, so the balance of what we were trying to shoot was all wrong.

“Our cars would come out of the corners and disappear and [the camera car driver] would lose us on the straights so it was a whole world of pain there.

“[In the end we] decided that the thing that we got from America was just no good. In fact, we blew it up in Hungary! We lost all the oil pressure and then the pump fell apart and at that point I said, ‘Send it away, I'm done now!'”

Another one of the GP3-engined APXGP cars was used as a replacement – an imperfect solution but one which helped add to the visual impact of the movie.

“The GP3 car wasn't as quick as the F2 cars,” says Kelly, “but we could tame that back a bit and the camera movement was good because it could get in the mix, and that gave us quite a lot of ‘speed effect' in the camera.”

In the world of cinema, it's normal practice for actors to be filmed driving in close-ups, only for be-wigged, be-costumed stunt drivers to then be substituted in when there's proper driving to be done.

And while precision drivers were used for many segments in the film – including Duncan Tappy, Craig Dolby and former Formula 2 champion Luciano Bacheta – both Pitt and Idris themselves spent hours and hours spinning laps in single-seaters, especially at Silverstone, in order to both train them up for the rigours of motorsport, and to capture convincingly fast shots of them driving.

“[The single-seater training cars] were quicker through the corners than our [APXGP] car so they had quite a lot of aero characteristics, which was good to train Brad on – he needed to feel what the aero was doing and it seemed like a good step to get him from that to the [APXGP] car,” remembers Kelly.

Post-shooting on the film, Pitt had proved his worth behind the wheel to such an extent that he was even invited to drive a real McLaren F1 car at the Circuit of The Americas in Texas (check that out below). So, did Kelly think Pitt had the right stuff when it came to racing?

“I have to say, Brad surprised us all,” he says. “He jumped in the car and I was kind of pessimistic about the whole thing, partly because I'm responsible for safety and I'm responsible for putting a 61-year-old actor in a 600 horsepower, 600 kilo car… I was a bit concerned, let's put it that way!

“And then we got him into these [lower formula] cars and the feedback we were getting from the guys that were running the car was that he knows where to put the car. Him and Luce [Luciano Bacheta], they became joined at the hip.

“He just loved it. He enjoyed it, and you could see him just growing into a person that loves driving race cars. I mean, he's always been a bike man, so he developed very quickly and we all began to trust that process.

“Damson was great as well… but he didn't love it the way Brad loved it. So I think you need to really love it. I mean, Brad was a couple of seconds off Formula 2 lap speeds in a car that was nowhere near as capable as a Formula 2 car, heavier by 100kgs, longer, so it was easier to handle, but he wasn't doing bad.”

Whatever the team behind F1 set out to do, it seems to be resonating with audiences, with the film currently sitting on a 97% ‘Popcornmeter' score on the Rotten Tomatoes movie review website.

But to the million-dollar question (well, couple of hundred million actually): with all Kelly's experience, does he back the filmmakers' claims that they've managed to create the most authentic racing movie of all time?

“The experience was fantastic, it was an amazing experience,” he says. “It was exhausting and I think it was exhausting because it was quite a lot of subliminal stress involved in worrying about guys in cars on track and the film process, and actually also exhausting because of the way that [the motorsport] world exists every weekend.

“But I realised that whatever film was coming out of it was going to be really grounded in motorsport. The audience is sophisticated enough to tell whether [the action] is on a stage or it's CGI – and all of the stuff I've ever done, Ronin, all of that stuff, has all been visceral and real.

“And Joe coming off the back of Top Gun, which was clearly real – he came into this film, and all the stuff I've seen, you can see the tiny little nuances of a man driving a car at that sort of speed.

“And all of the effects on that, the image that you see, that for me… makes it feel real and that's what the film needed.”

He adds, of the film's ultimate litmus test: “All the [F1] drivers went to see the movie in Monaco and all of us were like, they're all going to be oversensitive and overcritical of the movie, because they're all drivers – and I don't think one of them came out saying it was s***. They all came out saying, ‘That was really good'.”

David Lynch was a true original, so singular that we had to invent the term “Lynchian” just to describe his work. The fact that we all instantly know what that means speaks to how powerfully his style and sensibility came through in every frame, through a deep, intentional marriage of form and content. While his talent was once-in-a-generation, that uniqueness was something he cultivated and protected through his creative process.

“He had that infinite wonder of everything, he would get transfixed into just the sheer act of exploration, experimentation, discovery,” said longtime Lynch collaborator Dean Hurley on the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “He loved to get into the sandbox of experimentation because the emotional spark that happens when you discover something, or stumble upon something, to him was the secret sauce to how things started. You're rubbing a flint against something and you're creating that spark that hopefully jumps onto something and creates a fire. He was always doing that.”

For 14 years, Hurley had a front-row seat to how exactly Lynch did that. He worked daily with the “Twin Peaks” director in his Hollywood Hills studio.

 










Lynch owned a compound of three homes in the Hollywood Hills, one of which appeared in “Lost Highway” before he converted it into the recording studio where he spent most of his waking hours. Hurley was originally hired as the studio engineer, but quickly realized the role was much broader. He became Lynch's all-purpose “sound guy,” handling everything from recording, mixing, and session playing to archiving, post supervision, and tracking down unusual instruments and sound-making devices.

“The space was a hundred percent unique,” said Hurley. “It was built like a commercial studio, and he put a ton of money into it, but it was all bespoke.”

Hurley described how the home studio was an extension of Lynch's art. The painter-musician-filmmaker designed every inch of the space, down to the texture of the walls and the furniture (which he built himself).

“He lived his whole life like that,” Hurley said. “He would craft everything down to every detail.  He literally curated and designed his whole experience on life: Where he lived, where he worked, where he moved. It was incredible.”

Sound and music provided Lynch the “emotional spark” for so much of his art.

 










“Sound is a very unique thing. Sound and music, these things of vibrations, at that certain window of frequency, it does something to us as humans. It is a carrier tone for our emotions,” said Hurley. “When you have a brain like [David's], that is so tuned into emotional learning, there's something that grabbed him and it set up this intense glowing breadcrumb where he wanted to follow and chase that feeling.”

Lynch himself told the origin story of when he was first inspired to make a film while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While working on a painting of a woman in a garden at night, he heard wind. He saw the green in the painting move, the still life becoming a moving picture in his mind. For Lynch, something so non-narrative as wind inspired him to pursue a new medium. Hurley said he saw the anecdote play out every day and believes it is the connective tissue to other great directors.

“I think for filmmakers in general, it's the ones who are masters at their craft who are chasing feelings and figuring out the architecture of how to design that feeling for an audience,” said Hurley.

Like the wind in the painting, Lynch would often get transfixed by something seemingly small. On the podcast, Hurley said Lynch became fascinated by the sounds he could generate scratching on his favorite chair in the studio.

 










“It's funny, going back and listening to some of these [recordings], they all sound the same, but like everyone he would start scratching a little rhythm, and he'd be say [Hurley doing an impression of an excited Lynch], ‘Listen to that Dean [pause], listen to that, Dean.' It would almost be like he'd forgotten the last time and he would get re-excited,” said Hurley. “It was always a reset for him. He was incredibly fired up about the smallest little things, just the simple act of life dancing before his eyes and ears.”

Hurley admitted he could be dismissive — “Yeah, I've got that recording already” — but he grew to see how moments like this were key to Lynch's process.

“He could stay a long time in that zone,” said Hurley. “The lowering of the barometer is bringing down that awareness and interest to a sort of subatomic level that most people are not vibrating on that zone. One of his favorite quotes was ‘Where the attention goes, that becomes lively.'”

What Hurley described as Lynch's “lowering of the barometer” was exploration done without a specific project, story, or medium in mind. The scratching could lead to a song, or the emotional underpinning of a scene in “Twin Peaks,” or the concept for window display. The longer he remained in the zone of following a spark of interest, the greater the possibility of discovery and alchemy.

 










“That lens of somebody like him is one I think a lot of the filmmakers that we gravitate to [have],” said Hurley. “They're putting a magnifying glass over something that is often skimmed over, they're elevating it to a hyper-focused level where you didn't realize how deep that area was before.”

Hurley wore many hats in Lynch's world. On “Twin Peaks: The Return” he had many official titles because Lynch didn't want to bring in specialized professionals every time he tried to make something. He preferred a more DIY, hands-on approach that allowed discoveries to evolve organically.

“That way he could impart more of himself and have a more of an action-and-reaction kind of process with the making of things,” said Hurley.

Hurley said this also explained Lynch's instant love affair with digital technology in the 2000s.

“[Digital] reduced his time, specifically the action and reaction time; he wanted that feedback,” said Hurley. “He definitely took to digital like a duck to water because it just reduced, reduced, reduced, and also allowed him to go back to the early days of basically doing everything DIY himself, like with short films, having a Bolex and just having a small group of people.”

Much of Lynch's creative life was about finding ways to extend the process of exploration and discovery. Even after their recordings transitioned from experimentation to the building blocks of a film, Hurley would come up with ways that allowed Lynch to extend his action-and-reaction process.

 










For example, Hurley would take a theme, like the sound of electricity in “Twin Peaks,” and use samplers to create a full keyboard array where each key had different sounds that Lynch could play.

“He liked discovery, so you put a garden of discovery in front of him and he would stumble over certain things, and then you could see which were exciting him [doing his excited Lynch impression again], ‘ I love that Dean. I love that,'” said Hurley.

That which thrilled Lynch became the first step in building a palette. Lynch would categorize sounds, applying unusual names that spoke to him about the feeling of a section of the show or movie.

“He would be like, ‘Yeah, that section where it got really hairy,' or ‘that really low mood stuff,” so you'd start to categorize that stuff as building blocks,” said Hurley. “You could chop it up, ‘Okay, I've got this here.' ‘This is a distinctly different mood than this section.' You just start slowly building the thing and then with that stuff floating all in the air, something would inspire something else. It's really hard to talk about, because as it's laid out in a linear fashion, when you got to the end, you could see, ‘Oh, that led to that, led to that.' But when you're in it, it feels like you're in a dark room bumping into furniture.”

 










The rise of digital sound made it much easier to build dense, multi-layered soundtracks, although not always to the benefit of the artform. One key lesson Hurley took from working with Lynch, and still applies to his work as a sound editor today, is the power of restraint and efficiency.

“You can throw a bunch of different sounds [at a scene] trying to think more is better, but [David] was always interested in ‘Let's find a sound for this.' It was about finding the exact right sound to elicit the emotion,” said Hurley. “It creates an architecture of, 'Is this doing anything for us?' If it's not, get it out of there. Everything has its purpose.”

While working on “Twin Peaks: The Return,” Hurley saw how Lynch applied this principle across his creative process. Lynch often grew frustrated when collaborators focused on background details or secondary actions — anything he felt distracted from the primary focus of a scene.

“There's a power in efficiency, and I think that goes across the board with him, with his writing, with his shot syntax,” said Hurley. “A director is someone who directs your attention.  So when you have a scene, a tool of directing is what do I want them to pay attention to? Each element is an opportunity to exploit, to focus, to present in a way that crafts a feeling.”

 










Lynch's studio was transformed into the post-production hub for all 18 episodes of “Twin Peaks: The Return.” He invited a small group of trusted collaborators into this tightly controlled, insular space. Like an unnecessary sound effect, anyone not essential to that process was kept outside the environment he so carefully maintained.

“I think that's one of the clear-cut tools of David is that he unified the goals and intentions of a massive group of people so he could align people to his vantage point, to his goal, to the result he was after, and people latched onto that,” said Hurley. “And when everybody's in the same house, there was a huge comfort factor for David because it's all insular and it's all his home, and I think that plays into it as well.”

Hurley said it was during the edit that he fully grasped the deeper alchemy of Lynch's art. After more than a decade working on sound, he could now see how every element of Lynch's craft fed into a unified creative process.

“You're seeing different practitioners problem solve and you're seeing what's coming for you later [referring to dailies, and picture editing], and they're walking in and hearing what's coming later. It had a very hive mind vibe, it got everybody on the same wavelength,” said Hurley.

 










In the decade leading up to the third season of “Twin Peaks,” Lynch focused on smaller side projects and work outside of film and television. But according to Hurley, the “Twin Peaks” experience reignited his drive to pursue another large-scale project. At one point, “The Unrecorded Night” was briefly in motion until COVID brought everything to a halt.

“What happened after ‘Twin Peaks' wrapped is I think he got rejuvenated for that process of being the conductor of a large orchestra for something like that. I think he loved the humanity, the camaraderie, the relationships, the circus of activity with projects like that definitely put the bug in his bonnet to want to do another large scale film or TV project,” said Hurley.

It's our loss that he didn't get to do his last film project. If there's one thing we know for sure, it's that Lynch and his process would have led to another creation unlike anything else we'll see again.
