                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's explosive growth continues to outshine gold, stocks, and the dollar, with 100% of trading days profitable resulting in unmatched long term returns. From the beginning, Bitcoin's rise has been nothing short of legendary. Priced at just $0.07 on August 17, 2010, it has skyrocketed $100,000+ into 2025, creating wealth, rewriting investment playbooks, and cementing its place as a cornerstone of the future financial system. Bitcoin Magazine Pro data reveals that out of 5,442 total days since Bitcoin first began trading, 5,441 have been profitable when compared to today's price, an extraordinary 99.98% success rate. This level of consistency has become a key reason why so many long term investors continue to hodl with confidence. JUST IN: Holding #Bitcoin has been profitable for 100% of its history. During that same period, Bitcoin's price jumped from around $113 to more than $118,000 at its peak. This trend shows a strong connection between the increase in global money supply and the rise in Bitcoin's value, supporting the idea that Bitcoin acts as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value. According to Bitcoin Magazine Pro, if you had dollar cost averaged (DCA) $100 a month into Bitcoin over the past nine years, you'd be sitting on over $230,670 today, from just a $10,900 total investment, with a return of over 2,016%.

COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The Putnam County Sheriff's Office is investigating multiple scams involving Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs.

PCSO reports that the scammers are requesting payments in the form of Bitcoin by depositing money in cryptocurrency ATMs.

“Scammers may claim the payment is needed for overdue bills, missed court dates, or a family emergency,” PCSO said. “Scammers may also claim to be local law enforcement, public officials, or government agencies.”

Here are instructions on how to watch WSMV4 live on various platforms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PENGU token jumped as much as 13% after Coinbase updated its official X profile picture to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, according to Binance data. Coinbase's new profile photo comes on the heels of Alex, formerly with Binance, taking on the role of Head of Crypto Twitter Communications to enhance the firm's public messaging and community ties. Alex took over our account for an hour. (Legally we're required to point out that Alex has not technically joined forever and has a very normal employment contract with the company.) I had to do something different, and a twitter takeover felt right,” Alex said in a Friday statement. “The new focus is making comms more social native – direct, transparent and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct. They're already working on it, and I've joined to be a part of that change,” he added. At the time of writing, PENGU changed hands at around $0.023, up over 20% in the last 24 hours. The token has regained upward momentum since Wednesday, as Bitcoin's rally has lifted the overall crypto market. In addition, positive regulatory developments, with the SEC having recently acknowledged Canary Capital's spot PENGU ETF application, also helped boost its momentum.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, blockchain has been the foundation of nearly every major crypto project. But fifteen years later, that architecture is starting to show its age. Congestion, high fees, and confirmation delays remain common problems, even on networks with billion-dollar ecosystems. That's where DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, enter the picture. DAG-based infrastructure offers an alternative to traditional blockchain by enabling parallel processing of transactions. Instead of blocks in a single chain, transactions are recorded as interconnected nodes in a graph structure, allowing for higher throughput, near-instant confirmations, and better scalability. Projects like IOTA and Kaspa have attempted to pioneer this path, but one new entrant is making noise with a unique twist: BlockDAG, a hybrid Layer 1 that combines the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the speed of DAG architecture. And based on its rapid growth, the crypto market is paying attention. This creates limits on how many transactions per second (TPS) a network can handle, a problem that plagues even top 10 chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. DAGs solve this by removing the need for sequential blocks. Each transaction verifies previous ones, forming a graph-like network that expands in multiple directions. The result: transactions can be processed simultaneously rather than waiting in line. This structure is especially relevant as crypto moves toward real-world adoption. Retail payments, IoT devices, enterprise use cases, all demand speed, scale, and low costs. What sets BlockDAG apart isn't just that it uses DAG. By combining DAG-based transaction architecture with a Proof-of-Work consensus layer, BlockDAG manages to strike a balance between scalability and security, something few Layer 1s have pulled off. In practice, this means that miners still validate transactions and secure the network (like Bitcoin), but those transactions are no longer locked into a linear block structure. It's the same foundational insight that helped Kaspa attract a cult following, but BlockDAG is evolving the concept further, with developer tools, a growing testnet, and consumer-ready mining apps already live. BlockDAG's approach isn't just theoretical, it's already in motion. The presale has now exceeded $337 million, with over 23.8 billion BDAG tokens sold, putting it among the largest community-driven crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. It's backing up its product roadmap with aggressive global positioning. These partnerships integrate Web3 features like NFTs and fan tokens into existing sports ecosystems, exposing millions of users to BDAG in organic, engaging ways. Add to that earlier branding campaigns with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football giant Inter Milan, and it's clear BlockDAG is serious about reaching audiences far beyond the typical DeFi crowd. Right now, BDAG is priced at $0.0016, a figure that stands out when compared to early-stage valuations of other successful Layer 1s. The project has already confirmed that its current unlock promotion, allowing 80% of tokens to be accessible on Day 1, will only be available for a limited time. At Crypto Economy we do not give investment advice, if you are going to invest in any of the promoted projects you should do your own research.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin's price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin. Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels. The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market sentiment surrounding the PUMP token launch is cautiously optimistic, with prediction markets like Myriad indicating a 70% likelihood of a sellout within the first hour. However, investors are advised to monitor pre-market activity, particularly on platforms such as Hyperliquid, which currently values PUMP at approximately $0.005426—reflecting a 35.65% premium over the ICO price. Despite initial enthusiasm, some analysts express reservations about PUMP's short-term price trajectory. Daniel Seager, head analyst at Trireme Trading, highlights the token's challenging market share environment, noting that Pump.fun has recently ceded dominance to competitors like LetsBonk, which captured nearly 66% of daily token creation on Solana. Seager also points to the tokenomics structure, which includes a one-year cliff on private and team allocations, potentially mitigating immediate sell pressure but raising questions about long-term liquidity. Conversely, pseudonymous investor Solarnius underscores the token's favorable lock-up terms and expresses bullish sentiment, signaling intent to make a significant investment despite the high fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion. Meanwhile, VC Beanie from GM Capital warns that the $4 billion valuation is “unprecedented” and forecasts downward price movement in both the short and long term. This divergence in expert opinion underscores the complexity of assessing PUMP's market potential amid evolving competitive dynamics and valuation metrics. However, recent data from Dune Analytics reveals a significant shift, with LetsBonk overtaking Pump.fun in daily token creation share. Despite this, Pump.fun's co-founder Alon Cohen remains a respected figure in the community, with some analysts expressing confidence in the platform's long-term viability based on its tokenomics and strategic positioning. Veteran meme coin trader Wirelyss highlights this dynamic, suggesting that sidelined investors may seek value in related tokens, potentially diluting initial demand for PUMP. These factors, combined with the token's lock-up provisions and competitive pressures, suggest a nuanced market environment where strategic entry points and vigilant monitoring of pre-market indicators will be crucial for prospective investors. As the PUMP token ICO approaches, the crypto community faces a complex interplay of high valuation, competitive market shifts, and regulatory exclusions shaping its launch trajectory. While early indicators and tokenomics suggest potential for measured growth, expert opinions diverge on the likelihood of significant price appreciation. Investors should approach the PUMP token with a balanced perspective, closely observing pre-market trends and broader Solana ecosystem developments to inform their trading strategies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have transformed digital ownership by enabling the trade of unique assets through blockchain technology. Yet, this rapid innovation has outpaced security measures, leaving users vulnerable to sophisticated scams, technical exploits, and project failures. As NFTs grow in popularity and financial value, the consequences of security breaches have become increasingly severe. Due to these concerns, there is a critical need to systematically study the full scope of NFT security risks and create practical defenses against emerging threats.In a new study (DOI: 10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100268) published on June 25, 2025, in Blockchain: Research and Applications, researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Peking University unveil the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) on NFT security. Their work culminates in a multilayered NFT security reference framework that pinpoints the most common vulnerabilities, assesses detection challenges, and proposes a clear path forward for safeguarding the Web3 ecosystem.The researchers constructed a three-tier security model encompassing the contract layer, market layer, and auxiliary service layer. These findings are grounded in real incidents, including high-profile cases where attackers stole millions by exploiting minting functions or deceived users through counterfeit tokens tied to celebrity names.The team also developed practical detection tools, such as transaction trace analysis for identifying reentrancy loops and symbolic execution to test logic vulnerabilities in minting functions. Alarmingly, they found that many real-world incidents—especially those involving phishing and front-end manipulation—remain underexplored in academic research. "Our work bridges this knowledge gap by not only exposing the root causes of major attacks but also offering developers and researchers the tools to detect and prevent them. This is a call to action—for academia and industry alike—to take NFT security seriously. "This pioneering research lays the groundwork for a more secure and resilient NFT ecosystem. Developers can now reference the proposed framework to preemptively address common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and marketplaces. Investors and collectors gain a better understanding of the warning signs associated with fraudulent projects. Perhaps most importantly, the study advocates for greater collaboration between cybersecurity researchers and blockchain practitioners to stay ahead of evolving threats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>State development bank NRW.BANK has issued its first digital bond, a two-year €100 million issuance on the Polygon blockchain. The bond is a ‘crypto security' under Germany's Electronic Securities Act (eWpG), which means it used a crypto registrar Cashlink rather than a central securities depository. Deutsche Bank, DZ BANK and DekaBank acted as joint lead managers, with the issuance attracting strong interest from institutional investors. Yesterday the BIS published a bulletin on blockchain-based government bonds, finding that they attract tighter bid-ask spreads, indicating greater liquidity. Cashlink CEO Michael Duttlinger said that the latest issuance “shows the increasing trust in blockchain-based capital market infrastructure and reinforces our role as a key enabler for secure, compliant, and scalable tokenized financial instruments.” The company also observed that some institutions are progressing from one off pilots to fully integrate with blockchain technology. NRW isn't the first German state bank to issue a digital bond, with KfW launching two last summer, for €100 million and €50 million. The second one used Germany's Trigger solution that links to the TARGET2 payment system to settle in central bank money. This was part of the ECB's wholesale DLT settlement trials. Both were on the Polygon blockchain and used Cashlink as the registrar. In addition to issuing bonds, KfW  also took the step of investing in blockchain based bonds, buying the mortgage bonds of state bank and LBBW subsidiary Berlin Hyp.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social poker brand Devilfish.com has announced the complete sell-out of its Genesis Avatar NFT collection. The company said this milestone validates its approach to creating "a player-centric brand, which applies a sweepstakes-membership style, free-to-play (F2P) model to poker." According to Devilfish.com, the success of the Genesis Mint signals "a clear market appetite for players to be part of a brand and a new social movement," as against the real-money-first poker model, which the brand says has long struggled with high customer acquisition costs (CPAs) and a significant player churn rate. This F2P, community-centric model is designed to address the industry's long-standing retention problem, where an estimated 85% of recreational players are long-term net losers, which may result in a poor player experience. JJ Williams, CEO of Devilfish.com, commented: "We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our Genesis collection, but we are not surprised. This is a powerful signal of how creating a brand-centric story to the industry that poker has a sustainability problem and that the solution lies within the community, not just in cash. Inspired by the growth of social and sweepstakes casinos, Devilfish.com seeks to position itself as "a vital partner for the broader gaming industry." For online operators, land-based casinos, and poker publishers, the platform promises a low-friction pathway to attract new demographics, build prospect databases, and re-engage lapsed players. The Genesis Avatars represent a player's unique digital identity, which Devilfish touts as a significant component of its brand ecosystem, including membership. It grants holders access to exclusive benefits and a stake in the community's future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT) has announced the establishment of a $1 million strategic reserve in Ethereum (ETH), marking its first step toward expanding its presence in Ethereum's on-chain financial infrastructure. This strategic initiative represents BTCT's evolution from a crypto mining company to an on-chain financial infrastructure participant. CEO Siguang Peng emphasized that this initial investment positions the company for future opportunities in decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. The decision is driven by Ethereum's dominant position in stablecoin infrastructure, high transaction volumes, and growing institutional adoption. Il CEO Siguang Peng ha sottolineato che questo investimento iniziale posiziona l'azienda per future opportunità nella finanza decentralizzata, emissione di stablecoin e tokenizzazione degli asset. El CEO Siguang Peng destacó que esta inversión inicial posiciona a la compañía para futuras oportunidades en finanzas descentralizadas, emisión de stablecoins y tokenización de activos. BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT)는 이더리움(ETH) 100만 달러 규모의 전략적 준비금을 설립했다고 발표했으며, 이는 이더리움 온체인 금융 인프라 확장에 첫 발을 내딛는 의미입니다. 이 전략적 이니셔티브는 BTCT가 암호화폐 채굴 회사에서 온체인 금융 인프라 참여자로 진화하고 있음을 나타냅니다. CEO 시광 펑(Siguang Peng)은 이번 초기 투자가 탈중앙화 금융, 스테이블코인 발행, 자산 토큰화 등 미래 기회를 위한 회사의 입지를 강화한다고 강조했습니다. 이 결정은 이더리움이 스테이블코인 인프라에서 차지하는 지배적 위치, 높은 거래량, 그리고 증가하는 기관 채택에 기반합니다. 회사는 시장 상황과 네트워크 업그레이드에 대응하여 ETH 보유량을 계속 늘릴 계획입니다. BTC Digital (NASDAQ : BTCT) a annoncé la création d'une réserve stratégique d'un million de dollars en Ethereum (ETH), marquant ainsi sa première étape vers l'expansion de sa présence dans l'infrastructure financière on-chain d'Ethereum. Le PDG Siguang Peng a souligné que cet investissement initial positionne l'entreprise pour de futures opportunités dans la finance décentralisée, l'émission de stablecoins et la tokenisation des actifs. Cette décision est motivée par la position dominante d'Ethereum dans l'infrastructure des stablecoins, ses volumes élevés de transactions et l'adoption croissante par les institutions. L'entreprise prévoit de continuer à augmenter ses avoirs en ETH en fonction des évolutions du marché et des mises à jour du réseau. BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT) hat die Einrichtung einer strategischen Reserve von 1 Million US-Dollar in Ethereum (ETH) bekannt gegeben, was den ersten Schritt zur Erweiterung seiner Präsenz in der On-Chain-Finanzinfrastruktur von Ethereum markiert. CEO Siguang Peng betonte, dass diese Anfangsinvestition das Unternehmen für zukünftige Chancen in den Bereichen dezentrale Finanzen, Stablecoin-Emission und Asset-Tokenisierung positioniert. Die Entscheidung wird durch Ethereums dominierende Stellung in der Stablecoin-Infrastruktur, hohe Transaktionsvolumina und wachsende institutionelle Akzeptanz getrieben. Das Unternehmen plant, seine ETH-Bestände entsprechend der Marktentwicklungen und Netzwerk-Updates weiter zu erhöhen. BTCT's $1M Ethereum reserve signals strategic pivot toward DeFi infrastructure participation, positioning for stablecoin and tokenization opportunities. The strategic rationale centers on Ethereum's critical position in decentralized finance - over half of major stablecoins including USDT and USDC operate on Ethereum, creating massive transaction volumes approaching traditional financial rails. By establishing this reserve, BTCT is positioning itself to potentially capitalize on multiple value-creation opportunities: This move aligns with emerging institutional trends where mining and blockchain companies diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The $1 million allocation appears to be just the first phase, with management indicating plans to "scale that position" and "continuously augment its ETH holdings" based on market developments. The timing coincides with several technical catalysts that could enhance Ethereum's fundamental value proposition, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade, mature Layer-2 scaling solutions, and increasing regulatory clarity. Rather than merely holding cryptocurrency as a speculative asset, BTCT is strategically positioning to leverage Ethereum's programmable capabilities for potential revenue generation and infrastructure participation. SINGAPORE, July 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BTC Digital Ltd. ("BTCT" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: BTCT), a leading blockchain technology company, today announced that it has established a strategic reserve of $1 million in Ethereum (ETH). "As the stablecoin market continues its explosive growth, Ethereum has emerged as the foundation of on–chain USD settlement and value transfer," said Mr. Siguang Peng, CEO of BTCT. "By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization. This strategic move strengthens our technological edge, enhances market confidence, and optimizes capital deployment." Looking AheadBuilding on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from "hash–rate provider" to "on–chain financial infrastructure participant." The Company intends to continuously augment its ETH holdings in alignment with market developments and network upgrades. BTCT believes that Ethereum, akin to "digital gold," will remain indispensable—not only as a stablecoin settlement hub but also as a catalyst for decentralized payments, asset tokenization, and the next wave of global financial interoperability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime Bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said the latest BTC rally may be a selling opportunity for investors to buy silver instead. “With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it's a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver's next big leg up,” Schiff said in a Thursday X post as Bitcoin (BTC) put on its moon boots again and set new highs above $112,000. He claimed that silver has more upside potential than Bitcoin and added that while BTC “can easily crash, silver's downside seems very limited.” He said he was “slightly bearish” due to the US Treasury General Account being replenished through new debt issuance, which could temporarily drain liquidity. Related: Bitcoin, Ether ETFs clock second-biggest day of inflows on record The reaction came amid Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high on Thursday, surpassing $112,000. OKX CEO Roshan Robert said, “Bitcoin is showing why it's in a class of its own.” According to Robert, while ongoing trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating Bitcoin as a macro hedge and maturing asset class. “July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it,” he concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The token's price action coincides with AI giant Nvidia's (NVDA) surge to a $4 trillion valuation, highlighting crypto's tie with tech. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hit a fresh record on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was headed that way on Thursday. "Historically, Bitcoin has remained highly correlated with tech stocks, and this correlation is still playing out," Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of the Coin Bureau, wrote on Thursday morning. Read more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card? Over the past two months, bitcoin has traded within a tight $10,000 range — an unusually stable period given its historical volatility. "At the heart of this rally lies sustained structural inflows from institutional players," wrote Dilin Wu, research strategist at Pepperstone. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) this week also filed for approval to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF”, which would include about 70% of its holdings in bitcoin. The timing of bitcoin's breakout also comes days before Congress kicks off its highly anticipated "Crypto Week" on July 14. Lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the industry's regulatory framework. "A favorable outcome could accelerate institutional inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin's role as a macro asset and strengthening confidence in compliant crypto platforms," said Jesse Jarvis, CEO of Kaiko AI. The stock is up more than 500% from its June 5 IPO. Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) were also higher during Thursday's session.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by the success of businesses like MicroStrategy, which has seen its stock surge more than 3,000% since it pivoted to buying Bitcoin instead of developing software, other publicly traded companies are now betting on an even more volatile cryptocurrency: Ethereum. And some taking the risky move are saying it's a “Chat GPT moment for crypto” — because they believe the product is going to become ubiquitous and highly valued in just a few months. Lee joined BitMine Immersion Technologies last week as chairman following the company's rebrand from a Bitcoin mining company to a focus on acquiring what they believe is the real gold, Ethereum. And if the stock price is any indication, it seems to be working. Since announcing its pivot to Ethereum, BitMine Immersion Technologies' stock climbed 25%. Bit Digital, a publicly traded company that previously focused on computing infrastructure and, at one point Bitcoin mining, saw its shares surge nearly 30% after announcing it was moving to an Ethereum treasury management and staking strategy. Likewise, SharpLink Gaming, a former sports betting and online casino marketing company, saw its stock surge over 400% after announcing a shift to an Ethereum treasury strategy in May 2025, though it has since experienced significant volatility. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency focused on secure, peer-to-peer transactions without supporting complex apps, Ethereum is a high-tech blockchain platform powering apps, smart contracts and its currency, Ether. Large wealth managers restricted by SEC rules from buying crypto can invest in companies holding Ethereum to gain exposure to both the cryptocurrency and its technology, which supports stablecoins, staking and decentralized finance applications. “Ethereum offers something unique: It's a productive asset,” Mara Schmiedt, the CEO and co-founder of Alluvia, told me. “Staking delivers a 3%+ baseline yield … forward-looking companies aren't just holding ETH, they're integrating it into how they generate yield, manage capital and future-proof their businesses.” “For traditional finance investors like asset managers, staking represents a compliant, reward-generating strategy that provides direct exposure to the economic activity of decentralized systems.” And for Wall Street, which loves complex financial tools (derivatives, anyone? “We're in the early innings of a treasury strategy evolution for public and private companies,” Schmiedt said. This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC's power players (and those who aspire to be). And if the heavyweights who bought into BitMine are any indication, it has serious backers. BitMine Immersion recently secured $250 million from prominent backers including Mozayyx Group (a discretionary macro hedge fund), Founders Fund, Pantera, Galaxy Digital, Falcon X, Kraken and Republic Digital, as well as traditional funds like Ockham Crest and Diametric Capital.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking to Yahoo Finance Future Focus, Robinhood crypto senior vice president and general manager Johann Kerbrat explained how the platform is leveraging blockchain technology to overhaul outdated systems and offer investors something different. These “stock tokens” allow users across 31 European countries to trade more than 200 US stocks and ETFs, including heavyweights like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA), without paying any commission or spread fees. "Right now, what we're launching in Europe is that EU customer will have access to 200 plus US stocks and ETF tokens, and the stock token holder will also be able to receive dividends directly into their app," Kerbrat said. It means European users can gain exposure to the US market, something that can be expensive due to regulatory barriers and foreign exchange costs, while also receiving dividend payouts like traditional shareholders.

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink recently called it the “next generation for markets.” "We've been vocal about the fact that we believe the traditional finance system is a bit outdated, and doesn't match how people are using products now, nowadays," said Kerbrat.

To support this new tokenised financial world, Robinhood is building its own Layer 2 blockchain, powered by Ethereum and based on the Arbitrum stack. Layer 2 blockchains are built on top of existing blockchain networks like Ethereum to boost speed and scalability while lowering transaction costs. Robinhood's in-house chain will eventually become the infrastructure behind its tokenised stock platform, enabling features like 24/7 trading, seamless bridging of assets, and self-custody for users. "We're already excited to build our own Robinhood layer two blockchain. It's going to be built on top of Ethereum using the Arbitrum stack," said Kerbrat. Starting with ethereum and solana, US customers can now stake their assets directly in the Robinhood app. Staking allows users to contribute to the security of blockchain networks in return for earning rewards, sort of like earning interest for locking up your crypto. And on a regular basis, they will receive a new reward, and they can decide to invest with it, or just to stake them again." The move comes as discussions heat up around whether ethereum staking should be allowed in spot ETFs. While regulators debate, Robinhood is already rolling out staking in a user-friendly interface designed to demystify the process. This new feature lets experienced traders make bigger bets on the price of cryptocurrencies by using leverage, meaning they can trade with more money than they actually have.
