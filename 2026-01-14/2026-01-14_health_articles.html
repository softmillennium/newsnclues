                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers from the University of Liverpool has found that spikes in blood sugar after meals may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Whilst research has long suggested that hyperglycaemia, diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance strongly relate to worse brain health, specifically increasing the risk of cognitive decline and dementias, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using data from the UK Biobank, the team analysed genetic data from over 350000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years of age. They focused on markers of how the body processes sugar, including fasting glucose, insulin levels and blood sugar measured two hours after eating. Using a technique called Mendelian randomisation, they tested whether these traits were likely to play a causal role in dementia risk. The results found that people with higher post-meal blood sugar (postprandial hyperglycaemia) had a 69% greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This was not explained by changes in overall brain size or damage to white matter, suggesting that the risk may operate through more subtle mechanisms. This finding could help shape future prevention strategies, highlighting the importance of managing blood sugar not just overall, but specifically after meals." Dr Vicky Garfield, senior author commented: "We first need to replicate these results in other populations and ancestries to confirm the link and better understand the underlying biology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed a way to 3D print custom micrometer-sized structures directly into the interior of living cells. As reported in Advanced Materials, the investigators used their method to print complex microstructures in shapes including barcodes, geometric patterns, and even a tiny elephant. The breakthrough involves injecting a cell with a bio-compatible light-sensitive material called photoresist and then treating the cell with a special laser that polymerizes the photoresist into an intracellular structure with submicron resolution. A cell treated with this method not only contains the newly fabricated structure within its interior, but also keeps on living and dividing, passing the structure on to one of the daughter cells that result from cell division. Although the research is preliminary, it could be the basis for printing tiny machines or devices inside cells to provide deeper insights into biological functions or to instill enhanced or entirely new properties to cells. Our method provides a new tool to manipulate living cells from the inside, enabling a new approach to studying their mechanical and biological responses."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings, which are published in Cancer Discovery, could allow clinicians to easily and noninvasively determine which patients should receive the drug. Isolating cancer cells from the blood has tremendous potential to guide immune-related cancer therapies, and our group has created cutting edge bioengineering technologies for purification of these circulating tumor cells. We've learned a lot about the biology of these cells, but we haven't had a test that has direct clinical relevance. Daniel A. Haber, MD, PhD, senior and co-corresponding author, director of the Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research, Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute The blood cell enrichment technology has been licensed to TellBio, Inc. The study focused on whether properties of circulating tumor cells might correlate with a patient's response to tarlatamab, which was fully approved in late 2025 as a treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) after prior chemotherapy. Although tarlatamab showed promise in clinical trials, about half of patients with SCLC experience cancer progression within six months of initiating therapy. It was thought that every SCLC case expresses DLL3, but Haber and colleagues found that only half of the 20 patients they studied had abundant DLL3-positive cancer cells in their blood, and these were the patients who responded to tarlatamab. The study, which was a collaboration between bioengineering experts who had developed the technology to analyze rare cancer cells in blood specimens, and lung cancer clinicians, has important implications for clinical care. "Our work may help predict which patients with SCLC are likely to respond to tarlatamab and potentially other antibodies targeting DLL3, many of which are in development," said co-corresponding author Justin Gainor, MD, program director of the Center for Thoracic Cancers at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. "It also has potential implications for other cancers that express DLL3 as they become more aggressive and for the field of antibody-directed cancer therapies." Mishra, A., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research at Karlstad University shows that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and adverse life events during pregnancy can influence children's behavior and brain development. "We know that exposures during this period can have lasting effects," says Marlene Stratmann. "My dissertation 'The importance of prenatal environment for children's neurodevelopment: Epidemiological studies on endocrine disrupting chemicals and stress' shows that mixtures of endocrine-disrupting substances found in everyday products can be associated with behavioral problems in children at seven years of age, and that boys and girls were affected in slightly different ways," says Marlene Stratmann, PhD student in Public Health Science at Karlstad University in Sweden. Many substances are found in products that people use daily and cannot choose to avoid themselves." Marlene Stratmann, PhD student in Public Health Scienc, Karlstad University Research also indicates that psychological stress and adverse life events events during pregnancy are linked to behavioral outcomes later in childhood, suggesting that both chemical and psychological factors in the prenatal stage affect children's development. "We know that brain development begins early in fetal life and that exposures during this period can have lasting effects," says Marlene Stratmann. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect the hormonal system that governs brain development, and our research shows that this may be linked to behavioral problems in children later in life. To improve children's future health, regulations and product development must be designed with the child's best interests in focus," says Stratmann. Another piece of the puzzle is children's play. Researchers observed that the way children play was linked to their behavior, suggesting that early environmental factors can leave traces both in how children act and how they interact socially. To give children the best possible start, clear regulations and safer products are needed," says Marlene Stratmann.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diabetes, a metabolic disease, is on the rise worldwide, and over 90 percent of cases are type 2 diabetes, where the body does not effectively respond to insulin. Researchers from Mass General Brigham and Albert Einstein College of Medicine identified metabolites (small molecules found in blood generated through metabolism) associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future and revealed genetic and lifestyle factors that may influence these metabolites. In this study, researchers tracked 23,634 individuals with diverse ethnic backgrounds across 10 prospective cohorts with up to 26 years of follow-up. These individuals were initially free of type 2 diabetes. The team analyzed 469 metabolites in blood samples, as well as genetic, diet, and lifestyle data, to see how they relate to risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, we found that diet and lifestyle factors may have a stronger influence on metabolites linked to type 2 diabetes than on metabolites not associated with the disease." Jun Li, MD, PhD, first and co-corresponding author, assistant professor of Medicine and associate epidemiologist, Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine Li is also an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Increasing evidence suggests that these dietary and lifestyle factors are associated with greater or lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Our study revealed that specific metabolites may act as potential mediators, linking these factors with type 2 diabetes risk." "Our study is the largest and most comprehensive investigation of blood metabolic profiles associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes that integrates genomic and diet and lifestyle data from a wide range of people, and lays important groundwork for future studies," said senior and co-corresponding author Qibin Qi, PhD, professor in the Department of Epidemiology & Population Health and associate director of that department's Center for Population Cohorts at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "While these new findings offer important insights, additional experimental studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm the causality of these associations and clarify how these metabolic pathways contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes." The collaborative research team plans to continue investigating why people develop diabetes through different biological pathways, with the goal of helping develop more targeted prevention strategies for individuals at high risk. "A better understanding of the biological pathways behind disease can help drive the development of new treatments," said Li. "Our findings lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of type 2 diabetes and may help inform the development of precision preventive strategies targeting specific metabolic pathways."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The risk of pregnancy-related high blood pressure varied markedly among subgroups of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander people, highlighting the need for tailored prevention and treatment, according to research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. "There are known ways to help prevent and treat high blood pressure during pregnancy. Our findings can help health care professionals identify those who are at higher risk," said study lead author Jennifer Soh, M.S., who was a master's student in Community Health and Prevention Research Program at Stanford University School of Medicine when she conducted the study. "Early identification and treatment can help prevent serious, downstream complications for both the pregnant individuals and their infants." These conditions can be managed and treated with medication or lifestyle changes, according to the  American Heart Association. Yet little is known about differences in risk between Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations as they are often studied together, despite the diversity found within these groups. To understand the risk by race and ethnicity, researchers in this study analyzed the risks of five hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in individuals of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander descent. Preeclampsia is high blood pressure during pregnancy characterized by too much protein in the urine or other signs of organ damage. Eclampsia is a serious complication of preeclampsia that can cause seizures. Future studies should examine more structural and social factors that could help explain the differences in the elevated risks found in this study." Finally, the study could not consider additional potential, yet important, factors that may impact high blood pressure during pregnancy, such as air pollution, neighborhood walkability and food access.

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Kevin Shah, MD, a board-certified cardiologist and program director of Heart Failure Outreach at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, about this study. “The finding that even light physical activity was associated with a substantially lower risk of death is both reassuring and empowering for patients who may not be able to meet traditional exercise recommendations,” he told us. “What stood out most was that the benefit appeared strongest in patients with more advanced CKM stages, where barriers to vigorous exercise are often greatest,“ Shah continued. “Rather than framing physical activity as an all-or-nothing goal, this study reinforces that incremental, achievable movement can still translate into meaningful long-term health benefits,” he emphasized. “It is important for researchers to continue to examine how light physical activity translates into health benefits because, as a society, we have drifted towards an increasingly sedentary lifestyle often coupled with poor diets, which in turn fuels a growing burden of cardiovascular and metabolic disease,” Del Conde, who was likewise not involved in the study, said. “Future research should focus on interventional studies that test whether intentionally increasing light physical activity, such as structured walking programs or movement-based daily routines, can improve meaningful outcomes in patients with CKM syndrome,” he explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As more Americans receive treatment for opioid use disorder, that progress is increasingly showing up in the operating room, creating an urgent need to modernize how pain is managed during and after major surgery, according to a study in the February 2026 issue of Anesthesiology, the peer-reviewed medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). The study documents a steady rise in surgical patients using medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), highlighting a gap between current surgical pain practices and the needs of today's patients. "From the patient's perspective, our study reinforces that addiction treatment is medical care – not something to pause or hide before surgery," said study lead author Mark C. Bicket, M.D., Ph.D., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. "If you or a loved one are on a treatment for opioid use disorder and need surgery, your care team needs to know." MOUD are an essential treatment strategy for patients with opioid use disorder. Medications such as the opioid buprenorphine can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms and improve health outcomes, including a reduced risk of opioid overdose. "Our study shows that more people arriving for surgery are already receiving MOUD, while our surgical system has not fully appreciated or adapted to that reality," said Dr. Bicket. "This is a critical moment for safer, more coordinated care because growing numbers of patients on opioid use disorder treatment are entering the operating room without clear, coordinated plans in place to manage both pain and recovery." The study included data on adults hospitalized for major surgery, drawn from a national insurance database. During this time, the rate of MOUD use among surgical patients increased significantly: from 154.4 per 100,000 procedures in 2016 to 240.8 per 100,000 procedures in 2022. Throughout the study period, about 80% of MOUD users were taking buprenorphine, which has advantages in safety and pain control compared to other options (e.g., methadone or naltrexone). Most of the top ten procedures associated with MOUD use were orthopedic surgeries, including shoulder joint replacement, lower extremity amputation, or surgery for hip or pelvis fracture. Patients in the Midwest and Northeast regions had higher rates of MOUD use, compared to those in the West and South. "Our findings reflect progress in getting people treated for opioid use disorder," said Dr. Bicket. The study provides "startling evidence" that every anesthesiologist is likely to encounter patients with substance use disorders – including patients taking MOUD, according to an accompanying editorial by Lynn R. Kohan, M.D., and Eugene R. Viscusi, M.D. They wrote: "Anesthesiologists as champions of perioperative medicine are ideally suited to provide the care these patients demand and to integrate addiction management principles into perioperative care."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The international consortium - bringing together academic institutions, industry partners, SMEs and patient organisations - is co-led by Amsterdam UMC, Siemens Healthineers, King's College London and Gates Ventures, with funding from the European Commission's Innovative Health Initiative for a five-year period. The project begins at a pivotal moment for AD care in Europe. In 2025, two new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), lecanemab and donanemab, received regulatory approval, offering a first opportunity to slow the progression of AD. However, additional accessible and scalable treatment options are also needed, since Member States are confronted with rapidly escalating diagnostic bottlenecks, long waiting times and a growing shortage of specialised healthcare professionals. Health systems are already struggling to deliver timely diagnostic testing, brain imaging and structured clinical follow-up, raising the risk of delayed treatment and poorer outcomes. "Our vision is simple but ambitious: to make personalised care a reality for every patient with AD, regardless of where they live," said Professor Frederik Barkhof from Amsterdam UMC and Clinical Lead of ACCESS-AD. "ACCESS-AD brings together the clinical, scientific and societal stakeholders needed to turn innovation into everyday practice across Europe." ACCESS-AD is pioneering a coordinated, multimodal clinical framework that unites brain imaging, blood-based biomarkers, digital monitoring tools, AI-driven decision support, and real-world evidence into a seamless patient pathway. ACCESS-AD also aims to widen access to tools that historically have been available only in centres of excellence, such as accelerated MRI protocols, quantitative amyloid PET and automated safety monitoring. ACCESS-AD introduces a coordinated innovation pathway structured across four key clinical stages: "ACCESS-AD brings together expertise from across Europe to address the urgent need for more effective and personalised Alzheimer's care," said Andreas Schneck, head of Magnetic Resonance at Siemens Healthineers, Industry Lead of ACCESS-AD. "By integrating laboratory diagnostics, advanced imaging, and AI-driven digital tools, this coordinated approach aims to strengthen the entire care pathway – enabling timely diagnosis, precision treatment, and equitable access to innovations across diverse care settings." The ACCESS-AD framework is being built around AI-driven prediction models capable of forecasting treatment response, identifying patients at risk of adverse events, and guiding personalised treatment planning. A dementia dashboard will synthesise the multimodal data into clear, actionable insights for clinicians in both specialist and community-based settings. "ACCESS-AD will demonstrate how responsible data ecosystems can accelerate both scientific discovery and clinical impact." A cornerstone of ACCESS-AD is its pan-European AD registry, which will leverage the established InRAD platform. This infrastructure will collect real-world data from more than 500 patients across a variety of health systems, capturing safety, clinical evolution and treatment outcomes under routine clinical conditions. The registry will also support a pilot study that tests the feasibility of combining DMTs with a multicomponent lifestyle intervention and advanced nutritional supplements from Nestlé, as well as a clinical prediction study of the once-daily oral therapy, blarcamesine. "ACCESS-AD is a holistic effort across private and public sectors," noted Professor Dag Aarsland from KCL, clinical co-Lead of the project.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a Phase I study led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, published today in Nature Medicine, the novel monoclonal antibody linavonkibart demonstrated the potential to overcome treatment resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple cancer types. The trial was led by Timothy Yap, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics and vice president and head of clinical development in MD Anderson's Therapeutics Discovery division. "This is a very exciting trial because we've been trying to effectively target this protein, called transforming growth factor-beta 1, for a long time," Yap said. "We've known that it helps tumors evade the immune system and develop resistance to immunotherapies but, until now, attempts to target it have failed. This is potentially a significant step in helping patients overcome resistance and benefit further from immunotherapies." Despite the tremendous impact that immunotherapies like pembrolizumab have had, many cancers are either unresponsive or develop treatment resistance. Research has found that often this resistance involves a protein called transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1). There have been previous efforts to develop therapies targeting TGFβ1, but most initial treatments also blocked TGFβ2 and TGFβ3, instead of just selectively blocking TGFβ1. Linavonkibart is a first-in-class selective immunotherapy that aims to overcome resistance by targeting and preventing activation of only TGFβ1. Linavonkibart also is a "fully human" antibody, meaning it is built exclusively from structures found naturally in the human body. This should make it safer and less likely to initiate an immune response against it, and the initial clinical data support this theory. This Phase I DRAGON trial was divided into three parts: The safety profile was manageable overall, and the combination therapy showed side effects consistent with the safety profile of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy, with only dermatological reactions identified as an additional risk. In the dose expansion cohort, the most common adverse effect at grade three or higher was rash, with only four patients experiencing any grade four adverse effects. In the dose expansion cohort of 78 heavily pre-treated patients who were progressing on prior immune checkpoint therapy, physicians observed multiple objective responses. According to Yap, there are multiple next steps to assess linavonkibart, including investigating whether it may be even more effective as an earlier-line treatment. It's notable that our Phase I trial involved a very heavily pretreated population with a prognosis of just over three months. We believe that this linavonkibart combination will be even more effective when given in earlier treatment settings, before significant resistance to immunotherapy has developed." Early data from this trial were presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.
