                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Along with Matt Kalish, the chart-topping DJ stands accused of federal consumer protection violations after driving sales for a crypto-based startup that ultimately collapsed. According to a lawsuit filed in federal court, Steve Aoki and DraftKings cofounder Matt Kalish deceived thousands of buyers by concealing financial relationships with a digital collectibles company that later went bankrupt, Front Office Sports reports. Plaintiff Evan Berger, who also serves as counsel in the case, reportedly purchased 26 MetaZoo tokens after viewing social media content from both defendants. His collection, once valued above $150,000, holds no market value today, per the suit. The complaint points to a livestreamed poker game at Aoki's residence where both defendants discussed the tokens' appreciation potential. Federal Trade Commission guidelines require influencers to clearly mark sponsored content and Instagram's parent company, Meta, maintains similar disclosure policies. The lawsuit alleges Kalish and Aoki ignored these standards while presenting themselves as “disinterested consumers” rather than compensated spokespeople, recommending MetaZoo NFTs on social media to inflate their value while failing to disclose that they were paid for the posts. The proposed class action seeks to represent “tens of thousands” of American buyers and Berger is reportedly requesting $5 million in baseline compensatory damages. A thought leader in the electronic music space, he writes stories at the intersection of music, technology and culture. He's also contributed words to Yahoo Life, UPROXX and Roland, one of the world's most iconic manufacturers and distributors of electronic musical instruments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapid plummet of a digital coin promoted by ex-New York City Mayor Eric Adams is drawing outrage from investors and crypto mavens who say the debut of the currency resembles a “rug pull” or “pump-and-dump” scheme. “NYC Token” fell a jaw-dropping 82% in value less than an hour after opening Monday afternoon — and as someone withdrew $2.5 million in liquidity from the asset. “This thing is about to take off like crazy,” Adams said in a video promo for the currency. The token — proceeds from which would go to unspecified efforts to fight antisemitism and so-called “anti-Americanism,” the ex-mayor bizarrely said — opened at $0.60 per share. But its value quickly plummeted to $0.11 as a party took out $2.5 million from the token. Observers noted that the sudden collapse bore the hallmarks of what is known as a “rug pull” scheme — similar to a “pump-and-dump” — in which unscrupulous entrepreneurs drain the value out of a cryptocurrency shortly after they launch it. About $1.5 million of those funds were later put back in the NYC Token. “Our market maker made adjustments in an attempt to keep trading running smoothly, and as part of this process, moved liquidity. “I truly have no explanation on why they did it,” he was quoted as saying. Maybe I'm overoptimistic and I don't want to believe that's the case, but maybe this is what it is.” Meanwhile, a possible trademark dispute is brewing that involves a Bronx-based entrepreneur who accused Adams of hijacking the NYC Token concept. Edward Cullen claims he pitched the idea for a cryptocurrency branded around New York City to Adams' team in June and had already trademarked the name “NYC Token” before the former mayor's public rollout. “We are going to pursue action, including sending a cease-and-desist within the next two days.” Adams and representatives for NYC Token have not publicly addressed the trademark allegations. Some critics say the episode highlights the growing risks of politicians lending their names and credibility to speculative financial ventures, warning that official stature can blur the line between public service and private promotion — and leave everyday investors exposed when hype overtakes fundamentals. “If a sitting president can attach their name to a speculative financial product, then every governor, mayor, and city councilmember now has the green light to do the same,” said Dean Lyulkin, CEO of Cardiff. “Once political credibility becomes a marketing asset, the line between public service and private promotion effectively disappears. You cannot argue that this behavior is inappropriate at the local level if it has already been tolerated at the top.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High Roller Technologies Inc (NYSE:ROLR), operator of the High Roller and Fruta online casino brands, has announced that it has entered into a binding Letter of Intent with crypto trading platform operator Crypto.com, for an exclusive partnership to launch an event-based prediction markets product in the US. The partnership will offer people the opportunity to trade event contracts across markets including finance, entertainment, and sports, through a legal, engaging, and user-friendly platform.

Late last year FanDuel Predicts launched (in five US states), backed by a partnership with derivatives market operator CME Group. Sports betting outfit DraftKings has also thrown its hat into the Prediction Markets sphere. Pairing the massive appeal of prediction markets with our strong distribution capabilities is an incredibly exciting opportunity, and we're looking forward to introducing our premium experience to consumers across the country.” The partnership remains subject to the execution of definitive agreements, which will include customary representations, warranties, conditions, covenants, and other provisions consistent with transactions of this nature, and there can be no assurance the parties will reach definitive agreements.

A weekly column by Atlantic Council President and CEO Frederick Kempe, Inflection Points focuses on the global challenges facing the United States and how to best address them. UkraineAlert is a comprehensive online publication that provides regular news and analysis on developments in Ukraine's politics, economy, civil society, and culture.

Econographics provides an in-depth look at trends in the global economy utilizing state-of-the-art data visualization tools. The good news from the World Bank's Global Findex Database 2025 is that 79 percent of adults globally and 75 percent in low- and middle-income economies (LMIEs) now have a financial account of some kind. Mobile phones are even more ubiquitous, with 86 percent of adults globally and 84 percent in LMIEs having one, which in most contexts can be used to access financial services. However, the majority of adults in LMIEs that have a financial account do not yet fully engage with the formal financial sector. Only 40 percent of adults in LMIEs (on average) saved formally and only 24 percent of adults in LMIEs (on average) borrowed from a formal financial service provider in the last year and even they do not necessarily have the type of credit they need.1Klapper et al., The Global Findex Database 2025, xxxiii, 152, 154, 218. There are, therefore, about three billion people who could actively engage in the formal financial sector, and they present both a challenge for financial sector leaders and an opportunity for accelerating inclusive growth. The main reasons adults in LMIEs do not use formal digital financial services are affordability, lack of trust in service providers, and lack of products to meet their needs. Rapid advances in digital public infrastructure (DPI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to directly tackle these challenges. Yet, there are potentially problematic aspects to these exciting innovations. DPI has the potential for loss of data privacy (if privacy by design is not embedded), for rent extraction (if not an open-source platform), and for government surveillance (if DPI safeguards are not central).5Zoran Jordanoski, “Safeguarding Digital Public Infrastructure: A Global Imperative for Sustainable Development,” United NationsUniversity Operating Unit on Policy-Driven Electronic Governance, July 9, 2025, https://unu.edu/egov/article/safeguarding-digital-public-infrastructure-global-imperative-sustainable-development. These guardrails are essential so new customers have affordable, appropriate products, can trust their money and data are safe, and have effective recourse mechanisms if problems occur.

But transaction costs remain too high—a problem that policymakers should tackle at upcoming meetings in Washington and Rio de Janeiro. Policymakers, investors, and innovators must advance a new financial inclusion agenda designed for the global majority. Cryptocurrencies and CBDCs have the potential to enhance financial inclusion. However, the lack of quantitative data makes it challenging to evaluate their impact. To assess their financial inclusion capacity, this paper builds a rubric for policymakers which includes layers of consideration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finance minister says digital innovation will be pursued in line with regulation and national interest The Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with SC Financial Technologies, which it described as an affiliated entity of World Liberty Financial. The agreement will allow dialogue and technical engagement around “emerging digital payment architectures”. Today, World Liberty Financial signed an MoU with the Ministry of Finance to explore innovation in digital finance, particularly the use of stablecoins for cross-border transactions, signalling growing global interest in Pakistan as a key market for digital assets. The development marks one of the first publicly announced partnerships between World Liberty Financial, a crypto based finance platform launched in September 2024, and a sovereign state. It also comes amid warming ties between Pakistan and the United States. Under the agreement, SC Financial Technologies will work with Pakistan's central bank to explore integrating its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments framework, allowing it to operate alongside Pakistan's own digital currency infrastructure, a source involved in the deal told Reuters. The announcement coincided with a visit to Pakistan by Zach Witkoff, co founder and chief executive of World Liberty Financial and chief executive of SC Financial Technologies. “Our focus is to stay ahead of the curve by engaging with credible global players, understanding new financial models, and ensuring that innovation, where explored, is aligned with regulation, stability, and national interest,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said. Stablecoins, which are digital tokens typically pegged to the US dollar, have expanded rapidly in recent years. Pakistan has been exploring digital currency initiatives as it seeks to reduce cash usage and improve cross border payments, including remittances, a key source of foreign exchange.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Names like ADA, TRX, and the surging newcomer DOGEBALL dominate discussions among traders hunting massive gains. Established players face headwinds, while fresh projects spark real excitement in this volatile space. This meme-powered token combines viral DOGE appeal with genuine utility on a custom-built Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain. The presale momentum builds fast, drawing investors eager for early entry into a project blending gaming thrills and low-fee transactions. The DOGEBALL ICO has launched strong, shattering expectations with rapid accumulation in Stage 1. This short four-month window ends May 2, 2026, creating built-in urgency unlike drawn-out sales elsewhere. Backed by Falcon Interactive—a global gaming powerhouse with hits on Apple and Google Play—the project gains serious promotion and blockchain access for millions of users. The addictive DOGEBALL game lets players hurl balls at characters, level up, climb leaderboards, and vie for shares of a $1M prize pot in $DOGEBALL tokens, with the top spot claiming $500k. High-yield staking delivers 80% rewards, turning holdings into passive income streams while the ecosystem grows. A $1000 investment at the presale price of $0.0003 secures roughly 3,333,333 tokens. Analysts eye ambitious post-launch targets, with some forecasting $1 as realistic amid gaming adoption and exchange listings, transforming the same $1000 into $3.33 million. Launch value hits $75,000, and a $1 target delivers $5 million—pushing potential toward life-changing multiples. This setup echoes early Dogecoin entries, where ground-floor positioning fueled explosive wealth. ADA hovers around $0.39 in early 2026, showing limited upside despite occasional bounces. Recent analyses point to bearish short-term trends, with prices consolidating near support levels and forecasts capping near-term gains around $0.40–$0.45. Ecosystem developments continue, but momentum stalls compared to broader market shifts. Longer-range outlooks vary widely, yet current performance reflects stagnation amid competition from faster networks. TRX trades near $0.30, posting modest gains in January 2026 but failing to ignite major rallies. As a top crypto for low-fee transactions, TRX benefits from consistent utility. Still, stagnation persists without catalysts to drive it decisively higher toward $1 in the near term. Established names like ADA and TRX offer stability but little thrill in today's market, leaving investors searching for the next big mover among top crypto options. DOGEBALL emerges as the standout presale, blending meme energy with live blockchain testing, gaming utility, and confirmed partnerships that position it for explosive growth. Head to the DOGEBALL website immediately, apply code DB50 for that 50% bonus, and secure a position in what could become the breakout story of 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price held steady on Wednesday, continuing a trend that has been going on in the past few weeks. ETH token rose to $3,340, and this trend may accelerate in the coming months as it has formed the highly bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, and the spot ETH ETF inflows have continued. Ethereum price technical analysis points to a surge The weekly timeframe chart shows that the ETH price tumbled to a low of $1.360 in April last year and then rebounded to a record high of $4,965 in August. Therefore, the most likely ETH price forecast is bullish as long as it remains above the right shoulder at $2,663. First, data shows that American investors have started buying spot ETH ETFs this week. The funds have now had over $12.57 billion in cumulative inflows, with their total assets rising to nearly $20 billion. Second, Ethereum has continued to gain its market share across all areas in the crypto industry, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which most analysts believe is the future of finance. Its market dominance has jumped to 76%, even as new chains have been launched in the past few years. They include networks like Base, Berachain, Katana, and Monad. Its RWA ecosystem has also continued to boom, with top companies like Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan using its chain. It has bought over 4 million tokens since July last year and is on track to hit its target of holding 6 million tokens over time. This raises the possibility that the company will change its goalpost and decide to accumulate more Ethereum over time. There are also signs that Ethereum is undervalued. For example, it has a market capitalization to DeFi TVL ratio of 2.64, much lower than Solana's 3.85 and BSC's 3.85. Ethereum apps now have $337B of capital actively deployed across lending, trading, and settlement.Historically, when this level of activity has existed on Ethereum, the network's valuation has not stayed far below it for long.That's because many of these applications require Ethereum price will also likely rebound as the developers work on the upcoming Glamsterdam and Hegota upgrades later this year. These upgrades will boost Ethereum's speed, making it a faster network. Indeed, there are now questions on the role of general-purpose layer-2 networks as Ethereum will soon match their speeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is warning that emerging “agentic AI” systems could introduce significant data protection challenges as developers and organizations push to automate more open-ended tasks. The assessment arrives in a new Tech Futures report exploring how autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents may evolve over the next two to five years, including applications across commerce, government, medicine, cybersecurity and consumer services. This capability allows systems to not just generate text or images, but to browse the web, make purchases, interact with other software and, eventually, other agents. Current use cases already include research automation, coding assistance, transaction planning and customer support. But as autonomy increases, so do concerns about privacy, accountability and governance. The ICO notes that agentic systems may operate with limited human oversight, increasing the likelihood of unexpected behaviour and making it harder to determine responsibility for harmful outcomes. The report identifies novel data protection risks, including special category data inference, expanded automated decision-making, ambiguous purpose specification, challenges for transparency, and new cybersecurity threat vectors. While highlighting risks, the ICO also points to innovation opportunities, including privacy-first agentic controls, data protection compliance tooling, trusted computing approaches and improved benchmarking. The regulator will now begin engaging industry through workshops, AI guidance updates, and cross-regulatory collaboration, including work with the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum and G7 data protection authorities. The report emphasizes that organizations deploying agentic systems remain legally responsible for data protection compliance, even as autonomy increases. It also stresses that governance frameworks built for traditional automation may not translate to multi-agent ecosystems. Its findings come as governments worldwide accelerate their AI regulatory agendas and private-sector adoption intensifies.</p>
