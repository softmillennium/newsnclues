                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025 Max Verstappen has been reflecting back on the season of his career in which he became "really upset" with himself. After making his debut at 17 years old for Toro Rosso in 2015, Verstappen was promoted to the main Red Bull outfit following the opening four races of 2016 and promptly won on his debut for the squad in Barcelona. While he scored another two victories towards the end of 2017, the beginning of the 2018 championship did not go entirely smoothly for the young driver, having been involved in an incident at each of the first six Grands Prix – including a collision with team mate Daniel Ricciardo in Azerbaijan. Asked during an appearance on Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast about which season he felt he had learned the most from – or faced the most struggles in – Verstappen explained: “2018, the start – the first seven or eight races. “[I was] making some mistakes myself and then you get into a negative spiral, you try to push even harder and it all just didn't work out, and [I was] being really upset with myself. “Then I had a turnaround in Montreal [topping all three practice sessions and ending the race in third], and I have to say I think from that day that's really where it clicked.” Pushed further on whether he could see the person he was going to develop into when he first arrived in F1, Verstappen answered: “No, because I don't think about [that]. The 28-year-old was also quizzed on the advice he would give his younger self, to which he responded: “Nothing. I would want him to make the same mistakes or go through the same tough times, good times, because if you know everything in advance it's really boring, and you get lazy as well if you know everything in advance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moments that made us laugh and cry in 2025 The American squad are making their Formula 1 debut this season, with experienced duo Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez returning to the grid to form their line-up. Cadillac will unveil the livery for their inaugural F1 campaign on February 8 during the Super Bowl, a few days before official pre-season testing begins in Bahrain, hence the special edition livery for the Barcelona running that takes place between 26-30 January. The one-off livery features a monochrome concept with geometric pattern in a gloss and matte sequence plus a large Cadillac crest draped over the rear to help disguise the aero surfaces. It is traditional for teams to run these camouflaged liveries in testing in a bid to mask aerodynamic details ahead of the season start, particularly ahead of a season when there have been sweeping changes to the regulations. President of General Motors Mark Reuss said: “Our new testing livery celebrates Detroit's design heritage and the power of the global Cadillac Formula 1 team, while keeping our design secrets under wraps. TWG combined with General Motors allows us to rethink the norm and introduce the team in bold new ways. "Debuting our race livery during a globally televised championship broadcast challenges convention and brings Cadillac Formula 1 to a global audience. "Paired with this special-edition testing livery designed by the GM Design studios, we're honoring automotive heritage while looking ahead as we build toward the 2026 season.” Cadillac are expected to shakedown their car at Silverstone this month ahead of heading to Barcelona for the all-team shakedown.</p>
