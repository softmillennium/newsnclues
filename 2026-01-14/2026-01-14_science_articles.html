(2026)Cite this article Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated scientific discovery1. Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel prizes2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, these trends establish the role of AI tools in science10. This advancement raises questions about the influence of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits11. To evaluate these questions, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labelled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across the natural sciences and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientists' engagement with one another by 22%. By consequence, adoption of AI in science presents what seems to be a paradox: an expansion of individual scientists' impact but a contraction in collective science's reach, as AI-augmented work moves collectively towards areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools seem to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.

(a) Structure of our deployed language model, which consists of the tokenizer, the core BERT model, and the linear layer. (b) Procedure of the two-stage model fine-tuning process, where we design specific approaches for constructing positive and negative data at each stage. We randomly sample 1320 papers and delegate three experts to scrutinize the identification results for each paper. We then draw the final expert label of each paper from the three experts according to the principle of the minority obeying the majority and validate the result of the language model with it. Results indicate strong consistency among experts and high accuracy with our identification results. Results show that AI papers consistently attract more citations over different eras (P < 0.001, n = 27,405,011), indicating a higher academic impact than non-AI papers. 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean, and the statistical tests use a two-sided t-test. Results show that in all 6 scientific disciplines, researchers adopting AI are more productive than their counterparts without AI (P < 0.001, n = 5,377,346). On average, researchers adopting AI annually publish 3.02 times more papers compared with those not using AI. 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean, and the statistical tests use a two-sided t-test. (a) The career role transition of researchers. We consider the last author of each paper as research project leader and researchers who have been research project leaders as established researchers. Researchers who have yet to lead a research project are junior researchers, and they have two potential role transition pathways in the future: (1) become established researchers (solid arrow), and (2) abandon academia (dashed arrow). (b) Change in the ratio of conceptual work across the research career, before and after becoming an established researcher. The ratio increases rapidly before the role transition to established researchers, while it remains stable and high after that transition. 99% CIs are shown as error bands centred at the mean. (a) AI research is associated with reduced research team sizes, averaging 1.33 fewer scientists (P < 0.001, n = 33,528,469). Specifically, the average number of junior scientists decreased from 2.89 in non-AI teams to 1.99 in AI teams (31.14%), while the number of established scientists decreased from 4.01 to 3.58 (10.77%). (b)-(d) Change in team size, average number of junior researchers, and average number of established researchers. These findings indicate that within the overall trend of increasing size of scientific research teams, AI adoption primarily contributes to a reduction in the number of junior scientists in teams, while a decrease in the number of established scientists is more moderate. (e) The average career age of team leaders in AI and non-AI papers. (f) The average career age of all involved established researchers in AI and non-AI papers. Results indicate that AI accelerates the transition from junior to established scientists, enabling AI-adopted researchers to become established at a younger age than those without AI. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as error bars or error bands centred at the mean. All statistical tests use a two-sided t-test. (a) (c) (e) Survival functions for the transition from junior to established researcher in (a) biology (n = 625,093), (c) medicine (n = 1,137,076), and (e) physics (n = 120,366). (b) (d) (f) Survival functions for the transition from junior researcher to leave academia in (b) biology (n = 625,093), (d) medicine (n = 1,137,076), and (f) physics (n = 120,366). All survival functions can be well-fit with exponential distributions, where the expected time for junior scientists to become established is shorter for those who adopt AI (P < 0.001), while the expected time for junior scientists to abandon academia is similar or slightly longer for those who adopt AI. Results indicate that AI not only provides junior scientists opportunities to become established scientists at a younger age, but also reduces the risk of their exiting academia early. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean. All statistical tests use a two-sided t-test. Here we visualize the embeddings of a small random sample of 2,000 papers, half of which are AI papers and half are non-AI papers. To eliminate randomness introduced by the t-SNE algorithm, here we simply pick out the first two dimensions of the high-dimensional embeddings to flatten them into a 2-D plot, and we provide 5 different random batches for each field to ensure robustness. As shown by the solid arrows and circular boundaries, the knowledge extent of AI papers is smaller than that of a comparable sample of non-AI papers, which is consistent across the fields studied in our analysis. Compared with conventional research, AI research is associated with a shrinkage in the collective knowledge extent of science, where the contraction of knowledge extent can be observed in more than 70% of over two hundred sub-fields (n = 1,000 samples in each subfield). For all subfields, 99% CIs are shown as error bars centred at the mean. In AI research, a small number of superstar papers dominate the field, with approximately 20% of top papers receiving 80% of citations and 50% receiving 95%. This unequal distribution leads to a higher Gini coefficient in citation patterns surrounding AI research (P < 0.001, n = 100 sampled paper groups for each discipline). Such disparity in the recognition of AI papers is consistent across all fields examined. For all panels, 99% CIs are shown as error bars or error bands centred at the mean. All statistical tests use a two-sided t-test. Supplementary Sections 1–4, Figs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ancient town comes with pyramids, buildings, stone columns, and a ball field. Though it is over 1,000 years old, this city wasn't known to the modern age. Its re-discovery comes thanks to airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and subsequent on-the-ground archeology. Tucked some 37 miles deep in the jungle, a research team—led by Ivan Ṡprajc, a professor of archaeology from Slovenia who has directed work on the Yucatan Peninsula since 1996—took info from the airborne scan to discover the true location of a 1,000-year-old Maya city complete with complex buildings, plazas, and even a ball game site. Highlighted by several pyramidal structures over 50 feet tall, the city is perched on a peninsula of high ground surrounded by extensive wetlands. “Between the two main plazas there is a complex made up of various low and elongated structures, arranged almost in concentric circles” Ṡprajc says in a statement translated from Spanish. It is highlighted by a pyramid rising 82 feet above the natural terrain. Researchers named the newly discovered city Ocomtún, “stone column” in Yucatec Maya. The multiple cylindrical columns discovered likely serving as entrances to upper rooms of buildings. The team also discovered an area for a ball field and the possibility of either markets or space for community rituals. Located within 18 to 31 miles of three other Maya cities discovered within the last decade, the exploration of Balamakú ecological reserve continues to offer up exciting finds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An unprecedented international research effort combining brain imaging and memory testing from thousands of adults is offering a clearer picture of how age-related brain changes affect memory. By bringing together data from multiple long-running studies, scientists were able to examine how memory performance shifts alongside structural changes in the brain over time. The analysis drew on more than 10,000 MRI scans and over 13,000 memory assessments from 3,700 cognitively healthy adults across 13 separate studies. The results -- which tracked people across a wide age range -- reveal that the link between brain shrinkage and memory decline is not simple or linear. The association grows stronger in later life and cannot be explained only by well-known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including APOE ε4. Together, the findings suggest that brain aging involves complex, widespread changes rather than damage driven by a single cause. Published in Nature Communications, the study titled "Vulnerability to memory decline in aging revealed by a mega-analysis of structural brain change" shows that memory-related brain changes extend far beyond one isolated region. People who experienced faster-than-average structural brain loss showed much steeper declines in memory. This suggests that once brain shrinkage passes a certain level, its impact on memory increases more rapidly instead of progressing at a steady pace. This accelerating effect appeared across many brain regions, not just the hippocampus. While the hippocampus remains especially sensitive, it functions as part of a broader system rather than acting alone. "By integrating data across dozens of research cohorts, we now have the most detailed picture yet of how structural changes in the brain unfold with age and how they relate to memory," said Alvaro Pascual-Leone, MD, PhD, senior scientist at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research and medical director at the Deanna and Sidney Wolk Center for Memory Health. These results suggest that memory decline in aging is not just about one region or one gene -- it reflects a broad biological vulnerability in brain structure that accumulates over decades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1687, English physicist Isaac Newton published his famous Law of Universal Gravitation. Thankfully, Albert Einstein came around in the early 20th century to help patch things up a bit with his Theory of General Relativity. But space is a big place, and even Einsteins sometimes meet their limit. One of the most well-known of these limits is a black hole's center, or singularity, where Einstein's famous theory appears to break down completely. Now, a study from scientists at South Korea's Sejong University suggests that another limit to Newton and Einstein's conception of gravity can be found in the orbital motions of long-period, widely separated, binary stars—also known simply as “wide binaries.” The results of this study were published in The Astrophysical Journal. After analyzing 26,500 wide binaries within 650 lightyears captured by the European Space Agency's Gaia space observatory, co-author Kyu-Hyun Chae discovered something strange—when these celestial objects achieved extremely low orbital accelerations around 0.1 nanometers per second squared, the observed accelerations were nearly 30 to 40 percent higher than Newton-Einstein models would predict. However, if these accelerations were above 10 nanometers per second squared, they followed the Newton-Einstein theory as predicted. Something weird is happening specifically at these ultra-low accelerations. Because scientists don't know anything about this hypothetical form of matter and energy that supposedly makes up a majority of the universe, it's possible that dark matter is influencing this strange gravitational interaction. However, Chae argues that Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND—first proposed by Israeli scientist Mordehai Milgrom in 1983—could explain (among other galactic anomalies) these low acceleration deviations. The most surprising element is that a MOND-influenced theory of gravity—also co-authored by Milgrom—explains this unexpected 1.4 times acceleration boost. Chae's study appears to be a big +1 in the pro column for Modified Newtonian Dynamics, but the theory is still just that—a theory. Are We Living in a ‘Hall of Mirrors' Universe?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sediment runoff, algae blooms, and organic debris can sharply reduce underwater light, sometimes transforming bright coastal waters into near night. To better understand these events, an international team of scientists has developed the first system designed to identify and compare what they call marine blackouts. These events are short-lived but intense periods of underwater darkness that can seriously disrupt kelp forests, seagrass meadows, and other marine organisms that depend on light to survive. "We have long known that light levels are critical for photosynthetic organisms -- like algae, seagrasses and corals -- and that factors that reduce light to the seafloor can impact them," said co-author Bob Miller, a research biologist at UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute. "This study creates a framework for comparing such events, which we call darkwaves." Until now, scientists lacked a shared method for evaluating extreme losses of underwater light across different regions. "Light is a fundamental driver of marine productivity, yet until now we have not had a consistent way to measure extreme reductions in underwater light," said lead author François Thoral, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waikato and Earth Sciences New Zealand. To build the framework, researchers analyzed long-term data from multiple coastal regions. The team also examined 21 years of seafloor light estimates derived from satellite data along New Zealand's East Cape. Across these areas, marine darkwaves ranged from brief events lasting only a few days to prolonged episodes that persisted for more than two months. In some cases, light reaching the seabed was almost completely eliminated. Many were associated with powerful storms and large-scale weather systems, including Cyclone Gabrielle. For years, scientists have focused on slow, long-term declines in water clarity as a major threat to coastal ecosystems. The new findings suggest that sudden darkwave events may be just as damaging. "Even short periods of reduced light can impair photosynthesis in kelp forests, seagrass and corals," Thoral said. "These events can also influence the behaviour of fish, sharks and marine mammals.

A 2,000-year-old stone wall unearthed in a gravel quarry in central Switzerland put those facts on display all over again, revealing an “archaeological sensation” that researchers hope will provide insights into the Romans as far north as Switzerland. The wall itself—found just a few centimeters below the surface—encompasses at least 5,300 square feet near Cham-Oberwil and points to what was once an entire building complex with various rooms. Roman buildings of similar dimensions were last excavated in the area almost 100 years ago. Throughout history, the location has proven popular for inhabitants. “We were also amazed that the top bricks were even visible above ground,” Gishan Schaeren, head of the Department of Prehistory and Prehistoric Archaeology at Archeology Society Zug, said in a statement. The fragments of amphorae, in which precious liquids such as wine, olive oil, and fish sauce were brought from the Mediterranean to Äbnetwald near Cham, show the extensive trade routes of Roman times. Additionally, the team also located gold fragments, probably originating from jewelry. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

A nurse works in the intensive-care unit at a hospital in China's Sichuan province during the COVID-19 pandemic. Michael Levin had just started working as a paediatric infectious-disease doctor in London when he received an urgent call from a hospital in Malta. It was the early 1980s, and a young boy had been brought in with symptoms of a severe infection that was spreading through his body, damaging multiple organs and tissues. But his doctors could find no trace of a pathogen. The boy was flown to Levin's hospital for further tests. “Everyone's exposed to them, but almost no one gets ill,” says Levin, who is now at Imperial College London. Despite aggressive treatment, the boy eventually passed away. This case illustrates a question that has plagued doctors for decades: why do some people become severely ill from infections that leave others unscathed? What is it about some people's immune systems that makes them susceptible? As it turned out, the boy from Malta had a brother and a cousin who had also fallen severely ill with mycobacteria infections. After years of searching, Levin and his colleagues eventually identified what made these children so sick: a genetic mutation affecting a receptor for interferon-γ, an immune molecule with myriad functions, including regulating inflammation1. Not long after that, a group in France discovered that similar mutations were responsible for rare cases of severe disease caused by another mycobacterial species — this time, a weakened form used as a tuberculosis vaccine2. It might seem obvious that differences in each person's immune system can affect how well they fight off pathogens. But uncovering the specific causes of this variation has enabled researchers to find ways to treat — and even prevent — severe infections that used to seem like random cases of bad luck, says Isabelle Meyts, an oncologist and immunologist who studies IEIs at the university KU Leuven in Belgium. The discoveries have already begun to change clinical practice, for instance allowing doctors to genetically screen people for relevant mutations or supplement missing immune factors. And scientists are continuing to piece together the many ways in which genetic factors contribute to infectious diseases — especially in life-threatening cases. “What we're realizing more and more is that there are probably inherited factors that predict who's going to have severe reactions,” says Michael Abers, a physician-scientist studying infectious disease at Montefiore Einstein in New York City. The realization that microorganisms, invisible to the naked eye, could make people ill spurred public-health measures such as better hygiene, vaccines and anti-microbial drugs, which drastically improved outcomes for people with infectious diseases. But even with these tools, there are still people — particularly some children and older people — who become sick and die from infections that are typically preventable or treatable, suggesting that there are limitations to focusing mostly on pathogens in the fight against infectious disease. Researchers have since discovered that one of the most important determinants of infection susceptibility might be a person's genes. SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (yellow) infect a cell (blue).Credit: NIAID/NIH/SPL Among the most famous demonstrations of genetic mutations driving infection outcome is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), an inherited disease that leaves people without a functioning immune system and that is linked to mutations in more than a dozen genes. If left untreated, it typically leads to death before the age of two. But inherited mutations that can cause problems in the immune system are much more common. Over the past few decades, researchers have found inborn errors of immunity linked to more than 500 genes3. In addition to infectious-disease susceptibility, these mutations are involved in other immune-system abnormalities, including autoimmune diseases and allergies. Some mutations dampen the immune system and diminish its ability to fight off infections. Although some IEIs can cause a generalized vulnerability to pathogens, most of them put people at risk from specific microbes, such as mycobacteria, avian influenza virus, herpes simplex virus and the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. “Each infection has a different set of mechanisms,” says Steven Holland, physician-scientist specializing in infectious disease at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. The mutations known so far tend to cause severe disease, although some have been linked to recurrent milder infections. For example, a mutation in the gene encoding CCR5, a receptor on the surface of white blood cells, makes people resistant to HIV4 (although it increases the risk of severe infection with West Nile virus). In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear that some infected people became severely ill, whereas others got barely a sniffle. A massive consortium of scientists, led by paediatrician and immunologist Jean-Laurent Casanova at the Rockefeller University in New York City, discovered that around 10% of people with severe COVID-19 harboured autoantibodies — rogue proteins that turn against a person's own body. Casanova and his colleagues have since found the same autoantibodies in a subset of people who develop severe disease from seasonal influenza, West Nile and many other diseases, as well as in those who experience rare adverse reactions to live vaccines, such as the yellow fever vaccine. It's not known exactly why and how autoantibodies develop. Some scientists, including Casanova, suspect that they might be the result of inherited or acquired mutations. He and others have identified some mutations that can give rise to these autoantibodies, such as deficiencies in various interferon-related genes. Whether such mutations can account for the majority of severe cases of these diseases remains to be seen. Researchers are still working out the complex ways in which genetics contributes to infection outcome. Having a mutation doesn't always make someone vulnerable: IEIs can behave unpredictably. Many people carry immunodeficiency-related mutations without ever experiencing their effects — a phenomenon known as ‘incomplete penetrance'. And although most IEIs with severe effects become apparent in childhood, some might lie dormant for decades. Scientists are still working to identify which factors influence the severity of IEIs. The team also found evidence that this process might be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, which are influenced by environmental factors — suggesting that, not only might the same IEIs manifest differently in different people, but the effects of these mutations could change over a person's lifetime. Bogunovic's team is currently searching for the factors, such as inflammation or certain infections, that might control this variable allele expression.

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Sushmita Pathak & Alex Sugiura What do ready-to-bake cinnamon rolls, most french fries and many premade salad dressings have in common? Until fairly recently many of us might have been concerned about how much oil those foods contained rather than what kind.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Everyone from so-called wellness influencers on social media to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, wants us to believe that seed oils are uniquely bad for us. The health secretary has gone so far as to say, without evidence, that seed oils are toxic. And some restaurants, including the salad chain Sweetgreen, are increasingly boasting of seed-oil-free options. So today we dig into seed oils: What are they, and are they secretly killing us? Hi, thanks for taking the time to speak with us today. Pierre-Louis: One of the reasons we wanted to speak with you is you're something of an expert on seed oils, which have in recent years become the villain of, you know, quote, unquote, “wellness” social media. Decker: Basically, the fats we eat could come from animals, so that would be things like lard and tallow and butter; or they can come from fruit, and that would be things like olive and avocado; or they can come from seeds, and those seeds could be soybean, corn, canola, sunflower. Pierre-Louis: But when I'm looking in my kitchen cabinet I'm seeing, for the most part, liquid oils that all look exactly the same. Decker: Yeah, they're gonna have a couple differences. There are some cold-pressed seed oils, but they're pretty uncommon. So because they're refined or not refined could be one of the reasons that their composition will change. Decker: Which is a monounsaturated fatty acid. Decker: The seed oils, you can find a very broad range of fatty acid composition. So canola oil would be very high in monounsaturated ... But then the others, like corn and soybean and the safflower or sunflower, these are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the most common one of those is linoleic acid ... Pierre-Louis: Okay, so for a regular person who's just trying to figure out what they should eat in the grocery store aisle, these fatty acids, do they matter? Decker: Yeah, so there's really good human clinical data that show that the polyunsaturated fatty acids will decrease the LDL cholesterol in your blood. Because I have it on good authority from our human health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that Americans are being “unknowingly poisoned” by seed oils. [CLIP: RFK Jr. speaks in an August 24, 2024, interview on Fox & Friends Weekend: “Seed oils are one of the, the most unhealthy ingredients that we have in foods.... Seed oils, they are associated with all kinds of very, very serious illnesses, including body-wide inflammation.”] Decker: Yeah, there's a lot of theories about this. Decker: Whereas the omega-3s, most of which we would get from fish oil ... So even though this, this is a theory and it's been shown in animals, when you actually look at human clinical trials ... And really, the only time you ever see hexane being a, a problem is with workers in factories that are exposed ... Decker: To very high levels of hexane. Pierre-Louis: From the outside it often seems, when I go to the grocery store and I look at, you know, these seed oils, they're often lower-cost than some of the other oils that we're being pushed to consume instead. And I'm wondering—it feels like there's a little bit of classism at play here and this idea that just because it's expensive, it must be better for us. Decker: So the best example is extra-virgin olive oil. Decker: So the yield is somewhat low. Plus, olives can only be grown in warm climates, so there's ... Decker: Limitation of how much that's out—there's actually some shortages that are occurring right now because of climate change. So they typically will be more expensive. And when you think about olive oil it's really—has a lot of flavor to it, and that flavor is very desirable in the olive oil. Decker: And when they're extracted with hexane this gets all the oil out, so it's very, very efficient. But it takes out some other fats—it takes out things like phospholipids and free fatty acids and fats that aren't desirable in the oil. So the refining process removes these other lipid components from the oil, and this makes the oil very bland in flavor; it gives it really good cooking properties, like very high smoke point; and so it makes these oils very, very versatile. Pierre-Louis: And isn't that also why people love deep-frying in peanut oil, because it has a high smoke point? When you get into high saturated fats they would be a little bit higher ... You don't wanna make your sugar cookies with olive oil. Decker: You don't want the oil to have flavor. One thing about olive oil, it's actually not good to high-temperature-cook olive oil 'cause it's got a low smoke point and you'll lose a lot of the flavor that you're paying for. So it's, like, you should use it in cold applications or in—you know, you can use it in a frying pan, which doesn't get too hot. Decker: Is if you heat 'em too high and they start to smoke, you're now decomposing the oil into other compounds, which have health risks. So really managing your oil when you're cooking with it and not letting it get too high of temperature and start to smoke is also very important. But I guess it feels like there's a health halo around kind of the more expensive oils and we're vilifying sort of the cheaper, more accessible oils. Decker: Yeah, I mean, extra-virgin olive oil does have this halo, and there's a lot of good research that shows that it has health benefits beyond just normal oils. A really good contrast is your favorite, avocado oil. Which, to be clear, I am only vilifying because it wants me dead, so. So avocado oil doesn't really have any data that shows that it has major health benefits, and actually, its fatty acid composition, in terms of the amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, is very similar to canola oil. And so if it's refined, then you're taking out other potential beneficial compounds in the oil, and it becomes even more like canola oil, except it's probably four times more expensive. So it's more that people are making these cold-pressed oils into being these superfoods when there's really no evidence to show, especially with avocado oil, that that's true. Pierre-Louis: That's, A, awesome to know, and, B, I hope the word gets out because people are putting avocado oil in everything for no reason [Laughs], as someone who's allergic. They're really pushing for us to use animal fats, like butter or rendered beef, a.k.a. You've probably heard that the fast-food chain Steak 'n Shake, for example, has said it's gonna eliminate seed oils in favor of beef tallow. And actually, if you go on the website, they're selling jars of beef tallow. And this kind of makes me think—Steak 'n Shake is just fundamentally processed fast foods. And I can't imagine that even if you were to switch whatever oil they were using before for a, quote, unquote, “healthier” oil, it's gonna make that much big of a difference in the health of ordinary people. Decker: Yeah, there's two parts of this controversy. So especially if you were to replace polyunsaturated fats with saturated fats, you would decrease the benefit of the healthy polyunsaturated fats in your diet. However, on the other side, there's an oxidation that occurs in oils, and when those oils oxidize they start to decompose into a whole variety of compounds, some of which, in animal studies, have shown to have some toxicity. So if you do something, like, in, uh, food-service operations and you deep-fry foods with these highly polyunsaturated fatty acids, they can oxidize and produce these products, where if you use something like tallow, which is saturated, it's much more stable against the oxidation and doesn't present, again, that risk. Now, as long as you take care of the oil that you're using in the fryer, there's no real risk there. Pierre-Louis: And what does “used properly” mean? Decker: It just means you have to make sure that you maintain the oil in the freshest state possible. Good food-service operations will actually filter and clean their oil on a regular basis. Pierre-Louis: In a way you're saying that using beef tallow gives fast-food restaurants an easier margin, so they're able to, essentially, use older oil than they would if they were using a seed oil. And it costs a lot of money to fill up that fryer with oil, as you can imagine, so the longer you can make your oil last, the more money you'll save. Now, another part of beef tallow is that beef tallow can have very positive flavors to it. Decker: So for many years McDonald's used beef tallow. But many times if you go to fancy restaurants, you can get fries that are cooked in beef tallow—or even duck fat ... Pierre-Louis: And it also just sort of seems like for your everyday, you're not looking for a flavor, maybe you're making a stir-fry, a seed oil is fine. Pierre-Louis: And to be clear, I love a good duck-fat french fry; they are very tasty. But I'm also not under the belief system that a potato deep-fried in duck fat is heart-healthy. And I think the thing that, with seed oils in particular, is many of the people who are vilifying them is they're making an explicit health claim and telling people to eat diets that are really heavy in these saturated fats and to really pivot away from eating, you know, canola oil or oils that are, for many people, lower-cost, more accessible and—it seems to be, based on the available evidence—better for our health. Decker: Yeah, I mean, I would say that the influencers who have had so many negative comments about seed oil, those aren't really based on strong scientific evidence. And you know, like you said, the recommendation should really be, “Eat less fried food,” right, because fried food's gonna be, generally, very high in calories. So the messaging is—seems to be all messed up. We shouldn't worry about, “Is seed oil better than tallow?” We should be worried about people that eat so much fried food in their diet. Join us on Friday, when we'll dig into Venezuela's oil reserves and why the U.S. seems to want it.

(2026)Cite this article Intra-articular RNA therapeutics have shown promise in osteoarthritis (OA); however, maximizing their efficacy requires targeted delivery to degenerating cartilage within focal lesions. As OA progresses, cartilage degeneration worsens, necessitating disease-responsive targeting with enhanced delivery in advanced stages. Here we develop an anionic nanoparticle (NP) strategy for targeting glycosaminoglycan loss, a hallmark of OA's progression that reduces cartilage's negative charge. These NPs selectively diffuse and accumulate into matrix regions inversely correlated with glycosaminoglycan content owing to reduced electrostatic repulsion, a strategy we term ‘matrix inverse targeting' (MINT). In a mouse model of OA, intra-articular delivery of luciferase messenger RNA-loaded MINT NPs demonstrated disease-severity-responsive expression. Using this strategy, we delivered ghrelin mRNA, as ghrelin has shown chondroprotection properties previously. Ghrelin mRNA-loaded MINT NPs reduced cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone thickening and nociceptive pain. Our findings highlight the potential of ghrelin mRNA delivery as a disease-modifying therapy for OA and the platform's potential for lesion-targeted RNA delivery responsive to disease severity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This substance is produced by heat-loving cyanobacteria when they are exposed to UV-A, UV-B, and salty conditions. Unlike other known mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), this compound is created through a distinct biosynthesis pathway. The finding offers new possibilities for industrial biotechnology focused on producing natural UV-filtering ingredients. To cope with extreme stress, they generate a wide range of chemical compounds. MAAs help protect cells from sun damage and act as antioxidants by neutralizing stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although these molecules share a basic structural framework, their variations give rise to different biological activities and functions. As concerns increase over UV exposure and rising skin cancer rates, scientists are searching for safer compounds that offer effective sun protection. Conventional chemical sunscreens can block UV rays, but they are also linked to allergic reactions and other unwanted side effects. MAAs stand out because they are biocompatible and considered safe for human use. These qualities make them promising candidates for sustainable biotechnology and large-scale production of natural sunscreen alternatives. Beyond identifying a new molecule, the research sheds light on how these organisms adapt to extreme environments. During laboratory experiments, one strain known as Gloeocapsa species BRSZ produced a previously unknown UV-absorbing compound when exposed to UV-A and UV-B light. The compound, identified as β-glucose-bound hydroxy mycosporine-sarcosine (GlcHMS326), was then examined in detail to understand its structure and function. GlcHMS326 is notable for undergoing three distinct chemical modifications: glycosylation, hydroxylation, and methylation. These modifications have not been previously reported in MAAs derived from cyanobacteria. Genetic analysis revealed that the cyanobacteria responsible for producing this compound contain a unique set of genes linked to these chemical changes. Production of GlcHMS326 increases significantly when the cyanobacteria are exposed to UV-A, UV-B, and high salt conditions. Although the organisms originate from hot springs, this specific compound is not triggered by heat stress. The chemical modifications found in GlcHMS326 contribute to its unusual structure and enhanced performance. Methylation is known to improve the stability, UV absorption, and antioxidant activity of MAA compounds. The study offers new insight into how cyanobacteria in extreme environments have evolved specialized metabolic pathways to produce effective natural UV-protective compounds. This unique MAA appears to play an important role in helping Gloeocapsa species tolerate environmental stress and likely serves several functions within these thermophilic cyanobacteria. Our recent study underscores that extremophilic cyanobacteria are not only ecologically important but also represent a key area of research for multiple disciplines." The newly identified compound stands out because of its versatility and potential for sustainable, large-scale production using cyanobacterial "biofactories." It could serve as an alternative to certain synthetic UV filters that raise environmental concerns, helping advance the development of more eco-friendly sunscreens. Its antioxidant properties also suggest possible uses in anti-aging products, skincare formulations, and pharmaceuticals. "This discovery reminds us that nature still holds many chemical surprises. Extremophilic cyanobacteria reveal uncommon molecules that can inspire new directions in basic science and sustainable biotechnology," concludes Prof. Kageyama. He has published 70 research articles and authored or co-authored five books. Her work focuses on how extremophiles adapt to harsh environments, the discovery of new compounds produced by these organisms, and metabolic engineering for biotechnological applications.
