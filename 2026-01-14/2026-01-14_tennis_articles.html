                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A tennis player learned Wednesday not to celebrate victory before the match is really won.Before Sebastian Ofner lost in Australian Open qualifying, the 29-year-old Austrian had raised his arms and walked toward the net after taking a 7-1 lead in the decisive tiebreaker against Nishesh Basavareddy.The chair umpire sent Ofner back to continue playing the super tiebreaker until he got at least 10 points—not seven—and was two points ahead.

When your brain calls match point before the umpire does... pic.twitter.com/r1i49K1k2V Minutes later, Basavareddy completed a 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (11) win—after Ofner had two match-point chances—and the 20-year-old American did an apparent choking gesture at the net with both hands on his neck. "I saw him tense up a little bit," Basavareddy said of Ofner's reaction to the score mishap, adding "generally when that happens, you start overthinking like, ‘Oh, I thought I already won the match, through to the next round.' So, yeah, that definitely gave me a little bit of hope. "Basavareddy now faces George Loffhagen of Britain for a place in the main draw first round—where the American took the first set off Novak Djokovic one year ago.The 131st-ranked Ofner has never won a main-draw match at the Australian Open, though he reached the fourth round at Roland Garros in 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek, Alexander Zverev, Amanda Anisimova, Elena Rybakina and Nick Kyrgios were also among the stars eliminated from contention, with the ATP's world No. Gauff was joined by the likes of two-time reigning men's champion Jannik Sinner and Frances Tiafoe in not managing to put their serves in the box. Amateur Jordan Smith of the Castle Hill Tennis Club in New South Wales ultimately won it all, defeating Joanna Garland—who had dropped her women's singles qualifying opener Monday—to take home the big pay day.“I can't speak.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top seeded American clinched his first match win of 2026 in straight sets; No. AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Eighth-ranked Ben Shelton "knocked off the rust" in his first match of 2026 on Wednesday with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Francisco Comesana in the ATP Tour event in Auckland, New Zealand.As the top-seeded player, the American had a bye through the first round of ATP 250 tournament which he has chosen to start his season in each of his last four years.With his coach and father Brian Shelton and his partner, U.S. women's soccer team star Trinity Rodman courtside, Shelton saved a set point in the first set to beat 68th-ranked Argentina player in 1 hour, 42 minutes.Shelton had 12 aces and won 78% of first-serve points but his game showed signs of recent inactivity. "I feel great, knocked off a little bit of rust but just feel great to be back playing, back competing," Shelton said. "I think it's great when you get to play a competitive match, feel the tension at certain points of the match and then obviously get a win and give yourself the opportunity to play again."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys improved as the match progressed in her first meeting with Tereza Valentova to earn herself a straight-sets win, setting up a showdown with Victoria Mboko in the Adelaide quarterfinals. Madison Keys wasn't at her sharpest early in her second-round match against Tereza Valentova, but she settled in and pulled away for a 6-4, 6-1 win in 1 hour and 24 minutes to reach the Adelaide quarterfinals for the second straight year. The event's reigning champion overcame seven double faults and saved five break points to secure the first set in 49 minutes. Valentova pushed to stay in it, but Keys ripped a forehand return winner off the 18-year-old's second serve to break for a 2-0 lead in the second set. From there, she won four of the final five games to close out a hard-earned victory. “You know, it kind of sucks,” Keys said with a laugh in her on-court interview. “So you definitely have to just expect them to play some really great tennis, and like I said, try to lean on experience in those big moments and just kind of hope that that gets you across the finish line.” "I'm actually quite looking forward to it," Keys said in her press conference. So definitely everyone's kind of had their eyes out for her a little bit. "It's going to be a really tough match. But first, here's how the American got it done on Wednesday: From 40-15 down while trailing by a break in the opening set, she rallied to deuce, earned a break point and converted with a forehand winner taken right off of Valentova's racket to level at 3-3. She kept leaning on that forehand throughout the match. In all, Keys converted five of her six break points. Tale of two sets: After a shaky start on serve, the World No. Keys landed just 54% of her first serves, hit seven double faults and was broken twice in the opening set. But the second set told a different story. Though she still struggled to locate her first serve at times, her second serve became less vulnerable, and she limited herself to just two double faults. She didn't face a single break point in the second set and saw the rest of her game improve as a result. After committing 20 unforced errors in the first set, she cut that number to seven in the second set as she cruised to victory. "But I think the first serve also got a little bit more effective and I was able to do a little bit more damage with it, just kind of create a little bit more opportunities on those first balls. "Then I think being able to kind of take advantage of those early break opportunities and really get a lead I think kind of helped me just take the momentum and keep running with it." Entering Wednesday's match, it was fair to wonder if Jaqueline Cristian had a Daria Kasatkina problem. In their two completed meetings, the Romanian had lost both -- though Kasatkina was ranked much higher on both occasions. Cristian survived a chaotic first set that featured just one combined hold to nine breaks -- including six straight to open the match -- before running away with a 6-4, 6-0 win in 1 hour and 31 minutes. Kasatkina, meanwhile, struggled mightily on serve, finishing with nine double faults. She'll face another Australian in the quarterfinals in Kimerly Birrell, who advanced after Marketa Vondrousova withdrew due to injury ahead of their second-round match. Cristian and Birrell have split their two previous meetings, with the Romanian scoring a dominant 6-0, 6-1 victory last year at Roland Garros. Madison Keys improved as the match progressed in her first meeting with Tereza Valentova to earn herself a straight-sets win, setting up a showdown with Victoria Mboko in the Adelaide quarterfinals.</p>
