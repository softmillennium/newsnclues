Trump's Second Term:

Federal agents searched the home of a Washington Post reporter who allegedly obtained and reported on classified information from a Pentagon contractor who is currently in jail, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

Bondi didn't name the reporter, who the Washington Post identified as Hannah Natanson. Natanson, who was at her home in Virginia at the time of the search on Wednesday, was told she was not a target of the probe, according to a Washington Post storyBloomberg Terminal on the matter.</p>

Alphabet Inc.'s Google said its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant can now proactively tap into users' data across Gmail, Search, Photos and YouTube, an attempt to make its consumer-facing AI product more personalized.

Using this extensive digital paper trail, the new feature — called Personal Intelligence — is designed to “make Gemini uniquely helpful,” Josh Woodward, a vice president overseeing the Gemini app, Google Labs and AI Studio, wrote in a blog post published Wednesday.</p>

Trump's Second Term:

A Citi credit card.

Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said the lender wants to cooperate with President Donald Trump's affordability push but doesn't support his proposed cap on credit card fees.

A “cap would likely result in a significant slowdown in the economy,” Mason said Wednesday on a call with reporters after the bank reported fourth-quarter results. He added that affordability is an important issue that Citi wants to collaborate with the administration on, but “an interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added. If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported. The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30 per share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve have "grave" ramifications for the global financial system, a former European Central Bank governor has told CNBC. Jean-Claude Trichet, who is also a former governor of the Bank of France, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday that the Trump administration is "trying to change the game" by upending the long-held consensus of central bank independence that has held in developed economies for almost 50 years. On Sunday, Fed chair Jerome Powell revealed the Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation into the $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters. On Tuesday, global central bank heads — including the Bank of England's Andrew Bailey and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde — issued a joint statement defending Powell. Trichet compared Powell's treatment to how monetary policy is made in certain emerging markets with weak institutions, warning that the "situation is extremely grave." "A Federal Reserve that is the most obedient servant of the executive branch is not what is expected in the U.S. Constitution. Bank of Finland governor Olli Rehn said central bank independence is a "cornerstone" of financial and price stability. "That would certainly have global ramifications and of course all of us, including Europe, would have to take that into account in our own decisions to safeguard price stability and economic stability more broadly," Rehn told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday. Trichet highlighted the "bipartisan consensus" in the U.S. to "spend more and more" as a key contributor to economic and political vulnerability, as investors grow wary of financing deficits and huge debt-to-GDP ratios. We are in a situation where the debt outstanding as a proportion of GDP, public and private, is higher at the moment… [than] just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers," he said. He added: "We are in a situation of great vulnerability of the global economy. We have also to take that into account. Citi warned that risks to central bank independence from populist governments could also spread beyond the U.S. As the weighted average maturity of gilts and European government bonds continues to shorten, with fewer investors wanting to buy longer-term 30-year paper, debt servicing costs have become more sensitive to policy-rate decisions, they wrote in a Tuesday note. That, in turn, could lead to greater pressure from future populist governments to lower rates, they added, writing: "Although, ECB and BoE independence is not currently under question, this cannot be taken for granted for the longer-term."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airbnb has tapped Ahmad Al-Dahle, former head of generative artificial intelligence at Meta Platforms, as its new technology chief, CEO Brian Chesky announced on Wednesday. "With Ahmad, we are really, really excited because we have an opportunity to do AI right for travel, to do AI right for e-commerce," Chesky told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. Al-Dahle previously ran Meta's older GenAI unit and was later appointed co-head of AI products when the social media company divided the unit after developers poorly received its Llama 4 model. Meta later hired Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang as part of a $14.3 billion deal to bolster its AI strategy. Former tech chief Ari Balogh stepped down in December after more than seven years at the company. Airbnb is in the midst of a major transformation as it attempts to push beyond its reputation as a short-term rental platform. In May, the company overhauled its app, bringing services like catering and personal training to the platform. The company later added direct messaging and updated its AI chatbot. "AI is 24/7, speaks every language, can learn from millions and millions of customer actions to help you. "And imagine one day Airbnb is this travel concierge, this companion that's with you the entire trip. Chesky, who is a close friend of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has also shared aspirations to integrate ChatGPT into the platform. However, he told CNBC in October that the chatbot is "not quite robust enough." Al-Dahle fits into the company's mission to use its technology and AI to foster human connection, Chesky wrote in his post. He "shares our belief that technology should serve people—not the other way around—and that its highest purpose is to bring us closer together," he said. He graduated from the University of Waterloo in Canada. "He connects big ideas with technical depth, highly values design, and believes engineering should be a true strategic partner in everything we do," Chesky wrote in a blog post.

Narrator: There was no fraud.

The Department of Justice is assembling a first-ever national voter database. It has demanded that states turn over their complete voter registration lists — loaded with private information such as driver's license and Social Security numbers linked to names, home addresses and dates of birth. It has also turned the federal immigration database into what it calls a national “voter verification” tool to remove large numbers of voters from the rolls. 

Each of these moves evades federal privacy protections, but they might not seem objectionable to many Americans. After all, the government already knows much of this information, plus our TSA facial profile and our tax and business information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The looming U.S. Supreme Court decision on the legality of many of President Donald Trump's tariffs has companies on edge as they eye potential refunds, but the ruling also could quickly influence the volume of trade to the U.S. ahead of Chinese New Year, according to logistics experts. The freight industry in the U.S. has been in a rate recession due to lower container volumes after companies frontloaded products to soften the impact of tariffs. If the tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are ruled to be illegal by the Supreme Court, imports to the U.S. may rise as companies feel more confident about their cash situation and seek an opening to buffer inventory ahead of any revised tariff plan from the Trump administration, which officials said will be ready to go and accomplish its existing trade goals. "If the IEPPA tariffs were to be removed from all imported goods, there would certainly be an increase in imports," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics. "Especially for goods recently being sourced in higher-tariffed countries," he said. The Supreme Court issued three decisions on Wednesday morning, but the tariffs case was not among them. While Trump's trade war hasn't slowed Chinese trade with other nations — it just reported a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus — global ocean container volumes to the U.S. tracked by SONAR show a 14% decrease year over year. Project44's January Tariff Report estimates U.S. imports from China fell 28 percent year-over-year, while exports to China dropped 38 percent in 2025. The Supreme Court decision comes at a critical time of year for supply chain management decisions within companies because factories shut down in China for a month in February for the Lunar New Year. "If the Supreme Court does rule the tariffs illegal, this will absolutely impact orders with an increased demand for bookings for three reasons," said Brian Bourke, chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics. Second, we fully expect other tariff provisions to be used, but there are limits and implementation timelines that will encourage companies to 'beat the clock' again, and third is the expected infusion of future cash to fund these purchases." If the tariffs are ruled illegal, the Court of International Trade has the legal authority to require refunds are paid to U.S. importers and retain jurisdiction over claims for refunds for a two-year statute of limitations period. At the same time, the Trump administration has said if the Supreme Court rules against it, there is already a plan in place to implement tariffs using other legal provisions. Smaller companies would be expected to act first. "Small and medium-sized businesses must start ordering early compared to the larger businesses because of their planning and smaller staff," said Eytan Buchman, CMO of Freightos. Based on its analysis covering five years of Lunar New Year ordering data, Freightos would expect a surge of orders from small and medium-sized businesses to kick in very soon if a ruling against Trump's tariffs is issued. "Normally, we see a massive spike in importer activity three to four weeks ahead of Chinese New Year," said Buchman. "This means U.S. small and medium-sized businesses have until January 20 to plan their shipment." A recent survey from Freightos indicates that small and medium-sized businesses won't all necessarily begin resourcing from China. Respondents said if the tariffs were ruled illegal by the Supreme Court, they would broaden their global sourcing base and evaluate high-quality, lower-cost suppliers in new regions without tariff-related cost penalties. Others mentioned they would move production back to China. A recent CNBC Supply Chain survey showed there was no bump in additional orders from China in November or December after a trade truce between the two nations was announced on October 30, despite expectations by logistics managers there could be a surge in new orders. Warehouse inventories tracked on the Logistic Managers' Index show a strong contraction in warehouse inventories by 17.4% month over month. "Right now, there is a certain amount of defeatism because they feel worse off than a year ago. But not all players within the supply chain are convinced that the Court's decision will be a major swing factor in trade volumes to the U.S. IMC Logistics tells CNBC it is seeing strong volumes from Asia to the West Coast and does not foresee a decline in volumes as retailers, manufacturers, and wholesalers are actively restocking after a robust holiday season. "Import volumes have continued to demonstrate strength through the end of the year and into January 2026," said Brian Kobza, IMC's chief commercial officer. Kobza added that because of the time it takes for orders to be made and then travel across the ocean, any impact on higher container volumes would not be seen for roughly 45 days. "We do not believe the ruling will impact total import volumes either way based on how trade reacted in 2025," he said. "If the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, there may be a small bump, but nothing dramatic appears to be coming," said Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA.

The great middle manager flattening is in full swing, and those who remain are seeing their dominions balloon. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities. In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Iran's future hangs in the balance as civil unrest gathers steam, its powerful ally Russia can do little but watch and wait as the U.S. ponders its next move against the Islamic Republic. On Tuesday, he repeated that threat, warning the U.S. would take "very strong action" if Iran executed arrested protestors. Russia will be focused on how events unfold in Iran given Tehran's position as a key strategic, military,  economic and trade partner for Moscow in the Middle East. The prospect of another ally falling in the Middle East will be a worrying one for Moscow, particularly after it has seen its alliances with Venezuela, Syria and the Caucasus upended recently, denting its power and influence abroad. "Moscow sees the potential loss of Iran as a much more significant risk to both its regional national posture than it saw the loss of Syria, Venezuela, or arguably its influence in Armenia over the last few years," Max Hess, founder of political risk consultancy Enmetena Advisory, told CNBC on Tuesday. "The reason for this is because Iran is itself a regional power projector, which offers Russia a platform to build alliances and expand its own influence," he said. Mario Bikarski, senior analyst of Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed that any regime collapse would be worrying for Moscow, and could also unleash wider regional instability in the Caucasus region that separates Russia and Iran. But [this time] the pressure has been building up, and it's not only domestic, it's also external," he told CNBC on Tuesday. "Should the Iranian regime fall, Russia would probably have to scramble and find new ways to ensure that instability does not reach its borders, and also that it's maintaining some influence in the region," he said. If a leadership vacuum emerged in Iran and rival factions vied for power, leading to further violence and unrest, that would mean "big security trouble for Russia and for a lot of other countries in the region," Bikarski warned. Neither the Kremlin nor Russian President Vladimir Putin have commented on the events unfolding in Iran, although a muted response from Russia's leadership is not uncommon when it's trying to gauge the outcome of a particular event and how its strategic interests are impacted. Russian state media has downplayed coverage of the protests in Iran, but Russian officials have blamed the unrest on "foreign interference" without presenting evidence to back up such claims. Meanwhile, Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, decried what he described as "attempts by foreign powers to interfere in Iran's internal affairs," echoing Iranian accusations of Western interference. A shared anti-Western ideology has been a bonding factor for Russia and Iran, as have international sanctions, which meant that Iran was one of the few international partners that Moscow could rely on for military hardware help after it invaded Ukraine in 2022. In return, Iran reportedly received military technology and intelligence from Russia, as well as funding for its space and missile programs. Tehran was also believed to have coveted Russian Su-35 fighter aircraft and S-400 air defense missile systems, but it's unclear whether it ever received these. One of the clearest signs that the alliance was more nuanced than it initially appeared, however, was when Russia stood back during heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, and amid U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities last summer. Analysts told CNBC at the time that Russia was likely unable to support Tehran militarily — given its operations in Ukraine — but that it was also unwilling to do so, as any direct conflict with the U.S. and Israel would be highly dangerous and damaging to Russia. Moscow's standoffish stance last year was a wake-up call to Tehran's leadership about the limits of its alliance with Putin — limits that were being seen today too, analysts said. "There is absolutely nothing meaningful that Russia can provide the Iranian regime to save it. "Russia prioritizes its own interests ... and doesn't really believe in alliances, at least under Vladimir Putin, only ways to project power." That is something that the Kremlin would be planning to do in the event of regime change in Iran, Bikarski said. "Russia would try to re-engage with whoever succeeds the Islamic Republic, and would and try to ensure that their interests are shared with whatever new government takes form," he noted, with the alternative being that Russia is "completely pushed out of the Middle East." That scenario, he said, would be highly undesirable for Russia. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent a letter dated July 14, 2025, to key senators on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, following his testimony before Congress about renovations to the central bank buildings. In it, the Fed chair gave lawmakers a detailed and expansive response to inquiries about the renovations. Powell's letter to the Senate Banking Committee, obtained by Business Insider, was sent 10 days before giving President Donald Trump and other White House officials a tour of the renovation site on July 24, 2025. Powell announced via video message on January 11 that the Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve. He said the probe is into his June testimony about renovations at historic Fed office buildings, but warned that it was a pressure tactic over interest rates. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation." Rep. Anna Paulina Luna accused Powell of misleading Congress and sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though it's unclear whether that prompted the DOJ investigation. During Powell's testimony in June, Scott said the Fed's more than $2 billion renovation of its headquarters was excessive and likened it to the "Palace of Versailles." Powell responded that many features Scott mentioned no longer exist, such as beehives, a VIP elevator, and water features, but added that the Marriner S. Eccles Building urgently needed safety upgrades and hadn't been meaningfully renovated before work began in 2022. The White House and the Federal Reserve Board did not immediately respond to a request for comments.</p>
