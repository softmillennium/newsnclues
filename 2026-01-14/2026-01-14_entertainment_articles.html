                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back before he was the prolific bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea got his start playing trumpet. Now, after nearly 50 years of making music, he is returning to his jazz roots with his first solo album, Honora, out March 27 via Nonesuch. Ringing in the news is his new single “Traffic Lights,” which was co-written with Thom Yorke and Josh Johnson, and gets an animated video by Nespy5euro. “Something about it reminded me of Atoms for Peace, so I sent it to Thom,” Flea said in a statement, adding that the Radiohead frontman is “just the warmest, free flowing, jamming motherfucker.” This spring, Flea will take his solo album out on the road with a backing band. Red Hot Chili Peppers have been busy these past few years, releasing two albums—Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen—in 2022 alone, but Flea keeps a booked schedule of his own while not on tour with his band.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video has handed a series order to Odd Jobs, a future-set adult animated comedy co-created and executive produced by Mike McMahan (Star Trek: Lower Decks, Solar Opposites) and Dominic Dierkes (Solar Opposites). It will premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, Antonio Canobbio, and Ben Kalina executive produce for Titmouse, alongside McMahan and Dierkes. Amie Karp also serves as an executive producer. “While wandering through the wilderness, we accidentally stumbled through a portal and found ourselves hundreds of years in the future. We witnessed bizarre and grotesque portents about where humanity is heading. Instead of acting on those warnings, we're thrilled to turn them into an animated show,” said McMahan and Dierkes. “Odd Jobs is sharp, absurd, and laugh-out-loud funny, taking a wildly imaginative look at a future that's as chaotic as it is entertaining,” said Melissa Wolfe, Head of Animation, Amazon MGM Studios. “Mike and Dominic have built a bold, unpredictable world filled with hilarious characters, and we couldn't be more excited to partner with CBS Studios and Titmouse to bring this new comedy to Prime Video audiences around the world.” Odd Jobs joins Prime Video's forthcoming animated comedy Kevin, written and executive produced by Aubrey Plaza and Joe Wengert, in the latest expansion of the streaming network's adult animated series slate. It joins current Original series Invincible, Hazbin Hotel, The Legend of Vox Machina and spinoff The Mighty Nein, Secret Level and Sausage Party: Foodtopia.

Sure, sure, “faith” and “redemption” are in there, too, but based on the series' latest official trailer, evil seems to be winning out. Set a few years after our core group has graduated from high school, this new look at the third season makes it pretty clear: their misadventures in high school were only the tip of the iceberg. Related Stories ‘This Is Not a Test' Trailer: High Schoolers Take on the Undead in Adam MacDonald's Gutsy Apocalypse ‘Kontinental '25' Trailer: Radu Jude's Droll iPhone Comedy Side-Eyes a Transylvanian Bailiff Undone by Her Own Class Guilt Season 3 will see the return of a number of the series' beloved regulars, including Emmy winner Zendaya (who is genuinely riveting in this first look), Hunter Schafer, Eric Dane, Jacob Elordi, Sydney Sweeney, Alexa Demie, Maude Apatow, Martha Kelly, Chloe Cherry, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Toby Wallace. The season will also see the return of some of its biggest guest stars, including Colman Domingo, Dominic Fike, Nika King, Alanna Ubach, Sophia Rose Wilson, Melvin Bonez Estes, Daeg Faerch, Paula Marshall, Zak Steiner, and Marsha Gambles. Season 3 also boasts an insane array of new guest stars, including: Sharon Stone, ROSALÍA, Danielle Deadwyler, Marshawn Lynch, Anna Van Patten, Asante Blackk, Bella Podaras, Bill Bodner, Cailyn Rice, Christopher Ammanuel, Christopher Grove, Colleen Camp, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Eli Roth, Gideon Adlon, Hemky Madera, Homer Gere, Jack Topalian, James Landry Hébert, Jeff Wahlberg, Jessica Blair Herman, Justin Sintic, Kadeem Hardison, Kwame Patterson, Madison Thompson, Matthew Willig, Meredith Mickelson, Natasha Lyonne, Priscilla Delgado, Rebecca Pidgeon, Sam Trammell, Smilez, Trisha Paytas, Tyler Lawrence Gray, and Vinnie Hacker. And, fun fact: this season was, per HBO, “shot on a new KODAK motion picture film stock in both 35mm and 65mm. Creator Sam Levinson and Emmy-winning cinematographer Marcell Rév collaborated closely with Kodak to commercialize the new stock in each format. Season three is also the first narrative television series to shoot significant volume of 65mm film, providing for an expanded image on screen which mirrors the characters' journeys out of high school into the wider, wilder world.” Take a peek and see what some of the “Euphoria” all-stars have been up to, and what new trials await them. New episodes of the HBO Original drama series will debut weekly. Check out the first official trailer for Season 3 below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylie Jenner is practicing her best Britney Spears impression in her latest fragrance campaign, slipping into a red latex catsuit for the occasion. Fully covered in the curve-hugging material from neck to wrists and ankles, Jenner looks as though she shopped Spears' closet for the shoot, bringing back an iconic look from the early-aughts. While Jenner not only loves a latex look — both out and about and on the set of a photoshoot — and even has a line of latex looks for her fashion brand Khy, she's never gone full catsuit before today. Jenner shared bright red images on Instagram, promoting the newest Kylie Cosmetics fragrance, called Cosmic Intense, which she called “a deeper, more seductive take on Cosmic.. rich, warm, and addictive,” just in time for Valentine's Day next month. The bottle has the same organic shape as its two predecessors, though the latest version is also bright red, including the cap. Other images also feature a miniature bottle, pierced through Kylie's matching nail. While Spears, of course, will forever be the original purveyor of the red latex catsuit, Jenner brings it into 2026 with effortless grace, slipping into a pair of matching cherry red stilettos to finish off her look. It's been a busy start to the year for Jenner, who has already hit the awards show circuit with boyfriend Timothée Chalamet at the Critics' Choice Awards and, most recently, the Golden Globes. At the latter, she sparkled in a sequined corset dress and more than 100 carats of diamonds. Perhaps she'll go bold in red for the next red carpet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TuneCore leadership will now shift to CRO Brian Miller and CTPO Luxi Huang, overseen by Romain Vivien, Believe's global head of music. Andreea Gleeson, CEO of TuneCore, is stepping aside after a decade with the DIY distribution platform, transitioning into a strategic advisor role for parent company Believe. The move, effective immediately, marks the end of a transformative era for TuneCore and signals its next phase of growth. Gleeson joined TuneCore in 2015 as head of marketing, later serving as chief marketing officer and chief revenue officer before being named CEO in August 2021. Under her leadership, TuneCore expanded its global footprint, modernized its platform and evolved beyond distribution into artist development, launching initiatives like TuneCore Accelerator to provide education and career-building opportunities for independent artists. In an internal memo obtained by Billboard, Gleeson expressed pride in the company's progress and reaffirmed its mission to empower independent artists. “Together, we've transformed this company [while staying] true to what matters most: an artist-first mission and a belief in independence.” “Her work co-founding the Music Fights Fraud Alliance and advancing gender equity in the music industry reflects values that are at the heart of Believe and areas we will continue to prioritize,” he said. Leadership of TuneCore will now be overseen by Romain Vivien, Believe's global head of music, alongside senior executives including chief revenue officer Brian Miller and chief technology and product officer Luxi Huang. After ten years at TuneCore, and with the company well-positioned for continued success, Believe and I have mutually agreed that the time is right for me to transition. Effective immediately, I'll be moving from my role as CEO of TuneCore into a Strategic Advisor position for Believe. As TuneCore enters this next phase from a position of strength, its mission remains: empower independent artists to succeed on their own terms, moving them from “access to success” through an efficient, automated platform. Moving forward, TuneCore will prioritize harnessing more fully the capabilities of Believe, to help artists grow globally. Believe and I looked at what the future requires and agreed the best path is for me to support Believe's executive team in an advisory capacity to continue building where I can have the greatest impact. Together, we've transformed this company, expanding our global footprint, strengthening and modernizing the platform, and pivoting from just distribution to artist development by launching programs like TuneCore Accelerator to give artists deeper support, education, and access to real career-building opportunities. Through it all, we stayed true to what matters most: an artist-first mission and a belief in independence. Your creativity, resilience, ambition, and care for artists shaped TuneCore into what it is today. I've been continually inspired by the way this team shows up for each other and for the creators who trust us with their careers. TuneCore's success has also been deeply connected to the Believe Group's long-term vision and global scale, which allowed us to grow with purpose while serving independent artists at every stage of their journey. This planned transition reflects my confidence in the strength of this team and in TuneCore's next phase of growth within the Believe ecosystem. TuneCore will always be a part of who I am and I can't wait to see what you build next. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

It's back to school and open season in the first trailer for “This Is Not a Test” — a sardonic, promising new zombie apocalypse thriller from writer/director Adam MacDonald for Shudder and Independent Film Company. It will open exclusively in theaters on Friday, February 20. Adapting the best-selling YA novel by Courtney Summers, “This Is Not a Test” begins with a standard “Breakfast Club” drama, before pitching into a “Shaun of the Dead”-style escape thriller sharper and scarier than its setup suggests. The trailer wastes little time establishing its pressure-cooker premise, quickly barricading five teenagers inside their high school as their hometown collapses into chaos. “We have to do things we don't want to do if we're going to make it,” one student says in a scene that places the survival film's  spunky but still bleak, decision-driven tone somewhere between “The Faculty” and “The Mist.” At the center is Olivia Holt, who doesn't particularly stick out in the promo but nevertheless feels like an inspired choice for the lead after her impressive turn in last year's Valentine's Day-themed slasher “Heart Eyes.” The ensemble around Holt includes Froy Gutierrez, Luke MacFarlane, Corteon Moore, Chloe Avakian, and Carson MacCormac — filling out a cast that feels authentically adolescent but capable and glossy enough to carry some big action-horror beats if need be. MacDonald made his directorial debut at TIFF 2014 with the Canadian wilderness thriller “Backcountry,” which was loosely inspired by the true story of two campers attacked by a dangerous black bear. Now, Macdonald is leaning deeper into his knack for creature frights and disturbing human psychology with a premise that asks what you're willing to become when the doors won't hold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BLACKPINK announced on Wednesday (Jan. 14) that its highly anticipated new album is set to arrive in just a matter of weeks — on Feb. 27. According to the Instagram post, it will be a mini album. It was the first time JENNIE, JISOO, ROSÉ and LISA had performed together as a unit since 2023. The women had taken some time off from the group to focus on their own personal projects, which included solo albums, as well as acting projects such as HBO's The Idol for JENNIE, and The White Lotus season three for LISA. Ahead of the Deadline World Tour in 2025, the group reunited to record “Jump,” its high-energy new song, which was officially released on July 11. In JENNIE's January 2025 Billboard cover story, she shared that she had missed the rest of the girls during their time apart to focus on their solo projects. However, she teased that big things were to come for the group: “I want to say it's going to be the most powerful [versions] of ourselves that anyone has seen.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: 3SIX9 Studios, the production company launched in Cannes two years ago, has confirmed an ambitious upcoming slate of international projects, including the new Woody Allen film, a John Boyega horror and a buzzy Arnaud Desplechin feature. The company is led by producing partners Daya Fernández, Prison Break star Amaury Nolasco, and entrepreneur Alois Rubenbauer, who oversee development, production and strategy. They are joined by partners Kevin Obarski and Saudi billionaire Sheikh Mohammed El Khereji. The company's slate is supported by a newly formed fund called Silver Screen Global, which is in place for “long-term financing of 3SIX9 productions, as well as select outside projects that align with the studio's creative and commercial approach”. We're told that Sheikh Mohammed is among a group of investors behind the fund. Woody Allen Pays Tribute To "Magical" Diane Keaton: "Her Face And Laugh Illuminated Any Space She Entered" The synopsis reads: “A desperate couple in rural Iceland confronts a centuries-old curse that forces them to choose between love and survival.” Also completed is Todo lo Que Nunca Fuimos (All We Never Were), based on the popular novel by Alice Kellen. The synopsis reads: “After losing her parents, aspiring painter Leah is left reeling with grief. When her brother leaves town, he asks his best friend Axel to look after her — unaware that Leah has harbored unspoken feelings for him for years.” The film is currently in post-production and is scheduled for release by Warner Bros Spain in spring 2026. We already knew the movie would shoot in Madrid this spring and as part of local funding stipulations should have Madrid in its title. We're told the project, whose budget is estimated around $14M, will be largely English-language and feature a high-profile cast, which is still coming together. Also on the upcoming slate is Arnaud Desplechin's (My Golden Days) intriguing feature The Thing That Hurts, similarly aiming to shoot this spring. Lea Seydoux and Jason Schwarzman are among the starry cast that have been attached to the project over the years but deals and schedules are still being figured out so cast isn't confirmed yet. The project is described as “a Parisian psychodrama where grief, guilt, and love collide among strangers bound by a haunting secret”. Later in the year, the studio plans to move into production on Linda Lisboa, an elevated romantic drama to be directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse (The Dressmaker) and produced in collaboration with industry vet Gareth Wiley (Match Point), with filming scheduled across Portugal and Canada. Conspiracy thriller Ghost of Tomorrow is currently in packaging with production targeted for 2027, as is Piñata, an animated family feature based on an original concept by Ken Locsmandi, the VFX vet whose credits include Donnie Darko and Apocalypto. Among scripted and unscripted TV projects on the development slate is Soundbite from Whitney Welch. Some of these projects are expected to be on sale via third parties at the EFM and Cannes market, where 3SIX9 will be on the ground taking meetings. Two years ago, the company launched with former Paramount exec Inga Vainshein Smith also aboard but Smith is no longer with the firm. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple Martin is starting the year off strong. Just two weeks into 2026, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's daughter is continuing her role as the face of Self-Portrait, starring in the fashion brand's spring campaign. In one image, the budding model practically walks on water, standing ankle deep in a high-slit dress ($620) looking as though she's one with the lake. Looking like her mom's doppelgänger, Apple wears a selection of white silk, inset lace and pale yellow wrap dresses in a woodsy lake-themed shoot. “While our first chapter introduced Apple officially to the creative industry, this new series of portraits show a more reflective evolution of her personality,” the brand's founder Han Chong wrote in a press release. “There's a maturity and steadiness to the imagery which aligns with where she is heading.” She is “a new effortless style icon in the making,” he concluded. Back in September, Apple was revealed as their new brand ambassador on Instagram. On her own Instagram Stories, she wrote at the time, “I am so excited! Apple is leaning into her official modeling debut while still enrolled at Vanderbilt University. In an interview with Vogue at the time, Gwyneth shared, “I was so impressed by how she seemed to already know how to be in front of the camera,” to which Martin replied, “I was trying my best!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the mornings, they can stop by La Mina to pick up breakfast tacos and coffee. Enrique — “Quique” — and his brother Arturo have owned La Mina for almost four years. “I don't want to complain,” Quique says of his circumstances while bartending over a counter framed by twinkling Christmas lights and neon homages to Cerveza Estrella Jalisco, Tecate, and the second-most venerated entity in Mexico: La Selección, the national soccer team. Costs were “always expensive,” he says of the last few years of business in the region, but now things are going “very poorly and I think it will probably get worse.” Laredo is the beating heart of Webb County, a 95-percent Hispanic district that swung over 25 points toward Trump from 2020 to 2024, voting Republican in a presidential election for the first time since 1912. Almost every county throughout the Rio Grande Valley and along the border swung toward Trump by double digits in his comeback election. Even though Trump won by slim margins in South Texas, the fact that he won them at all is cause for alarm among Democrats. The pendulum may now be swinging in the other direction, though, as Trump's chaotic, tariff-fueled economic agenda and brutal anti-immigration push have wrought havoc on Hispanic communities. This is especially true across the Rio Grande Valley, where Rolling Stone recently spoke with residents — many of whom voted for Trump in past elections — who did not mince words about how bad things have gotten since the president retook office a year ago. In other words, the percentage of Texas Hispanics who really don't like Trump's performance jumped almost 15 points in less than a year. Wall Street Is Dancing While Trump Assaults Free Markets. Jimmy Kimmel Suggests Sending ICE Agents in Minneapolis to Iran: ‘They Could Help' Jon Stewart on ICE Killing of Renee Good, Venezuela: ‘What the F-ck Is Happening in This Country?' Separate polling by UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights and advocacy group, found in November that among 3,000 registered Latino voters, “64 percent disapprove of his job performance,” and “of those who voted for him, 13 percent say they would not vote for him again.” The Pew Research Center, meanwhile, found that 70 percent of Latinos disapprove of Trump. Pew also found that upwards of 60 percent disapprove of Trump's approach to immigration and believe he has made the economy worse. Quique, La Mina's owner and a two-time Trump voter, says he regrets voting for Trump in 2024, and that he's not alone. The first time, I felt the country needed a change,” he explains, noting that he voted for him again hoping for much-needed economic growth, and that immigration and frustration with the Democratic Party also factored heavily. “I don't think he knows what he's doing,” Quique says, pointing to cruelty in his immigration enforcement and the chaotic tariff and trade policies. The bar's costs are higher, people have less to spend, and the neighborhood is still struggling to recover from lockdown-era stagnation. He sees Trump as an aging, sickly figure, surrounded by yes men. In a city that straddles the border, he's watched good, hardworking people who legally cross the bridge outside his bar every day become “spooked” at the possibility of losing their status, permits, or jobs. “What I hear from patrons is not necessarily that they want to just go back to a Democratic president,” Quique says, as the last of that night's regulars pay their tabs and depart for the bridge. He remains hopeful that things will get better eventually — just maybe not under Trump. “As a business, I was doing quite well, and right now I'm probably down about 3,000 shipments year over year,” he says. The vision of a Laredo Tejano — with slick hair and a sport coat paired with full quill ostrich-leather cowboy boots — Gonzalez is one of hundreds of specialized customs brokers in the city who help importers and exporters manage the intricacies of inspections, taxes, approvals, and logistics involved in cross-border commerce. “Laredo has grown [economically] anywhere from five to seven percent on a yearly basis. “I think we're just really looking for some stability of understanding,”  JAMCO President Rahul Oltikar says at their company headquarters, a nondescript building nestled within the maze of enormous warehouses and shipping centers that dispatch thousands of trucks a day. He and Gonzalez both note that warehouse space — usually highly in demand and easy to fill — has seen a sharp increase in vacancies. Virtually every aspect of the cross-border supply chain has been negatively impacted since Trump retook office. Over 9,000 freight truck drivers have been pulled from service after failing new English-language proficiency requirements instituted by the Department of Transportation. In August, the Department of Homeland Security paused the issuance of foreign visas for truck drivers — a decision that disproportionately impacted inland border ports like Laredo — after an undocumented driver caused a deadly crash in Florida. “Local markets, smaller players have definitely suffered, on having to let people go,” Oltikar adds, noting that the domino effect is being felt in virtually every local industry. “I have a lot of friends who are die-hard Trumpers,” Gonzalez adds. “Everybody wanted a change because they saw what the Biden administration was doing. Now with the current Trump administration, a lot of people — when I go to D.C. and I have my discussions out there — they'll say I voted for him, but I didn't vote for this.” Looking towards 2026, Gonzalez says the industry is hoping for some more “checks and balances” on the president. Every so often at an interior checkpoint, an immigration officer gives you a once over and asks, “Are you a citizen?” Here, the speculative optimism of city tradesmen dissolves into the generational slough of a perpetually burdened agricultural sector — and support for the president intensifies. After nearly 100 years in operation, times have rarely felt more dire. “We're all suffering,” says Matt Klosterman, Rio Farms' president and general manager. Some valley farmers and ranchers have recently turned to wind farming, with turbines able to net about $15,000 in energy revenue a year, but their love of Trump has complicated the push for green energy. The area's agricultural industry is now in a race against time, however, fighting collapsing commodity prices, a water shortage, rising costs of machinery and fertilizers, and labor scarcity resulting from Trump's immigration crackdown. Trump's tariff regime shocked commodity crop values across the country, which had been floundering for years. The tax on countries like China, Brazil, and Mexico — major buyers of staple crops like cotton, soybean, sorghum, wheat, and corn — became a financial vice on an already struggling industry. Farmers are struggling to just keep their heads above water. “I think for us, we're all going to play the ‘least risk' game,” Klosterman says. “Put the least amount [of money] into it and try to lose as little as possible, which is not a great business model.” “Until either the cost of inputs come down, or the price of our commodities go up, we're going to be in this pickle,” Klosterman adds. Farmers have been hit so hard — not just in South Texas but across the U.S. —  that in December Trump gave them a $12 billion bailout. “Nobody's not going to take the money,” Klosterman says, but in his community of growers “most of the sentiment is that this is a very short term fix.” “This doesn't help next year,” he adds, describing the payments as a “bridge” to prevent more bankruptcies and closures. Jerry Maldonado, of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, says that while his politics align more with Republicans, he's of a split mind when it comes to the president. While Maldonado is not thrilled about how Trump's tariffs have affected freight load volumes, he doesn't begrudge the president's immigration policies. “It's no different than you running a stoplight and getting into an accident or speeding down the highway and hoping the cop doesn't catch you,” he says. And some people forget that part.” He firmly believes taxpayer dollars should go only to American citizens, and that in an imperfect political system, you just gotta pick the party you feel “will do right by you.” A worker we'll call Paul, a left-leaning home builder who did not vote for Trump, agreed to speak on conditions of anonymity for fear of backlash from other firms and the administration. “This is what I voted for,” he recalls his peers saying. The laborers being rounded up and deported were workers and contractors that had been in the community for decades, “people in the industry they have relationships with,” Paul says, people whose weddings, quinceñeras, and baptisms they attended. “People who are padrinos to their children.” The attitude shifted, to a feeling that “Trump has good intentions but doesn't see the domino effect” of his policies. “Business is down significantly, and if we continue on this trajectory, this direction, we will see a lot of businesses fail,” says Ronnie Cavazos, president of the STBA. Let me tell you something about immigrants in this country: Nobody believes in the American dream more than them, nobody is willing to work harder for it.” “There is no Plan B for us,” he adds. One man recalled that a friend of his who is employed as an ICE agent told him that the valley is regularly targeted by raids because its low-hanging fruit to meet detention quotas. Another noted that the over tenfold increase in funding for ICE operations under the Trump administration was not them “looking to make this better or help us out,” it's “10 times more harshness.” Others described migrants and day laborers at work sites with documentation and work permits being detained, leading to financial losses for constructors and a climate of fear among workers. Driving through Hebbronville, a slowly crumbling majority-Hispanic town whose most colorful feature is its plushie-and-flower encrusted cemetery, a sign jumps out at passers by: “SAVE TEXAS, SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR DEMOCRATS.” Disillusionment with Trump may be growing, but the president and his party still enjoy a loyal contingency of voters in the region. Texas Polling Project Director James Henson says it's not necessarily that Hispanic voters are “becoming more permanently Republican,” but “that their party affiliation is becoming less fixed.” In a region where voters are already quite comfortable splitting their ticket, the share of independent voters is growing, and the framework of unconditional party loyalty among voters is cracking. Businesses and locals predict harder times to come, and while many are growing dissatisfied with Trump, Democrats are also historically unpopular. The blame game has yet to be retested on a ballot. As Quique explains over a plate of brisket tacos at La Mina, many lifelong Democrats who decided to split their ballot or outright defect from the party did so under the feeling that they had no other choice. Democrats were the “ones responsible for the people looking for someone like Trump,” who would “tell them what they wanted to hear” from their elected officials, he says. Times were hard and getting harder, and in 2024 the resounding economic message being put out by the campaigns of former President Joe Biden, and later former Vice President Kamala Harris, was that things were actually not that bad.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flea has revealed the release date of his first full-length solo album, Honora, arriving March 27, 2026, on NonesuchRecords. “Deantoni and I played what became ‘Traffic Lights' the first day. And I was right, he did,” said Flea in a statement. Flea, who composed and arranged the music for Honora, which takes its name from a family member, also plays trumpet and bass across the record. Yorke and Nick Cave also dive in to assist with the vocals, while Mauro Refosco (David Byrne, Atoms for Peace) and Nate Walcott (Bright Eyes) also lend their talents to the upcoming debut album. In a statement sharing how the record came to be, Flea said that one night in 1991, the year the Red Hot Chili Peppers released the landmark album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Flea was acting in Gus Van Sant's film My Own Private Idaho and told a friend, “I want to make an instrumental record with deep hypnotic grooves, trippy melodies layered on top, meditations on a groove.” Jackson Browne's Son Ethan's Cause of Death Revealed After Actor Died at 52 My Chemical Romance Delay First Show of the Black Parade 2026 Tour Cher Wants Sonny Bono's Widow to Pay Her $1 Million Legal Tab As he neared his 60th birthday, the musician resolved to practice the trumpet every day for two years and that he would make an album, regardless of where his knowledge or talents ended up. While he at first worried that the band he assembled for the project would think he was “a non-playing motherf*cker, charlatan, rock poseuror fan,” it turned out that “they were all the most genuinely supportive people, movingme deeply and daily with their generous spirits.” “Sitting in a room and playing the music with them made me feel like I was on drugs,” said Flea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jason and Travis Kelce are launching a new online retail destination with Amazon. The new site will be featured across Amazon at launch and will also be available as part of Prime Video's Shop the Show experience, where viewers can purchase items while watching New Heights on Prime Video. Taylor Swift's Mother Helped Start Relationship With Travis Kelce, Eras Tour Doc Reveals Mark Ronson Wants to DJ Taylor Swift's Wedding: "I Am Keeping the Year Open" These moves come as Amazon has ramped up its efforts on creator-led, video-focused podcasts, after it broke up its Wondery podcast studio in August. Narrative podcasts moved to Audible and the creator-led, video-focused podcasts such as New Heights and Armchair Expert joined Amazon's new Creator Services organization. The focus of the new organization, as initially announced, is “working with a select number of top creators to drive scaled listenership and unlock broader and long-lasting relationships across Amazon.” From day one, New Heights has been about family and football and has rallied a community as passionate about those things as we are, so creating something game-changing for our loyal fans was the natural next step. Welcome to the official home for 92%ers,” Travis and Jason Kelce said in a statement. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vampire mystery movie 'The Blood Countess,' starring the French icon as a 16th-century serial killer, and the new series from 'Adolescence' co-creator Jack Thorne are among this year's Berlin highlights. Vampires, sci-fi creatures, and Charli XCX are descending on Berlin this year. The Berlin Film Festival on Wednesday unveiled more titles for its Berlinale lineup, including its high-profile, out-of-competition section of red carpet premieres that will screen at the 76th Berlinale, which runs Feb. 12-22. Superman Shots, 'Euphoria' Glow-Ups and 'GoT' Fart Jokes: Inside the HBO Max Germany Launch Party Among the titles bowing in Panorama, Berlin's main sidebar section, is Aidan Zamiri's The Moment featuring music superstar Charli XCX in what is described as “a mockumentary, a feminist act of self-empowerment and an ironic meta-commentary on the music business.” Feminist perspectives will also be showcased elsewhere in the Panorama lineup, which includes Árru, the directorial debut of Sámi choreographer Elle Sofe Sara; Iranian activist and filmmaker Mahnaz Mohammadi's new drama Roya; and Olive Nwosu's feature debut Lady. And it wouldn't be Berlin withou a new film from Hong Sangsoo. The prolific South Korean auteur returns to Potsdamer Platz with Geunyeoga doraon nal, a drama described as “a subtle reflection on the acting profession itself.” The Blood Countess was a hot pre-sales title at Berlin last year. On the gory side, Berlin will hold the world premiere of Sleep No More, a body horror feature from Indonesia's genre master Edwin (Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash), and Saccharine, from Australia's Natalie Erika James, in which a lovelorn medical student become possessed after taking part in an obscure weight-loss craze: Eating human ashes. Series getting their world premiere in Berlin this year include eagerly awaited new adaptation of Lord of the Flies, directed by Marc Munden and written by Adolescence co-creator Jack Thorne; the darkly comic crime drama Mint directed by Charlotte Regan (Scrapper); and Chilean adaptation La casa de los espíritus, based on Isabel Allende's landmark novel (which was adapted in English by Billy August as The House of the Spirits in 1993, starring Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas and Vanessa Redgrave).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to both Hollywood and the media ecosystem writ large, originality can be hard to find these days: we're relentlessly barraged with sequels, cinematic universes, remakes, retellings, rehashes, and anything else the suits can think of to avoid greenlighting something new. In short, this version isn't afraid to take a step forward instead of simply repeating yesterday. For those unfamiliar with the story's lineage, Hiroshi Sakurazaka's light novel and its previous adaptations follow a soldier who becomes stuck in a time loop on the day when he and his unit are slaughtered by extraterrestrials. By contrast, this latest take centers on Rita (Ai Mikami), the deuteragonist in previous tellings, a listless young woman who signs up to help prune the branches of a massive tree-like alien organism that crash-landed on Earth. After an unremarkable year as a member of this cleaning crew, this extraterrestrial sprouts an army of murder plants that gruesomely slaughter everyone in sight. Rita watches in horror as her co-workers are killed, unable to do anything but run. From here, she learns how to wield a cartoonishly oversized fire axe in hopes of hacking and slashing her way to tomorrow alongside an ally who shares her predicament. However, while there are plot specifics, both big and small, that directly reference the original story, All You Need Is Kill is a very different spin on the material, starting with its more varied tone that whips between relatively reserved and outright panic. The original novel and manga are steeped in relentlessly grimdark storytelling: An unstoppable, unsightly alien menace eviscerates humanity in droves, conquering much of the planet while leaving little room for hope. This version is much more contemplative and nuanced, less relentlessly pounding the viewer like they're under artillery fire and more showing them something pleasant before swerving into horrors. Instead of the aliens being grotesque and terrifying, there's an odd beauty to their rainbow neons, especially when it comes to the massive world tree that acts as their motherbase, spreading roots that turn everything into a feast of otherworldly colors. It makes it all the more uncomfortable when this outwardly pleasant flora turns out to be malicious fauna that crushes, tears, and consumes its prey with impunity. While this world is similarly deadly, you probably couldn't get further from the grays and browns of a pulverized no man's land that the original story evokes. This colorful pivot underlines an aesthetic eccentricity that very much works in the film's favor: Izumi Murakami's exaggerated character designs immediately imbue the cast with personality, which is essential given that only two characters, Rita and her time loop partner Keiji (Natsuki Hanae), get any real screentime. Anyone familiar with some of STUDIO 4℃'s more experimental work from the aughts, like the visually exuberant Tekkonkinkreet and Mind Game, will feel quite at home, even if most of the key staff from those projects didn't work on All You Need Is Kill. Much like countless other examples of time-loop fiction, the story is as much about her overcoming a fundamental feeling of “stuckness” as it is about overcoming some external threat (in this case, hacking through alien hordes). It's a significant departure, considering the original protagonist's growth is almost entirely centered around becoming a modern-day samurai by embodying the bushido saying “kiri-oboeru,” which means “strike down your enemy and learn.” While their arcs are brief, Akimoto's direction ensures that Yuichiro Kido's script lands as it should, delivering imagery that succinctly captures their moods, pasts, and worldviews, as they make an effort to move past stagnation, inside and out. This growth comes across in rapidfire montages of the many unsuccessful loops, conveying the brutal repetition of this living nightmare without making it feel monotonous, before ultimately leading into a positively psychedelic final battle that neatly ties together both characters' journeys. While the compositing work is quite smooth, and it's frequently hard to tell what's hand-animated and what isn't, the occasional framerate dips on background characters prove a distraction in an otherwise visually exuberant film. However, judged both in a vacuum and against its source material, All You Need Is Kill is a rare retelling that finds its own tenor. Director: Kenichiro Akimoto Writer: Yuichiro Kido Starring: Natsuki Hanae, Ai Mikami Release Date: January 16, 2026</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nobody knows who Daguerreotypes' James Samimi Farr is, and judging from his expansive and warm folk debut, This Is My Way to Tell You That Everything Is Real and Is Happening Now, this knowledge has eaten away at him quietly for the better part of a decade. After abandoning his dreams of a music career in his early 20s, Farr has returned to these dreams, or perhaps to the grave where he believes they are buried. “If this is all there is, and we are all alone/My voice can go no higher,” he sings on “Born a Baritone.” As a writer, Farr belongs to a long and storied line of married men wrangling poetry from their bewildered happiness and vague dissatisfaction. At times, he reminds me of Bill Callahan, trembling at the implications of his unlikely late-life bliss on 2019's Shepherd In a Sheepskin Vest. At others, he recalls Built to Spill's Doug Martsch, who paired dreamy contentment with unease in lyrics like, “Nothing's bad, no one's dying/Most of my dreams have come true.” You can hear his loving devotion to the process in the music, which feels surrounded by everyday objects and drenched in light. A deep and wide spiritual longing courses through the center of Farr's music, a sort of everyday mysticism, that also puts his music in conversation with Will Oldham's. On “Take a Great Notion,” over stand-up bass notes that hit like ink droplets, Farr imagines a time when he will, in fact, embrace a higher power: “Spool out your mercy like the line of a kite,” he pleads, before admitting: “I don't believe you, or in you/But maybe I might.” The strumming pattern is an unmistakable callback to Arcade Fire's “Wake Up”—another anthem of unbearable sincerity, from another time. Perhaps Farr never gets closer to the bone than he does with “I Love to Sing and Play Guitar,” which represents the apogee of Farr's peculiar kind of bravery. There is no second level to the song's message. Farr reminisces about being taught “Come As You Are” by his sister at age 10, admitting that it changed his life forever. “I make music every day/I'm so glad to be a part of beauty in my own way,” he sings, before coating the track in wide paint streaks of electric guitar soloing. But Farr's music pushes past these contractions, demanding gently that you open wider, admit more of the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kiefer Sutherland, the actor best known for torturing people on television, was arrested early Monday morning after he allegedly attacked a rideshare driver. Per ABC News, Sutherland entered a rideshare car just after midnight on Monday morning and allegedly assaulted and threatened the driver. Police arrived and detained the actor around 12:15 a.m., and he was bailed out the next morning on a $50,000 bond. He's scheduled to appear in court on February 2. The driver reportedly did not require medical attention and suffered no serious injuries. This is not Sutherland's first run-in with the law. Between 1989 and 2007, he was charged with four DUIs. In 2009, he head-butted fashion designer Jack McCollough, whose representatives characterized the incident as a “vicious, violent, unprovoked attack.” At the time, Sutherland accused McCollough of pushing Brooke Shields, who had no idea what Sutherland was talking about. The charges were later dropped.
