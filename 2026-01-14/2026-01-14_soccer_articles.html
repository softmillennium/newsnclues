                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer fans heading to New Jersey for the World Cup final face paying exorbitant fees to stay near MetLife Stadium - and that's before they even buy a ticket to the game. Supporters from all around the globe will descend on Mexico, Canada and the United States this summer for the biggest tournament in sports. MetLife Stadium - the home of the New York Jets and Giants - will host the final on July 19 and already prices are skyrocketing for homestays near the arena. The Daily Mail found one seven bedroom-property in nearby Jersey City that will cost nearly $27,000 for the three nights, while another six-bedroom home is listed for nearly $23,000. A house in North Bergen, which contains five bedrooms, will cost you $17,450 while those fans hoping to stay in Manhattan can find a four-bedroom home in Midtown for $29,750. Several two- and three-bedroom homes - which can sleep up to seven guests and are a five-minute drive from the stadium - will set you back more than $12,000. Secret NYC, meanwhile, found a one-bedroom property where up to four guests can sleep between July 17 and July 20 for an astonishing $16,074. For those hoping to rent a 'ultra high-end luxury mansion' in New Jersey, a seven-bedroom home with an outdoor swimming pool has been listed for more than $40,000. Prices for the games have infuriated supporters, too. The most expensive seat, meanwhile, which is listed simply for the 'lower bowl and mid-level sidelines' is being offered for $97,789.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spurs saw off competition from Premier League rivals Aston Villa to secure the 25-year-old's signature, with his arrival a major boost for manager Thomas Frank especially after Rodrigo Bentancur was ruled out of action for three months through injury. Gallagher signed for Atletico Madrid in 2024 after being forced out at Chelsea and made 50 appearances for the club during his first season in Spain, scoring four goals. He will now get a fresh start at Tottenham, where he will hope to nail down a regular place in the starting XI and boost his chances of making England's squad for the 2026 World Cup. Speaking to the club's media channels, Gallagher said: “I'm so happy and excited to be here, taking the next step in my career at an amazing club. “I know how great the fans are, I'm really happy to be a part of it here and want to create special moments and memories together.” He is still young, so has plenty of room for improvement, but also has huge experience across the Premier League, La Liga and with the England national team. “Conor has captained teams so will bring leadership, maturity, character and personality to our dressing room, while his running power, pressing ability and eye for goal will strengthen us in a key area of the pitch.

Spurs' interest in Gallagher has been long standing, but hopes of a deal in the past were hampered by his role at Chelsea, with the two teams being fierce London rivals. However, Spurs found an opportunity to rekindle their infatuation with the former Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion loanee as his game time at Atletico dipped this season. Aston Villa, who unlike Tottenham are enjoying a fruitful season as they chase Champions League qualification while sitting only six points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, were keen on Gallagher as manager Unai Emery looked to add an energetic midfielder to his squad.

The Uruguayan is facing three months out, also with a thigh injury, but Tottenham have managed to act quickly in order to bring in a replacement who already has plenty of Premier League experience thanks to his previous spell with Chelsea. His arrival is also handy as he will count as a homegrown player, replacing Brennan Johnson who left for Crystal Palace earlier this month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. women's national team midfielder Sam Coffey has completed a transfer from the NWSL's Portland Thorns to Manchester City. Coffey has signed with the Women's Super League side through 2029, joining for a fee of $875,000 plus potential add-ons, ESPN reported. The 27-year-old has become a fixture for club and country since turning pro in 2022. Coffey spent four seasons with the Thorns, earning NWSL Best XI First Team honors in three of those campaigns. Thorns president and general manager Jeff Agoos said the club tried to keep Coffey, but the New York native wanted a new challenge in her career. "While the Thorns organization did everything it could to keep Sam in Portland, we thought it was important to support her ambitions while we continue building a team capable of competing for championships. It feels like the right time to really challenge myself in this way," Coffey said. "We believe she has all the qualities needed to thrive at City and, more broadly, the WSL, and we're excited to see how she can elevate our already superb squad of players. "Sam is playing at the top of her game, and I think her decision to come here shows the incredible progress we've made as a club and the ambitions we have moving forward." Coffey is the latest in a group of USWNT stars who have moved to England over the past two years, joining Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma at Chelsea and Emily Fox at Arsenal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alvaro Arbeloa has made a bold statement in his first squad selection as Real Madrid manager, opting to leave superstars Jude Bellingham and Thibaut Courtois at home for the Copa del Rey clash against Albacete. Faced with a mounting injury crisis that has stripped the squad of several Galacticos, Arbeloa has chosen bravery over caution for his debut in the dugout. Ahead of the Copa del Rey round of 16 fixture against Albacete, the manager has announced a squad list that features notable absences and fresh faces, signalling a clear intent to trust the club's youth system during his tenure. Midfield dynamo Bellingham, goalkeeper Courtois, defensive midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni and defender Alvaro Carreras have all been left in Madrid. It is a calculated risk from Arbeloa, who is prioritising the long-term health of his squad over short-term security, placing his "blind trust" in the next generation to get the job done against Segunda Division opposition. He joins a crowded treatment room that includes Rodrygo, Antonio Rudiger, Eder Militao, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ferland Mendy. The absence of these defensive and offensive heavyweights makes the voluntary exclusion of Bellingham and Tchouameni even more striking. Arbeloa is reportedly hopeful of recovering Mbappe, Rudiger and Rodrygo progressively over the next few weeks, but for now, he must navigate the fixture list without them. By resting his remaining healthy stars, he is sending a message that he believes the squad's depth, now bolstered by the academy, is sufficient to compete. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Having transitioned from coaching the youth categories, he possesses an intimate knowledge of La Fabrica, and he has utilised this by calling up five specific canteranos to reinforce the first team. Joan Martinez, David Jimenez, Manuel Angel, Cesar Palacios and Jorge Cestero have all been included in the squad for the trip to Albacete. These players participated in Arbeloa's first training session and have now been rewarded with a potential opportunity to shine on the senior stage. They join fellow academy goalkeepers Fran Gonzalez and Sergio Mestre, who have been regular fixtures in the matchday squads this season but are now closer to the action than ever before. This reliance on youth is not merely a necessity born of injuries; it is a statement of philosophy. For players like Manuel Angel and Palacios, this match represents a life-changing opportunity to impress the new boss in a competitive environment. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The Ukrainian international has proved his worth on numerous occasions and will be the senior figure in a defensive unit that looks vastly different from the club's gala XI. Arbeloa has travelled with three first-team centre-backs in David Alaba, Raul Asencio and Dean Huijsen, alongside full-backs Dani Carvajal and Fran Garcia. Arbeloa has four first-team midfielders available, supplemented by three from the B-team. Only three recognised forwards have made the list: Vinicius Junior, Gonzalo and Franco Mastantuono. Barring a tactical shift, it appears likely that this trio will lead the line, placing significant responsibility on Vinicius to guide his younger partners through the match. The trip to Albacete is the first hurdle in what promises to be an emotional week for Arbeloa. His primary objective is to ensure Real Madrid remain alive in the Copa del Rey, a title that represents his first realistic shot at silverware as a manager. A victory is non-negotiable to avoid an early crisis.</p>

"I think the problem with Wrexham for a Championship side is that they've got so many players, including a lot of forwards. Young forwards thrive on confidence and the certainty that they are the focal point of an attack. While Ferguson has hit a bit of a stride in recent weeks by scoring a double against Celtic in the Europa League in December before netting his second and third Serie A goals of the season over the last two weeks, Murphy believes that taking a step down, potentially to the Championship where Wrexham have been making waves, shouldn't be viewed as a regression, but rather a strategic recalibration. "I think that playing regular football and scoring goals is the key to getting your confidence back, and that might mean dropping a level even if it was to a Championship side, where he would be the main man and become appreciated again," Murphy explained. At Brighton, Ferguson's breakthrough was fuelled by a system that created chances and a manager who trusted him. At Wrexham, the project led by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney is built on momentum and collective belief, an environment that could help rebuild the striker's shattered confidence.

Ferguson's struggles are not solely down to selection decisions; the physical and mental toll of professional football has played its part. The young striker has been plagued by niggling injuries over the last two years, which have disrupted his rhythm. Murphy was sympathetic to this plight, noting that the isolation of not playing can be devastating for a young athlete's psyche. "Football is tough for anyone when you're not playing, and it does get you down physically and mentally," Murphy said. "So he would have to be quite careful in terms of the destination he ends up at for next season because he needs to be appreciated again and he needs to get back to enjoying his football." The pundit referenced Ferguson's own admissions about his difficulties, highlighting how quickly a rising star can fade from the public consciousness. "I heard him talking about his difficult couple of years and how he lost a bit of confidence. Injuries can do that, of course," Murphy reflected. He's a big lad, scores goals, has decent technique and is strong. I think all of us expected him to kick on. Unfortunately in football, with injuries and a loss of confidence, players can quickly fall out of the spotlight and that's what's happened to him."

With the Welsh side pushing hard for Premier League status, Ferguson could theoretically join them in the Championship and find himself back in the top flight within months, but this time with his confidence restored and his goal tally healthy. Murphy mused, hinting at the potential fairytale narrative. However, the overriding message from Murphy to Ferguson is one of pragmatism over prestige. Whether it is Wrexham or another club, the priority must be game time. "He's at Roma, I don't know if he'll get enough minutes and game time there for him to recapture that form. "But if I was advising him, I'd be saying, find somewhere where you're going to play every week, be appreciated, and just get your enjoyment back for the game."</p>
