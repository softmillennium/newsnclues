                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google's first stab at smart glasses since Google Glass will be here sooner rather than later, and we may have just gotten our first good look at what the glasses can do. The unexpected preview comes courtesy of a user on Reddit who says they discovered an early version of Google's smart glasses companion app hidden inside a preview build of Android Studio. While the companion app doesn't reveal everything, it does point to a few features and choices that make Google's smart glasses stand out. According to Android Authority, which pored over strings of code in the app, there are references to features like “conversation detection,” which sounds like a novel feature among smart glasses I've used over the past year. As for the privacy, strings in the code also indicate that Google is taking measures to prevent security risks inherent with a device that hears what you're saying all the time. As Android Authority notes, one string indicates that, “To protect your privacy, all conversation detection processing happens on your glasses. No raw audio, images, or conversation data is shared with Google or other services.” To be honest, that's better than Meta, which does use data to train its AI, in particular, images gathered when using the smart glasses for computer vision. We'll have a clearer picture of just how privacy-sensitive Google's glasses are when they're released, though. Speaking of distractions, it looks like Google's smart glasses might also let you pause what could be a major one by turning the display off when it's not in use to use the smart glasses in an audio-only state. That capability is evidenced by a string of code found by Android Authority titled “displayless mode.” Again, that's not groundbreaking, but it's thoughtful, and as someone who's used both display glasses and non-display glasses extensively over the past year, I could see that capability coming in handy. Tiny feature tweaks like that could elevate smart glasses in a big way. (Turning off the screen could also extend battery life.) Outside of those standouts, there are references to some features already found in Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and the Meta Ray-Ban Display, like the ability to record 3K video, and, just like Meta, it looks like you won't be able to record video or take pictures when the privacy light indicator (an LED that lets people know you're recording) is obscured. There's not a ton to go off of yet, but if there's one thing that's clear, it's that Google has learned a thing or two since the Google Glass days, at least in terms of protecting privacy and designing thoughtful features.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taiwan just proved it's not afraid to go after big names as it ramps up efforts to compete with China in the tech talent pool. Taiwanese authorities have issued an arrest warrant for OnePlus CEO Pete Lau, accusing him of illegally recruiting dozens of Taiwanese engineers since 2014. The move comes as Taiwan has been strengthening enforcement against Chinese companies that attempt to lure away its highly sought-after tech workforce. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is now the world's sixth-largest company by market capitalization and manufactures chips for tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. With China and the U.S. locked in a heated technological arms race to develop more advanced AI systems, it's little surprise that Chinese companies would turn to Taiwan as a prime source of talent. In this case, Lau is accused of establishing a Hong Kong–based company called OnePlus Hong Kong and opening a Taiwanese branch of that company in 2015. That entity allegedly underwent some name changes and eventually hired around 70 engineers who worked on developing and testing software for OnePlus, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. Authorities also accuse OnePlus of transferring more than $72 million to the Taiwanese company through a separate Hong Kong firm for what it described as “contracted research and revenue from selling research results.” Prosecutors say the money was used to recruit Taiwanese engineers, pay their salaries, and buy equipment for the business. Two Taiwanese citizens were also indicted in connection with the alleged scheme. This makes Lau one of Taiwan's more high-profile targets. He co-founded OnePlus in 2013, and the company has since grown into one of China's most prominent smartphone brands. But this isn't the first time Chinese companies have come under scrutiny from Taiwanese authorities. Throughout last year, Taiwan investigated dozens of Chinese firms over similar alleged schemes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Post reported that federal agents seized a phone, two laptops — one work and one personal — and a Garmin watch from reporter Hannah Natanson, who was at her home in Virginia at the time. CNN's Brian Stelter wrote in his Reliable Sources newsletter Wednesday morning that several staffers told him “they're wondering what, if anything, Bezos will do to defend Natanson and the Post from this aggressive government action.” A warrant said that law enforcement is investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and has been accused of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports that were found in his lunchbox and his basement, according to an FBI affidavit. Natanson wrote a compelling first-person account in December of her time covering the Trump administration and the hundreds of government workers she'd been in contact with as sources. Bezos' influence at the Post has come into focus in recent years. In February he shook up the newspaper's opinion pages by refocusing the section on supporting and defending what he called “two pillars” — personal liberties and free markets. After Trump's re-election, Bezos joined other tech leaders in expressing a willingness to work with the administration. Bezos was among those who attended the presidential inauguration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A space startup founded by veterans of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture is recruiting partners in its quest to build robotic arms powered by artificial intelligence. Orbital Robotics CEO Aaron Borger told GeekWire that the company is working with a stealthy space venture on an orbital rendezvous project for the U.S. Space Force, with a series of demonstration missions scheduled in the next year and a half. And that's just the start: Borger and his teammates are trying to get traction for a plan that could give NASA's aging Hubble Space Telescope a much-needed boost. “We worked to get to the right people to talk to, both on the servicing side and on the mission side, and we're in conversations now on how we could work together on a collaborative mission,” said Doug Kohl, Orbital Robotics' chief operating officer. Their advisers include Chris Sembroski, an engineer who went into orbit in 2021 for a privately funded philanthropic space mission known as Inspiration4 and later spent two and a half years at Blue Origin. Orbital Robotics aims to focus on a key challenge looming for the next stage of the new space age: how to build spacecraft that can interact with other orbiting objects safely. That's not as easy as it may sound, especially when you're trying to manipulate objects in space while obeying Newton's Third Law of Motion. “That is exactly one of the hardest parts about putting robotic arms on spacecraft,” Borger said. To address the challenge, Orbital Robotics is developing a suite of AI-based software tools designed to track targets in space, plan out orbital maneuvers and interact with other spacecraft. It's also laying the groundwork for robotic arms and spacecraft that make use of its technology. “A lot of NASA engineers will say you can't use AI because you can't really predict what it's going to do, but with our method, we can,” Borger said. Now Orbital Robotics has built a larger prototype arm with seven degrees of freedom. “This one is more focused on how you dock with space debris, for example.” Borger declined to discuss that side of Orbital Robotics' business plan, but he noted that there are commercial applications as well. How do you actually continue to use it, rather than just letting it come down or die up there?” he said. … Then we can start focusing on using our robotic arms to manipulate things, start refilling it, repairing it, all sorts of stuff.” Orbital Robotics recently tested its tracking software using video footage that was captured during an earlier suborbital test mission. The first mission would test Orbital Robotics' flight software. Later missions would test the company's robotic arm and demonstrate its ability to capture a spacecraft in orbit. There's a growing interest in orbital rendezvous, proximity operations and capture, or RPOC for short — and Orbital Robotics isn't the only space company targeting that market. Borger said he prefers to think of such companies as potential partners rather than rivals. “I think they could use our arms,” he said. “They could use some of our software.” The company has already announced partnerships with Redmond, Wash.-based Starcloud and Texas-based Space Ocean. Orbital Robotics is also recruiting partners for an effort to save the 35-year-old Hubble Space Telescope from a fiery, mission-ending descent. Kohl said he and his collaborators are working on a white paper about the project that would be reviewed by NASA experts as well as astronauts who participated in previous Hubble servicing missions. Several years ago, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman was trying to get NASA interested in a crewed Hubble reboost mission. The clock is ticking: Last week, a team of scientists reported that Hubble could fall to its doom in as little as three or four years, due to increased atmospheric drag caused by heightened solar activity. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for Orbital Robotics as well. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People have settled on river deltas for millennia, drawn by fertile soil, fresh water, and abundant food sources. Coastal flooding is disproportionately affecting river delta populations, forcing them to contend with infrastructure damage, saltwater intrusion, and erosion. One reason for this is climate-driven sea level rise, but a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature finds that many of the world's river deltas are actually sinking faster than sea levels are rising. The findings point to heightening near-term flood risk for more than 236 million people, but river delta flooding is an issue of global food security as well. “Billions of people rely on the food that is produced from these deltas,” co-author and Virginia Tech geoscience professor Manoochehr Shirzaei told Gizmodo. The researchers, led by former Virginia Tech graduate student Leonard Ohenhen, who is now an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, used satellite data to create the first map of vertical land motion—or subsidence—for 40 major river deltas worldwide. Their satellite data was gathered using InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), a powerful remote sensing technique that uses multiple radar images of Earth's surface to map tiny elevation changes over time. The map offers a high-resolution view of delta-wide subsidence spanning five continents and 29 countries. These deltas are sinking about 4 millimeters per year on average, faster than current estimates of global sea level rise. While both land subsidence and sea level rise contribute to flood risk, the fact that these deltas are sinking faster than sea levels are rising means that subsidence is the primary driver of their near-term flood risk, according to Shirzaei. “If you want to come up with an adaptation strategy or create a resiliency plan, this is the data you should look at, rather than projections of sea level rise to 2100.” Whereas sea level rise is driven by global climate change, land subsidence is driven by regional human activities such as excessive groundwater pumping or underground mining. “We have very good engineering solutions for that,” Shirzaei said. Future studies will need to account for infrastructural differences to fully assess the subsidence-driven flood risk across various river deltas, he explained. Shirzaei also hopes researchers will eventually be able to map land subsidence across the entire world—similar to Google Earth, but for land deformation. “The satellite data that we use are publicly available data, we don't pay for it, and we have the technology to process the data and turn them into such useful measurements at [high] precision and accuracy. Access to this data will become increasingly important as climate change continues to compound the effect of land subsidence across the world's coastlines. The iceberg could completely disintegrate within days or weeks, scientists say. Scientists uncover new evidence of undocumented glacial earthquakes in Antarctica. In some areas, the weather could feel more like May than late December. This process, driven by climate change, is increasing the risk of “Category 6” tropical cyclones making landfall in densely populated areas. There's never been a giant dam failure in the US modern era, and a team of researchers is looking to keep it that way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced on Wednesday that it's launching a new beta feature in the Gemini app that allows the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Although Gemini could already retrieve information from these apps, it can now reason across your data to provide proactive results, such as connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched. Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. “Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a blog post. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.” “I've also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it's been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Trump administration publicly cast Venezuela's Tren de Aragua (TdA) as a unified terrorist force tied to President Nicolás Maduro and operating inside the United States, hundreds of internal US government records obtained by WIRED tell a far less certain story. Intelligence taskings, law-enforcement bulletins, and drug-task-force assessments show that agencies spent much of 2025 struggling to determine whether TdA even functioned as an organized entity in the US at all—let alone as a coordinated national security threat. This story was produced in partnership with Property of the People. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. While senior administration officials portrayed TdA as a centrally directed terrorist network active across American cities, internal tasking directives and threat assessments repeatedly cite “intelligence gaps” in understanding how the group operated on US soil: Whether it had identifiable leadership, whether its domestic activity reflecting any coordination beyond small local crews, and whether US-based incidents pointed to foreign direction or were simply the work of autonomous, profit-driven criminals. Again and again, they flag unresolved questions about TdA's US footprint, including its size, financing, and weapons access, warning that key estimates—such as the number of members operating in the US—were often inferred or extrapolated by analysts due to a lack of corroborated facts. While senior administration officials spoke of “invasion,” “irregular warfare,” and “narco-terrorism,” field-level reporting consistently portrayed Tren de Aragua in the US as a fragmented, profit-driven criminal group, with no indication of centralized command, strategic coordination, or underlying political motive. At the same time, however, an internal Border Patrol assessment obtained by WIRED shows officials could not substantiate those claims, relying instead on interview-based estimates rather than confirmed detections of gang members entering the US. In a Fox News interview the same month, US attorney general Pam Bondi called TdA “a foreign arm of the Venezuelan government,” claiming its members “are organized. Although TdA's classification as a foreign terrorist organization—following a February 2025 State Department designation—immediately reshaped policy, internal correspondence shows the group remained poorly understood even by senior counterterrorism officials, including those at the National Counterterrorism Center. Unresolved questions about TdA—alongside newly designated drug cartel entities in Mexico—ultimately prompted intelligence managers to issue a nationwide tasking order, directing analysts to urgently address the US government's broad “knowledge gaps.” The directive, issued May 2, 2025, underscores the breadth of these intelligence gaps, citing unresolved questions about whether the entities had access to weapons beyond small arms, relied on bulk-cash shipments, cryptocurrencies, or mobile payment apps, or were supported by corrupt officials or state-linked facilitators overseas. The tasking order makes clear those uncertainties extended beyond TdA's past activity to its potential response under pressure. Issued by national intelligence managers overseeing counterterrorism, cyber, narcotics, and transnational crime, it flagged a lack of insight into how TdA and several Mexican cartels might adapt their operations or shift tactics in response to intensified US enforcement. Similar limits surface in records from White House-run interagency task forces known as HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas), which show counter-narcotics officials, too, were working with a materially limited understanding of TdA's activities. Additional HIDTA reporting likewise fails to identify a sprawling narco-terror enterprise publicly described by senior officials. A “2026 Threat Assessment” covering North Texas and Oklahoma identifies Mexican cartels as the dominant narcotics threat, while characterizing TdA activity as “street level.” That assessment drew on survey responses from dozens of law enforcement agencies and was compiled by a task force that included police chiefs, sheriffs, US attorneys, district attorneys, and senior officials from the FBI, DEA, DHS, and Secret Service, among others. Assessments by Customs and Border Protection broke sharply from broader law enforcement perspectives. Beginning in mid-March, CBP began producing its own intelligence products, quickly ascribing TdA with both the “capability and intent” to carry out attacks inside the United States; ranking it among the “most capable” foreign terrorist groups, listing it above Hezbollah and Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, while also acknowledging it had no knowledge of any “specific or credible threat.” CBP and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions or requests for comment. Just before April, CBP unveiled a much longer “sensitive but unclassified” assessment. The report describes TdA as a growing national security concern, citing its exploitation of US-bound migration and a range of criminal activity from money laundering, to extortion, to human smuggling. The report, which drew from across border enforcement, intelligence offices, and the FBI's own gang intelligence center, warned readers on its interagency network that its findings relied on “analytical judgments that are not fact, knowledge, or proof,” adding that it might not always distinguish in print between assumption and fact. The same report acknowledges significant uncertainty about TdA membership figures, identifying markers, and whether US-based subsets coordinate or respond to centralized leadership. Over a 22-month period, CBP's own detection methods identified no more than 83 known TdA members at the border. In remarks Tuesday, Trump leaned into the same framing, accusing Democratic-led cities of giving gangs room to operate. In internal assessments before the 2024 election, the FBI described TdA as an unsophisticated compared to traditional “South American theft groups,” finding its members favored “opportunistic,” often “spontaneous” crimes, with a focus on retail theft from big-box stores and exploiting other Venezuelan and South American migrants. While the bureau consistently warned of TdA's propensity for violence, it failed to find any coordination among members inside the US or note any evidence of complex, preplanned operations. In April, a joint situation report filed by Alabama and Tennessee field offices linked TdA to a “retail theft crew” suspected of smash-and-grab burglaries at Walmart jewelry counters in the region. While the report notes similar incidents nationwide—with losses estimated at roughly $1.2 million—it implicates only a single “confirmed” Tren de Aragua member, and makes no reference to any national-security-level threat. The reports sit alongside public statements from FBI director Kash Patel, who, also in April, described TdA publicly as “a direct threat to our national security,” vowing to eliminate what he called a “violent terrorist organization.” Inside the bureau, records show, its Terrorism Screening Center responded by convening a “Tren de Aragua Interagency Working Group” to coordinate watch listing changes. It did not acknowledge the existence of any terrorist threat, saying only that it remains steadfast in its “commitment to working with our local, state, and federal partners to combat violent gang activity in our communities, including illegal acts carried out by the Venezuelan criminal gang, Tren de Aragua.” Similar low-level depictions of TdA activity appear in regional drug-task-force reporting. A June 2025 Northern California threat assessment noted that TdA “did not appear to be directly involved in drug trafficking,” similarly linking the group instead primarily to organized retail theft, alongside suspected involvement in “at least two shootings.” A separate assessment covering North Texas and Oklahoma alleged a connection between TdA and Walmart's delivery app, Spark, citing suspected identity theft used to “exploit the delivery driver profession to facilitate financial fraud.” According to the bulletin, TdA members—including some with “direct ties to TdA leadership”—used services such as Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub by renting or sharing accounts obtained through personal networks or online forums. Walmart, Uber, GrubHub, and DoorDash did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In August, a law-enforcement bulletin on ATM “jackpotting,” circulated by the Texas Financial Crimes Intelligence Center, warned that suspects involved in ATM malware attacks “may be associated” with TdA. People “allegedly affiliated with TdA have hosted parties involving DJs,” officials said, adding that the gatherings “may be” an effort “to potentially further engage in, or promote criminal activity.”</p>

Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, accused the author of “doxxing” a Delta Force commander and “leaking classified information.” Luna has even made a criminal referral to the Justice Department. The incident has stirred a debate online about the meaning of “doxxing,” a term that Luna doesn't seem to understand. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security keeps insisting that ICE agents are getting “doxxed” when masked federal agents are simply being identified as they storm the country, rounding up anyone who isn't white. The day after the U.S. government kidnapped Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Harp shared a photo and online biography of a U.S. military officer. “I have made a motion to subpoena Seth Harp before Congress to face accountability for leaking classified intel about Operation Absolute Resolve, including doxxing a Delta Force commander,” Rep. Luna tweeted on Jan. 7. “It is not ‘doxxing' to identify by name government officials involved in breaking news events,” Harp told Gizmodo. Harp acknowledges that “true doxxing can be a crime,” depending on the circumstances. “For example, 18 USC s. 119 criminalizes publishing restricted personal information about certain government officials, informants, and witnesses with the intent to incite a crime of violence against them. There are state laws against doxxing as well,” Harp continued. “It was deeply irresponsible of Rep. Luna to throw around allegations of ‘doxxing' in her wild accusations against me, when all I did was identify by name a highly ranking military officer at the center of a major breaking news story, which is inherently newsworthy information that the public has a right to know,” Harp wrote. But Harp didn't even share any information, like an address or phone number. He shared biographical information that was listed on a public website. Gizmodo reached out to the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 8, the day after Renee Good was killed in Minneapolis by an ICE agent. We asked for confirmation that the agent involved was named Jonathan Ross, a simple fact first reported by the Star Tribune that we wanted to verify. DHS said that confirming the identity would be doxxing. “We are not going to expose the name of this officer. The email also described him as an ICE deportation officer with 10 years of experience and included a long list of requirements he had to meet to get an ICE Special Response Team. Oddly, that long description could have been used to identify him in the first place. Local news outlets reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's description of a previous incident with Ross in June, where he was dragged by a car, is probably what allowed the Star Tribune to identify him from court documents. DHS went on to insist that naming the agent was an act of doxxing, while claiming that their officers were under threat: DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers. Our law enforcement officers are on the frontlines arresting terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists. Now, thanks to the malicious rhetoric of sanctuary politicians, they are under constant threat from violent agitators. But is it doxxing to just identify a federal agent who has allegedly killed someone? Ross is involved in an event with not just national attention but international significance. The whole world is on edge about America's slide into fascism, not to mention Trump's threats to invade allies like Greenland, Canada, and Panama. People magazine has since reported that Ross lived in the suburb of Chaska, Minnesota, but even that isn't really doxxing. If reporters weren't able to describe basic biographical information in news stories, it would be impossible to report on anything accurately. There's no law that criminalizes identifying the city where an ICE agent lives. ICE and its other sister agencies, like CBP and Border Patrol, are acting outside the law to harm Americans right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YouTube and other social media platforms are ramping up their parental controls as the online safety of minors continues to be a hot topic internationally. Parents can even block accounts from watching Shorts altogether — either permanently, or temporarily, like if a kid is supposed to be using YouTube to study for a test by watching educational content. These features are also available for adults, who can opt to set their own limits and reminders. For parents who also use YouTube, it can be challenging to move back and forth between an adult's account and kid's account — unless if you want your algorithm to be forever usurped by Bluey. These features build upon YouTube's existing parental controls for teens, which include the ability to supervise a teen's channel activity if they're making content. This has become industry standard, as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook have similar controls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been one week since a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a resident of Minneapolis. Thousands of protesters—from young students to elderly residents—have taken to the streets, setting up memorials for Good and facing off with ICE agents. More than 2,000 ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, with another 1,000 on the way. “It feels like our community is under siege by our own federal government,” Minnesota state representative Michael Howard told The New York Times. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem has continued claiming that Jonathan Ross, the agent who reportedly shot Good, acted in self-defense. Videos of the situation in Minneapolis show a different reality, however, one where Good appears to be driving away from the scene when Ross fires multiple shots through her windshield. In one video purportedly filmed on Ross' cell phone that was shared by multiple members of the Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance, a male voice can be heard saying “fucking bitch” right after the shooting. Protests across Minnesota—and around the country—are ongoing, on crowded city streets and in small towns, as residents don winter coats and stage walkouts, demonstrating against their federal government. Police tape surrounds Renee Nicole Good's vehicle after she was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. People confront Minneapolis Police officers as they leave the scene after a shooting by an ICE agent during federal law enforcement operations in Minneapolis. Protesters gathered where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed earlier that day by a federal agent in Minneapolis. A protester is shot in the face with what appears to be a marker round or a rubber bullet at the scene where an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good earlier in the day in Minneapolis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is removing the option to pay a one-time fee for its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday. It's also a decision that could have an impact on Tesla's bottom line, Musk's ability to unlock the full value of his $1 trillion pay package, and the company's ever-swirling legal troubles. And it comes as many other global automakers are making progress on their own advanced driver assistance systems in hopes of competing with Tesla. Tesla has sold access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software suite — which still does not make a car completely autonomous, and requires human supervision — at various price points over the years. Musk often encouraged customers to pay the upfront price, though, as he claimed the cost of FSD would increase dramatically as Tesla added to its capabilities. Musk also did not offer an explanation for the change, but there are a few possible reasons. Musk and other Tesla executives have spoken publicly about how the adoption rate is lower than they had hoped. In October 2025, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said only 12% of all Tesla customers have paid for FSD. Boosting subscriptions would also get Musk closer to fulfilling one of the key “product goals” required for him to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. The company has tasked him with, among other things, reaching “10 million active FSD subscriptions” (measured daily over a three-month period) before late 2035. But that was not true: Tesla has had to make a number of upgrades inside its vehicles in the years since, and Musk himself has said that a huge portion of existing owners (those with so-called “Hardware 3” vehicles) would likely need new hardware in their cars. Customers who bought the software outright would eventually get a software update that would make their cars full autonomous. Tesla currently faces all kinds of legal trouble related to these unmet promises. Tesla also faces a range of class action lawsuits over the claims it made about the future autonomous capabilities of its vehicles. By removing the option to buy FSD outright, the company could be capping any potential liabilities in those lawsuits should they proceed to trial. But the company's success hasn't stopped competitors from trying to develop their own systems. Rivian recently detailed its own efforts to release FSD-like driver assistance software, starting with a major geographic expansion to its hands-free driving feature. Ford and General Motors have their own hands-free systems. And the many rival automakers Tesla competes with in China have been developing their own solutions, with some even offering their driver assistance features as a standard option.

He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.

At CES last week, Nvidia unveiled its new DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution technology, along with 6X Multi Frame Generation. Now, after initially teasing a January 13 rollout and then quietly delaying the feature, the company is rolling out DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution to all Nvidia app users. Announced at CES last week, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution introduces a 2nd generation transformer model for DLSS Super Resolution, delivering state-of-the-art image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs in over 400 games and apps," the company stated. Nvidia claims its second-generation Super Resolution is its most sophisticated yet, utilizing 5x the compute power compared to the first-generation transformer model. Since its launch in beta last week, community tests have confirmed that, while DLSS 4.5 works on older RTX 30 and even 20 series GPUs, warnings about performance lossses of up to 20%+ ring true. In our short hands-on time at CES 2026, we definitely noted an impressive improvement over the existing model. Per our previous report: "What we didn't expect is that DLSS 4.5 actually makes certain lighting and particle effects look richer and more natural, too." While this week's headline launch is Super Resolution, Nvidia also highlighted that its existing DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is now available on over 250 games and apps — but there's no sign of 6x DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, also unveiled at this year's CES, just yet. Other updates to the Nvidia app include a new Debug Mode that can instantly disable all overclocks and voltage tweaks in case of system instability.

At CES 2026, Phison demonstrated consumer PCs with its aiDAPTIV+ software/hardware combo running AI inference up to ten times faster than without its specialized suite of technologies. When Phison introduced its aiDAPTIV+ technology in mid-2024, it essentially transformed NAND memory into a managed memory tier alongside DRAM to enable large AI models to train or run on systems that did not have enough DDR5 and/or HBM memory, but at the time, it was merely a proof-of-concept aimed at enterprises. Normally, when tokens no longer fit into the GPU's key-value (KV) cache during inference, older KV entries are evicted, so if/when the model needs those tokens again (in cases of long context or agent loops), the GPU must recompute them from scratch, which makes AI inference inefficient on systems with limited memory capacity. However, with a system equipped with Phison's aiDAPTIV+ stack, tokens that no longer fit into the GPU's KV cache are written to flash and retained for future reuse, which can reduce memory requirements in many cases and dramatically increase the time to first token, which is the time it takes to produce the first word of a response. The renewed focus of Phison's aiDAPTIV+ platform is designed to let ordinary PCs with entry-level or even integrated GPUs handle far larger AI models than their installed DRAM would normally permit. Bringing large-model inference and limited training to desktops and notebooks may be valuable for developers and small businesses that cannot afford to make big investments in AI at the moment, so Phison has a list of aiDAPTIV+ testing partners with systems featuring the technology at CES 2026, such as Acer, Asus, Corsair, Emdoor, MSI, and even Nvidia. For example, Acer has managed to run an gpt-oss-120b model on an Acer laptop with just 32GB of memory, which opens doors to a number of applications. Phison claims that a 120-billion-parameter MoE model can be handled with 32 GB of DRAM, compared with roughly 96 GB required by conventional approaches, because inactive parameters are kept in flash rather than resident in main memory. Given that Phison's aiDAPTIV+ stack involves an AI-aware SSD (or SSDs) based on an advanced controller from Phison, special firmware, and software, the implementation of the technology should be pretty straightforward. This is important for PC makers, value-added resellers, and small businesses interested in using this capability, so it is reasonable to expect a number of them to actually use this technology with their premium models aimed at developers and power users.

His comments imply that Cupertino has bought into the company, following in Nvidia's footsteps after the White House took a 10% stake in the company, but there is a possibility they are erroneous. As you know, Intel came to see me; they needed help. And I said I'll help you, but I want 10% of your company to go to the United States of America.” Trump also added later, “As soon as we went in, Apple went in, Nvidia went in, a lot of smart people went in — they followed us. This statement has analysts and industry experts talking, as it's seemingly a suggestion that Apple has reached an agreement with Intel regarding the latter's overtures toward the former for a potential investment in the third quarter of 2025. Aside from that, we've seen clues in Apple and Broadcom job listings that both are looking for experts in Intel's suite of EMIB packaging tech, as well as reports from sources that Apple has acquired the Intel 18A process design kit for its entry-level M-series chips. However, without any official announcement from Intel or Apple, we can only speculate if this was an actual investment or if the President misspoke. After all, Intel would have to notify its shareholders if it sold a major amount of its stock to Apple (or any other company, for that matter). Alternatively, it could be that what Trump meant by “Apple went in” is the company signing a contract with Intel to produce chips for them. This is actually a more plausible direction, especially given that it may be considering using 18A or even 14A for its future SOCs. But, then again, a major client like Apple, which would be expected to order at least 15 and 20 million units, should appear in Intel's filings, which are due to come out in a couple of weeks. A more straightforward explanation, though, is that Trump could have mistaken Apple for another company — SoftBank Group. However, without an official statement from Apple or Intel, it remains unclear what the President meant by what he said.

Recently, the flagship Nvidia card has surged in price far beyond the mythical $2000 MSRP, and is now also harder to find than a clear picture of Sasquatch going for a forest walk. The only way to get your hands on a 5090 at the moment is to purchase one as part of a prebuilt gaming PC, and today, we have a deal on an HP Omen 45L gaming PC that you can configure with an RTX 5090 for just $3544.99 when you add the promo code NEWYEAR26 for a 26% discount off the total checkout price, getting you the whole rig for less than current 5090 standalone listings. You could save a few cents by going with 16GB of RAM, but I wouldn't recommend dropping below 32GB on a high-end build like this. The rest of the configured parts include an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K with 20 cores and 20 threads, and a 1TB SSD for storage. This configured HP Omen 45L gaming PC features an RTX  5090 GPU, Intel Core Ultra 7 265K CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD for storage. Apply code NEWYEAR26 at checkout to receive the 26% discount on your order. Searching through the most popular retailers, I have not found a 1st-party seller offering an RTX 5090. It's not just RAM that's disappearing off the shelves and asking astronomical prices; GPUs are also starting to climb in price again. The Nvidia RTX 5090 is the most powerful consumer graphics card available (if you can find one in stock), and in our review of Nvidia's RTX 5090, we saw a 25% increase in performance at 4K ultra over the previous RTX 4090 flagship GPU. We benchmarked the card against our suite of 16 games and found it easily topped the charts in pure rasterization and dominated in ray tracing and MFG applications, where Nvidia holds the crown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many years ago, my brother-in-law was renovating an 18th-century house in New Orleans. As I spent the day searching through piles of moldy copies of Peanuts comics, I found a (still working!) A vibrating device offers you a mystical promise: You can trick yourself into exercising while staying absolutely still, as long as you're standing on, near, or holding something that's vibrating! Anyway, this is a long way to go about saying that for a few weeks, I have been vibrating myself while watching Train to Busan and other zombie movies. While I do think that the long-standing claims that you can vibrate your way to weight loss are mostly bogus, they do have some real benefits. Every mildly fitness-interested person has gotten served ads for these. Right now, I'm using the Merach vibration plate. (I used to have the EZLife HitGo ($100), but it inexplicably stopped working a month or so ago.) The Merach version feels sturdy and is incredibly easy to set up. Just plug it in and pop some AAA batteries into the included remote. The slim manual explains that there are five presets. It has silicone lugs on top so that you can't slip off, although everyone in my family does cheats and stands on it without shoes. (Multiple people in my family could get on at the same time.) Multiple vibration-plate TikToks (I have been researching extensively) note that you can start to see physical changes in as little as 20 minutes of whole-body vibration a day. I didn't even need to wait 20 minutes. After two or three minutes, the skin of my thighs turned red and started itching violently. It turns out this is a known reaction to whole-body vibration, and it's probably a mild histamine release from the sudden capillary dilation. (I do not experience anything like this on other parts of my body with a handheld massager.) There are many vibration plate workouts online, depending on whether your goal is to lose weight, build muscle, or reduce the risk of falls. I opted to do my normal at-home strength training routine of dumbbell lunges, weighted squats, and push-ups, while using the plate. For what it's worth, my fitness trackers do not register any increase in heart rate when I do a strength workout on the plate versus off the plate, so I don't think I'm burning any more calories than I would without it. I was fully prepared to write about how this viral TikTok device doesn't really do anything more for you than getting outside and walking around the block would, and that it didn't really do anything for me except give me a weird thigh rash. (My neurotypical 10-year-old daughter doesn't show any interest at all.) A friend who is an occupational therapist remarked on this when she came over for dinner one evening. “It provides deep, full-body sensory input that can help calm the nervous system and improve body awareness,” she said (she being Mallory Kennedy, an occupational therapist who owns Portland, Oregon's, Sensory Nest). Vibration plates do have a lot of researched benefits for specific populations. For example, if you've been inactive for a long time due to factors like cancer treatment or being on bed rest, a vibration plate is a low-impact way to encourage bone and muscle growth. This comes with the massive caveat that if you do have one of these conditions, you should probably start an exercise program under the guidance of your doctor. “Older, more frail adults appear to benefit most from whole-body vibration training,” said Michael Fredericson, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Stanford's Sports Medicine Clinic. “Studies have demonstrated improvements in lower-body strength, balance, mobility, and overall physical performance. Whole-body vibration represents a safe intervention for older adults with limited mobility or sedentary lifestyles and offers an alternative to traditional exercise for those unable to perform conventional resistance training.” I would say that if you're an able-bodied person who is trying to build muscle or lose weight, there are probably way more effective exercises you could be doing and devices you could be using. But if you're coming out of a long period of inactivity and are worried about muscle loss or loss of bone density—or, more rarely, if you or your child or partner is neurodivergent—you would probably benefit from this viral device a lot more than the rest of us would.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>My journey on TikTok Shop started out with a search for “hip hop jewelry.” It's an innocuous search query multiple users have likely typed in, hoping to find something to wear. While browsing the cheap jewelry, I was struck by what TikTok's algorithm repeatedly suggested that I might also be interested in: jewelry with blatant Nazi symbolism. Last year, the social media platform removed multiple antisemitic products from its store. Most recently, many users who were scrolling through videos on their For You pages expressed outrage when a swastika necklace, under the name “hiphop titanium steel pendant,” was promoted to them in late December as an on-sale product in TikTok Shop that cost $8. Despite TikTok removing that necklace, my investigation into TikTok Shop uncovered an algorithmic web of far-right product search suggestions that nudged me toward white nationalist and Nazi-related terms. This recommendation box sometimes appears in TikTok's mobile app as a set of four related search suggestions, each with a picture, as users look for products and scroll through what's available on TikTok Shop. He says TikTok is currently working to remove these algorithmic suggestions from the app, in response to a detailed list of questions from WIRED. Kuper also highlights TikTok Shop's safety report, which states that the ecommerce platform removed 700,000 sellers and 200,000 restricted or prohibited products in the first half of 2025. Buddhists widely used manji symbols, which can often look identical to swastikas, for thousands of years before the Nazis. Even so, the necklace that was promoted in December included a detail suggesting the piece of jewelry was so widely seen because it was potentially part of an attempt at trolling by extremists, rather than a cultural misunderstanding. While this “hiphop” connection may sound like a stretch at first, TikTok Shop's algorithm suggested I look up products related to Nazi symbolism multiple times over the past month while searching for “hiphop jewelry” and variations of that search with different spacing and phrasing. For example, the top term TikTok highlighted in the dedicated ecommerce tab as a product that others users searched for was “swatika jewelry,” a misspelling of swastika—next to an $11 set of rhinestone-covered chains. After I tapped on this initial suggested search for “swatika jewelry,” TikTok highlighted searches on the next page that were even more explicitly inflammatory. As I continued clicking on more product searches that TikTok suggested, the web of Nazi-related terms seemed endless. Although the search algorithm was clear with its suggestions, the product results TikTok Shop served me were less blatant and often plausibly deniable as not being connected to antisemitism when removed from this context. “We have general ideas about how these algorithms work,” says Filippo Menczer, a professor at Indiana University and faculty director of the Observatory on Social Media. Without more insights into TikTok's secretive algorithm, it's impossible to ascertain exactly how this web of Nazi-related search terms originated. Menczer theorizes that the suggested search results I encountered could be either the algorithm “working as intended,” where it connects potentially related organic search terms, or “some kind of manipulation” by nefarious users, where fake accounts may be used to try to trick an algorithm by boosting certain search terms in an effort to astroturf their popularity. When reached for comment, TikTok's Kuper stated that the platform has protective policies, which include search results. “They really need to dig in, do an investigation, and understand where it's coming from. And also provide transparency, so that users understand how they were targeted,” she says.
