                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One suspected foreign agent identified under psychic program said to be still working for FBI Details of the successful use of a DIA psychic, Angela Dellafiora Ford, also a now-retired DIA official, are contained in Mr. Carmichael's unpublished book “Unconventional Method.” The use of psychics for intelligence and security operations, including hunting for spies, locating hostages and finding foreign surveillance gear officially ended in 1995, when so-called remote viewing programs known as Star Gate and Grill Flame were shut down. The effort to locate spies with the help of psychics continued unofficially for several years after through what Mr. Carmichael said was a private, personal effort carried out with a handful of officials who had the blessing of senior DIA leaders. Mr. Carmichael, who received multiple intelligence awards before retiring in 2014, said initially he was highly skeptical of using psychics to track down spies in government. But after Ms. Ford provided accurate details that led to the arrest of an Australian intelligence official who tried to sell U.S. satellite imagery secrets, he became a believer in the unorthodox technique. Among his awards are the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, Defense Intelligence Director's Award and citations from the FBI director. The former counterspy said he wrote the book, an insider account with previously undisclosed information, in an effort to highlight what he regards as a major FBI counterintelligence failure. “They didn't even bother to interview the employee,” he said. “To the best of my knowledge, he remains unaware of the fact that anyone suspected he was identifiable with an FBI UNSUB.” But he described the suspect as a military service member who later retired and then joined the FBI and held a high-level security clearance. “Today, he serves in a supervisory capacity at FBI headquarters and has been employed by the FBI for a bit more than 20 years. FBI and DIA spokesmen did not respond to email requests for comment. “And that was the point where Angela made a true believer out of me,” he wrote. Canadian-born Wispelaere worked at the Australian Imagery Organization within the Defense Intelligence Organization, an intelligence unit that received secret U.S. satellite photos. He quit abruptly in January 1999 and days later walked into a Singapore embassy in Southeast Asia with an offer of a secret U.S. satellite photo for sale and identifying himself under a false name, Jeff Baker. At DIA, in what officials said was an officially approved personal activity, Ms. Ford conducted several psychic sessions that correctly identified the spy as Australian or someone close to Australia, something Mr. Carmichael later confirmed through DIA records. Karl C. Glasbrenner, also a retired DIA security official and Mr. Carmichael's former boss, said Ms. Ford was a remnant of the “remote viewing” program code-named Star Gate that was canceled in 1995. In addition to Star Gate, the 16-year program used other code names, including Grill Flame. “In fact, the psychics scored a number of remarkable successes,” the book states, including helping to locate terrorist-held hostages and other missing people. Ms. Ford, Mr. Glasbrenner said, correctly identified Wispelaere with a near-correct spelling of his name and disclosed that the suspect was Australian during the psychic sessions – information that she had no physical way of knowing. “Angela Ford had some phenomenal skills in the remote viewing arena,” Mr. Glasbrenner said. Mr. Glasbrenner said Ms. Ford initially took part in finding overseas listening devices for DIA. “So they don't necessarily want to find the problem in their own ranks.” The book explains how Ms. Ford conducted her work as an intelligence-gathering psychic. Without any prompting or discussion between her and DIA officials, a clue or question would be placed in a double-sealed envelope. She would concentrate on the sealed envelope and begin taking notes. In some cases, the psychic would visualize words or seem to hear words in their mind, including locations and people's names, and then record the words and the sounds on paper. “But the writing is actually a process of recording information that she receives in her mind.” Ms. Ford said Mr. Carmichael engaged in real-world counterintelligence work using the psychic methodology known as remote viewing. “While controversial, remote viewing was explored alongside traditional tradecraft to generate leads and perspectives that proved operationally relevant,” she stated in an email. “Angela believes that every event generates or leaves in its wake a quantum of psychic energy – a fingerprint of energy which uniquely marks that event forever,” the book stated. “If one could access such uniquely marked tags of energy, one could reconstruct an experience or otherwise access the original event … Automatic writing enables the practitioner to access those uniquely marked tags of energy.” Mr. Carmichael said he is aware that other security intelligence officials and agencies dismiss the use of psychics as unproductive. There also are legal concerns that if a spy is captured through psychic means that the method could be used to thwart a prosecution, he said. The process can be both odd and scary, he said. “But frankly, how it works, though of interest, is not terribly important to me. I do care principally about the acquisition of accurate and actionable information,” Mr. Carmichael said. Within the short-lived intelligence psychic community, Ms. Ford was an anomaly. The others involved in remote viewing were banned from the use of automatic writing and instead followed a method called “coordinate remote viewing” that used photos and geo-coordinates. One of the FBI's prime recruited Chinese agents in Southern California, Katrina Leung, turned out to be a longtime Beijing double agent who supplied China with secrets until her arrest in 2003. In 1999, FBI counterintelligence agents also falsely hounded then-CIA counterintelligence official Brian Kelley for nearly three years beginning in 1999, alleging he was a Russian mole. Peter Strozk, FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division, was fired in 2017 after a text message revealed he had promised his mistress “we'll stop” Donald Trump from becoming president. Mr. Carmichael said he favors greater use of psychics for intelligence agencies, including counterintelligence. “There are unknown numbers of Americans currently active within our system whose crimes have gone completely undetected to date,” he stated. “When American warfighters are in harm's way somewhere in the world, then an unresolved UNSUB case means that someone's son or daughter may die,” he said. However, Mr. Carmichael said it is unlikely U.S. counterintelligence officials will leverage psychics in their work.

Even with today's advanced computers, the world's most complex data problems can't be solved by a single machine. Instead, it's far more efficient to break up tasks among many separate computers. But with the rise of personal computers (PCs), UC Berkeley researchers like David Gedye and David Anderson realized that the untapped pool of citizen scientists could be a vital asset. And what bigger data pool was there to draw from than the vastness of interstellar space? In 1999, the computer scientists teamed with astronomers Eric Korpela and Dan Werthimer to launch SETI@home. The project relied on individuals downloading a client program to their home PC designed to parse data passively collected by a 984-foot-wide radio telescope at the now-shuttered Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Before launching SETI@home, project organizers estimated they'd receive around 50,000 volunteers. In only a few days, they surpassed 200,000 participants from over 100 countries. The data itself wasn't collected by simply aiming Arecibo at a section of space and listening for ET whisperings. That multiplies the amount of computing power we need by 10,000,” said Anderson. No other radio SETI project has been able to do that.” Combing through those files ultimately required enlisting the help of a supercomputer—in this case an installation at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics. From there, researchers could winnow down their suspects to a couple million signals, then rank them by likelihood of ET origin after accounting for radio frequency interferences from sources like orbital satellites, TV broadcasts, and even kitchen microwaves. Korpela and Werthimer eventually settled on about 100 final contenders worth additional examinations. Since July 2025, they have used China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) to collect new data from these sections of sky. And we have a long list of things that we would have done differently and that future sky survey projects should do differently,” explained Anderson. According to Korpela, Arecibo's limited field-of-view and a lack of any particularly striking radio blips so far means a sudden ET revelation isn't likely just yet. “There's a little disappointment that we didn't see anything,” he said. “In order to probe farther distances, you need bigger telescopes and longer observing times. It's always best if you are able to control the telescope for your project. We weren't able to control what the telescope was doing.” Regardless, SETI@home speaks to the power of both crowdsourcing and citizen science. When combined with all of the PC advancements since 1999, there's a chance that an heir to the project may finally find that extraordinary, history-altering space signal. “I think it still captures people's imagination to look for extraterrestrial intelligence,” said Korpella. “I think that you could still get significantly more processing power than we used for SETI@home and process more data because of a wider internet bandwidth.” Sign up for the Popular Science newsletter, delivered to your inbox six days a week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please share it using our news tips form. The Netflix series was a smashing hit from its very first season. It instantly cemented its characters and iconography in the cultural zeitgeist while also helping to kick off the ‘80s nostalgia wave. Every subsequent season felt like its own cultural moment within itself. Each year that a new season came, new and unique trends followed, whether that be Scoops Ahoy and red cherry slushies or Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” charting to number one over 30 years after its release. The good news is that in the streaming age, shows are abundant, and plenty of them can fill that “Stranger Things”-shaped hole in your heart. Here are five series featuring eerie small towns and groups of plucky kids fighting supernatural threats. Don't be scared off by that title. While “Dark” may be a bit bleaker, it has no shortage of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The series follows four families whose wicked and mysterious pasts come to light after two children go missing in their quiet German town. Not only was the original novel by Stephen King a huge source of inspiration for “Stranger Things,” but both franchises feature Finn Wolfhard in prominent roles – though he does not have a role in this prequel series. It follows a new set of characters in Derry, Maine, as they unravel the secret horrors of Pennywise and the town itself. Based on the manga of the same name, “Alice in Borderland” follows an unemployed gamer named Arisu as he is transported to a desolate mirror of Tokyo. Once again, this TV show is based on a comic book of the same name. “Locke & Key” focuses on three siblings who move into their deceased father's home in small-town Massachusetts. Upon their arrival, they find a number of strange keys that hold magical properties that are unlocked when used on doors in the house. Their use of these keys attracts enemies, but it may also guide them to the answer of their father's death. No list of creepy, rural community shows would be complete without the premiere one. “Twin Peaks” is a strange series, but an essential one. It follows a small Pacific Northwest town that is shaken up by the death of teenager Laura Palmer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered more than 6,000 planets beyond our solar system. What if some of them aren't planets at all, but tiny black holes in disguise? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. What if some of the alien worlds we've discovered are not actually planets at all? Astronomers have spent years cataloging thousands of worlds orbiting distant stars, assuming that if something has the mass of a planet and exerts a gravitational pull on its parent star, it must be a planet. But there may be a ghostly alternative lurking in the early universe. In a recent paper that was uploaded to the arXiv preprint server but has not been peer-reviewed, researchers suggest that some "exoplanets" we've detected might actually be something far more exotic — primordial black holes. These are not your garden-variety black holes, born from dying stars. Instead, they are hypothetical leftovers from the Big Bang itself, formed when the newborn universe was a chaotic, high-pressure soup of energy. Our current methods for finding planets are exceptionally good at measuring mass but less so at determining the physical size of a planet. For example, we often use the radial velocity method — a technique that involves watching a star "wobble" because the gravity of an orbiting object is yanking on it. When a planet transits, it blocks some light, telling us its physical size. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The researchers identified several intriguing suspects, including Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f and Wolf 1061 d. These objects are heavy enough to make their stars wobble, yet they remain invisible to our telescopes. The team pointed to microlensing events — brief flashes of light caused when a massive object passes in front of a distant star and acts like a magnifying glass — as potential hiding spots for these ancient nomads. —Tiny black holes from the dawn of time may be altering our planet's orbit, new study suggests The authors admitted that these candidates are merely representative possibilities, rather than a definitive gallery of tiny black holes. The next decade of data from missions like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope — a NASA telescope that will take a broad survey of exoplanets, due to launch as soon as this fall — will be crucial for learning more about these objects. We might catch one evaporating via Hawking radiation, a theoretical process whereby black holes slowly leak energy until they vanish.
