                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Gray News) – A cause of death has been revealed for Dan Rivera, the ghost hunter and paranormal investigator who died while on tour with the infamous Annabelle doll, which is believed to be possessed. According to PEOPLE, the Adams County coroner said in a statement Thursday that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac related. His death was ruled as natural. The coroner also said that Rivera had a known history of heart issues and that the Annabelle doll was not in the room with him when he died. Officials said Rivera, 54, was found dead in July in his hotel room the day after an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that featured the iconic doll. The event was part of the “Devils on the Run” tour, which displays Annabelle, “for those brave enough” to come face-to-face with her. “They were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the NESPR website states. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.” In 1968, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated the doll and determined that Annabelle was “demonically possessed.” Copyright 2025 Gray Local Media, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dan Rivera died on July 13, one day after an event featuring the infamous doll A cause of death has been determined for the paranormal investigator whose body was found in July after an event in Gettysburg, Pa., showcasing the infamous Annabelle doll. Dan Rivera, an Army veteran and senior lead investigator for the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research, died on July 13, one day after an event with the purportedly haunted toy that has long been featured in horror tales. Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner, said in a statement on Thursday, Sept. 4, that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac-related and was ruled as natural. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings. Rivera had been with colleagues that morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room, Dutrow previously told PEOPLE, although it wasn't clear what Rivera may have been ill with. At the time of his death, Rivera was on tour in Gettysburg to show Annabelle, which the New England Society for Psychic Research has described as “demonically possessed.” “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.” Harrison Jones, a journalist for the Hanover, Pa.-based Evening Sun, attended the tour just one day before Rivera's death, telling PEOPLE afterward that Rivera "definitely struck me as a kind and very welcoming person, and my heart breaks for his family and colleagues." Joining a tour group, Jones took photos and video footage as Rivera spoke with the visitors before he took them to see the doll. Rivera, along with another of NESPR's investigators, Wade Kirby, spoke to the group about Annabelle's history and their experiences working with the doll,” Jones said. “Among those discussions, Mr. Rivera spoke about how he had built the case that Annabelle was in himself, and that he had designed many aspects from the perspective of his faith.” Jones said he didn't speak much with Rivera but that the paranormal investigator “did ask me if I got what I needed out of my visit and asked if I had gotten good images during the tour.” “It was clear from the prior controversy surrounding the tour that his death was going to immediately cause intense controversy and become his own part of paranormal legend no matter what was said,” Jones told PEOPLE. “But in my own reporting I was mainly concerned with trying to focus on the human life lost at the center of this tragic news, Mr. Rivera, who had dedicated so much time and effort in sharing his love for the paranormal." “Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society said. “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The weirdest looking cloud I've ever seen. Whitney, an Owensboro native who now lives in White House, Tennessee (just north of Nashville), walks at least 10,000 steps a day. That's a lot of steps and the aspiring singer-songwriter normally passes her time listening to podcasts. But, Whitney didn't need a podcast to keep her company on Monday. Instead, she got quite a surprise on Labor Day when she was walking in the new neighborhood across from her apartment. Let's just say that, for a few moments, she was convinced she was having one of those Close Encounters of the Third Kind. When I saw the video footage of what Whitney saw in the sky, I immediately had flashbacks to my own childhood in the early 80s. That's when the TV miniseries V was released. If you don't, check this out! Whitney admits that the neighborhood she was walking in was giving her "creepy suburbia vibes", but it was the briefly unidentified object in the sky that made her say, "What in the HECKKKKK?" Whitney says, "I was already kinda creeped out, then I turned onto the street within the neighborhood and passed a house to my left." That's when she looked up and saw this. Whitney says she immediately thought that what she was seeing was some sort of  UFO. It hovered there, in that formation, for at least ten minutes. Oddly, no one else- in the creepy neighborhood- seemed to even notice it. She captured the video and shared her footage on social media. While a couple of her friends immediately proclaimed, "UFO! Lenticular clouds do resemble our notions of what a UFO would look like.</p>

"The cause of death has been determined to be cardiac-related and is ruled out as a natural death," a statement from the coroner's office says. "Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings." WGAL was able to get an up-close look at the doll. A sign posted beneath the doll said: "This Raggedy Ann doll was believed to be possessed by a young girl named Annabelle. Annabelle is responsible for scratching one of its victims with seven psychic scratches, and several motor vehicle accidents including the death of a motorcyclist who taunted Annabelle shortly before the crash."

Japanese fashion brand JennyFax has been getting a lot of attention for its newest line of hair accessories, made up of a pair of women's panties with a hair clip glued to them.

Most people would only wear underwear on their heads as a joke or a dare, but if unconventional fashion brand JennyFax has anything to say about it, wearing women's panties in one's hair will soon become a fashion statement. The Japanese brand took a pair of silky women's underwear, glued a metal hairclip to them, and created an original accessory that was sure to get people talking. Aptly called “panty ribbon bow,” the new hairclip comes in three colors -black, pink, and blue – and is priced at an eye-watering 17,600 yen ($119).

The brand's founder, Jen-Fang, has always been known for her non-conformist design choices, and the panty ribbon bow is definitely consistent with the brand tone.

Photos of the controversial accessory recently went viral on Chinese social media, sparking a heated online debate about the creative liberties of fashion brands. JennyFax is definitely not the first company to push the envelope in terms of design. Balenciaga regularly sparks controversy with its unconventional, sometimes shocking creations, as do other lesser-known brands, like ZNWR, or Felissimo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse just released a new trailer for the sequel to Ethan Hawke's terrifying horror film, Black Phone 2. The short story that the original movie is based on, written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King), follows a masked serial killer who abducts children, locks them in his basement, and torments them. That is until one kid, Finney (Mason Thames), uses a black rotary phone to speak to the ghosts of The Grabber's victims and hatches a plan to escape, kill the Grabber, and reunite with his family. Evidently, the circumstances of his demise were greatly exaggerated. Black Phone 2‘s story follows Finney and his younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who, after receiving a call from a black pay phone, see disturbing visions of kids being stalked at camp. Together, they work to prevent her visions from coming to pass and confront an even more powerful supernatural version of the Grabber. We just got a text that included the first tease for BLACK PHONE 2! Speaking at CCXP Mexico earlier this June, director and co-writer Scott Derrickson explained the film's premise pretty vaguely without giving away how the Grabber made it back. “The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is a typical ghost story,” Derrickson said. Like many horror movies that catch fire, Black Phone made a lotta cash when it released back in 2022, earning $161 million from an $18 million budget, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Derrickson didn't have plans on making a sequel film until Hill hit him up a couple of months after the first film's release with the idea of having a sequel set with kids at a different stage in their lives, i.e., high schoolers, THR added. Fans can witness what horrors await Finney and Gwen when Black Phone 2 hits theaters on October 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine a scenario that sounds like science fiction: Earth, a warming planet, sees its glaciers slowly melt, and life begins to adjust to new conditions. This is because temperatures drop dramatically, about 10°C, and the planet enters “winter mode,” a period that lasts more than a thousand years. To understand the impact of this discovery, we need to go back in time and look at what was happening on Earth. After more than 7,000 years of continuous warming, the planet entered an extremely rapid cooling phase. It was then that scientists wondered: what if this cooling wasn't just a consequence of the melting ice, but had been caused by something external? It was then that a team of scientists decided to further investigate ocean sediments collected from Baffin Bay, near Greenland, and their findings were surprising. They identified small metallic particles, rich in elements such as platinum, iridium, nickel, and cobalt. These elements are rare on Earth but abundant in comets and meteorites. Even more impressive, they found impact microspheres, which are small mineral bubbles that form when materials melt under intense heat, something that can occur when a comet disintegrates upon impact with the atmosphere. It's worth remembering that these particles block solar radiation, causing an “impact winter.” This is a temporary blockage of the sun that could have drastically reduced temperatures, so rapidly that Earth was plunged into a long period of cooling. In other words, this event would have destabilized the planet's conditions, impacting ecosystems and the civilizations that were just beginning to form (much like this vast anomaly affecting America). And no, this discovery isn't just a curious detail from the past… Here are some of the lessons we can learn from this discovery: The comet that exploded over Earth, releasing cosmic dust, may have been the catalyst for a centuries-long global cooling. That's why we need to remain vigilant, especially now with this 1.9-billion-year-old megablast hurtling toward Earth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long before the deranged ranting and raging began, Luke Filby knew his uncle simply as the man who could make life feel electric – renting Terminator 2, blasting Metallica and mucking around like a fun older brother while they played Super Mario Kart. Now, those memories are tainted by another set: a Christmas lunch filled with rants about religion and the end of the world. Hours at a hospital deathbed drowned out by angry tirades from his uncle Dezi Freeman against police. A frightening descent into violence and conspiracy theories. “I tuned it out in the end,” Filby recalls. “It didn't even make sense to me. It was one of the first steps in a long, spiralling collapse that would plunge his entire family deep into his vortex of fixation and paranoia, culminating in the horrific events in Porepunkah. Filby mourns the man he lost years ago – long before his uncle chose a new life and a new name, before the shootings and the headlines, before Dezi became a fugitive. “He went through so many different groups in his life phases,” Filby says. It has broken our hearts for the innocent lives lost, and their families involved.” The last time Freeman saw his extended family was Christmas 2018, and he spent the day erratically regurgitating his fanatical views to weary relatives on everything from religion and doomsday theories to the impending apocalypse. Dezi Freeman and his wife, Amalia (Mali) Freeman.Credit: Marija Ercegovac This particular Christmas was a final tipping point for many of the Filbys, splintering an already fractured family, who say they have been estranged from the alleged double murderer for years by both name and ideology. Freeman, a self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen”, changed his surname from Filby and has been on the run for 10 days after allegedly blasting Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, with a home-made shotgun through the door of a bus that the weapons enthusiast was living in near the township of Porepunkah on August 26. He is then alleged to have opened a window of the bus and shot Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, 35, who also died at the scene. Another detective seriously wounded in the attack is understood to have hidden under the bus for up to an hour until paramedics arrived. By all accounts from family, friends and acquaintances, Dezi Freeman has had many incarnations over his life. A heavy metal fan with unkempt long dark hair who loved to play Nintendo. Luke Filby recalls his uncle obsessively going to church youth groups and then destroying all his Metallica cassette tapes in the 1990s as he plunged deeper into Christianity and suddenly began to describe the band as “satanic and evil”. He recalls his uncle bizarrely using a magnet to erase the music from the cassettes in a process known as tape degaussing, which works by using a strong magnetic field to erase data. Those who have known the 56-year-old for decades say he has always struggled to hold down a job, living off welfare payments and a disability pension for years, and exhibiting what they describe as “narcissistic, racist and misogynistic” traits. Locals say he has also worked sporadically as a freelance photographer, a diver and an abseiling instructor at “The Gorge” near Bright. He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.” Another family member says he was the type of person “upset with everybody else having something better than him”. His relatives say he refused to pay parking and speeding fines, and was embroiled in road-rage incidents and countless disputes with neighbours as he became a radicalised, anti-authority conspiracy theorist who adhered to pseudo-legal beliefs in line with sovereign citizens, who believe they are not subject to the law. Freeman disappeared to the Philippines soon after this altercation, and Filby says he remembers his uncle suddenly re-emerging in the early 2000s with his wife, Amalia, known as Mali. He says it was Mali who helped him to temporarily reconnect with his frayed family before they became estranged again. “She's such a wonderful, spirited person,” Filby says. “We are very worried about her and the kids. He's gone on the run from police and has basically thrown them under a bus.” Filby still mourns the uncle who he says was like an older brother to him as a boy. “That's what I loved about him, and so it was just sad that he had this weird anger inside of him, almost like a mental illness. This kind of rage where he constantly threw tantrums.” ‘He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.' But like much of Freeman's family, Filby had distanced himself from his uncle for years as his behaviour grew more erratic and terrifying. “My grandparents, Dezi's mum and dad, were some of the loveliest, good Samaritan Christians ever,” he says. They would just be absolutely heartbroken by this.” As the years went on, Freeman's extremist views only hardened. Those who knew him say he became paranoid, setting up surveillance cameras wherever he was living and meticulously researching technology devices as he joined online forums for conspiracy theorists, including a Facebook group dedicated to preparing for the apocalypse. One family member also recalled him increasingly watching online videos of police brutality, and grotesque terrorism and beheading footage from the Middle East. He frequently spent extended periods in the bush and was known to be an expert hunter. Former landlord Jamie King told this masthead last week that Freeman had a long-running fascination with home-made arsenal dating back more than decade. King recalled his former tenant showing him sketches of guns that he had found on the internet. Freeman had told the farmer he wanted to make his own guns, but had also asked his wife, Mali, to get a firearm licence so he could buy more weapons. “I said, ‘Why would Mali want a gun?' And he said, ‘Well, I've got assault charges. His intense hatred for police is well-documented in online posts, video footage and court documents. He came to public attention for his anti-government stunts during the pandemic, making headlines in 2021 when he helped lead an attempted private prosecution of then-premier Daniel Andrews for treason. He has described police as terrorist thugs and Nazis. These views appear to have only deepened when he was drawn to the so-called freedom movement during the coronavirus pandemic. During the pandemic, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. He refused to wear face masks in shops, voiced his refusal to get vaccinated, and told people about his distaste for government restrictions and lockdowns. “He was anti everything to do with it,” one local said. A friend of Freeman's wife, Mali, says Freeman began to change during the pandemic, believing the Victorian government had mishandled its COVID-19 response. She says Freeman had begun to mobilise with a group of people in the community who were also opposed to lockdowns, restrictions and vaccines. King says Freeman considered himself to be “a bit of a Geronimo” – a reference to the famed Native American leader who resisted both Mexican and American forces in the late 19th century. King says his former neighbour owned a ghillie suit, an elaborate type of camouflage clothing, that he would wear in the remote bushland when he disappeared into the High Country for weeks on end. King still vividly remembers when Freeman came to his house one afternoon holding sketches and drawings he got online about how to make home-made guns. But another of Freeman's former neighbours, Gary French, is not shocked by the alleged brutal double murder. French and his family found themselves embroiled in a bitter land dispute and then a drawn-out civil court case when the suspected gunman began hunting for deer and continually trespassing on their land. French says he often felt police were powerless to stop him. “He lost his gun licence at that time,” French says. “So I was dumbfounded that he actually got a gun licence back. “But he has also been convicted of firearm offences previously, so I just couldn't believe he even had a firearms licence to begin with.” Police arrested Dezi Freeman outside the Myrtleford court in 2021.Credit: David Estcourt/Michael Howard “He was a little bit jealous of me because I own property,” King says. He remembers Freeman as a person who was self-absorbed and arrogant. He says he once pretended to be a photographer employed by the Country Fire Authority, wearing a firefighter uniform with the word “media” sewn on it, so he could take photos at close range as bushfires tore through the High Country. Early one summer's day, when the two were still neighbours, Freeman told King to come outside his house after midday. When King went outside, he saw Freeman had climbed a nearby mountain and was standing on top of it holding a tiny mirror in his hand, illuminating the vast countryside below with sunlight. “You could see this light reflecting from the mirror kilometres away,” he said. Their relationship soured in 2012 during a dispute, when King discovered a vast marijuana crop growing on the property and told Freeman to dig it up within 24 hours. “I have thought a lot about what has happened these last few days, and I didn't think he had it in him. I reckon he's built an underground bunker somewhere or hiding down a mineshaft.” While they were chatting about their day, another call came through from Filby's uncle, Freeman's brother, and his mother hung up abruptly. “She said, ‘Google Porepunkah shooting right now',” Filby says. “So I Googled it, and Mum said, ‘Who do you think that is?' “My mum has been crying her eyes out about it for days,” Filby says. “We are absolutely heartbroken for the two police officers who have died, their families, and the third guy that was injured.” “I always felt something like this was going to happen,” Filby says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jensen Ackles offers new insights into "Vought Rising" and reuniting with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki & Misha Collins for The Boys. During a wide-ranging interview with Variety that went live on Wednesday night, Jensen Ackles covered a wide range of topics regarding his professional career, including deep dives into Prime Video's Countdown and CBS's Tracker. Of course, you can't cover all of the things that Ackles has going on and not touch on his run as Soldier Boy in the upcoming fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys and in Showrunner Paul Grellong's upcoming Ackles and Aya Cash (Clara Vought, aka Stormfront)-starring prequel series The Boys: Vought Rising. Ackles Compares Soldier Boy in "The Boys" and in "The Boys: Vought Rising": "Obviously, they're the same guy, but certainly there's a lot of life that Soldier Boy has lived when we see him in 'The Boys' and when we see him in Season 5 — how he's relating to people, the things that are important to him, the things that he's willing to just slough off, his idea of the life he wants to lead. And then going back 70-odd years to see him when he was really starting to get going, I'm able now to deal with the struggles that made him who he became, and you start to see him before he has necessarily the swagger and the gravitas and the life lived of 75 years of being the top dog. ["Vought Rising"] predates all that, so I think I'm trying to show a little bit more of an early version of it — not necessarily an innocence to it, but there's certainly scenes, relationships and character traits that predate how we see him in modern day, and that's fun to play with. That's there, and we'll get there quickly, but it is fun to show the origin of how this guy became who he is, and what were the little tricks and little ticks that crafted him into where we see him now." Ackles & Cash: "The Boys: Vought Rising" Feeling "Familiar, But Feels Unfamiliar Too": "It's funny — Aya [Cash] and I were talking and working together the other day. There's all new actors that you're working with, all new characters, and all new relationships that you're developing as that character, and she was like, 'It's like coming home, and you've sold the house and there's a new family living there. Ackles on His Dynamic with Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins While Filming "The Boys": "Look, we're going to have fun no matter what venue we're operating in. We've spent many years — and continue to — behind the camera and at events and convention centers, so there's a relatability between all of us that exists that's far greater than just our characters. So I feel like you can stick us in anywhere and we all get along and we all know how to operate, whether we're playing a new character, an old character, or ourselves. Along with Ackles and Cash, the spinoff prequel also stars Will Hochman (Blue Bloods), Elizabeth Posey (Euphoria), Jorden Myrie (Bridgerton), Nicolò Pasetti (Industry), Ricky Staffieri (The Bear), Brian J. Smith (Sense8), Mason Dye (Stranger Things), and KiKi Layne (The Old Guard 2). Here's a look at a screencap of Grellong's Instagram Stories, followed by his IG post confirming the start of production on the prequel spinoff series:</p>
