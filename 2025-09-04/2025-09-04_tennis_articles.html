                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a rematch of last year's US Open final, Aryna Sabalenka -- who advanced via walkover on Tuesday -- takes on Jessica Pegula in the semifinals. NEW YORK -- Just a few hours before she was to meet World No. That sent Sabalenka into a Thursday semifinal against No. It's a rematch of last year's US Open final, won by Sabalenka in straight sets. Head-to-head: 7-2, Sabalenka, including the last three in a row -- all on North American hard courts. In the dizzying daily flood of numbers-crunching statistics, this one stands out: Sabalenka is only the fifth woman in 35 years to reach all four Grand Slam semifinals in a single year. The catch is that Sabalenka has yet to win one in 2025 -- thanks to three Americans -- a development that suggests she wants to defend her title here very, very badly. She'll be the favorite here, based on that decisive head-to-head advantage. She'll be exceedingly fresh for Thursday's match with an extra day off, and after winning her first four matches in straight sets. You can be sure that Sabalenka, who was stung by those missed opportunities in Melbourne, Paris and London, will throw everything into this one. Last year was a watershed year for Pegula: She turned 30, shook up her coaching staff and advanced to her first major final. On a court that's become her favorite in all the world. Thursday's crowd will be almost completely behind her. But at the end of a Slam, you expect that to happen, and you expect people to be playing their best tennis and to be playing the best players, because those are the players that are playing the best.” After a disappointing summer, Pegula has caught fire at just the right time. And while none of her five victories have come against seeded players, she's been exceedingly sharp. She converted five of nine break-point opportunities against Krejcikova and was broken only twice herself. Pegula knows just how close she was, losing that US Open final 7-5, 7-5. "This year I've come back with a different perspective, knowing that I wasn't playing well, to really enjoy the fact that this is pretty cool. "I would probably have that mentality, instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly ... and enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final and I'm playing the best player in the world." In a rematch of last year's US Open final, Aryna Sabalenka -- who advanced via walkover on Tuesday -- takes on Jessica Pegula in the semifinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When JJ Tracy was going through the process of figuring out which university he would attend, the product of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Hilton Head, South Carolina visited Ohio State University. His host on the trip was Robert Cash, whom he had crossed paths with in the juniors but never played against or with. “Usually because I wouldn't make it that far in the tournaments,” Tracy said. “No, he's not giving himself credit,” Cash, from New Albany, Ohio, quickly added. But the former Buckeyes' bond truly began to form on that visit before they were teammates. “I just realised how down to earth JJ was. It's kind of rare in tennis,” Cash said. “I felt like we had a connection off the rip. We were very similar in a lot of ways. He was very cool, very funny, meshed with the team extremely well on his visit and then when he started school, he worked harder than everybody else and that's what I really admired about him. I just think that we get along so well off court and on court, and it helps us both ways.” You May Also Like: Robert Cash: I was ready for medical school, but one point changed everything Cash's longtime dream has been to go to medical school and eventually become a surgeon and his partner, Tracy, studied finance at Ohio State. “Never really got to get a big head about any special finance major because we had a couple doctors on the team,” Tracy joked. The pair's professional journey nearly was over before it began. Had they let slip one of those points, Cash would have fully focused on medical school applications and Cash would have put his energy into singles. Instead, they won the tournament and earned a US Open wild card. They also were awarded a wild card into the Hall of Fame Open, reaching their first ATP Tour final there. “It's been super special to see us climb the ranks, from winning our first Challenger tournament to stringing a few of them together, making our first ATP appearance and Los Cabos, getting our first title. “We were getting interviewed some in Los Cabos and I kept saying that our goal is to win one of every level of tournament. A clear reason behind the Americans' success is how well they get along and work together. He's always got a good attitude, great energy,” Cash said. “People feed off of him, and nothing really brings him down, so he's always got a smile on his face, bringing people, putting smiles on people's faces around him, and such an easy guy to be around.” There's been times in my life I was down, there are times I'm down, he's always knocking on my door saying, ‘What's the deal, dude? He's always trying to pick me back up. When Cash and Tracy advanced to the last four on Wednesday evening, countryman Ben Shelton posted his congratulations on Instagram Stories: “Hype for these boys”. They were all in college at the same time. He doesn't have to give us the time of day, but he's such a nice guy off the court, and we're really appreciative of that.” The former college standouts know their job is not yet done. Cash and Tracy return to the court Thursday to face this year's Roland Garros champions Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos for a place in the final. He tells us to stay in the dirt. “We've got to take it one step at a time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Anisimova, into the US Open semifinals, called her win over six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek the most meaningful of her life. Anisimova won 6-4, 6-3 on Wednesday night, and she'll play Naomi Osaka for a spot in the final. NEW YORK -- Amanda Anisimova has won 199 matches over the course of her nine-year career on the Hologic WTA Tour, and she can safely say that this one rises above the rest. 2 Iga Swiatek in a packed and raucous Arthur Ashe Stadium to reach her first-ever US Open semifinal. The win was meaningful for so many reasons, not the least of which was getting revenge -- and peace of mind -- after Swiatek drubbed her 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon final earlier this summer. 9 focused on staying mindful and playing without fear She also worked to stay positive, something she felt was missing in the championship match at Wimbledon. "I think that was the most important part of today, is really lifting myself up and trying to pump myself up with positive affirmations," the New Jersey native said after the match. She then followed that up with some highlights of successes (again, positive affirmations). In rewatching it, she noticed that "I was slow as hell." She certainly wasn't slow as hell on this day, and dictated play with her power -- 23 winners to Swiatek's 13 -- and strong return game (four of nine break points converted). She admitted she felt some stress out of the gate, after getting broken in the first game -- "OK, here we go" --  but promptly broke back and felt the stress melt away as she got into a groove. "I think when I started the tournament, I was kind of going into the matches with a little bit of fear and maybe holding back a bit," she said. Today I really came out there with not an ounce of fear." Anisimova will play Naomi Osaka, who defeated Karolina Muchova on Wednesday evening, on Thursday for a spot in the final. The American has won each of her two meetings against Osaka, though they haven't played since the 2022 French Open. Amanda Anisimova, into the US Open semifinals, called her win over six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek the most meaningful of her life. Anisimova won 6-4, 6-3 on Wednesday night, and she'll play Naomi Osaka for a spot in the final.</p>

That might sound like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but it's a fire that Djokovic has endured recently. There are a couple of reasons for Djokovic and his fans to believe this one will be different.First and most important, he appears to be healthy. “The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed.”The second positive is that instead of Sinner, he'll face Carlos Alcaraz.

That might sound like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but it's a fire that Djokovic has endured recently. Djokovic has been at his savviest against Alcaraz, surprising the Spaniard with his early aggressiveness, and holding up better in the clutch. He has had more success imposing his game on him than he has on Sinner.“Would love to be fit enough to play and to play, you know, potentially five sets with Carlos,” Djokovic says. “I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion.”Does Djokovic sound a little pessimistic for a guy with winning record against his opponent? Looking at Alcaraz's form since the spring, he has a right to be. He has won five titles on three surfaces, and hasn't dropped a set so far in New York.“I think today I just played a really—or almost perfect match, I would say,” Alcaraz said after seeing off Jiri Lehecka on Tuesday. It seems like, OK, just two more steps to do, and let's see what happens.” “I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion.”Does Djokovic sound a little pessimistic for a guy with winning record against his opponent?

We'll see if that's still the case, or if his excellent run of play this spring and summer—he has won 43 of his last 45 matches—will finally take him to a place where Djokovic can no longer keep up.“We all know Novak's game,” Alcaraz says. “It doesn't matter that he has been out of the tour since Wimbledon. Djokovic may still have the mental and tactical edge over his younger opponent. But will Alcaraz's youth, athleticism, shot-making, and self-assurance render that moot? “It doesn't matter that he has been out of the tour since Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. Since returning to tennis, Naomi Osaka has often faced stacked Grand Slam draws as an unseeded player -- a recurring challenge that's left her frustrated. This one, though, carries added significance: It's her first Grand Slam semifinal since becoming a mother. And I think when all the moms came back and they did well off the bat, I sort of felt like something was wrong with me. “So yeah, that was on my mind, but now I'm here and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.” Watching her fire winner after winner in front of a roaring Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd, it was clear that Osaka had something to prove -- and she delivered. Osaka erased it with a forehand winner -- one of many she unleashed throughout the night. After the match, Osaka likened the play as you get deeper into a Grand Slam to boxing -- “but with a tennis ball, obviously.” Following an off-court visit with the physio between sets, Muchova returned with renewed energy and broke Osaka to begin the second set. It snapped a streak of 18 consecutive service holds for Osaka. And when Muchova broke again at 4-all, setting herself up to serve for the second set, Osaka responded with a forehand smash winner to break at love. Locked into the moment, Osaka said she couldn't recall what was going through her mind at that stage of the match. “I honestly don't even remember it,” Osaka said. She's beaten me a couple of times and she beat me here last year, so I knew it was going to be a really tough match.” Before you could blink, Osaka raced out to a 6-2 lead. Two match points later, she sealed her place in the semifinals. Among players who began their careers in the Open era, Osaka is the third woman to win each of her first five Grand Slam quarterfinals, joining Chris Evert and Aryna Sabalenka. Speaking of Sabalenka, she'll face Jessica Pegula in the first semifinal Thursday night. Osaka anticipates a challenge as she looks for her first win against the American. “It's definitely going to be really tough,” Osaka said. She smiled and clarified: “I'm not cheering for her against me, but yeah, it's going to be fun. Plus, she's American, and you know, this tournament means a lot to her as well.” Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Wednesday night to advance to the US Open semifinals for the first time since becoming a mother.</p>
