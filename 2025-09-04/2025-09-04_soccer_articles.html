When not writing, he is either playing or watching sports. Colombia is set to take on Bolivia in this 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday at Roberto Melendez Metropolitan Stadium. Colombia head into this crucial qualifying match sitting comfortably in sixth place with 22 points, secure in direct qualification territory yet still needing every point to solidify their standing. Manager Néstor Lorenzo has named a surprising inclusion in the squad: 39-year-old Dayro Moreno, the veteran striker, joins a forward line featuring Luis Díaz, Luis Suárez, Jhon Córdoba, Jaminton Campaz, and Marino Hinestroza. This blend of experience and flair highlights Colombia's intention to lean on both creativity and hunger up front to close out the campaign. Despite a tough road ahead, they'll still back themselves to cause trouble, especially in the final stretch. Colombia has had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning three of the last five and keeping three clean sheets. The spotlight will be on Luis Díaz, who is Colombia's leading scorer in qualifying, and Bolivia's Miguel Terceros, their top goal threat. This is a great World Cup 2026 qualifying match that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, several players have voiced frustration over the congested schedule created by international federations and the number of matches crammed into each season. But ahead of France's upcoming UEFA World Cup qualifiers, star forward Kylian Mbappe made a surprising statement on the matter: “We aren't playing too much.” Ahead of France's clash with Ukraine for the World Cup qualifiers, Mbappe was asked if he had learned to prepare differently for such a long season after last year's grind. His response was candid: “I don't know if you can ever really be ready to play a 60-game season. From my experience, from what I've seen, I can't remember a player performing at a high level across 60 matches. Physically, yes, you can be ready—but in terms of performance level, it's just not possible. There will be times when you're not at your best.” I used to think so, but not necessarily anymore. “The counterargument is always: ‘You earn a lot of money, so play.' If we stop there, the debate will never end. When I saw teams playing friendlies before the season had even ended, that wasn't normal. Kylian Mbappe suffers major France squad setback as star PSG teammate misses training with injury Across those tournaments, Mbappe played 59 matches, scored 44 goals, and added five assists, missing only nine games. That included three Club World Cup fixtures he sat out with acute gastroenteritis, while the others were due to minor muscle strains or coach's decisions to rest him between matches. On top of his club duties, he also featured in six matches for France, including the Nations League Final Four, while missing four others during his public dispute with coach Didier Deschamps.

However, the game against Venezuela will be a momentous occasion regardless. Lionel Messi will likely play his final official home game with La Albiceleste against La Vinotinto, as Messi himself admitted. The iconic Monumental will be rocking as thousands upon thousands of Argentina fans cram the stadium to celebrate their hero. For Venezuela, though, this game is of massive importance. La Vinotinto currently holds the final spot for an intercontinental playoff berth. Fernando Batista's side have a one point lead over Bolivia and the next two games will determine if they get a chance to play for their first-ever World Cup appearance.

Poland trail just behind, having played one match more and a modest +2 goal difference. Jan Urban's Poland started with wins over lowly Lithuania and Malta but lost 1-2 to Finland in their last qualifying outing, and tonight the Eagles face their biggest test yet. In their most recent meeting, the Netherlands overturned an early setback as Adam Buksa's 16th-minute header gave Poland the lead during their UEFA European Championship 2024 group match. But Cody Gakpo's deflected equalizer and sub Wout Weghorst's late strike sealed a 2-1 comeback victory for the Dutch in Hamburg, Germany.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Angel City forward and U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson is set to join Chelsea FC at the transfer deadline. Sources stateside have confirmed to CBS Sports that Thompson's move is imminent, though the transfer fee number is not yet finalized. The current reported fee would equate to $1.3 million, making Thompson one of the most expensive transfers in women's football history. Reigning NWSL Champions Orlando Pride recently set a new record of $1.5 million with the new acquisition of Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle from Liga MX Femenil's Tigres Femenil. The 20-year-old USWNT international signed a contract with Angel City earlier this year, a new deal through 2028, alongside her sister, defender Gisele Thompson. Once official, a five-year contract with Chelsea is in place for the rising star, who first cracked a major USWNT roster during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The move also highlights the growing financial power of top NWSL and European clubs and their ability to attract top talent across leagues. Thompson's arrival at Chelsea will place her among an already strong offensive side. Though the Blues striker Mayra Ramirez is rehabbing from hamstring surgery, Sam Kerr is back at full fitness following an ACL injury, and Lauren James, Guro Reiten, Aggie Beaver Jones and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd are among Chelsea's attackers. The move will also reunite Thompson with USWNT teammates Catarina Macario and Naomi Girma. While Thompson's departure is a blow to Angel City's playoff hopes, a potential substantial fee can provide resources for future high-profile moves. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico. So, the following is an attempt to explain it. There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says. For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December. Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup. Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing). To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.” You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform. And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible. A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access. But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods. FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person. You won't have to choose between these options until October. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says. The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer. In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69. The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins. For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats. Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app. Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market. FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches. FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.” They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have. So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase. The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gianluigi Donnarumma is entering a new phase of his career as the Italy goalkeeper prepares for 2026 World Cup qualifiers under new coach Gennaro Gattuso before taking his place at Manchester City. The giant goalkeeper will move to England after Italy's Group I clashes with Estonia and Israel after he was abruptly frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain by coach Luis Henrique. Donnarumma insists he holds no ill will about the way he was dumped down the pecking order at PSG in favour of French youngster Lucas Chevalier so soon after his performances helped win the capital club's first Champions League. "I've always had an excellent relationship with the coach. I appreciated his directness with me, right from the first day of training," he said. "I don't know what the reason was (for being replaced), I don't even want to know. "You can always improve, but I've accomplished great things since I made my Serie A debut at 16 years old." Just as he did when he moved to PSG, Donnarumma signed his City contract at Italy's Coverciano training camp during an international break. "It brought me some luck," said Donnarumma, who was also key to Italy being crowned European champions in 2021, just before he signed for PSG. But before joining Guardiola in Manchester Donnarumma has a big task on his hands with Italy, who are at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. Donnarumma has maintained the captain's armband under Gattuso, who replaced Luciano Spalletti in June after a troubled start to Italy's qualifying campaign which included a 3-0 thumping at the hands of group leaders Norway. The 26-year-old played under Gattuso, who won the World Cup as a player with Italy in 2006, at AC Milan when still a teenager. Donnarumma said that he wants to "take Italy back to where we belong" which is not small feat given where they find themselves after two qualifying matches. Italy are nine points behind Norway, albeit having played two games fewer, and have a slim chance of taking the spot which offers the only direct place in next year's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How would you describe it when a soccer team is clicking? Do you refer to it as "camaraderie" or "a good locker room"? Or maybe it's what the younger folk today may refer to as "vibes." Whatever the term, some think it isn't nearly as important as just assembling a team with the players possible. For the most part, they aren't wrong. Only eight countries have ever won a men's FIFA World Cup. The last four winners of the UEFA Champions League — Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea — are among the wealthiest, most valuable brands in all of global sports. But when players bond and sacrifice for a common goal, they become greater than the sum of their parts. That's how Leicester City overcame 5000-1 odds to win the Premier League in 2016, or how Greece stunned host Portugal to win the 2004 European Championship. Take it from the most capped player in U.S. men's national team history. "It's probably the most important thing," said three-time World Cup veteran and first-ballot National Soccer Hall of Famer Cobi Jones. I caught up with Jones, who'll debut his Cobi Club podcast in 2026, to break down the notion and importance of vibes – especially ahead of next year's World Cup. U.S. great Cobi Jones, right, hopes that Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino can get back on the same wavelength ahead of the World Cup. In March, a full-strength American side featuring Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson lost a competitive match to Panama for the second time in a year, snapping its four-year dominance of the Concacaf Nations League. Four months later, with several of those first-choice players missing, a skeleton squad rounded out primarily by inexperienced MLSers exceeded expectations by reaching the Gold Cup final. That team lost, though, to blood rival Mexico in a match in which El Tri was clearly superior. The vibes discussion has picked up again, when U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino called Pulisic back, but left out McKennie and several other mainstays to his 23-man roster for the upcoming matches against Korea Republic and Japan. Christian Pulisic is back in the U.S. squad ahead of crucial friendly matches. He was perhaps the best player on the 1998 U.S. team that finished dead last at that World Cup in part because of the poisonous environment that had taken root under then-coach Steve Sampson. Fifteen years later, Arena was unable to fix the broken culture he inherited from Jürgen Klinsmann. "You can have world-class talent and do terrible, because the vibe isn't there. People really have to understand: you're going into camp like a month before the World Cup even starts," Jones told me. The last of Jones' 164 international appearances came more than two decades ago now. It's a USMNT record — he has seven on Landon Donovan and 13 more than Michael Bradley that might never be broken. Now 55, the Detroit-born, Southern California-raised former winger spent 12 seasons with his hometown LA Galaxy after stints in the Premier League and in Brazil. Cobi Jones was part of the 1994 World Cup squad that exceeded expectations and the 1998 team that largely faltered. Pochettino surely knows that he'll need all of his best players if the Americans are to make a historic run at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. It's about, can they come together as a unit?" Jones — for whom the Galaxy will unveil a statue next spring at their stadium in Carson, Caifornia — will have a front-row seat. For U.S. backers worried about how the national team will fare next June and July, Jones has another message. A lot of things that have to gel," he added. "I always look at the 1998 World Cup, which France won. They didn't score a goal four years later. "I think these guys, they'll find a way."

Listen to what he had to say about the venue and his comedic exchange with USMNT teammate and friend Tim Weah. “A lot of people coming into the game this weekend,” said Adams, who hails from Wappingers Falls, N.Y. “It's always nice to play at the old stomping grounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's surprising United States men's national team roster gets to test itself agains two terrific Asian foes starting with South Korea on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey. Pochettino opted against calling in a number of big-name players, as Weston McKennie again misses out and is joining in exclusion by recently-transferred USMNT stars Giovanni Reyna, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso. Just-healthy Antonee Robinson and Ricardo Pepi are also given breaks, and that gives big chances to some lesser-known names against these strong visitors. MORE — How will USMNT line up versus South Korea? South Korea have lost just once in the last 19 months, and it was last time out against Japan — a solid team and the Yanks' next opponent. Players like Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman were very good at the Gold Cup, much better than their displays against Turkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino knows this group can do great in CONCACAF, but the World Cup's raised stakes will be closer to the level of South Korea (and Japan) more often than not. Kickoff: 5pm ET Saturday (Pregame coverage at 4:30pm)Stadium: Sports Illustrated Stadium — Harrison, New JerseyTV Channel: Telemundo, UniversoStreaming: Peacock (en Espanol) The names on Pochettino's 24-man roster are anything but predictable, but there's a big-time in-form player in Josh Sargent and a number of North America-based players with huge opportunities to impress the boss. How much will we see of Nathan Harriel, Tristan Blackmon, Sean Zawadzki, and Alex Zendejas? And is there any chance we see Roman Celentano or Jonathan Klinsmann, or is this Matt Freese's 18-yard box for the duration of the international break? LAFC's Heung-min Son and PSG's Kang-in Lee will get a lot of the focus, but the Taegeuk Warriors are deep and dangerous. Bayern Munich center back Min-jae Kim is a handful for attackers and Mainz midfielder Jae-sung Lee is one to watch. South Korea are more familiar and complete at this point, but home soil and the fitness of Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun, and Timothy Weah should be enough to produce a number of chances for the USMNT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino shares an update on Christian Pulisic's return to the squad ahead of upcoming friendlies. Just how "together" they are will be revealed over the next week and beyond, but make no mistake: they need to be on the same page if the U.S. is to reach its stated aim of making a deep run at next summer's World Cup. This isn't to say that the two have had a falling out, nor do they need to be best friends and have regular dinners together. Pulisic waved off an attempt by Pochettino to sub him out of the third-place game at the Concacaf Nations League last March. While Pulisic's impulse to defend himself is understandable, divulging some of the deliberations about his Gold Cup participation was a mistake and only served to annoy Pochettino. The U.S. manager responded, stating that he is "not a mannequin" and that he alone would decide who plays for the USMNT and when. When the roster for the upcoming friendlies was announced last week, Pochettino said he hadn't spoken with Pulisic since the Gold Cup, adding, "I think everything is behind us, all that happened in summer, and I think now we need to look forward." Left unsaid is how effective that approach will be if there hasn't been any communication. Holding midfielder Tyler Adams needs to be at his ball-hawking best. One of the available strikers -- be it Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, etc. -- needs to hit top form ahead of the tournament. When Pulisic plays well and is in full flow, the team usually follows suit. Pochettino and Pulisic need each other for the team to succeed. Part of what's at issue between Pulisic and Pochettino is that the U.S. manager is in the middle of attempting a cultural reset. That goes for everyone, from the biggest stars down to uncapped players who get called in. Pochettino is demanding total commitment, at least as he defines it. "If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day." Defender Tim Ream admitted after the Gold Cup that it had taken too long. At Tuesday's media availability, Ream said that with players just arriving, there hadn't been a team-wide meeting yet to discuss expectations, though coaches had been pulling players in for individual meetings.

"But for us, it is just the guys who were here during the Gold Cup ... We kind of know what the standard needs to be and what it is going forward and just making sure that everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, helping each other, and making sure that we all know that we're on the same page, we're on the same team." If there is to be movement in any direction, that will fall on Pulisic, because Pochettino won't be changing his ways. The U.S. manager has made it clear that no one's spot is secure. Weston McKennie was left off the current roster, and while Pochettino blamed his absence on a lack of rest due to participation in the Club World Cup, Tim Weah had a similar workload, yet was included in this camp. Relationships between players and coaches can be fluid, going through difficulties. That could very well be the case with Pochettino and Pulisic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At one point not long ago, the world governing body at least tried to look like it cared about growing the game worldwide. Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time, use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply. Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world's most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you're-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa. The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport's expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup. This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. “It's key to highlight Fifa's mission and Fifa's objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it's always a balance between different factors.” Fifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky – a YouGov poll shows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it's worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it's also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-final tumbled from almost $500 to just $13 in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn't violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislators have taken an interest and Australia has moved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquiry was swiftly abandoned by the Trump administration. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi is expected to play in what could be his last match in his home country with the Argentine national team on Thursday, Sept. 4. Argentina will host Venezuela in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match, which is the defending World Cup champions' last scheduled home match in the foreseeable future. “It's going to be a very special game for me because it's the last one in the qualifying round I don't know if there will be friendlies or more games after that,” Messi said during a postgame interview with Apple TV after Inter Miami's win against Orlando City in the Leagues Cup semifinals on Aug. 27. Argentine national team coach Lionel Scaloni acknowledged the occasion during a press conference Wednesday, while adding the club would look to plan another match for Messi in Argentina when the time is right. Surely, it won't be his last game in Argentina, and I saw that from the point of view that, if he decides it will be his last, we'll make sure he gets to play another one," Scaloni said regarding Messi. "We'll find the right moment, because he deserves it." For the reasons listed above, it appears very likely Messi will play with Argentina against Venezuela. Argentina will visit Ecuador on Sept. 9 to conclude Conmebol World Cup qualifying, but it's possible Messi will return to South Florida as Inter Miami prepares for the last stretch of the 2025 MLS season. Messi could potentially participate in four more Argentina friendly matches later this year. Argentina is planning to play two friendly matches in the United States between October 6-14 with locations and opponents to be determined. These friendlies would coincide with Inter Miami's MLS season, potentially creating a scheduling conflict for Messi. Argentina will also play two friendly matches between Nov. 10-18 in in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India with opponents to be determined. These friendlies would fall under a FIFA international window.</p>
