                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Without household names like Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah left at home for these upcoming matches, there are a handful of new names at practically every position, as well as some returning faces that are hoping to re-enter the fold. Here are five questions I have entering a crucial time for the USMNT: Can Josh Sargent recreate his club form with the United States? Josh Sargent has been red-hot for Norwich City to start the season — again — and has consistently been one of the best strikers in the English Championship for two seasons now. It was rumored he was very close to a summer move, but Sargent opted to stay and has been scoring a wide variety of goals, including a screamer this past weekend. But get this: Sargent's last goal for the U.S. was November 20th, 2019 — yes, almost six years ago. He only has five goals in 28 appearances for the United States, and after being left off this summer's Gold Cup roster, this could be his last chance to leave a good impression on manager Mauricio Pochettino. 9 position as more of a hold up/false 9 role to get players running in behind the backline, and we wouldn't often see Sargent in front of goal finishing off plays. Pochettino used Patrick Agyemang all throughout the Gold Cup as a player that would run in behind to stretch defenses and also take part in the build-up, but had a lot of good looks in front of the goal. Agyemang was very inconsistent in his finishing, which has been a theme for the No. There are a few new faces in the backline for this window — most notably Vancouver Whitecaps veteran Tristan Blackmon and 18-year-old Augsburg prospect Noahkai Banks. We are 282 days until the World Cup, and if it was to start tomorrow, I'd predict the back line would be: Sergiño Dest, Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson. That's a pretty solid backline – especially if you consider the huge growth as a leader from Richards over the past year. From a center-back perspective, what's been worrisome for the USMNT is that there is nobody even close to him in terms of level of play, experience, and who can comfortably start play/pass out of the back. As much as I feel comfortable with Ream in that position, it would be great if someone else could develop over the next 8–10 months and be another dependable option. I've long since felt that the USMNT would be best with a back 3 — which could allow Ream or Richards to slide into the middle and add another option for this team. Will we see a motivated Christian Pulisic after this summer? Christian Pulisic heard all the noise about his absence over the summer and I believe he will have a point to prove to those that questioned his commitment. A good set of performances in these two matches will go a long way with the USMNT fan base, with whom the relationship has been a little tense since the summer. He came off the bench to score over the weekend for AC Milan, after pushing through a bit of an ankle knock. I'll be interested to see how he is used by Pochettino in this window and what types of performances he'll put together because, as always, all eyes are on him to be the difference-maker for this team. Will the players not at camp be noticed? We saw some important contributions from the likes of Sebastian Berhalter, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna, Jack McGlynn, Alex Freeman, and Matt Freese that have propelled them to call-ups in this window. Tillman was an excused absence as he continues to work back from injury and integrate into life with Bayer Leverkusen (he opened his account with a goal last weekend), but for the rest, this camp presents another opportunity to show they can "level up". Tyler Adams will look to continue in his role at the No. At the Gold Cup we saw him in a combination of two holding midfielders and, at times, as the lone No. With no McKennie, Johnny Cardoso, or Yunus Musah in camp, where does Pochettino opt to go with in these games? And, how does he foresee his midfield looking in future camps? I think these games will tell us a lot about where he is leaning, but again, with players left out for various reasons, Pochettino's hope after the Gold Cup was that nobody was "guaranteed" a position — or at least that they felt that way. (Photo by Jordan Bank - Leagues Cup/MLS via Getty Images) We also saw a few shaky moments on crosses and the back-pass against Haiti, but what was impressive was how quickly he rebounded from that. The other two keepers on the roster — Roman Celentano and Jonathan Klinsmann — are both uncapped, so it would be a safe bet to assume that Freese will once again get the nod in goal. Pochettino knows what he has in Steffen and Turner, who I would guess currently round out the three keepers. But with Freese set to get two more games, strong and commanding performances in both could truly start to separate him as the nailed-on starter for the USMNT.

Brazil, under coach Carlo Ancelotti, has already secured its spot in the 2026 World Cup and is set to conclude its qualifying campaign with a home match against Chile. Ancelotti has emphasized evaluating potential future contributors, making this match an opportunity for these players to showcase their abilities. Chile, managed by Nicolás Córdova, faces a challenging task as it aims to secure a positive result to keep its World Cup hopes alive. The team will be without key players, including Alexis Sánchez and Benjamín Kuscevic, due to injuries. Despite these setbacks, Chile will rely on players like Eduardo Vargas and Darío Osorio to lead their attack. However, their recent form has been concerning, with only one win in their last five matches, and they have struggled to score goals in recent outings. Historically, Brazil has dominated this fixture, winning its last four encounters against Chile, all while keeping clean sheets. Given the current form and squad depth, Brazil is favored to secure a comfortable victory in this match.

Two-time Women's World Cup winner Alex Morgan looked back at the U.S. women's national team's equal pay battle, saying the group "never knew if it was going to ever happen" as they faced years of opposition before successfully reaching a settlement with the U.S. Soccer Federation. Morgan said that U.S. Soccer essentially argued "women are inherently inferior" and that the men have more responsibility. Morgan was one of five players who filed a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016, months after the USWNT won their first World Cup in more than a decade and was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit filed by the entire team months before they won the 2019 World Cup. The legal battle played out for several years before the parties reached a settlement in 2022 that guaranteed equal pay and included $22 million in backpay. "We won the World Cup first time in 16 years," Morgan said on a recent episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast. "All of a sudden, had sold out stadiums. We were generating revenue for U.S. Soccer like never before. We were getting sponsors coming to U.S. Soccer saying, 'We want to work with the women.' U.S. Soccer doesn't do sponsors for only the women's or men's team. Sponsors come and they get everything, so we were seeing this. You can see the returns at the end of the year, so you're like, 'Okay, I know what you're making. We file a motion with the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and it goes nowhere. "Three years go by and we know that we are bringing money into U.S. Soccer. However, we are getting paid, for example, like per game, $1,500 for a win. The men, I'm throwing this out there, but I think it's almost accurate. At the end of the year, we were making, if you played in every single game, you're making maybe like $85, $90,000. Men, if they were to play the same amount of games as us, win the same amount of times as us, like 400-plus thousand dollars. There was such a gap, and then we were seeing what we were generating, like the revenue we were generating for them, and we're like, 'This doesn't make sense in terms of what we're bringing in, but also we're doing the same job for the same company as the men, but getting paid vastly different and getting treated vastly different.' We're sitting in 27B and the men are in 2A, so we're like, 'This is not adding up at all.' And don't get me started also on FIFA and how we had to also, and they've come a long way, but back in 2015, there was a lot of challenges also on that front. Though the USWNT received plenty of public support after they filed their lawsuit, the reception was different inside the federation. "I remember specifically going to the U.S. Soccer annual board because I was on the Athletes Council, and you get a chance to speak at the end if you want," Morgan said. And one of the board members from another board, it's like there's like 300 people in the room. He gets on the mic and he goes, 'Our women's team is so disappointing. He goes on and on for five minutes and after you hear people in the room clapping, like at the U.S. Soccer annual board meeting and us athletes were mortified, like embarrassed on his behalf, but also like this is who's making the decisions in this room. Okay, we have a lot of work to do." The federation's pushback, though, was most visible in the court documents that came to light in early 2020 and later forced the resignation of president Carlos Cordeiro. "We had to submit court documents … basically saying why we deserve equal pay and U.S. Soccer saying why we didn't," Morgan said. "Their main argument was that the man bears more responsibility because they, what was it? They bear more responsibility because they are inherently faster and stronger because it takes more strength and speed by a man and so the responsibility is greater. So basically saying women are inherently inferior. They retracted that statement later." Morgan pointed to the leadership change after Cordeiro's resignation as a turning point in the legal battle, with retired USWNT player Cindy Parlow Cone being promoted to the role after serving as the federation's vice president. "US Soccer hired Cindy Parlow Cone, who was a women's national team player, scored many goals, very good player," Morgan said. Also, that was a voluntary position. You did not get paid to do that, so when she came in charge of that, we were like, "Okay, we got one on the inside. Still got to convince that board, but we got this," and when we settled and achieved equal pay and millions, over $20 million back pay, I was holding my daughter when we signed it. My daughter was three years old, two and a half, three years old, and it was a really special moment because it was, I mean, you got to think, over 500 hours of our own time put into something that you never knew if it was going to ever happen. You didn't know if this was going to work out. You didn't know what kind of effect this could possibly even have in sports."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Historically, the loss will be remembered as Germany's first away loss in a World Cup qualifier. Germany controlled possession early, but struggled mightily with Slovakia's quick dribbling and movement, especially in 1v1 situations. In the 42nd minute, left back Dávid Hancko flew forward and was on the receiving end of a cross from Dávid Strelec. In the 55th minute, Strelec followed up his first half heroics with an impressive curler to put the game on ice. Earlier this week, Strelec was a £6.5M deadline transfer to Middlesbrough from Slovan Bratislava. Strelec's fearless attitude resonated throughout the Slovakian squad and they were rewarded with an impressive upset victory. Baumann's two big saves in the first half kept the match close, but the Hoffenheim goalkeeper was unable to prevent two goals from screaming past him and he was still outplayed by his Slovakian counterpart, Martin Dúbravka, who produced the five saves necessary to hold the clean sheet. Kimmich spent a lot of the first half trying to find a forward pass but there was zero movement, possibly by design. He still managed a 97% passing rate, went three-for-three on long balls, and was a force on the defensive end. Ultimately, Kimmich can do all of these same things from the right back position if that introduces a better midfielder or attacker onto the starting XI. The entire offense was a non-factor for most of this game. After a quiet first half, Wirtz picked up the pace a little bit and brought some creativity to the game. It would have been nice to see Germany recover at least one goal late in the game but never really found a decent opportunity. Wirtz is better suited to roam the central midfield but Julian Nagelsmann is severely limited in his options at winger. This would potentially open up some space for Nick Woltemade to make things happen as well. The Slovakians abused Germany's right flank in the first half and could have scored even more goals. David Raum replaced a struggling Nnamdi Collins, switching Mittelstädt to the right side. Unfortunately, Slovakia just started attacking Germany's left flank instead. Mittelstädt finished the match with four clearances, two tackles, a blocked shot, an interception, and won three ground duels. It is very depressing that Mittelstädt was the best German player tonight. A daily roundup of Bayern Munich news Harry Kane was key for Bayern Munich…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent months, several players have voiced frustration over the congested schedule created by international federations and the number of matches crammed into each season. But ahead of France's upcoming UEFA World Cup qualifiers, star forward Kylian Mbappe made a surprising statement on the matter: “We aren't playing too much.” Ahead of France's clash with Ukraine for the World Cup qualifiers, Mbappe was asked if he had learned to prepare differently for such a long season after last year's grind. His response was candid: “I don't know if you can ever really be ready to play a 60-game season. From my experience, from what I've seen, I can't remember a player performing at a high level across 60 matches. Physically, yes, you can be ready—but in terms of performance level, it's just not possible. There will be times when you're not at your best.” I used to think so, but not necessarily anymore. “The counterargument is always: ‘You earn a lot of money, so play.' If we stop there, the debate will never end. When I saw teams playing friendlies before the season had even ended, that wasn't normal. Kylian Mbappe suffers major France squad setback as star PSG teammate misses training with injury Across those tournaments, Mbappe played 59 matches, scored 44 goals, and added five assists, missing only nine games. That included three Club World Cup fixtures he sat out with acute gastroenteritis, while the others were due to minor muscle strains or coach's decisions to rest him between matches. On top of his club duties, he also featured in six matches for France, including the Nations League Final Four, while missing four others during his public dispute with coach Didier Deschamps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Argentina return to action at River Plate's Estadio Mâs Monumental, hosting Venezuela in their final home game of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers. However, the game against Venezuela will be a momentous occasion regardless. Lionel Messi will likely play his final official home game with La Albiceleste against La Vinotinto, as Messi himself admitted. The iconic Monumental will be rocking as thousands upon thousands of Argentina fans cram the stadium to celebrate their hero. For Venezuela, though, this game is of massive importance. La Vinotinto currently holds the final spot for an intercontinental playoff berth. Fernando Batista's side have a one point lead over Bolivia and the next two games will determine if they get a chance to play for their first-ever World Cup appearance. Here's how you can watch Argentina's clash vs. Venezuela. Peacock and fuboTV will broadcast the match in English. In Mexico, Argentina vs. Venezuela will be available on ViX Premium and Amazon Prime Video. Fans must have an existing subscription to watch the game. Fans in the UK that want to stay up past midnight to watch Messi and co. take on Venezuela can do so through Premier Sports 1. It's unknown if Messi will feature in that game or if he'll want the home game vs. Venezuela to be the final World Cup qualifier match of his career. However, Scaloni's side will reconvene during the October international break, with friendly matches against Venezuela and Puerto Rico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico. So, the following is an attempt to explain it. There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says. For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December. Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup. Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing). To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.” You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform. And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible. A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access. But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods. FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person. You won't have to choose between these options until October. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says. The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer. In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69. The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins. For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats. Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app. Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market. FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches. FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.” They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have. So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase. The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gianluigi Donnarumma is entering a new phase of his career as the Italy goalkeeper prepares for 2026 World Cup qualifiers under new coach Gennaro Gattuso before taking his place at Manchester City. The giant goalkeeper will move to England after Italy's Group I clashes with Estonia and Israel after he was abruptly frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain by coach Luis Henrique. Donnarumma insists he holds no ill will about the way he was dumped down the pecking order at PSG in favour of French youngster Lucas Chevalier so soon after his performances helped win the capital club's first Champions League. "I've always had an excellent relationship with the coach. I appreciated his directness with me, right from the first day of training," he said. "I don't know what the reason was (for being replaced), I don't even want to know. "You can always improve, but I've accomplished great things since I made my Serie A debut at 16 years old." Just as he did when he moved to PSG, Donnarumma signed his City contract at Italy's Coverciano training camp during an international break. "It brought me some luck," said Donnarumma, who was also key to Italy being crowned European champions in 2021, just before he signed for PSG. But before joining Guardiola in Manchester Donnarumma has a big task on his hands with Italy, who are at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. Donnarumma has maintained the captain's armband under Gattuso, who replaced Luciano Spalletti in June after a troubled start to Italy's qualifying campaign which included a 3-0 thumping at the hands of group leaders Norway. The 26-year-old played under Gattuso, who won the World Cup as a player with Italy in 2006, at AC Milan when still a teenager. Donnarumma said that he wants to "take Italy back to where we belong" which is not small feat given where they find themselves after two qualifying matches. Italy are nine points behind Norway, albeit having played two games fewer, and have a slim chance of taking the spot which offers the only direct place in next year's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's surprising United States men's national team roster gets to test itself agains two terrific Asian foes starting with South Korea on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey. Pochettino opted against calling in a number of big-name players, as Weston McKennie again misses out and is joining in exclusion by recently-transferred USMNT stars Giovanni Reyna, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso. Just-healthy Antonee Robinson and Ricardo Pepi are also given breaks, and that gives big chances to some lesser-known names against these strong visitors. MORE — How will USMNT line up versus South Korea? South Korea have lost just once in the last 19 months, and it was last time out against Japan — a solid team and the Yanks' next opponent. Players like Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman were very good at the Gold Cup, much better than their displays against Turkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino knows this group can do great in CONCACAF, but the World Cup's raised stakes will be closer to the level of South Korea (and Japan) more often than not. Kickoff: 5pm ET Saturday (Pregame coverage at 4:30pm)Stadium: Sports Illustrated Stadium — Harrison, New JerseyTV Channel: Telemundo, UniversoStreaming: Peacock (en Espanol) The names on Pochettino's 24-man roster are anything but predictable, but there's a big-time in-form player in Josh Sargent and a number of North America-based players with huge opportunities to impress the boss. How much will we see of Nathan Harriel, Tristan Blackmon, Sean Zawadzki, and Alex Zendejas? And is there any chance we see Roman Celentano or Jonathan Klinsmann, or is this Matt Freese's 18-yard box for the duration of the international break? LAFC's Heung-min Son and PSG's Kang-in Lee will get a lot of the focus, but the Taegeuk Warriors are deep and dangerous. Bayern Munich center back Min-jae Kim is a handful for attackers and Mainz midfielder Jae-sung Lee is one to watch. South Korea are more familiar and complete at this point, but home soil and the fitness of Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun, and Timothy Weah should be enough to produce a number of chances for the USMNT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino shares an update on Christian Pulisic's return to the squad ahead of upcoming friendlies. Just how "together" they are will be revealed over the next week and beyond, but make no mistake: they need to be on the same page if the U.S. is to reach its stated aim of making a deep run at next summer's World Cup. This isn't to say that the two have had a falling out, nor do they need to be best friends and have regular dinners together. Pulisic waved off an attempt by Pochettino to sub him out of the third-place game at the Concacaf Nations League last March. While Pulisic's impulse to defend himself is understandable, divulging some of the deliberations about his Gold Cup participation was a mistake and only served to annoy Pochettino. The U.S. manager responded, stating that he is "not a mannequin" and that he alone would decide who plays for the USMNT and when. When the roster for the upcoming friendlies was announced last week, Pochettino said he hadn't spoken with Pulisic since the Gold Cup, adding, "I think everything is behind us, all that happened in summer, and I think now we need to look forward." Left unsaid is how effective that approach will be if there hasn't been any communication. Holding midfielder Tyler Adams needs to be at his ball-hawking best. One of the available strikers -- be it Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, etc. -- needs to hit top form ahead of the tournament. When Pulisic plays well and is in full flow, the team usually follows suit. Pochettino and Pulisic need each other for the team to succeed. Part of what's at issue between Pulisic and Pochettino is that the U.S. manager is in the middle of attempting a cultural reset. That goes for everyone, from the biggest stars down to uncapped players who get called in. Pochettino is demanding total commitment, at least as he defines it. "If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day." Defender Tim Ream admitted after the Gold Cup that it had taken too long. At Tuesday's media availability, Ream said that with players just arriving, there hadn't been a team-wide meeting yet to discuss expectations, though coaches had been pulling players in for individual meetings.

"But for us, it is just the guys who were here during the Gold Cup ... We kind of know what the standard needs to be and what it is going forward and just making sure that everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, helping each other, and making sure that we all know that we're on the same page, we're on the same team." If there is to be movement in any direction, that will fall on Pulisic, because Pochettino won't be changing his ways. The U.S. manager has made it clear that no one's spot is secure. Weston McKennie was left off the current roster, and while Pochettino blamed his absence on a lack of rest due to participation in the Club World Cup, Tim Weah had a similar workload, yet was included in this camp. Relationships between players and coaches can be fluid, going through difficulties. That could very well be the case with Pochettino and Pulisic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At one point not long ago, the world governing body at least tried to look like it cared about growing the game worldwide. Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time, use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply. Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world's most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you're-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa. The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport's expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup. This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. “It's key to highlight Fifa's mission and Fifa's objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it's always a balance between different factors.” Fifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky – a YouGov poll shows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it's worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it's also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-final tumbled from almost $500 to just $13 in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn't violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislators have taken an interest and Australia has moved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquiry was swiftly abandoned by the Trump administration. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi is expected to play in what could be his last match in his home country with the Argentine national team on Thursday, Sept. 4. Argentina will host Venezuela in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match, which is the defending World Cup champions' last scheduled home match in the foreseeable future. “It's going to be a very special game for me because it's the last one in the qualifying round I don't know if there will be friendlies or more games after that,” Messi said during a postgame interview with Apple TV after Inter Miami's win against Orlando City in the Leagues Cup semifinals on Aug. 27. Argentine national team coach Lionel Scaloni acknowledged the occasion during a press conference Wednesday, while adding the club would look to plan another match for Messi in Argentina when the time is right. Surely, it won't be his last game in Argentina, and I saw that from the point of view that, if he decides it will be his last, we'll make sure he gets to play another one," Scaloni said regarding Messi. "We'll find the right moment, because he deserves it." For the reasons listed above, it appears very likely Messi will play with Argentina against Venezuela. Argentina will visit Ecuador on Sept. 9 to conclude Conmebol World Cup qualifying, but it's possible Messi will return to South Florida as Inter Miami prepares for the last stretch of the 2025 MLS season. Messi could potentially participate in four more Argentina friendly matches later this year. Argentina is planning to play two friendly matches in the United States between October 6-14 with locations and opponents to be determined. These friendlies would coincide with Inter Miami's MLS season, potentially creating a scheduling conflict for Messi. Argentina will also play two friendly matches between Nov. 10-18 in in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India with opponents to be determined. These friendlies would fall under a FIFA international window.</p>
