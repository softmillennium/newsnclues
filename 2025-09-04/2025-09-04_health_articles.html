                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mitsuru Arase, Mari Murakami, and Prof. Kiyoshi Takeda (Graduate School of Medicine/ Immunology Frontier Research Center at The University of Osaka) revealed that transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40 play crucial roles in inducing T cells involved in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is an intractable disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which persist in long-term in the intestinal mucosa, have been implicated in disease pathogenesis, but it has not been clear how these cells are induced.In this study, though comprehensive single-cell analysis of gut T cells from Crohn's disease patients, the research group identified the accumulation of TRM with high expression of transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40. RUNX2 is known as a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation and maturation; however, a different RUNX2 variant was expressed in Crohn's disease TRM, distinct from that found in bone.Overexpression of RUNX2 and BHLHE40 in blood-derived T cells from healthy individuals enhanced the production of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (GZMB), and promoted tissue-retentive properties. In this research, we successfully identified a factor that induces T cells involved in the symptoms of Crohn's disease. We sincerely hope that the results of this study will contribute to the development of new diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for Crohn's disease. We extend our deepest gratitude to all collaborators and to the patients who generously provided samples for this study." Arase, M., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is it possible to treat obesity without reducing food intake? A new study co-led by Dr. Antonio Zorzano and Dr. Manuela Sánchez-Feutrie at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) suggests that this might be a possibility, at least in animal models. Published in Nature Communications, the research identifies a key role for Neuritin 1, a protein previously linked to the nervous system, which is also produced in brown adipose tissue, where it acts as a powerful driver of energy expenditure and metabolic health. Unlike current anti-obesity and antidiabetic drugs, such as Ozempic or tirzepatide, which work by suppressing appetite, Neuritin 1 boosts energy burning without affecting food intake. By increasing the levels of Neuritin 1 specifically in brown fat, we observed that the animals burned more energy, which helped prevent fat accumulation." This metabolic boost led to significant improvements in several health indicators, including reduced weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower liver inflammation, even in animals fed high-calorie diets. Previously described for its role in neuronal plasticity, Neuritin 1 is now shown to have a metabolic function in brown fat, a type of fat specialised in generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. In this context, Neuritin 1 stimulates mitochondrial activity and promotes the expression of thermogenic genes. To trigger its expression, the researchers used a viral vector that drives Neuritin 1 overexpression exclusively in thermogenic fat cells. "These findings point to Neuritin 1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating obesity and its associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, through a mechanism that differs from current approaches," highlights Dr. Sánchez-Feutrie. The team is currently exploring ways to translate these findings into a future therapeutic strategy. The study was made possible thanks to the contributions of several IRB Barcelona core facilities, including Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Functional Genomics, Protein Expression, and Histopathology. It also involved collaborators from international institutions such as the CNRS (France), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), and the University of Houston (USA).

This portable device provides accurate, on-demand breath testing, making it a practical tool for both clinical trials and research applications. Paired with a user-friendly smartphone app, the Breath Analyzer allows individuals to log food intake and symptoms alongside their breath readings. This integrated data can then be accessed by researchers for longitudinal monitoring of gut microbiome responses across a range of clinical study designs. To ensure accuracy comparable to in-clinic hydrogen methane breath tests (HMBT), the OMED Health team conducted extensive validation. This included building an in-house synthetic breath rig and benchmarking the device against a clinically established HMBT system. The OMED Health Breath Analyzer leverages MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) sensor technology to measure hydrogen and methane levels in exhaled breath. To ensure accuracy, a diffusion membrane filters the breath sample, minimizing the influence of interfering compounds on sensor performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that even highly trained esports athletes can't escape wrist fatigue during marathon sessions, with short breaks offering no relief and game genre shaping the strain. Electronic sports (esports) or competitive gaming for long periods can cause long-term musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). A recent paper published in BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation explores this aspect relative to wrist movement across various video games. Esports combine musculoskeletal loading of certain muscle groups, high cognitive-process demands, and long sitting times, which are linked to poor health outcomes. Thus, these demands are comparable to those in computer work, piano playing, and air traffic control, where MSD risks are elevated. High-performing esports players use repetitive movements (mouse clicks and keystrokes) with high frequencies of actions per minute, over 500 in some game genres. Without proper breaks, this can cause muscular fatigue, potentially leading to overuse injuries or MSD. It can be peripheral or central, depending on whether it affects the neuromuscular junction or the brain, respectively. Not much research has been conducted on these aspects of esports, though mobile phone gaming may cause more muscular fatigue in non-professional gamers. First-person shooters (FPS) and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) players have faster hand acceleration, more repetitive movements, and a longer cumulative hand movement distance than those who play adventure video games. The current study aimed to cover research gaps in this field, such as how esports affect muscular fatigue and wrist kinematics. The study included 32 healthy male esports athletes, with a mean age of 24. They had an average body mass index (BMI) of 24.8 kg/m2. Physical activity was, on average, ~308 minutes a week. They participated in two competitive video gaming sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. Muscle activity and wrist kinematics were recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) of the upper trapezius and wrist extensors. These showed increasing muscle fatigue over time, signaled by a reduction in the frequency spectrum of the EMG. This was demonstrated by the significantly lower median frequency (MDF) of both left and right wrist extensors (by about 3%-4%) with time. Only the right side showed a decrease for the upper trapezius, but this was not confirmed in post-hoc analysis. No significant change occurred in the trapezius, perhaps because the hands are more involved in such sports, or because of greater inter-individual variability in trapezius measures. Unexpectedly, the root mean square (RMS) also decreased over time. This finding may be explained by the behavior of motor units during low-intensity intermittent motor tasks like competitive gaming. It could also be due to the unpredictable duration of individual gaming sessions, which allows partial muscle recovery and reduces the continuity of neuromuscular loading. This might account for the atypical EMG fatigue patterns compared to conventional constant-load tasks. This offers a field for further study. The video game genre was associated with differences in the wrist kinematics, but these parameters did not significantly change over time. While FPS players' cumulative distances decreased across sessions and MOBA players showed a decrease followed by an increase, the study emphasized that these were not statistically significant effects. The area of displacement increased, while zero-crossings decreased over time for both FPS and MOBA players. These group differences could be due to the greater precision required for FPS games, which involve more upper extremity use and strategically lowered mouse sensitivity settings. Preventive interventions should include more physically active breaks between games to reduce muscle fatigue and improve cognitive function. Moreover, regular exercise should be incorporated into the daily routine to improve muscle health and prevent premature muscle fatigue and MSD. The authors also note that short in-game pauses, such as respawns or matchmaking, may allow partial recovery, potentially influencing fatigue patterns. The study indicates that wrist extensor fatigue increases over 3-4 hours of esports, across all video game genres. In contrast, the effect on wrist kinematics depends on the type of game (FPS > MOBA) but does not significantly change over time. Cumulative muscular fatigue is likely with such games since the break did not bring about any observable neuromuscular recovery. This indicates that a higher MSD risk is possible with repetitive loading. “Implementing preventive training strategies and regular active breaks may help mitigate these effects in esports athletes.” The authors also caution that the study was limited to male players, had more MOBA than FPS participants, and lacked a control group, factors that may affect generalizability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have found that the diabetes/weight loss drug Semaglutide, sold commercially under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, significantly reduces cocaine-seeking behaviour in rats. This work needs to be confirmed in humans, but it suggests that Semaglutide is a candidate to be developed as a treatment for cocaine dependency; at the moment there is no effective pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependency. Cocaine is the second most popular illegal drug used in Europe. There is, to date, no effective pharmacological treatment for problematic cocaine use. Scientists from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and the University of Pennsylvania, led by Professor Elisabet Jerlhag (University of Gothenburg), gave male rats access to directly-injected cocaine, which they could dispense by pressing a lever in the cage. Then an experimental group of 10 of these animals were treated with semaglutide before being given access to the cocaine dispenser. "We found that in comparison to the control animals, self-administration of cocaine use dropped by 26% in those animals which had been given semaglutide. Previous results, both from our group and from other groups, have found that semaglutide can reduce alcohol consumption and craving in both humans and animals, and this work on cocaine seems to reflect these previous findings on alcohol use. This is the first trial showing Semaglutide's potential as a drug for cocaine dependence. Importantly, we also found that after a period of abstinence, there was a 62% drop in cocaine seeking in those animals which had taken semaglutide and the motivation (work undertaken to attain the drug) was lowered by 52%. This is animal work, so at the moment, we can't say that we have anywhere near a viable treatment for human cocaine dependency. However, these results are very promising, underlining the need for human studies, especially since there are no existing pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependency". Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 inhibitors. These findings have clinical implications given the challenges identifying medications for stimulant use disorder, and the increasing clinical use of semaglutide in many areas of the world. These findings should encourage clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists for stimulant use disorder". Professor Hendershot was lead researcher on the first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of semaglutide's effects on alcohol craving in adults. Semaglutide suppresses cocaine taking, seeking, and cocaine-evoked dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A protein particle hidden within the SARS-CoV-2 virus could lead to longer-lasting, more protective vaccines for COVID-19. Scientists from La Trobe University and Kumamoto University in Japan have discovered that the body's immune system strongly reacts to an internal protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which mutates less frequently than the surface-spike protein currently targeted by vaccines. New research published in Nature Communications shows that these protein particles, known as peptides, appear on the surface of infected cells via an immune molecule called HLA-C, which killer T cells then use to identify and eliminate infection. Currently, vaccines target the spike proteins that decorate the surface of the virus – but they mutate frequently as they are constantly under pressure by our immune cells, which means we might need a new vaccine for each new variant. Stephanie Gras, Deputy Director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS) Professor Gras said the development of a longer-lasting vaccine could mean that people would need fewer booster vaccines to fight COVID, and help protect against the development of Long COVID. Professor Gras, Dr Demetra Chatzileontiadou, Dr Janesha Maddumage, and PhD candidate You Min Ahn led the research team at LIMS and La Trobe University's School of Biomedicine, Agriculture and Environment (SABE). It was funded through Professor Gras's National Health and Medical Research Centre (NHMRC) Leadership Investigator Grant (L2) and her Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant to investigate COVID. The research was done in collaboration with Associate Professor Chihiro Motozono and Yoshihiko Goto from the Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection at Kumamoto University in Japan, with data collection by the Australian Synchrotron. Professor Gras will also lead a new research centre at La Trobe University which aims to uncover the cause of Long COVID and other life-limiting post-viral infections such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The Post-Acute Viral Infection diseases Group (PAVING) Centre of Research Excellence has received $3 million in Federal funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at McMaster University have discovered that a rare but dangerous reaction to a widely used blood thinner is caused by a single antibody – overturning decades of medical misunderstanding and opening the door to more precise ways of diagnosing and treating this medical complication. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 3, 2025, focused on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious immune complication that affects approximately one per cent of hospitalized patients treated with the blood thinner heparin. Nearly half of those who develop HIT experience life-threatening blood clots, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, amputations, and even death, making early detection and treatment critically important. Until now, scientists believed that the immune response causing HIT involved many different types of antibodies working together. This study not only challenges our existing understanding of HIT but also revolutionizes how we think about the immune response overall." This status quo was a key reason behind the high rate of false-positive test results and frequent misdiagnoses in HIT, which can lead to severe consequences for patients, including unnecessary treatment or avoidable complications. Our findings lay the groundwork for more accurate diagnostics and targeted treatments," said Nazy, a professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster. They analyzed blood samples from nine patients diagnosed with HIT. "This discovery could reshape how we diagnose HIT and eventually how we treat it," said Jared Treverton, first author of the study and a PhD candidate at McMaster. "Knowing that HIT is caused by a monoclonal antibody will allow us to develop improved tests specific to patients with this disorder and design better targeted therapies. This is a major step towards making diagnostics more accurate and treatments much safer." The findings are expected to have immediate relevance for hematologists, laboratory specialists, and researchers in immunology, as well as for patients receiving heparin in hospitals across Canada and around the world. The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Institutes of Health and the Marta & Owen Boris Foundation. "This discovery is a testament to the power of scientific curiosity and collaboration. We are profoundly grateful to the Marta and Owen Boris Foundation and our funding partners for their support, which made this breakthrough possible. Their generosity is helping us change the way we understand and treat serious medical conditions like HIT," said co-author John Kelton, co-medical director of the MPIL and executive director of the Marnix E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new UCLA Health study found that taking an 8-strain probiotic daily may reduce the risk of pouchitis, a common inflammatory condition that occurs after colon removal surgery for ulcerative colitis, but the treatment may not be worth the cost depending on a patient's likelihood of flare-ups. Our findings highlight that while probiotic treatments can reduce the risk of this complication, their high costs limit their overall value for most patients. Our analysis can help guide shared decision-making between patients, clinicians and payers to ensure resources are used where they can provide the most benefit." Dr. Gaurav Syal, study lead author and inflammatory bowel disease gastroenterologist at UCLA Pouchitis is a common complication experienced by patients who have had their colon and rectum removed due to ulcerative colitis. Pouchitis can develop if this internal pouch becomes inflamed, leading to several uncomfortable symptoms such as frequent and urgent bowel movements, bloody stools and abdominal pain among others. This condition is typically treated with a short course of antibiotics. The UCLA study sought to determine whether a daily probiotic treatment using 8-strains of bacteria to prevent the development of pouchitis is worth the cost to third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. Using a computer model that assessed the risk of initial development and reoccurrence of pouchitis over a two-year period, the study found that the daily probiotic treatment was only cost-effective for patients who have frequent relapses of pouchitis (two or more incidents per year) but was not cost effective for patients with infrequent relapse or for preventing the first onset of this complication compared to patients who do not undergo the probiotic treatment. Dr. Syal said the findings can help clinicians determine treatment options with patients as well as inform policymakers and third-party payers to determine how best to allocate healthcare funding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These findings from a late-stage clinical trial suggest the second and third doses of conventional BPG therapy do not provide a health benefit. Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective against syphilis, but the three-dose regimen can be burdensome and deter people from attending follow-up visits with their healthcare providers. The new findings offer welcome evidence for potentially simplifying treatment with an equally effective one-dose regimen, particularly while syphilis rates remain alarmingly high." Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Syphilis can also increase a person's likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV. BPG is one of the few antibiotics known to effectively treat syphilis, and stockouts are common worldwide. The study was conducted at ten U.S. sites and enrolled 249 participants with early syphilis, which encompasses the primary, secondary, and early latent stages of disease. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular (IM) injection of BPG 2.4 million units (MU) or a series of three IM injections of BPG 2.4 MU at weekly intervals. Biological markers of successful treatment in the blood-known as the serologic response to therapy-were examined at six months following treatment. Seventy-six percent of participants in the single-dose group had a serologic response to treatment compared to 70% of participants in the three-dose group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant, even when participants were stratified by HIV status. One participant developed signs of neurosyphilis three days after starting BPG therapy and was excluded from the analysis. "Syphilis has been studied and treated for more than a century, and BPG has been in use for more than 50 years, yet we are still acquiring knowledge to help us optimize treatment," said Principal Investigator Edward W. Hook III, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "We hope these promising results will be complemented by scientific advances in syphilis prevention and diagnosis." According to the study authors, the results from this trial provide substantial evidence that single-dose BPG 2.4 MU is as effective as three doses in treating early syphilis. More research is needed to understand the full potential of this abbreviated treatment strategy and to evaluate therapeutic approaches for all stages of syphilis, including late syphilis, latent syphilis of unknown duration, and clinical neurosyphilis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UCLA Health has received a $7.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to expand research into a newer form of psychotherapy that has been shown to more significantly alleviate chronic pain among older adults compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. Developed in the 2010s, EAET aims to show patients that the brain's perception of pain is strongly influenced by stress-related emotions. Patients are helped to emotionally process stressful interactions, from anything as mundane as being cut off by a driver to severe traumas such as sexual assault, with the goal of changing brain circuits dealing with both pain and emotion to reduce or eliminate chronic pain. The trial will be led by Dr. Brandon Yarns, assistant professor at UCLA Health's Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. Previous research by Yarns found that nearly four times as many veterans experienced significant pain relief with EAET compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (63% vs 17%). That study, including 126 patients, was the first full-scale clinical trial of EAET among older adults, older men and veterans, with past studies being largely made up of younger, female participants, Yarns said. The new five-year trial will be a pragmatic trial to test the therapy's effectiveness in real-world clinical sites for potential widespread adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But, new research from Arizona State University, has discovered a universal experience – post-menopausal women experiencing increased blood lipid levels, such as cholesterol. Published today in the Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health, "Higher blood lipid levels after transition to menopause in two forager-horticulturalist populations," looked at several blood lipids, like cholesterol, that are major contributing factors to heart disease. In industrialized nations, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, women notably experience an increased risk of heart disease post-menopause, including an increase in those blood lipids. While we have good data from industrialized populations, to our knowledge, nobody had looked at this relationship in a non-industrial, highly active population like the Tsimane before." Madeleine Getz, PhD student studying global health in ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, and lead author on the study "While the difference varied by marker, they were between 1.5 to 11% higher after menopause. To see these risk factors increase after menopause in this population, despite their incredibly low levels of heart disease, was unexpected," Getz said, who is also an affiliated graduate student with ASU's Center for Evolution and Medicine and the Institute of Human Origins. "This suggests that these increases in cholesterol around menopause may be a human universal, no matter how or where we live," Getz said. Living a traditional hunter-farmer lifestyle, the Tsimane follow a diet free of processed foods and maintain high levels of physical activity, averaging around 15-20,000 steps per day. Their way of life closely mirrors that of early human societies, providing valuable insights into how modern environments influence disease and aging. The group has a longstanding relationship with the Tsimane to collect demographic and biomedical data, as well as helps to provide medical care for the community – a relationship that has been in effect for more than 20 years. "Working with populations like the Tsimane allows us to global variation in both menopause, as well as human health and disease" said Trumble. That suggests that post-menopausal increases in heart disease may be a human universal, and part of our underlying physiology regardless of lifestyle choices."
