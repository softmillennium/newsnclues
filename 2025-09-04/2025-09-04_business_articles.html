                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who lower courts ordered reinstated after he terminated her. Trump wants the Supreme Court to pause her reinstatement as he appeals the case. "President Trump acted lawfully when he removed Rebecca Slaughter from the FTC," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. "We look forward to being vindicated for a third time — and hopefully after this ruling, the lower courts will cease their defiance of Supreme Court orders." Trump in March removed Slaughter and another Democratic commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, as part of a sprawling effort to exert his influence over federal agencies. Slaughter and Bedoya then sued Trump, seeking to be reinstated. But Bedoya resigned from the FTC in June and dropped his case. The appeals court  held that FTC commissioners cannot be removed unless there is cause, which has been defined as neglect or malfeasance in office. Trump did not give a reason for firing Slaughter. Slaughter's case is the second in recent weeks to raise the question of whether Trump has legal "cause" to justify removing a federal regulator. The question of "cause" is also at the crux of Trump's unprecedented effort to remove Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. Trump last month moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, claims that her attorney has denied, setting up a court battle that could also end up at the Supreme Court. A court hearing on the matter ended without resolution last week, leaving the future of Cook's position unclear. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lululemon shares plunged in extended trading Thursday after the company gave a much worse than expected full-year outlook. The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. Lululemon said it expects full fiscal year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share, well below Wall Street estimates of $14.45 per share. "We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business," CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. Here's how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The stock is down more than 45% this year. The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period. Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%. Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share. McDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles "run too long," particularly in its lounge and social categories. "We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends," he said. "Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests," McDonald added. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bret Taylor's artificial intelligence startup Sierra has just joined an exclusive club: The company sports a new $10 billion valuation after raising $350 million in fresh capital. Sierra is one of just a handful of AI startups, including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines that are valued at or above $10 billion. Investors are pouring money into this competitive group of companies in the hopes that they'll eventually hit the public markets. Taylor is the chairman of OpenAI's board, and previously served as co-CEO of Salesforce alongside Marc Benioff. The company builds and implements AI agents for customer service. AI agents can carry out tasks autonomously on behalf of their users. Shares of Salesforce fell 5% Thursday after the company reported weak guidance and concerns lingered about how AI is affecting software companies. Sierra said its agents are already being used by "hundreds of millions of people" to help with tasks like refinancing homes, ordering lunch, delivering furniture, understanding insurance deductibles and fixing technology, among other things. Greenoaks led Sierra's latest funding round, the company said. The company said it will use its fresh funding to invest in its platform and focus on domestic and international expansion. Sierra's funding follows a flurry of other major AI raises in Silicon Valley. Earlier this week, Anthropic announced it had closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, Miran, President Donald Trump's nominee for the open Fed Governor role, said he wouldn't fully resign from his position at the White House while serving out the Fed Governor's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. He's set to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly at the beginning of August. Miran's appointment comes amid speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" and obtain ample influence in the central bank, raising fears about the central bank's independence. Miran keeping his White House job while serving as Fed governor could further fuel those concerns. "I have been advised by counsel that the legal approach is to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors, cease my activities and if council advises me otherwise, I will follow the law and follow council's advice," Miran said at the hearing. "The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign," he added. At the hearing, Miran repeatedly pledged to uphold the central bank's independence, stressing that no one at the administration had asked him to commit to easing monetary policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement, Cook's attorney Abbe Lowell described the criminal probe as "cover." "Predictably and recognizing the flaws in challenging their illegal firing of Governor Cook, the administration is scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach," Lowell said. "This Justice Department — perhaps the most politicized in American history — will do whatever President Trump demands." The Justice Department's criminal investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Bill Pulte — a Trump administration official who has aggressively attacked Cook — canceled a press conference in front of a Washington, DC, federal courthouse to present "new information" about the Federal Reserve board governor. "Once you see what we present on Thursday, there's going to be a lot of people apologizing and retracting their false and defamatory statements," Pulte said on X Tuesday morning. The criminal investigation marks a major escalation in the Trump administration's war against Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose term ends in 2038. President Donald Trump published a letter in August saying he was firing Cook for "cause" based on a criminal referral from Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and says Cook lied on mortgage documents. Pulte says Cook took out mortgages at around the same time for properties in Georgia and Michigan and said that each would be her primary residence. Cook sued Trump last week, saying Pulte's allegations didn't meet the legal standard for a "cause" firing. The federal judge overseeing the case, US District Judge Jia Cobb, is weighing whether to issue a temporary restraining order confirming that Cook will remain in her job while additional litigation plays out. Earlier this week, Justice Department officials urged her to decide quickly so that the parties would have a chance to appeal her decision ahead of the Federal Reserve's September 16 meeting. Neither Pulte nor the Justice Department responded to requests for comment. At a court hearing Friday, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth said Trump rightfully fired Cook. The Federal Reserve's role in setting interest rates means that a person who lies on mortgage documents can't be trusted, he said. "I think if there was something like that, we would have heard it by now." He said Trump needed to give Cook due process, and that the narrative about mortgage documents was a pretext for Trump filling the Federal Reserve with his own appointees to lower interest rates as part of his economic plan. "A bad motive can illuminate the fact that there was no real cause," he said. Lowell said in his Thursday statement that he would continue to address the allegations. This story has been updated to add additional comments from Abbe Lowell.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bad year just got worse for Salesforce. Following a disappointing revenue forecast in its quarterly earnings report late Wednesday, Salesforce's stock slumped 8%, bringing its decline for 2025 to 28%. That's the worst performance in large-cap tech. Revenue increased 10% in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier, cracking double-digit growth for the first time since early 2024. Sales of $10.24 billion topped the average analyst estimate of $10.14 billion, and earnings per share also exceeded expectations. Salesforce regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, but the company hasn't been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers — particularly those focused on infrastructure. There's also a concern on Wall Street that AI is going to eat away at much of the software sector. "While the investor community oozes angst over the future of SaaS, the here and now from Salesforce, while impressive at scale, is not enough to reshape the narrative," wrote analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a report on Wednesday. Salesforce is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products, Robin Washington, the company's president and chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. In its earnings release, Salesforce said it closed over 12,500 total deals for Agentforce, which can automate the handling of customer service questions. The company said that over 40% of bookings for Agentforce and its data cloud came from existing customers. "To hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, and people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth," Benioff said. Salesforce kept its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One Mexican city in particular has stolen my heart: Puerto Vallarta. Located on the country's west coast, Puerto Vallarta is more than just a classic resort town. I've visited Puerto Vallarta four times in the past two years — with friends, family, and for bachelorette parties — and every trip has offered something a little different. Here's why I love visiting this lively Mexican city. Those who want a fun and classic street-food-style experience should head to Pancho's Takos. The restaurant's al pastor tacos are so good that you'll probably have to wait in a line that stretches around the block. Fortunately, it's in the heart of downtown, so you can see street performers and people-watch while waiting. Travelers looking for something a little more luxe will love the stretch of restaurants along Playa Los Muertos (the main tourist beach). I especially enjoy El Dorado, which has fresh-tasting seafood, craft cocktails, and attentive service. I recommend going for dinner at sunset for a romantic and memorable dining experience — just be sure to make reservations ahead of time, as tables go fast. The Zona Romántica, or Romantic Zone, is home to lots of bars and nightclubs. It's also a hub for the LGBTQ+ communities and reminds me of West Hollywood. Once the sun goes down, crowds spill (or dance) out of bass-pumping bars on every corner. If a party is what you're looking for, you won't have to try very hard to find it in the Zona Romántica. Outdoorsy folks will love the plethora of scenic hiking trails, water sports, and natural wonders in or near Puerto Vallarta. I recommend checking out the Palo Maria waterfall trail, a moderate 1.4-mile trail that leads to a small waterfall and swimming hole. You can get there by boat or kayak — I opted for a kayaking tour through the Garza Blanca Resort.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Kern. It has been edited for length and clarity. When the sun sets, I know it's time to eat and rest. When the tide touches the bottom of my mooring buoy, it's time to work on the rock wall I'm building to help fight erosion. That's what days are like on Planet Sand. That's my preferred name for the 1.5-acre island in Casco Bay, about a 15-minute boat ride from Portland, Maine. The island — officially called Sand Island — has no running water, electricity, or reliable internet. It's my home for three months out of the year. It's built from recycled construction trash that I collected from dumps on the mainland. That's the measurement system we use here on Planet Sand: too big, not enough, or perfect. My boat is small and slow, so Portland, the nearest city, is a 45-minute boat ride for me. My record is eight weeks, but it's more typical to go get supplies every three to five weeks. People love to ask about the bathroom situation. I'm out here doing something extraordinary, working to save the world, and you want to know where I pee? We lived on another island in Casco Bay, but that one was populated, paved, and connected to the mainland by a bridge. There were no structures or docks. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the shore of the island, including time to scramble over rocks. Still, I've turned trash into treasure. In the real world, I was an outsider, but on Planet Sand, I felt at home. Unfortunately, I didn't always hear that call. For years, that made me forget about the island. I would wake up at noon, so hungover. We allow day visitors to the island, so I would see families playing together in this beautiful place, all while my head throbbed. That's why I stopped drinking, too. This November, I'll mark seven years in recovery. Being out here is not a vacation. I work all day, building a rock wall or repairing my winch system. Those songs are just so happy. I like to socialize with the boaters who come by. Most of the time, it's just me here, but on one day this summer, we had 60 people on the island. I love watching people laugh and explore with their families. There are kids here making memories that will last their whole lives. I've heard there's research about nature being good for mental health. If they say 15 minutes in nature can improve your mental health, just imagine what three months can do. For me, the island — my planet — is magic and medicine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Yen, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Los Angeles who is the founder of Daily Work Journal and Surfers Jewelry. Business Insider has verified Yen's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. It's the classic story: You quit a 9-to-5 to become an entrepreneur and end up working 24/7. I worked long hours in data analytics, but the difference now is that I'm willing to put in far more hours because it's my own company; it's part of my identity. Now, my work includes things I love: talking to surfers, dreaming up brand trips — experiences I could never have had as a corporate analyst. I started my career as a business technology analyst at Deloitte right out of UCLA in 2014. I chose Deloitte's San Francisco office for a change of pace from Los Angeles. I had imagined a glamorous consulting life filled with travel, but my last project before quitting Deloitte involved commuting from San Francisco to Walnut Creek every day. In consulting, you don't have much control over what projects you work on, and I realized I wanted more say in my career. I landed my first data role as a marketing analyst at Salesforce in January 2016. In interviews, I largely leaned on the Excel skills I built at Deloitte, and since it was also a core skill the team sought, it helped me transition seamlessly into my first tech role. I wanted to keep working with data while expanding into a broader scope, so I moved into business operations, which allowed me to touch strategy, business development analytics, sales analytics, and marketing analytics. From there, I joined Yelp in a business operations and strategy analytics role, working across multiple functions. People analytics became the final area I wanted to explore. The opportunity to round out my skills with people analytics came at Cruise, the self-driving car startup, which I joined in June 2019. But after several years in the high-stress field of data analytics, I was exhausted. Everyone wants your time and expects you to build dashboards, often with quick turnarounds. At my peak stress, I had dreams about redoing Excel formulas, obsessing over whether I'd divided something twice or misplaced a decimal. It got to the point where I was constantly ruminating about tiny details that could throw off entire reports by orders of magnitude. That level of pressure wasn't sustainable for me. In August 2020, during the pandemic, I decided to leave Cruise. I was burned out, single, living alone, and feeling the isolation of COVID-19. I wanted a break from corporate life and leaned into coaching full time. At the same time, I launched my first product business in December 2020 — Daily Work Journal, a notebook brand. After selling Daily Work Journal, I took some time off and started surfing, purely for fun. I only coach occasionally, when past clients reach out. I always advise aspiring entrepreneurs to have a corporate career before striking out on their own. Whatever you specialize in becomes your edge as an entrepreneur. My experience in data analytics gave me skills I now use every day and confidence in the financial side of my business. But now, I can't imagine doing anything else.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the course of my career at companies like Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I've hired, developed, and evaluated hundreds of employees. Many of them were smart, capable, and ambitious. If you think the group that got their requests granted was innately more talented or harder working than the group that didn't, think again. Promotions and pay raises are business decisions, not gifts. This means that even the strongest performers will hear "not now" if they ignore the situations that surround them. Here are five of the most common timing missteps I've seen, and what I wish more rising leaders would do differently. Someone gets promoted in January and, by April, they're asking for another raise. I once had a high performer who was promoted to senior manager after a solid year. Less than 90 days later, she sent me a proposal for another title change — accompanied by comp benchmarks and a list of expanded responsibilities. She was doing more, but she hadn't been in the role long enough to demonstrate success at that level, and she lacked the self-awareness that no one should ask for more every quarter. Understand your career path and the next opportunity for growth. I've seen people use early 1:1s to talk about their career goals. However, when it turns into "What would it take for me to get promoted this year?" before the manager even understands your role (and hers! ), it can create the perception that you're only thinking about yourself. It's like walking into a room you've never been in before and immediately asking to rearrange the furniture. Start by understanding how your new manager defines success and taking an interest in her priorities and challenges. Some of the hardest "no" answers I've had to give were to employees who were deserving but seemed oblivious to what was going on around them. Even if you think you've done everything right, asking for more when the broader context is shaky can hurt your chances. I've had employees come to me during expense freezes, department restructures, or right after we missed our numbers, sometimes with very strong cases for advancement. Make yourself even more valuable by showing that you can lead patiently through uncertainty. Be the person who brings stability when others are scrambling. Once the business starts to recover — and you've played a visible role in that — you'll be in a much stronger position to ask for more. This happens when someone moves too quickly after a mistake or learning opportunity. If you haven't closed the loop on feedback, asking for more shows a lack of accountability and self-awareness. I once had a direct report who delivered great work but struggled with cross-functional influence and managing senior leaders. He hadn't had time to show progress yet, and asking so soon after our conversation made it seem like he didn't understand the gravity of the feedback. Slow down, and shore up any doubts about your potential. When you hear feedback, don't just acknowledge it — change something. Then, when you make the ask, it will be even stronger because your coachability and growth will become part of the case for advancement. Every once in a while, someone has come to me unexpectedly and said, "I'm ready for the next level." If we hadn't been talking about growth, readiness, or performance over time, it could be challenging to make it happen quickly. Big asks shouldn't come out of nowhere. Depending on other career path timelines you've observed, your own performance, and the standard cycle of mid-year and year-end performance conversations, you might start talking about your career goals once you've been in your role for 6-12 months. Make career growth part of the regular conversation. Use 1:1s with your manager or HR to ask what overdelivering looks like. Get clarity on what's expected at the next level. That way, when you're ready to make a formal ask, your manager's already on the same page. It's usually after you've shown clear results, earned credibility, and positioned yourself inside the broader business picture. If you're preparing to make a case, put yourself in your manager's shoes, evaluate what's happening across the team or company, and ask yourself, "Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes'?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At long last, the white whale of iOS has been harpooned: Instagram finally made an app for iPad. Shockingly, there had never been a true iPad Instagram app — you could download the regular Instagram mobile app and use it on an iPad, but it was a uniquely crummy experience — you could use it with a phone-sized display or zoomed out, and the whole thing was clunky and sad. Finally, there's a new iPad version, nearly 15 years after Instagram first launched. (The iPad, also launched in 2010, just barely predates Instagram.) No more pretense that you might be hoping to see "photos" from your "friends" in the main feed. Instead, you'll see Stories at the top, should you choose to interact with those plebes you know in real life who cling to the sad concept of posting photos and videos from their real life to share with their close friends. This saves you the highly unpleasant experience of opening an app and having sound start playing right away, and it's also more intuitive to just slightly scroll down than to hunt and tap for a sound on/off icon. What does it mean that Instagram's iPad app is so Reels-centric? A more video-first approach makes sense with Reels and iPads. Since iPads are popular for watching video content — YouTube or Netflix — why not sit back and watch some Reels? Instagram's official blog post says: "With Instagram for iPad, we've redesigned the experience to reflect how people use bigger screens today — for lean back entertainment."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent. An internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated "hub" offices are hampering recruiting efforts. The hub strategy is listed as one of the "hotly debated topics" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire "high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider. Some Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely. One of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. Add Business Insider as a preferred source on Google to see more of us. In addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind. Oracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently. "We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations," the spokesperson said. Many firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. "We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time," the Amazon spokesperson said. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Seattle-based company is testing new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider. Quick Suite empowers "every business user to make better decisions, faster, and act on them swiftly by unifying Al agents for business insights, deep research, and automation into a single experience," according to one of the documents, marked confidential. Several companies have been given a private preview of the new technology, and Amazon recently sent out invitations for an internal beta test. Quick Suite positions AWS to compete more aggressively in AI with agent-driven automation. While the company is a pioneer in cloud computing, it's made less of a mark so far with software that runs on top of this infrastructure. "With over 40% of business users expected to adopt Al-enhanced work environments soon, AWS is positioned to lead this shift by providing integrated solutions that help organizations — including our own — effectively deploy and scale Al agents in the workplace," Amazon's beta test invitation states. Business Insider previously reported that Amazon was working on a unified "agentic" AI workspace, internally codenamed Q Business Suite, with "Quick" floated as a potential brand name. "We are seeing strong growth of Amazon Q Business with customers like Remitly, Nasdaq, and Smartsheet, along with partners like Zoom and Asana, adopting it to provide employees with generative AI assistance to transform how work gets done," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "Similarly, we are seeing customers like BMW and GoDaddy embrace Amazon QuickSight in order to make data-driven decisions quickly," the spokesperson added. Quick Suite will merge some of AWS's existing products, such as its data analysis platform QuickSight and its AI chatbot Q Business, while also adding a new product called Quick Flows, according to another of the documents. Quick Flows provides pre-built workflows that let customers automate tasks through natural language prompts, one of the documents explained. Quick Suite will include a "deep research agent" to generate reports from company and external data, and will also enable customers to create custom agents for "specific business functions or team needs," which can then be shared across their organization, one of the documents said. Quick Suite has received mixed feedback from beta users, according to one of the internal documents. Customers praised its simpler setup and more intuitive design compared to Q Business, as well as its "compelling" deep research feature for both internal and external use. The ability to connect with external tools, such as Atlassian's Jira, has also been well received. At the same time, some testers reported frustrations with networking limitations in virtual cloud environments and onerous permission requirements for linking data sources. Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, the document said. Quick Suite's launch represents a turning point in AWS's AI application strategy. Q Business had been intended as the company's flagship offering for business users, but AWS is now making Quick Suite a priority, as BI previously reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And the sky-high expectations that have been partly inflated and overhyped by AI firms over the past few years are finally coming down to Earth. AI's trajectory is starting to look less like a time machine or space elevator and more akin computers, smartphones, televisions: The technology will get better, it will almost certainly change our lives in the fullness of time, but it will more likely do so incrementally — to the point that if AGI (artificial general intelligence) or superintelligence do in fact one day arrive, it might not seem like much of a leap at all. There's perhaps no better example of this happening than OpenAI's latest and long-anticipated model, GPT-5, which was touted with a bang and landed with a shrug. "The degree of overhyping was too significant," one person wrote. "In the absence of massive gains, all you have is hype," wrote another. But it may be a glimpse at our new reality, where the breakneck speed of AI progress is simply steadying, where progress cannot run on hype alone, and where we will neither experience an overnight white-collar job wipeout nor reach an AI abundance society overnight. When the internet revolution took hold in the late 1990s, companies were minting millions overnight with little more than a website and a savvy sales pitch. It's easy to see why talk of a bubble has once again reared its head. Even Altman recently (and in an unusually measured moment from AI's biggest hype man) said he believes the AI market might be in a bubble. If that sounds eerily familiar, a check on AI now could prevent history from repeating itself. A recent study published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further stirred the pot last month, claiming that just 5% of companies it studied have managed to convert the technology into actual revenue — a revelation scary enough to cause a tech stock sell-off, even if the study had a lot of limitations. Other evidence suggests AI is starting to have an impact on businesses that are adopting it. A study from Stanford University researchers that analyzed payroll data concluded that AI was killing off entry-level jobs for people aged 22 to 25, and was especially doing so in fields where AI was more likely to replace, rather than augment, labor. Marc Benioff claims AI agents are replacing thousands of Salesforce's support roles, while other companies are boasting about AI automating more of their work. A study of AI's effects on the demand for foreign translators by Frey and fellow Oxford economist Pedro Llanos-Paredes, published earlier this year, concluded that the technology was having a small but provable impact on these jobs. "We seem to be seeing reasonable revenue growth for a handful of firms that are pioneering the AI revolution, but we're not seeing it translate into broader economic growth," Frey tells me. "What I find concerning is that we're still not seeing any hint of it in the productivity statistics, and ultimately that's what matters. What matters is translating that into real economic growth." For the markets, a more modest uptake may be perfectly OK. Evercore ISI strategists predict AI excitement will buoy US stocks a further 20% by the end of 2026. "AI is 'bigger' than the internet," they wrote in a note published this week. "In three years, its effect has touched all parts of society and industry even as adoption only begins to inflect." Last week's Nvidia earnings were a strong indicator of where we're at. (Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft spends about 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia's chips.) While it beat Wall Street expectations and its own sales records, its stock still dropped, suggesting investors weren't impressed with the figures they saw. One UBS analyst characterized Nvidia's results in a way that may perfectly sum up the new steady-chug-along paradigm of AI: "good enough." When Apple's iPhone 4 arrived in 2010, it was nothing short of a smash hit. Then things changed: With the exception of a couple of moderate leaps since, the iPhone has been on a more incremental trajectory. Evidence suggests artificial intelligence might be plotting a similar course. Frontier labs have been rolling out a steady flow of updates and mini-leaps, rather than waiting years between generations, and as a result, each new rollout has started feeling evolutionary, incremental. Last year, the big topic was whether AI labs were seeing diminishing returns when simply trying to throw more data and compute power at the models. That may go some way to explain how GPT-5 landed, but it's not the only factor. Between the launch of GPT-4 in March 2023 and GPT-5 last month, OpenAI rolled out well over a dozen models, each one focusing on specific jobs or incrementally improving another. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that GPT-5 didn't blow our socks off. Google's latest frontier model, Gemini 2.5, is also a bridge model, and the launch of GPT-5 may serve as a healthy warning to temper expectations for Gemini 3, which is expected before the year's end. "The progress just feels more continuous," says David Krueger, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal who studies AI safety and risks. Krueger still thinks we'll have the occasional "wow" moment, but said he also believes we'll need more breakthroughs on the technical side to reach any level of artificial intelligence that can go toe-to-toe with a human — and he says he doesn't believe we will reach AGI from large language models alone. "I think LLMs and more broadly deep learning are probably a big piece of the puzzle. If I had to bet, the biggest one," he says. "But I think we're maybe missing a couple of puzzle pieces." Krueger also lays blame at the feet of certain AI figureheads who have created "unreasonable levels of hype," and who are finally getting a reality check. The actual gains appear to be much more modest: During Alphabet's Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that more than 30% of code written at Google was being generated by AI. In a January interview with Bloomberg, Altman predicted AGI would arrive during Trump's second presidency. Elon Musk once predicted it could be here by the year's end. According to some of the best minds in AI, AGI is often just a "few years away." In truth it feels like we're finally realizing nobody actually knows. Perhaps nobody has had more of a humbling in AI than Apple, which earlier this year axed an iPhone 16 ad that promised several much-hyped new AI features that, as it turned out, were far from ready. When Tim Cook steps onstage next week, don't be surprised if he and other executives strike a more measured tone when talking about AI, as they pull back the curtain on the latest lineup of devices. I hear the new phone will be a little thinner this time. Hugh Langley is a senior correspondent at Business Insider where he writes about Google, tech, and wealth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett's dealmaking made him a legend, but the breakup of Kraft Heinz marks one of his few missteps, the investor's close followers say. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate partnered with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to acquire Heinz for around $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, they teamed up again to merge Heinz with Kraft in a $40 billion deal. Buffett, a fast-food aficionado, called it "my kind of transaction," adding that the combined company could "supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your Oscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favorite meal." But Buffett's partnership with 3G Capital was a departure from his playbook. Private equity firms often seek to quickly cut a company's costs and change its management to raise its value so they can sell it for a profit and use the money to fund their next acquisition. In contrast, Berkshire is known for offering permanent, hands-off ownership to businesses it buys, and seeks to avoid bloat instead of eliminate it, as Buffett laid out in his 2015 shareholder letter. After the Kraft Heinz merger, there were layoffs, management overhauls, massive writedowns, and asset sales. The company also settled a federal accounting probe and had a protracted decline in net revenues amid shifting consumer preferences. On Tuesday, Kraft Heinz said it plans to split into two businesses. Berkshire and Kraft Heinz didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider but Buffett told CNBC that he was "disappointed." The "Oracle of Omaha" has said before that acquiring Kraft was an error. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake. Buffett told CNBC he didn't rule out a sale, saying he would do what was best for Berkshire. He said it wasn't clear to him how this would generate value for shareholders. The company has said it anticipates $300 million of "dis-synergies" from the split, although it hopes to mitigate some. John Longo — a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of "Buffett's Tips" — said acquiring Heinz was a "home run" for Buffett, but merging it with Kraft was a "rare misstep." Longo said the merger generated fewer savings than expected. He also said that Kraft Heinz had faced challenges from weight-loss drugs like Ozempic that reduce people's appetites, and several years of high inflation, which has pushed some consumers to switch to cheaper, generic alternatives. Alex Morris, the head of TSOH Investment Research and author of "Buffett and Munger Unscripted," said he agreed with the Berkshire boss that combining Heinz and Kraft "wasn't a great deal" but "splitting them up won't fix the key issues." Morris said the company's challenges largely reflected mounting industry pressures on Kraft's legacy business, as consumer tastes have shifted toward fresher, healthier, and more natural alternatives. "They've collected dividends along the way and still own great assets," Mead said. Buffett's errors are rare, but he has admitted to them in the past. He said his 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe, a Maine shoemaker that crumbled under pressure from cheap foreign imports, was his "most gruesome" mistake and a "financial disaster." He bought the "worthless business" using Berkshire stock that would be worth nearly $19 billion today.</p>
