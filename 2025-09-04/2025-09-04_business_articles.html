                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India is an appealing destination for U.S. tech giants, with companies ranging from Google to Meta betting on its huge — and young — population over recent years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visited the country in February this year and met with the country's IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to discuss collaboration. During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users. He has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is "amazing to watch." "We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world," he said on X earlier this year. India is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. Here's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India. ChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. Since its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows. The download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. To address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app. "It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later," Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report. The ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India. It also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country. While India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta. Continued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms. OpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. "OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles," Futurum Group's Patience said. "While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Gen Z workers return to the office, they're reshaping corporate norms by embracing AI, normalizing mental health chats, and being more authentic at work. Born between 1997 and 2012, many Gen Zers entered the workforce during the pandemic, navigating their first jobs amid remote work arrangements, uncertainty and rapid change. Some top business leaders linked the rise of remote work to Gen Z, raising concerns about workplace discipline and engagement. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, "the zoomers don't show up" — referring to Gen Z professionals. Despite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL. As older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age. This has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral "Gen Z stare", to the "office siren" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like "ick"  becoming normalized in professional lingo. "Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity," Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC. Senior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap. This has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities. "Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. Twenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up. Twenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings "her whole self to work," she said. "'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on. Gen Z workers are often more casual and comfortable in how they show up at work — sometimes literally. "It'll always be the Gen Zers that sit on the floor instead of sitting like in a chair at a desk," Lanni said, referring to team meetings. Li believes showing up to work with an authentic personality is a unique trait of Gen Z culture, regardless of whether it aligns with corporate norms. Where mental health was formerly a hush-hush conversation in the workplace, Gen Z workers like prioritizing wellbeing. Roughly 51% of young people view mental and physical health as a primary metric of future success, more than other factors like wealth, occupation and family relationships, according to a recent global EY study of over 10,000 respondents aged between 18 and 34 years. Communications professional Li noted that, after the pandemic, "psychological safety has been very important" for young people, so essentially being able to bring their emotional side to work. She said that her friends and colleagues often check in with each other during lunch breaks. "We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people," Li said. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7." Lanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace. Lanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are "pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted." Gen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work. Twenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams. "We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI," she said. Around 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte. Li said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work," she said. Workplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: "Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document. The NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives. The VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives. The league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who lower courts ordered reinstated after he terminated her. Trump wants the Supreme Court to pause her reinstatement as he appeals the case. "President Trump acted lawfully when he removed Rebecca Slaughter from the FTC," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. "We look forward to being vindicated for a third time — and hopefully after this ruling, the lower courts will cease their defiance of Supreme Court orders." Trump in March removed Slaughter and another Democratic commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, as part of a sprawling effort to exert his influence over federal agencies. Slaughter and Bedoya then sued Trump, seeking to be reinstated. But Bedoya resigned from the FTC in June and dropped his case. The appeals court  held that FTC commissioners cannot be removed unless there is cause, which has been defined as neglect or malfeasance in office. Trump did not give a reason for firing Slaughter. Slaughter's case is the second in recent weeks to raise the question of whether Trump has legal "cause" to justify removing a federal regulator. The question of "cause" is also at the crux of Trump's unprecedented effort to remove Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. Trump last month moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, claims that her attorney has denied, setting up a court battle that could also end up at the Supreme Court. A court hearing on the matter ended without resolution last week, leaving the future of Cook's position unclear. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lululemon shares plunged in extended trading Thursday after the company gave a much worse than expected full-year outlook. The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. Lululemon said it expects full fiscal year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share, well below Wall Street estimates of $14.45 per share. "We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business," CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. Here's how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The stock is down more than 45% this year. The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period. Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%. Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share. McDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles "run too long," particularly in its lounge and social categories. "We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends," he said. "Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests," McDonald added. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement, Cook's attorney Abbe Lowell described the criminal probe as "cover." "Predictably and recognizing the flaws in challenging their illegal firing of Governor Cook, the administration is scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach," Lowell said. "This Justice Department — perhaps the most politicized in American history — will do whatever President Trump demands." The Justice Department's criminal investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Bill Pulte — a Trump administration official who has aggressively attacked Cook — canceled a press conference in front of a Washington, DC, federal courthouse to present "new information" about the Federal Reserve board governor. "Once you see what we present on Thursday, there's going to be a lot of people apologizing and retracting their false and defamatory statements," Pulte said on X Tuesday morning. The criminal investigation marks a major escalation in the Trump administration's war against Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose term ends in 2038. President Donald Trump published a letter in August saying he was firing Cook for "cause" based on a criminal referral from Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and says Cook lied on mortgage documents. Pulte says Cook took out mortgages at around the same time for properties in Georgia and Michigan and said that each would be her primary residence. Cook sued Trump last week, saying Pulte's allegations didn't meet the legal standard for a "cause" firing. The federal judge overseeing the case, US District Judge Jia Cobb, is weighing whether to issue a temporary restraining order confirming that Cook will remain in her job while additional litigation plays out. Earlier this week, Justice Department officials urged her to decide quickly so that the parties would have a chance to appeal her decision ahead of the Federal Reserve's September 16 meeting. Neither Pulte nor the Justice Department responded to requests for comment. At a court hearing Friday, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth said Trump rightfully fired Cook. The Federal Reserve's role in setting interest rates means that a person who lies on mortgage documents can't be trusted, he said. "I think if there was something like that, we would have heard it by now." He said Trump needed to give Cook due process, and that the narrative about mortgage documents was a pretext for Trump filling the Federal Reserve with his own appointees to lower interest rates as part of his economic plan. "A bad motive can illuminate the fact that there was no real cause," he said. Lowell said in his Thursday statement that he would continue to address the allegations. This story has been updated to add additional comments from Abbe Lowell.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One Mexican city in particular has stolen my heart: Puerto Vallarta. Located on the country's west coast, Puerto Vallarta is more than just a classic resort town. I've visited Puerto Vallarta four times in the past two years — with friends, family, and for bachelorette parties — and every trip has offered something a little different. Here's why I love visiting this lively Mexican city. Those who want a fun and classic street-food-style experience should head to Pancho's Takos. The restaurant's al pastor tacos are so good that you'll probably have to wait in a line that stretches around the block. Fortunately, it's in the heart of downtown, so you can see street performers and people-watch while waiting. Travelers looking for something a little more luxe will love the stretch of restaurants along Playa Los Muertos (the main tourist beach). I especially enjoy El Dorado, which has fresh-tasting seafood, craft cocktails, and attentive service. I recommend going for dinner at sunset for a romantic and memorable dining experience — just be sure to make reservations ahead of time, as tables go fast. The Zona Romántica, or Romantic Zone, is home to lots of bars and nightclubs. It's also a hub for the LGBTQ+ communities and reminds me of West Hollywood. Once the sun goes down, crowds spill (or dance) out of bass-pumping bars on every corner. If a party is what you're looking for, you won't have to try very hard to find it in the Zona Romántica. Outdoorsy folks will love the plethora of scenic hiking trails, water sports, and natural wonders in or near Puerto Vallarta. I recommend checking out the Palo Maria waterfall trail, a moderate 1.4-mile trail that leads to a small waterfall and swimming hole. You can get there by boat or kayak — I opted for a kayaking tour through the Garza Blanca Resort.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Kern. It has been edited for length and clarity. When the sun sets, I know it's time to eat and rest. When the tide touches the bottom of my mooring buoy, it's time to work on the rock wall I'm building to help fight erosion. That's what days are like on Planet Sand. That's my preferred name for the 1.5-acre island in Casco Bay, about a 15-minute boat ride from Portland, Maine. The island — officially called Sand Island — has no running water, electricity, or reliable internet. It's my home for three months out of the year. It's built from recycled construction trash that I collected from dumps on the mainland. That's the measurement system we use here on Planet Sand: too big, not enough, or perfect. My boat is small and slow, so Portland, the nearest city, is a 45-minute boat ride for me. My record is eight weeks, but it's more typical to go get supplies every three to five weeks. People love to ask about the bathroom situation. I'm out here doing something extraordinary, working to save the world, and you want to know where I pee? We lived on another island in Casco Bay, but that one was populated, paved, and connected to the mainland by a bridge. There were no structures or docks. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the shore of the island, including time to scramble over rocks. Still, I've turned trash into treasure. In the real world, I was an outsider, but on Planet Sand, I felt at home. Unfortunately, I didn't always hear that call. For years, that made me forget about the island. I would wake up at noon, so hungover. We allow day visitors to the island, so I would see families playing together in this beautiful place, all while my head throbbed. That's why I stopped drinking, too. This November, I'll mark seven years in recovery. Being out here is not a vacation. I work all day, building a rock wall or repairing my winch system. Those songs are just so happy. I like to socialize with the boaters who come by. Most of the time, it's just me here, but on one day this summer, we had 60 people on the island. I love watching people laugh and explore with their families. There are kids here making memories that will last their whole lives. I've heard there's research about nature being good for mental health. If they say 15 minutes in nature can improve your mental health, just imagine what three months can do. For me, the island — my planet — is magic and medicine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, features around 350 planes and missiles in its collection, but there's one aircraft in the World War II Gallery that attracts a particularly large crowd. Bockscar, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. When accompanied by a museum volunteer, visitors can walk under the plane to see where the 10,000-pound bomb was loaded. The bombing of Nagasaki initially killed an estimated 40,000 people and injured around 60,000 more, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources. Japan didn't surrender after the US dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. After Bockscar dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, the emperor of Japan announced their surrender on August 15, bringing World War II to a close. Additional factors, such as Japan's weakened military resources and the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria on August 9, are also understood to have contributed to Japan's surrender. Bockscar was based at Wendover Army Air Field in Utah. The plane flew from Utah to Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands and then from Tinian to Nagasaki. Bock normally flew Bockscar, but switched planes with Maj. Charles Sweeney, commander of the 393rd Bomb Squadron, for the bombing of Nagasaki. At Nagasaki, Bock flew The Great Artiste, and Sweeney piloted Bockscar. The Fat Man atomic bomb weighed 10,000 pounds and exploded with 20,000 tons of TNT. The museum refurbished a demilitarized Mk III bomb to look like the Fat Man, which was painted yellow so that it could easily be seen after it was dropped. Lt. Charles Levy took this colorized photo of the Fat Man's explosion from aboard The Great Artiste. The exact number of people who died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will never be known. The "high" estimate, which anti-nuclear weapons scientists and Japan released in the 1970s, counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima and 70,000 at Nagasaki for a total of 210,000 lives lost.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're stuck in the weeds of the stock market every day, it can be tough to appreciate a historically significant shift happening right before your very eyes. Strategists at Goldman Sachs led by Peter Oppenheimer, the firm's chief global equity strategist, say it's time to recognize such a change that's already underway. They call it the "postmodern cycle," which they say is the fourth long secular bull run since World War II. The strategists see a structural shift in stocks, with new factors starting to drive returns — and by extension, new opportunities for investors. "The reason we called it the 'Postmodern' cycle is that we thought it would have elements that mirrored experiences of historical cycles but would also contain distinct and unique drivers that would shape investment opportunities differently," the Goldman strategists wrote. There are three things that differentiate the postmodern period from previous structural eras, according to Goldman. New structural bull markets tend to start off with stocks at low valuations. "So absolute returns are likely to be lower," the bank added of stocks. Goldman says inflation and, consequently, long-term interest rates, are likely to trend higher. That differs from the past two super cycles, where interest rates generally trended lower. Investors have already been eyeing the threat that inflation will run hotter this year as companies begin to feel the impact of tariffs, which could lead them to raise prices for consumers. "Post-Covid inflation has triggered a rise in term premia," Goldman said, adding that they believed interest rates had "little room to fall" today. The government will likely continue to run up its balance sheet, Goldman said. That differs from past periods, such as during former President Bill Clinton's term in the late 1990s, when the US budget was in a surplus for the first time in decades. Higher debt levels are another factor driving up borrowing costs in the economy. "Each of these may weigh on aggregate corporate profits, although we are likely to experience wider differences between winners and losers," strategists said. While those changes are largely a net negative on equity prices, that's not to say there won't be bright areas of the market for investors. The bank also highlighted three "mega trends" that it believed could offer "significant" opportunities for investors: US tech stocks have largely been responsible for powering the overall market to fresh records in recent years, and large firms are still shelling out big to invest in AI. These two sectors are likely to "generate opportunities" for investors, given how technology will improve production, Goldman said. The promise of high returns from AI are not likely to be fulfilled without a significant ramp-up in physical infrastructure on data centres and electricity grids," strategists added. Strategists pointed in particular to the All Country World Index ex. "This is not an argument in favour of being underweight on the US, but rather in favour of being more open to undervalued opportunities elsewhere as a way of supplementing and diversifying from concentrated positions in the US index," the bank said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Yen, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Los Angeles who is the founder of Daily Work Journal and Surfers Jewelry. Business Insider has verified Yen's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. It's the classic story: You quit a 9-to-5 to become an entrepreneur and end up working 24/7. I worked long hours in data analytics, but the difference now is that I'm willing to put in far more hours because it's my own company; it's part of my identity. Now, my work includes things I love: talking to surfers, dreaming up brand trips — experiences I could never have had as a corporate analyst. I started my career as a business technology analyst at Deloitte right out of UCLA in 2014. I chose Deloitte's San Francisco office for a change of pace from Los Angeles. I had imagined a glamorous consulting life filled with travel, but my last project before quitting Deloitte involved commuting from San Francisco to Walnut Creek every day. In consulting, you don't have much control over what projects you work on, and I realized I wanted more say in my career. I landed my first data role as a marketing analyst at Salesforce in January 2016. In interviews, I largely leaned on the Excel skills I built at Deloitte, and since it was also a core skill the team sought, it helped me transition seamlessly into my first tech role. I wanted to keep working with data while expanding into a broader scope, so I moved into business operations, which allowed me to touch strategy, business development analytics, sales analytics, and marketing analytics. From there, I joined Yelp in a business operations and strategy analytics role, working across multiple functions. People analytics became the final area I wanted to explore. The opportunity to round out my skills with people analytics came at Cruise, the self-driving car startup, which I joined in June 2019. But after several years in the high-stress field of data analytics, I was exhausted. Everyone wants your time and expects you to build dashboards, often with quick turnarounds. At my peak stress, I had dreams about redoing Excel formulas, obsessing over whether I'd divided something twice or misplaced a decimal. It got to the point where I was constantly ruminating about tiny details that could throw off entire reports by orders of magnitude. That level of pressure wasn't sustainable for me. In August 2020, during the pandemic, I decided to leave Cruise. I was burned out, single, living alone, and feeling the isolation of COVID-19. I wanted a break from corporate life and leaned into coaching full time. At the same time, I launched my first product business in December 2020 — Daily Work Journal, a notebook brand. After selling Daily Work Journal, I took some time off and started surfing, purely for fun. I only coach occasionally, when past clients reach out. I always advise aspiring entrepreneurs to have a corporate career before striking out on their own. Whatever you specialize in becomes your edge as an entrepreneur. My experience in data analytics gave me skills I now use every day and confidence in the financial side of my business. But now, I can't imagine doing anything else.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the course of my career at companies like Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I've hired, developed, and evaluated hundreds of employees. Many of them were smart, capable, and ambitious. If you think the group that got their requests granted was innately more talented or harder working than the group that didn't, think again. Promotions and pay raises are business decisions, not gifts. This means that even the strongest performers will hear "not now" if they ignore the situations that surround them. Here are five of the most common timing missteps I've seen, and what I wish more rising leaders would do differently. Someone gets promoted in January and, by April, they're asking for another raise. I once had a high performer who was promoted to senior manager after a solid year. Less than 90 days later, she sent me a proposal for another title change — accompanied by comp benchmarks and a list of expanded responsibilities. She was doing more, but she hadn't been in the role long enough to demonstrate success at that level, and she lacked the self-awareness that no one should ask for more every quarter. Understand your career path and the next opportunity for growth. Then, give the business time to see your impact before you ask to level up again. I've seen people use early 1:1s to talk about their career goals. before the manager even understands your role (and hers! ), it can create the perception that you're only thinking about yourself. It's like walking into a room you've never been in before and immediately asking to rearrange the furniture. Start by understanding how your new manager defines success and taking an interest in her priorities and challenges. Some of the hardest "no" answers I've had to give were to employees who were deserving but seemed oblivious to what was going on around them. Even if you think you've done everything right, asking for more when the broader context is shaky can hurt your chances. I've had employees come to me during expense freezes, department restructures, or right after we missed our numbers, sometimes with very strong cases for advancement. Make yourself even more valuable by showing that you can lead patiently through uncertainty. Be the person who brings stability when others are scrambling. Once the business starts to recover — and you've played a visible role in that — you'll be in a much stronger position to ask for more. This happens when someone moves too quickly after a mistake or learning opportunity. If you haven't closed the loop on feedback, asking for more shows a lack of accountability and self-awareness. I once had a direct report who delivered great work but struggled with cross-functional influence and managing senior leaders. He hadn't had time to show progress yet, and asking so soon after our conversation made it seem like he didn't understand the gravity of the feedback. Slow down, and shore up any doubts about your potential. When you hear feedback, don't just acknowledge it — change something. Then, when you make the ask, it will be even stronger because your coachability and growth will become part of the case for advancement. Every once in a while, someone has come to me unexpectedly and said, "I'm ready for the next level." If we hadn't been talking about growth, readiness, or performance over time, it could be challenging to make it happen quickly. Big asks shouldn't come out of nowhere. Depending on other career path timelines you've observed, your own performance, and the standard cycle of mid-year and year-end performance conversations, you might start talking about your career goals once you've been in your role for 6-12 months. Make career growth part of the regular conversation. Use 1:1s with your manager or HR to ask what overdelivering looks like. Get clarity on what's expected at the next level. That way, when you're ready to make a formal ask, your manager's already on the same page. It's usually after you've shown clear results, earned credibility, and positioned yourself inside the broader business picture. If you're preparing to make a case, put yourself in your manager's shoes, evaluate what's happening across the team or company, and ask yourself, "Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes'?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At long last, the white whale of iOS has been harpooned: Instagram finally made an app for iPad. Shockingly, there had never been a true iPad Instagram app — you could download the regular Instagram mobile app and use it on an iPad, but it was a uniquely crummy experience — you could use it with a phone-sized display or zoomed out, and the whole thing was clunky and sad. Finally, there's a new iPad version, nearly 15 years after Instagram first launched. (The iPad, also launched in 2010, just barely predates Instagram.) No more pretense that you might be hoping to see "photos" from your "friends" in the main feed. Instead, you'll see Stories at the top, should you choose to interact with those plebes you know in real life who cling to the sad concept of posting photos and videos from their real life to share with their close friends. This saves you the highly unpleasant experience of opening an app and having sound start playing right away, and it's also more intuitive to just slightly scroll down than to hunt and tap for a sound on/off icon. What does it mean that Instagram's iPad app is so Reels-centric? A more video-first approach makes sense with Reels and iPads. Since iPads are popular for watching video content — YouTube or Netflix — why not sit back and watch some Reels? Instagram's official blog post says: "With Instagram for iPad, we've redesigned the experience to reflect how people use bigger screens today — for lean back entertainment."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent. An internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated "hub" offices are hampering recruiting efforts. The hub strategy is listed as one of the "hotly debated topics" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire "high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider. Some Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely. One of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. Add Business Insider as a preferred source on Google to see more of us. In addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind. Oracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently. "We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations," the spokesperson said. Many firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. "We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time," the Amazon spokesperson said. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Seattle-based company is testing new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider. Quick Suite empowers "every business user to make better decisions, faster, and act on them swiftly by unifying Al agents for business insights, deep research, and automation into a single experience," according to one of the documents, marked confidential. Several companies have been given a private preview of the new technology, and Amazon recently sent out invitations for an internal beta test. Quick Suite positions AWS to compete more aggressively in AI with agent-driven automation. While the company is a pioneer in cloud computing, it's made less of a mark so far with software that runs on top of this infrastructure. "With over 40% of business users expected to adopt Al-enhanced work environments soon, AWS is positioned to lead this shift by providing integrated solutions that help organizations — including our own — effectively deploy and scale Al agents in the workplace," Amazon's beta test invitation states. Business Insider previously reported that Amazon was working on a unified "agentic" AI workspace, internally codenamed Q Business Suite, with "Quick" floated as a potential brand name. "We are seeing strong growth of Amazon Q Business with customers like Remitly, Nasdaq, and Smartsheet, along with partners like Zoom and Asana, adopting it to provide employees with generative AI assistance to transform how work gets done," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "Similarly, we are seeing customers like BMW and GoDaddy embrace Amazon QuickSight in order to make data-driven decisions quickly," the spokesperson added. Quick Suite will merge some of AWS's existing products, such as its data analysis platform QuickSight and its AI chatbot Q Business, while also adding a new product called Quick Flows, according to another of the documents. Quick Flows provides pre-built workflows that let customers automate tasks through natural language prompts, one of the documents explained. Quick Suite will include a "deep research agent" to generate reports from company and external data, and will also enable customers to create custom agents for "specific business functions or team needs," which can then be shared across their organization, one of the documents said. Quick Suite has received mixed feedback from beta users, according to one of the internal documents. Customers praised its simpler setup and more intuitive design compared to Q Business, as well as its "compelling" deep research feature for both internal and external use. The ability to connect with external tools, such as Atlassian's Jira, has also been well received. At the same time, some testers reported frustrations with networking limitations in virtual cloud environments and onerous permission requirements for linking data sources. Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, the document said. Quick Suite's launch represents a turning point in AWS's AI application strategy. Q Business had been intended as the company's flagship offering for business users, but AWS is now making Quick Suite a priority, as BI previously reported.</p>
