Letitia James seeks to reverse appeals court's decision to wipe away president's penalty in financial fraud case

New York's attorney general has requested the state's highest court reinstate Donald Trump's large civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion dollar penalty to nothing.

Attorney general Letitia James's office filed a notice of appeal with the state's court of appeals, seeking to reverse the mid-level appellate division's ruling last month that the penalty violated the US constitution's ban on excessive fines.

James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal.

Trump, the US president, declared “TOTAL VICTORY” after the appellate division wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.

Trump, a Republican, filed his own appeal last week, asking the court of appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, from holding corporate leadership positions in New York.

Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the appellate division judges said Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals.

James's appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida.

After a trial the judge, Arthur Engoron, ruled last year that James had proved Trump engaged in a years-long conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers.

Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m – payback of what the judge deemed “ill-gotten gains” from his puffed-up financial statements. That amount soared to more than $515m, including interest, by the time the appellate division ruled.

The five-judge appellate division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive”.

President Donald Trump is allegedly trying to push New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa out of the city's mayoral race in order to help Andrew Cuomo defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, according to The New York Times. 

The Times reports that Trump's advisers have discussed giving Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa positions in the president's administration in order “to give former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in November's general election.” 

Sliwa said in a statement that he had not been contacted by the Trump administration. A spokesperson for Adams, who was allegedly offered a position in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), told The Guardian that, “He has had no discussions with, nor has he met with, President Donald Trump regarding the mayoral race.”

Cuomo told reporters, “I don't want him [Trump] involved in anything with my race.”

In June, Queens Assemblymember Mamdani, a democratic socialist, trounced Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary, earning 56 percent of the ranked choice vote. Cuomo has not held elected office since he was forced to step down as New York governor in 2021 after several women accused him of sexual harassment. Last year, Cuomo joined the legal team for accused war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Despite Mamdani's decisive win in the June primary, Cuomo announced that he would stay in the race and run as an independent in November's general election. A Truthout investigation  published last month revealed that billionaires and their companies “have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates.”     

Mamdani is running on a platform that includes raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers, as well as a rent freeze, free city buses, and universal pre-K.

“Today, we have learned what New Yorkers have long suspected, that Andrew Cuomo is Donald Trump's choice to be the next mayor of this city,” Mamdani said at a press conference he called in response to the Times story. 

Mamdani noted the widespread suspicion that Trump's Department of Justice dropped corruption charges against Adams in exchange for his cooperation with the president's anti-immigrant agenda. Last year, Adams was charged with bribery and campaign finance violations. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years in prison. 

“We are talking about a mayor who was facing an indictment that was then dropped by this administration to ensure greater collaboration with the immigration directives of this administration now being considered for a job offer,” Mamdani said. 

“None of this has to do with New Yorkers,” he continued. “None of it has to do with the welfare of this city. It all has to do with power. It all has to do with the audacity that we have here to believe that we could pick our own mayor, that we have to believe that the most pressing issues are not how to ensure that Donald Trump continues to have an ambassador in City Hall, but that New Yorkers can actually afford the place that they call home.”

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who also ran for mayor and has been campaigning for Mamdani, posted the Times story and called the alleged collaboration between Adams, Trump, and Cuomo “bizarre.” 

“Donald Trump & Eric Adams' teams are reported to be conspiring in a bizarre, corrupt effort to elect Andrew Cuomo as mayor of NYC,” he wrote on X. “Seriously, that's what this story says. 62 days until we elect @ZohranKMamdani and put this absurd cabal behind us.”

            A federal appeals court has blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. A preliminary injunction is a temporary order put in place until a court can make a final decision in a case.
    


Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown



            “After careful consideration, we grant the defendants' motions and we stay the preliminary injunction and the underlying case itself pending appeal,” ruled the three appellate judges in the order.
    


            Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier called this a “victory against an activist judge” in a social media post.
    


            “The 11th Circuit not only blocked Judge (Kathleen) Williams' order to close Alligator Alcatraz, but they blocked her from proceeding with the case until the appeal is complete. A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!”
    


            CNN reached out to the Friends of the Everglades and other plaintiffs in the environmental lawsuit at the center of this appeal for comment. The organization says it is reviewing the order.
    


            It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July.
    


            Ever since then, the makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure.
    


            And the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – a Native American tribe whose reservation lies within miles of the facility – had raised concerns about the impact the facility will have on their land and the environmentally sensitive area, including the plants and animals that inhabit the Everglades.
    


            “The project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” US District Judge Kathleen Williams said in her order in late August.
    


            Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

“We have entered a stage of chronic trauma fatigue, where people live in a state of emotional numbness,” a doctor warns.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Recently, I was running down the street, carrying food for my friend in northern Gaza, with a tank speeding behind me like a predatory beast. The ground trembled under the weight of its treads, and my breath quickened in a race I could never win. My legs began to give out, the terror heavier than my ability to keep going. I felt myself surrendering to what I thought was my inevitable fate … until I woke up. 

It was 8:00 in the morning. My body was shaking, my heart racing. It had only been a nightmare — but a nightmare rooted in the reality of war, in the deep psychological harm that has marked us and continues to haunt us every day.

A door slamming shut is enough to make our bodies jolt involuntarily, convinced We're hearing an explosion. And every time we try to heal, we realize that this fear has been growing inside us during months of death under Israeli siege.

“The psychological situation today [in Gaza] is more complex and more dangerous than at the beginning of the war,” said Dr. Mohammad, a mental health specialist working at a counseling center in Deir al-Balah who asked to keep his last name private. He told me:

At first, the psychological reactions were acute but predictable — fear, panic, anxiety. Today, we have entered a stage of chronic trauma fatigue, where people live in a state of emotional numbness, loss of meaning, and internal fragmentation. People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it. There is no expression of emotion. People unconsciously use defense mechanisms such as repression and isolation. They speak and act as if death were just another story to tell.

In speaking with him, I realized I am not alone — all of us across Gaza are facing this trauma. He said the symptoms he sees repeatedly include nightmares, panic attacks, inability to concentrate, survivor's guilt, insomnia, disorientation, dissociative symptoms, denial, and unfocused anger. He has also observed a rise in self-harm attempts, especially among teenagers, alongside severe and almost constant depressive symptoms.

“People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it.”

Dr. Mohammad explained that the psychological toll varies across age groups. Children often show behavioral symptoms such as bedwetting, excessive clinginess to their mothers, sleep disturbances, stuttering, or aggression. Through their play, they may reenact scenes of bombardment. He has seen 5-year-olds speak of “martyrdom” and “occupation” as part of their daily awareness. Teenagers tend to either rebel or withdraw, often struggling with identity crises and profound hopelessness. Adults live with the constant push-and-pull of survival, guilt, and responsibility. The elderly may face trauma in silence, rarely seeking help despite their deep suffering.

“The collective trauma in Gaza is not a single moment, but a continuous accumulation over years,” Dr. Mohammad told me. “We are talking about a generation born and raised in an environment of fear, loss, and destruction. Everyone is affected to some degree. It is not an individual trauma, but a structural one that wounds the very social fabric and reshapes collective consciousness.”

Children — those who grew up under the sounds of missiles, loss, and hardship in an environment that denies them a healthy childhood — bear the heaviest scars. Among them is my 4-year-old cousin Jinan. When Israeli warplanes bombed their home, Jinan survived and was pulled from the rubble by civil defense workers, but her father, mother, and all her siblings were killed. Her life was turned upside down in a single moment. Today, when she cries, she tells her grandmother, “I want to go to the rubble of our house. I want to talk to Mama.”

I asked Dr. Mohammad about the long-term impact of the lack of consistent psychological support for these children. “The ongoing absence of mental health care puts them at risk of developing chronic disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, and even personality disorders in the future. It also affects their cognitive development, their ability to form healthy relationships, and their safe integration into society,” he said, adding that children are among the groups that feel most forgotten by the international community. The questions he hears them ask most often are: “Why is no one protecting us?” and “Why is the world silent?”

When I asked him how he personally copes, both as a psychologist and as a human being, with the sheer amount of pain he witnesses every day, he replied: “Honestly? Sometimes I don't cope. I allow myself to cry, to be tired, to feel hopeless. But what keeps me standing are the children who still smile despite everything, my colleagues who keep working despite their grief, and the people who continue to seek help. This shared resilience is my real therapy.”

On the possibility of healing under the current conditions, Dr. Mohammad said, “Hope exists, but it is fragile and conditional. You cannot speak of psychological recovery while war, killing, destruction, hunger, and both physical and spiritual bleeding continue. Some cases are simply beyond our capacity right now — children who have lost their entire families, people who witnessed massacres firsthand without access to a safe environment or consistent support. Those with prior mental health histories have also seen their conditions worsen dramatically.”

“Do not let the next generations grow up from the ashes of war without healing.”

He stressed that the psychological and human dimension of Gaza is largely absent from international reports, which tend to focus on numbers and material losses. “The human spirit cannot easily be translated into metrics — yet it is the core,” he told me. “Covering trauma requires time, effort, and a high level of professionalism, which fast-paced media coverage often lacks.”

Currently only a handful of mental health counseling centers operate within Gaza, and facilities like Dr. Mohammad's remain limited in number and capacity. When asked about the urgent needs for mental health support in Gaza, he said, “We need flexible, community-based emergency interventions; trained staff; medications; psychosocial support tools; safe spaces for children; and group therapy programs. We also need long-term plans that go beyond ‘temporary relief' and build a vision for community recovery.”

Dr. Mohammad ended our conversation with a message to the international community and global mental health organizations: “You are required now to do more than condemn. Gaza is not only a humanitarian issue — it is a moral, psychological, and cultural one. We ask for real support, urgent trauma response, and genuine investment in building a sustainable mental health system. Do not let the next generations grow up from the ashes of war without healing.”

A Russian missile struck a Danish humanitarian demining group in Chernihiv Oblast on Sept. 4, killing two and injuring eight people, the Danish Refugee Council reported.

"It is with profound sadness that the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) confirms that one of our humanitarian demining sites in Ukraine was struck by a missile earlier today. The attack claimed the lives of two Ukrainian colleagues and left eight others injured," the Danish Refugee Council wrote on Facebook.

The nonprofit called the strike a serious violation of the international humanitarian law.

"At the time of the incident, DRC teams were conducting purely civilian humanitarian activities—working to clear landmines and explosive remnants of war in order to protect communities and enable safe access to essential infrastructure, farmland, and homes," the organization wrote.

Ukraine's northern Chernihiv Oblast borders both Russia and Belarus. Part of the region was occupied by Russian forces at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since its liberation in April 2022, Chernihiv Oblast has faced frequent attacks due to its proximity to Russia.

The strike took place in the Kyselivska community, according to Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast.

"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now, they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Chaus wrote on Telegram.

"Another act of senseless terror from the Russian Federation — an attack on those who help eliminate the consequences of the war," he added in another post.

The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, condemned the attack, saying that Russia is once again violating fundamental norms of international law.

"This is yet another cynical crime. Attacking people who are doing humanitarian work means deliberately undermining humanitarian activities. The world should react to this," he said.

As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spanned an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts.

The Danish Refugee Council said it "remains committed to its mission of protecting people affected by conflict and displacement in Ukraine."

"Despite the risks and challenges, our demining teams undertake this vital work to prevent further loss of life from landmines and unexploded ordnance," the nonprofit wrote.

"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the families, friends, and colleagues of those we lost today."

She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs.
Yuliia holds B.A. degree in English language and literature from Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University, she studied in Germany and Lithuania.

A Ukrainian citizen was among those killed in a funicular accident in Lisbon, Portugal, on Sept. 3, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to Hromadske.

"Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit.





"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast, wrote.

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

            Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced his resignation Thursday as the university faces an ongoing funding freeze by the Trump administration.
    


            His departure is the latest in a string of university leaders' resignations, following tenures marked by criticism and battles with the federal government.
    


            “As I reflect on the progress we have made and what lies ahead, I believe now is the right time for new leadership to guide Northwestern into its next chapter,” Schill said in a message to the campus community.



            “Therefore, I have decided, in consultation with the leadership of the Board of Trustees, that I will step down as President.”
    


            In his message, Schill wrote the university faced “serious and often painful challenges” since his tenure began in September 2022, and “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.”
    


            The university noted those challenges include the federal funding freeze, which began about four months ago when the Trump administration froze $790 million in federal funding.
    


            The freeze added to similar actions the administration has taken against other elite universities, either demanding changes to their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or in connection with their handling of protests against the war in Gaza.
    


            At the time, a White House official told CNN the freeze was connected to several Title VI investigations. The federal statute prohibits discrimination in programs and activities that receive federal funding.

            But the university said it had “fully cooperated with investigations by both the Department of Education and Congress.”
    


            White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Thursday, “The Trump Administration looks forward to working with the new leadership, and we hope they seize this opportunity to Make Northwestern Great Again.”
    


            House Republican Leadership Chairwoman Elise Stefanik said Schill's resignation was “long overdue.”
    


            “President Michael Schill finally resigned today after he failed (to) protect Jewish students, caved to the demands of the antisemitic, pro-Hamas mob on Northwestern's campus, and failed to hold students who perpetuate antisemitic attacks accountable at an Education and the Workforce Committee hearing,” she said in a post on X.
    


            The university said it has updated its policies to curb antisemitism on its campuses, resulting in a “dramatic decrease” in reported incidents, according to a news release Thursday.
    


            The revocation of funding has left universities desperate to keep much-needed funding.  It has also prompted lengthy legal battles between the Trump administration and universities, and led several university leaders to step down, including at the University of Virginia and Columbia University.
    


            Schill's resignation comes a day after a federal judge gave Harvard University a landmark victory in its fight against the Trump administration, siding with the Ivy League school in its effort to restore more than $2 billion in federal funding for research frozen by the White House.
    


            Northwestern had said the federal funds were used for “innovative and life-saving research,” including the development of the world's smallest pacemaker and research to fight against Alzheimer's disease.



            “This type of research is now at jeopardy,” the university said in an April statement.
    


            Schill had been leading “efforts to ensure the continuation of funding for critical research” during the funding freeze, the university said, and he will continue to work with its Board of Trustees to get them restored.
    


            “It is critical that we continue to protect the university's research mission and excellence while preserving academic freedom, integrity, and independence,” Schill said.
    


            An interim president for Northwestern has yet to be named and Schill will continue in his role until then, the university said. Following a sabbatical, Schill plans to return as a faculty member at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.

            Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced his resignation Thursday as the university faces an ongoing funding freeze by the Trump administration.
    


            His departure is the latest in a string of university leaders' resignations, following tenures marked by criticism and battles with the federal government.
    


            “As I reflect on the progress we have made and what lies ahead, I believe now is the right time for new leadership to guide Northwestern into its next chapter,” Schill said in a message to the campus community.



            “Therefore, I have decided, in consultation with the leadership of the Board of Trustees, that I will step down as President.”
    


            In his message, Schill wrote the university faced “serious and often painful challenges” since his tenure began in September 2022, and “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.”
    


            The university noted those challenges include the federal funding freeze, which began about four months ago when the Trump administration froze $790 million in federal funding.
    


            The freeze added to similar actions the administration has taken against other elite universities, either demanding changes to their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or in connection with their handling of protests against the war in Gaza.

            In the wake of the Minneapolis Catholic church shooting, senior Justice Department officials are weighing proposals to limit transgender people's right to possess firearms, according to two officials familiar with the internal discussions.
    


            The talks, described as preliminary in nature, appear to build on an idea that has gained some currency in conservative media since the Minneapolis shooting that killed two children and injured 21, most of them children, at Annunciation Catholic Church, an attack that police say was carried out by a 23-year-old transgender woman.
    


            Such a move would represent a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration's fight against the rights of transgender Americans.
    


            President Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders on the topic, including one barring transgender people from serving in the military and another ordering federal prisons to move transgender inmates to facilities corresponding to their gender assigned at birth.
    


            In addition, the idea of restricting gun rights has long been a red line for conservatives, with many Republican lawmakers and gun rights groups opposing red flag laws and or other policies aimed at keeping guns away from people suffering from mental health issues.
    


            But Justice Department leadership is seriously considering whether it can use its rulemaking authority to follow on to Trump's determination to bar military service by transgender people and declare that people who are transgender are mentally ill and can lose their Second Amendment rights to possess firearms, according to one Justice official.
    


            Another senior Justice Department official cautioned that any such proposal, should it gain steam, would likely run into legal complications. Millions of Americans have mental health issues and many take medications, but are not a danger to society and therefore cannot have their rights infringed upon.



            Federal law requires that a judge declare a person to be mentally “defective” before being stripped of their right to own firearms.
    


            A spokesperson for the advocacy group GLAAD said the DOJ is using the transgender community as a scapegoat.
    


            “Instead of actual solutions, the administration is again choosing to scapegoat and target a small and vulnerable population,” the GLAAD spokesperson said, noting that transgender people are less than 2% of the US population but four times as likely to be victims of crime. “Everyone deserves to be themselves, be safe, and be free from violence and discrimination.”
    


            The vast majority of mass attacks in the US have no connection to transgender people. Still, after the deadly shooting last week, some conservative allies of the president quickly claimed that gender dysphoria – the psychological distress and discomfort some people feel when there's a difference between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity – is a mental illness that should bar citizens from purchasing a firearm.
    


            The goal of the potential ban, according to the Justice official, is “to ensure that mentally ill individuals suffering from gender dysphoria are unable to obtain firearms while they are unstable and unwell.”
    


            Because gender dysphoria is included in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, also called the DSM, it is diagnosed as a mental disorder. (The DSM is the handbook used by health care professionals as the authoritative guide in diagnosing mental disorders.)
    


            But the gender incongruence – having a gender identity that's not the one assigned at birth – isn't what makes gender dysphoria a mental disorder. Having clinically significant dysphoria around the incongruence is what makes it a disorder.
    


            The Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi has launched a broad effort to target gender-affirming care across the country, including sending more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics who have provided transgender medical procedures to minors earlier this summer.
    


            One of those subpoenas, made public through court proceedings, demanded that the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia turn over swaths of sensitive information about its treatments, including patient data like birthdays, social security numbers and addresses.
    


            Bondi has previously advocated for some gun restricting laws. As Florida attorney general, she defended a state law that raised the age requirements for gun purchases in the wake of the Parkland school shooting in 2018.
    


            She also worked on the policy to ban the use of bump stocks – which allow a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute – during the first Trump administration. The US Supreme Court has since overturned the bump stock ban and Florida lawmakers are pushing to lower the age restriction on gun purchases.

Currently, all states require schoolchildren to receive vaccines against polio, measles, and other diseases.

This week, Florida's surgeon general announced that the state will drop all vaccine requirements, a catastrophic decision that could help usher in epidemics of diseases, like polio, that have been virtually eradicated by vaccines.

Currently, all states, including Florida, require children who attend public school to receive vaccines against measles, rubella, polio, whooping cough, and other diseases. 

“People have a right to make their own decisions,” Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, said on Wednesday. Ladapo is a virulent opponent of reproductive rights. Earlier this year, he threatened to file criminal charges against television stations if they ran an ad about abortion rights.

“Who am I, as a government or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body?” he continued. “Our body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”

Ladapo did not say when the requirement will be repealed. 

“I love our lawmakers. They're going to have to make decisions,” he said. “People are going to have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that the moral side is so simple.”

Critics charge that Ladapo's position is anything but moral. Dropping vaccine requirements may cause deadly outbreaks of diseases that are entirely preventable, like measles and polio. According to a 2024 study published in The Lancet, vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives since 1974, 95 percent of whom were children younger than five. Researchers found that in 2024, a child younger than 10 is 40 percent more likely to survive to their next birthday relative to a hypothetical scenario of no vaccination. 

Florida Democratic lawmakers condemned the plan. 

“Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child,” Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman said in a statement. “Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs.”

Public health experts also warned of the plan's potentially deadly consequences. 

“The AMA [American Medical Association] strongly opposes Florida's plan to end all vaccine mandates, including those required for school attendance… and urge[s] Florida to reconsider,” the group said in a statement. “This unprecedented rollback would undermine decades of public health progress and place children and communities at increased risk.”

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told The Guardian, “Florida's undertakers will now need to plan for the future by increasing their stocks of small coffins.”

Anti-vaccine activists have long been a loud and destructive minority, but under Trump, their lies have reached an unprecedented level of influence on public policy. Trump nominated, and Congress confirmed, prominent anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

Prior to Kennedy's confirmation, the Union of Concerned Scientists urged Congress to reject him, calling him a “dangerous and irresponsible pick for the federal agency charged with protecting the health of the American people,” and noting that he was “an environmental lawyer with no training in medicine or public health.”

Just a few months into his tenure, Kennedy has already sabotaged the availability and development of vaccines, and undermined the public's confidence in them. In June, he removed all members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory panel. He chose eight replacements, several of whom have spread misinformation about vaccines. 

Today, Kennedy is testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on the recent firing of CDC director, Susan Monarez, which prompted three agency officials to resign in protest. Monarez wrote in an OpEd published in The Wall Street Journal, that she was told to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed anti-vaccine rhetoric.”

In his opening remarks, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) urged Kennedy to resign, saying that Trump should fire him if he refuses.

Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a lawmaker who monitors human rights abuses abroad, said that the off-the-cuff exchange—and the casual way organ transplants came up—was unsettling.

“It shows how cruelty knows no bounds,” Smith told The Epoch Times.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, while walking together before a military parade on Sept. 3, discussed becoming younger with continued organ transplants. Xi suggested the possibility of living to 150 years old in this century.

The conversation signals a seeming abundance of organs for China's top political echelon, known for extravagant privileges inaccessible to the Chinese public. How and where to source the organs seemed an afterthought.

That Beijing has no desire for the publicity of the conversation was clear. Chinese media outlets have taken down videos containing the clip or covered the sound with music in replays.

But Putin confirmed the talk quickly later in the day.

“The modern means of health support, medicine, even some surgeries involving organ transplantation, allow humanity to hope that the active life span will not be like today,” he told reporters, adding that “it differs from country to country.”

What came across in these remarks seems to be, “I don't care,” according to Smith.

“My own argument has been that from Xi Jinping on down, anybody in the higher echelon, especially in the Chinese Communist Party, will look to steal somebody else's internal organs, through coercion, through death, to extend their life. I can't think of a more selfish and barbaric act to do that,” Smith said.

“They're so brazen about abusing other people for their own will and for their own longevity. ... They have secret police and the ability to jail anybody they want.”

Putin, the congressman said, “may or may not be in ill health, so he'll want to have any new organ that he thinks he requires.”

The organ transplant industry has since experienced a boom, paralleling the persecution of Falun Gong that began in 1999. Hospitals in China have advertised waiting times as short as days, a major draw for tourists from countries such as the United States with developed organ donation systems, where getting an organ could take much longer.

“[In China,] they go and they kill somebody who matches up with your antigens and everything else, so that there's no or less likely to be a rejection of the organ,” Smith said. “I've never seen anything like it, except in Nazi Germany, and I think that's what we're talking about here—it's Nazi like.”

The “most perverse thing,” he said, is that the persecutors will turn to the persecuted to help extend their lives. And Falun Gong practitioners' healthy lifestyle—meditating, not smoking or drinking, and adhering to their practice's moral tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance—makes them an ideal target for organ procurement.

“It's a genocide against the Falun Gong, like it's a genocide against the Uyghurs,” he said. “There are so many horrible human rights abuses in the world today. This is right at the top.”

In China, doctors could become an “oppressor,” stealing one's organs under state order, he said.

Smith, likewise, called for the Senate to “act fast” and move the bill up.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is facing a gas shortage, The Moscow Times reported on Sept. 4.

The statement comes after a months-long Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in an attempt to put economic pressure on Russia and undermine its ability to finance its war against Ukraine. 

Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sept. 4, Putin said that signs of gas shortages are already visible in the Russian Far East. He said that supplying new enterprises can be challenging, and demand for gas is expected to rise significantly in the Far Eastern Federal District in the coming years.

He didn't mention the reasons behind a potential shortage. 

Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.

According to the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Kremlin has 63.4 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves, enough for 100 years of production. In 2020, the Accounts Chamber of Russia estimated that the country's reserves made up 20% of the world's total but warned that they would only last 50 years.

Ukraine has targeted dozens of refineries, oil depots, and military-industrial sites with long-range drones since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 to disrupt Moscow's war effort. 

Kyiv has increased the attacks recently ahead of potential peace talks following U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15 and with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington on Aug. 18.

The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

One sheriff calls surprise use of deputy email list offering $50,000 hiring bonus ‘unprofessional and unethical'

The White House's aggressive push to hire federal immigration agents is causing friction with local sheriffs – even those who back Donald Trump's deportation agenda.

More than a dozen US sheriffs and law enforcement associations have complained that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tried to poach local deputies and officers as Ice rapidly expands.

“It is unprofessional and unethical,” Grady Judd, the sheriff in Polk county, Florida, told the Guardian last month after his deputies received recruitment emails from Ice.

Ice utilized an email list the sheriff had provided as part of his partnership supporting Trump's deportations; the messages noted recruits could receive a $50,000 hiring bonus.

“It's tantamount to us going to police departments and putting up a recruiting booth in their lobby,” said Judd, a Republican who has authorized his deputies to carry out immigration arrests.

Judd and other sheriffs have spoken out as the Trump administration has launched its massive recruitment effort to hire 10,000 new Ice officers and 3,000 border patrol agents, backed by an unprecedented $170bn in funding for immigration enforcement activities.

The anger from conservative sheriffs, generally Trump's close allies, underscores the challenges the White House is facing as it makes deportations and the expansion of Ice a top priority, sometimes at the expense of other law enforcement interests.

Federal agents who would normally handle child abuse, money laundering, fraud and other serious crimes have been diverted to immigration enforcement, targeting undocumented people with civil violations, Reuters reported in March.

Last month, the administration moved to temporarily reassign more than 100 FBI agents to conduct nighttime patrols in Washington DC, even though FBI officers generally have little experience or training in patrolling or immigration.

The backlash from Judd and other sheriffs in Florida was notable as the state has led the nation in 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement departments to directly assist Ice. Immigrant rights' groups have long criticized those partnerships as harmful to public safety, as they make immigrant communities less likely to report crimes or assist police in investigations.

Some of the most vocally Trump-supporting sheriffs have criticized Ice's recruitment. Wayne Ivey, the sheriff in Brevard county, Florida – who made headlines in June for threatening to hospitalize and “kill” anti-Ice protesters – told WESH 2 News last month that Ice's targeting of local deputies was “backhanded” and “frustrated every sheriff”.

Judd said his department was paying for deputies to be trained as immigration officers, allowing them to arrest and jail undocumented people for Ice. That arrangement gave Ice access to his deputies' contact information.

“You took government documents that we filled out to help you, to recruit our people that we trained on our dime to support you. That's low-rent,” he said. “I've never seen that before.”

Recruitment emails to sheriff's deputies were signed by Madison Sheahan, Ice's deputy director, who previously served as an aide to Kristi Noem, homeland security secretary, when Noem was South Dakota governor, ABC News reported. Sheahan, 28, has no prior immigration enforcement experience and has alienated career officials within Ice, according to a recent Atlantic story delving into internal conflicts at the agency.

“As someone who is currently supporting Ice through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law,” Sheahan's recruitment email said. “Ice is actively recruiting officers like you.”

Judd said Ice representatives in Florida weren't involved in the recruitment and had apologized. He blamed Sheahan, saying she and her DC colleagues did not acknowledge the misstep: “They doubled down. They didn't apologize. They didn't say it was bad form. That made me even more angry. It just shows her lack of maturity,” he said. “The illustration to me is they're probably sneaky and underhanded and not professional with the way they run the rest of the organization.”

Still, Judd said, “We're not going to back down on President Trump's mission. We'll continue to help Ice, because we are professional, unlike the Ice deputy.”

In the first five months of the year, Judd's office detained more than 200 undocumented people for Ice in the county's jails, according to the Ledger newspaper.

The National Sheriffs' Association, which represents sheriffs across the country, also raised concerns about Ice recruitment. The association's executive director said last month it would be hard for local departments to compete with the $50,000 bonus and other incentives, which could burden agencies already struggling with staffing.

Judd, however, said he wasn't concerned about his deputies joining Ice. He said he suspected ongoing anti-Ice protests were hampering recruitment: “It's a very difficult and dangerous job … and you've got to be comfortable and sure that the community supports you. When people see the way that Ice is being unfairly targeted, even if they want to be in law enforcement, they don't want to be in that branch.”

Scott Shuchart, a former senior Ice official under Biden, who has raised concerns about Trump recruitment spree, said it seemed “really disrespectful” to poach from sheriffs who have invested their own funding to support Ice through 287(g) agreements: “They're already taking sheriff's deputies who are supposed to be keeping the community safe and instead are helping out Ice. To now do the double whammy of stealing those resources to be fully Ice's seems like no way to treat a partner.”

On Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security announced a program to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for the salaries of trained 287(g) officers and said departments would be “eligible for monetary performance awards based on the successful location of illegal aliens”.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement that Ice was recruiting “local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience”. More than $500m from Trump's major budget bill would go toward expanding 287(g) partnerships, she added.

McLaughlin also said Sheahan, the Ice deputy director, had law enforcement experience from her previous job as secretary of the Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries, and had been “instrumental in leading negotiations” for more than 900 287(g) agreements: “These attacks on Madison Sheahan's leadership style have no basis in reality and are rooted in sexism. [She] is a work horse, strong executor, and accountable leader who along with [acting Ice director] Todd Lyons is leading the men and women of Ice law enforcement to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens.”

The effort to recruit sheriffs “shows how both cruel and reckless this administration is when it comes to law enforcement”, added Juan Cuba, executive director of Sheriff Accountability Action, a group that advocates for criminal justice reforms.

“It's a complete disregard for one of the biggest issues local law enforcement has, which is recruitment and retention. Those challenges are exacerbated by the administration's approach, but they don't care. What they care about is hitting these artificial quotas,” he said, noting Trump's demands for 3,000 immigration arrests a day. “It's less about public safety and more about just feeding this mass deportation machine.”

Some sheriffs do oppose efforts to have their deputies act as immigration officers, because they already feel stretched thin or are concerned about eroding public trust, Cuba noted. But publicly objecting can carry consequences, he said, noting that after Broward county's sheriff said he didn't want deputies arresting people for civil immigration violations, Florida's attorney general threatened to take steps to have him removed from office.

“We see silence from police chiefs and sheriffs because of political threats,” he said. “It is very alarming that public officials feel like they can't raise concerns.”

Former Senate leader likens administration's fixation with tariffs to isolationist policies of the US in the 1930s

US politics live – latest updates

The world during Donald Trump's second presidency has entered a period of danger with “certain similarities to the 30s”, according to Mitch McConnell, the veteran Republican former Senate leader.

McConnell made the comments primarily in reference to tariffs and foreign affairs, in a wide-ranging interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader published on Wednesday as he prepares to enter his final year in office.

Calling it “the most dangerous period since before world war two”, McConnell was openly critical of the Trump administration's fixation with trade tariffs, which he likened to the isolationist policies of the US in the 1930s that historians say hastened a global depression that paved the path to conflict.

But while decrying the lack of US preparedness to confront authoritarian regimes abroad, the 83-year-old McConnell – a senator since 1985 and leader of Republicans in the chamber for a record 18 years until he stood down earlier this year, then announced his upcoming retirement – did not discuss the Trump administration's own moves towards authoritarianism.

He also glossed over his own responsibility for handing Trump so much power. As majority leader, McConnell maneuvered to deny Barack Obama a rightful supreme court pick, and rushed to give Trump another in the final weeks of his first term in 2020. It made McConnell the architect of the current ultraconservative 6-3 majority on a panel that critics say has been overly loyal to Trump, not least last year's astonishing ruling giving him immunity for criminal acts.

In the interview, McConnell said he had been focusing on “defense and foreign policy” in the months since returning to the Senate's back benches, and had become worried about the direction he believed Trump's “make America great again” (Maga) trade policies were leading the world.

“I think this is the most dangerous period since before world war two. There's certain similarities right now to the 30s,” he said.

“[Then president] Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill in 1930, widely believed by historians and economists to have taken the depression worldwide. Those who were totally anxious to stay out of all of what was going on in Europe were called ‘America First'. Sound familiar?

“So what do we have today? North Korea, China, Russia, Iran and Iran's proxies. They're very different kinds of countries, but they have one thing in common: They hate us.”

The interview was conducted before this week's gathering in Beijing of world leaders largely hostile to the US, a meeting of authoritarians including Russia's Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong-un that some analysts see as an unprecedented redrawing of the global balance of power.

McConnell, however, believes the US should already have been readying itself to meet the challenges posed by the rise of autocrats in other nations, but had not done so. He cited, indirectly, Trump's failure to handle effectively Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war, now well into its fourth year, on Nato's border.

“When you talk about preparedness, we're not prepared like we should be,” he said.

“With regard to Ukraine, what we need to do is avoid the headline at the end of the war, ‘Russia wins, America loses.' It has huge worldwide implications.”

But he said he also saw financial benefits for the US in committing more than $130bn in support for Ukraine's military defense and humanitarian aid, while Trump has flip-flopped on the issue.

“For those who are concerned about the money, I think it's important to remember that about half of the money was spent in this country, including in Kentucky, [with] 38 states modernizing our own industrial bases,” McConnell said.

“We've sent older weapons to Ukraine.”

After leaving office in 2021, Trump told a donors' conference that McConnell was “a dumb son of a bitch”, and had previously nicknamed him “Old Crow”. In the Herald-Leader interview, McConnell rejected the opportunity to fire back.

“My own view about the leader job, whether you're the president or the leader of one of the parties, is the Ronald Reagan quote that I thought made the most sense. He had what he called the 11th commandment: ‘Do not speak ill of another Republican,'” he said.

Yet McConnell did appear sensitive to a suggestion he was standing down because he had grown unpopular in Kentucky, amplified by the hostility of Nate Morris, the Republican businessman and Trump ultra-loyalist tipped to succeed him as senator. “I'm a Trump guy, not a McConnell boy,” Morris has said.

McConnell said his record spoke for him. “These suggestions about who's popular and who isn't irritate the hell out of me, because when you get into the leadership position, you get beat up,” he said.

“How do you judge popularity? Seven victories in Kentucky, nine victories in the [Senate Republican] conference.”

Asked what he thought his legacy would be, McConnell said he was most proud of the 2004 Kentucky tobacco buyout, which paid the state's farmers to abandon their crops. “At the federal level it would be the courts,” he added.

He declined an invitation to say whether he thought the US was in a better position now than before the Trump era. “I'm not sure enough time has passed to start evaluating who made a difference and who didn't,” he said.

But he added he had “thought a good bit” about whether people would think he had. “I would like everybody to be able to say, you know, I actually had an impact in a positive way on the country.”

Italian man fell down vertical shaft in ice after body of another missing recovered near glacier on Monday

A researcher from Italy is missing after falling into a stream on Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier – after the body of another man, a hiker from Arizona, was found earlier this week off a trail near the glacier, authorities said.

According to the state department of public safety, Alaska wildlife troopers received a report on Tuesday that a man had gone missing after falling into a stream on the glacier and being pushed by the water into a small, vertical shaft in the ice known as a moulin. The man, whose name was not immediately released, was with two other people when he fell. He was conducting research on the glacier at the time, a department spokesperson, Tess Williams, said by email on Wednesday.

A local ice rescue team responded but found the roughly 2ft (0.6-meter) wide hole was filled with rushing water and determined that efforts to find the man would be too dangerous, the department of public safety said.

The glacier – part of the vast Juneau Icefield – is a popular destination for residents and cruise ship passengers, though many tourists view it from across Mendenhall Lake, within a more developed area of the Mendenhall Glacier recreation area that includes a visitor center. The glacier is about 13 miles from downtown Juneau.

Also this week, on Monday, searchers using cellphone location data found the body of Thomas Casey, 69, off a trail near the glacier, according to the department. Casey had last been seen on Saturday morning and was believed to have died from injuries from a fall. Juneau police had said that Casey was in the city for the summer.

In July, a Kentucky woman visiting Juneau on a cruise ship was found dead on the mountains near downtown after she failed to return from a hike.

Report links Arizona-Sonora smuggling to rising homicide and overdose deaths in both countries

A new “golden triangle” of fentanyl and gun trafficking between Mexico and the US ties together the homicide and overdose crises of the two countries, according to a a new study.

The triangle spans Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora – the three states where almost all fentanyl seizures in Mexico take place – and connects to Arizona through a quieter part of the US-Mexico border that has become a hotspot for trafficking in both directions.

The rise of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has swept away the old golden triangle of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua, which for decades was the epicentre of heroin production in Mexico.

Data from Mexico's defence ministry spanning 1990 to 2024 show that 92% of seized fentanyl powder was in Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora, while the figure for fentanyl tablets was 96%.

This overwhelming concentration of seizures could reflect the Sinaloa cartel's dominance of fentanyl production and trafficking, thanks to access to chemical precursors through Pacific ports, economic integration across the border and “decades of experience”, said the new report by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime thinktank.

But it could also reflect the focus of law enforcement efforts, with the Sinaloa cartel in the crosshairs of both US and Mexican authorities.

There is a similar skew in seizures on the border itself, where according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, roughly half of the fentanyl seized entering the US is caught coming through ports of entry in Arizona, and much of the rest comes through California.

In the other direction, Arizona's role in gun trafficking has also soared in recent years, as was highlighted by the Mexican government's lawsuit against five gun shops there.

Between 1 January and 24 July last year, Arizona was the source of 57% of guns that were recovered in Mexico and traced to a purchase in the US less than a year earlier, which is a key indicator of whether a firearm was bought with the intent of trafficking.

The prominence of the Arizona-Sonora border in both fentanyl and gun trafficking “underscores the linkages between the two markets”, said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, lead author of the report.

It also links the epidemics of homicide and overdose deaths in two countries, through a vicious cycle in which revenues from drug sales in the US allow criminal groups to boost their firepower in Mexico.

Mexico's annual homicide rate is among the highest in the world, at 24 per 100,000. Roughly 70% of homicides in Mexico are perpetrated with a firearm – and more than two-thirds of firearms recovered from crime scenes and submitted to tracing were sourced from the US.

But in the US, the annual overdose death rate is similarly high, at 21.5 per 100,000 people. And the majority of overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl.

Some states, like West Virginia, have overdose deaths rates on a level with the homicide rates of the most violent states in Mexico.

“Narratives that [place] casualties and costs of the war on drugs predominantly in the Global South are inaccurate in the context of synthetic opioids and, in particular, fentanyl,” wrote the authors. “The result is a region, not just one country, with high levels of excess mortality.”

Mexico has been under intense pressure to show that it is tackling fentanyl trafficking, with the Trump administration designating six Mexican organised crime groups – including the Sinaloa cartel – as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs).

One thing the FTO designation could be used for is to prosecute individuals involved in firearms trafficking who demonstrably provide “material support” to such groups in Mexico.

But for now, despite a recent fall in seizures of fentanyl on the
 border that both governments have celebrated as a sign their interventions are working, the situation in the US remains unchanged.

“There's no shortage or price changes reported [in the US],” said Farfán-Méndez. “And that suggests we don't have any less fentanyl.”

A thousand years ago, a play of mine – a comedy – was being produced in a small university town in Illinois. We were working on a short scene where a long estranged Indigenous father is talking with his daughter about how the rules of family can sometimes not have happy endings. 

“I understand. It's not like the way it is in the movies, is it?” the daughter asks. 

“No,” he replies, “Graham Greene isn't here.”

As we worked on the scene, I heard the dramaturge say quietly to the director regarding the line, “What is it with Canadian Indigenous people and that British novelist?!”

Yes, there was a time not that long ago when Graham Greene wasn't as well-known as he is today. These days, in many corners of the world, he's much more familiar than that British guy who wrote Our Man in Havana and The Quiet American.

An Oneida of the Six Nations Reserve in Southern Ontario, Greene was an actor who spanned many mediums and genres of the storytelling venues. He was a movie star, a television performer and an accomplished theatre artist. Before all that, he sampled the world as a welder, draftsman, steelworker and an audio technician before being urged to try acting and finding his true home.

My life and his intertwined many times in the previous century. For a period in the 1980s, he was the executive director of the Association for the Native Development of the Performing and Visual Arts, a Toronto-based Indigenous arts support service. On occasion I would find myself sleeping on their boardroom floor when I was between apartments. 

Actor Graham Greene dead at 73

Another time I went out for a beer with him, and we found ourselves at a bar, sitting with the remaining original members of the Byrds, who were performing in a concert hall nearby. That could only happen with Greene. He could talk to a garden full of marble statues and get stories out of them. 

Another time, I was the writer-in-residence for a theatre company named Native Earth Performing Arts, I was attending the rehearsal of a little play called Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing written by Tomson Highway. It was there I saw Greene in his full glory, strutting the stage as Pierre St. Pierre, a role that many would argue put Greene on the map. 

He was also a mainstay on television, in shows such as Reservation Dogs, on which he played Maximus.Shane Brown/The Associated Press

The play is seldom produced these days for several reasons, but his portrayal of that lovable drunk and hockey referee told me what a true actor can achieve. He would disappear into the character, creating unique elements that helped construct the persona he morphed into.

And if I remember correctly, many of the actors had to take a few hours off rehearsal one afternoon, as there was a major film company in town holding auditions for a movie. It was some Kevin Costner film. A Western called Dances with Wolves. The rest, as they say, is history. 

With Greene's portrayal of Kicking Bird, and the subsequent Oscar nomination, his life changed. 

But Greene never gave up theatre, working in such groundbreaking Canadian plays as The Crackwalker and The History of the Village of the Small Huts. More recently, he strode the stage at Stratford, where he lived for the last few decades of his life. There, he is remembered for his outstanding performances in Of Mice and Men, and of course as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. 

But perhaps it was his work in film that cemented his popularity in the consciousness of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Movies including Clearcut, Twilight, Maverick, The Green Mile, Pow Wow Highway and Thunderheart showed fans the diversity and complexity of Greene's acting, and of Indigenous characters in general. All of this at a time when Indigenous people were not commonly seen on the big screen.

For the most part, westerns, the main films that depicted Indigenous characters, were dead and sometimes it seemed there were no Indigenous people in the modern world. Many credit Greene with opening doors for other Indigenous actors, writers and directors, showing them how to storm the world of settler cinema.

It's important to note it wasn't just Indigenous-themed movies that he excelled in. For many Indigenous actors, it's frequently a great delight to play non-Indigenous actors. Greene was no different. In fact, it could be said a good portion of society would more than likely recognize him from many of his more mainstream appearances, such as Die Hard with a Vengeance and Transamerica.

He was also a mainstay on television, playing such a broad spectrum of characters, in shows such as The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon, Northern Exposure, The Red Green Show, Longmire, The Last of Us and Reservation Dogs. In fact, I believe I first met him on the set of a 13-part children's series that was shot three hours north of Thunder Bay, called Spirit Bay. It was 1985, and I was a young production assistant immediately captivated by his amazing and constant sense of humour. 

An absurd joke of his or a simple wry comment was better than a strong cup of coffee to start the day. 

Once I ran into him in Toronto as we were walking into Harbourfront. Very casually, he reached into his pocket and pulled out three colourful marbles that he rolled around in his hand. Very dryly, he said, “Contrary to popular rumour, I still have them.” It took me a moment for it to sink in, then I laughed.

In 1991, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing was being remounted at the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and I flew out to see it. Greene was recreating his role of Pierre St. Pierre. I was backstage before the show, congratulating everyone when I heard Greene's voice calling out to me. I turned to see him in full costume, including a furry hat with ear flaps. “Drew! Drew! What do you think?” 

With that, he produced a look of shock and dismay, at the same time pulling a string in his pocket making the ears of the hat pop up like a curious dog. It was pure Graham. 

Whether the joke was cheap or sophisticated, Greene didn't care. It was the destination, not the journey.

Tom King, the renowned author and friend of Greene, perhaps put it best: “We were in Calgary filming Medicine River. There was a guy who had come from Toronto to interview Graham about the movie. He caught Graham after a long hard day of filming and began asking him a bunch of inane questions. Towards the end, he asked Graham what was his most embarrassing moment and Graham smiled and said it was talking to him. He didn't suffer fools. He ate them.”

An icon has passed. I know that's said frequently about a lot of people who have moved on but to us who have circled in his orbit, it's true. To many, he was the consummate actor. The good friend. The passable golfer. The owner (with his partner Hilary) of many cats. 

Thank you, Graham, for doing all that you did. And allowing us to join the ride.

Canada needs to unite its domestic and foreign policy focus and orient it toward amassing economic and political power.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jeff Mahon is director of geopolitical and international business advisory at consulting firm StrategyCorp.

Welcome to the age of perplexity. Canada's decision to unilaterally drop retaliatory tariffs against the United States has left Canadians confused as to what the strategy is for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and our place in the broader world.

The reality is Canada had few other options in dealing with a much more powerful country that throws its weight around to get what it wants. Our initial response to Mr. Trump's tariffs followed an outdated playbook. As his resolve hardened and extended beyond Canada, it became clear that his trade attacks on our country were only the beginning of a much larger project.

To advance its domestic and international agenda, the U.S. is pursuing a policy that maximizes power by exploiting its centrality in global economic and security affairs. 

Canada is in an unenviable position where trade dependence makes us susceptible to economic coercion. Removing our countertariffs is only the latest attempt to secure much needed market access through concessions. As part of economic and security negotiations with the U.S., Ottawa is systematically and quietly aligning its policy with Mr. Trump's agenda, including on matters of border security, digital governance and steel. 

Carney says he spoke with Trump, expects ‘small agreements' on tariff relief for some sectors

However, the extent and limits of this policy alignment have yet to be determined. Canada's de facto sovereignty is at risk – its ability to freely exercise foreign, security and economic policy.

The only antidote is to rapidly build Canada's own power through domestic economic development and a network of complementary relations with other countries. To get clarity on the opportunities and constraints, we must recognize that we've entered a new geopolitical era, that of the economic security regime. 

A new set of principles and norms are quickly superseding the neo-liberal, rules-based international order. Bilateral agreements are trumping multilateralism, as evidenced by governments around the world signing onto lopsided agreements with the U.S. These deals also undermine the old rationale where issues of economics, security and foreign policy are self-contained in separate technocratic tracks. Mr. Trump's deals eschew this maxim, as he uses U.S. power to force multidimensional concessions. 

The new economic security regime is not merely a product of Mr. Trump's rise. Rather, political actors surf the contingencies created by the tidal waves of history. The President capitalized on the discontent wrought by globalization, identified the tension between inert policies and the changing world they're meant to govern, and is now changing the course of not only the U.S., but the world at large. 

Geopolitical orders are essentially constructions shored up by the system's most powerful countries. Rival powers, such as China, can and do emerge by exploiting loopholes and attention or enforcement vacuums. Throughout history, there has been an interplay between hegemonic powers that employ what are essentially variants of liberal policies, and rivals that seek advantage through mercantilism. At some point, the leading power reckons that a liberal economic policy no longer suits its interests and then reneges.

Canada's tariff revenue surges – but nowhere close to Ottawa's projections

The U.S. under Mr. Trump has determined that the costs of both its open economic policy and international security blanket are no longer worth the benefits. It is shirking status quo commitments and redefining its terms of international engagement. The rest of the world is at the same time realizing the intrinsic risks of a system whose dense interconnectivity relies on Washington to keep its promises, rather than the illusion of the universality of neo-liberal principles. 

The world is now in a transitory period with no clear leader. There is a global struggle over the economic vectors of power: productive investment, technological innovation, jobs and market access. Many of Mr. Trump's policy actions, both domestic and international, seek to maximize U.S. power using these elements. This is where the Canadian government's policy priorities should also lie. 

Canada needs to unite its domestic and foreign policy focus and orient it toward amassing economic and political power. Some early indications from Prime Minister Mark Carney's government suggests he understands this. 

His “Building Canada Strong” agenda seeks to channel the nationalist momentum catalyzed by Mr. Trump and correct for past neglect with respect to Canada's economic power – particularly in those sectors positioned to lead diversification efforts. Trade-enabling infrastructure, energy and natural resources are poised to benefit from the government's push to advance projects of national interest as outlined by Bill C-5. 

It's important to create a single window system and to fast-track approvals, but it won't be enough to drive investment and job growth. Canada must rapidly improve the investment climate to incentivize the development of large and small projects. Mr. Carney has called on his administration to have a disciplined focus and be open to new approaches to governing. Ministers and departmental officials should respond by working with business and labour to forge a new industrial policy compact.

Opinion: Canada's trade strategy suffers from delusions of friendship

Internationally, the government must gear trade policy toward managing market access to maximize investment and jobs. This means shedding the dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism. Along this spectrum, a new dimension is unfolding where there is a mix of open, closed and restricted-access sectors. 

Take steel for example: In an attempt to secure U.S. access, the government is effectively committing to a common Canada-U.S. steel market. Such a doctrine could also apply to China, as reconciling that trade dispute will require granting more certainty to Chinese enterprises, regardless of whether it's welcome or under what conditions. This must be based on an honest assessment of where engagement with China either aids or undermines Canadian economic interests. 

Despite having a network of free-trade agreements spanning the globe, Canada's trade with key markets doesn't live up to its potential because many Canadian companies manufacture products geared toward the North American market. For example, exporting to the European Union may require companies to retool their operations to meet EU regulations and product standards. The government could consider a tax rebate for capital expenditures on products that meet EU standards, at once spurring business investment and trade diversification.

We also need to leverage existing strengths to find creative ways to amass power and influence abroad. While the government has come around to the idea of making Canada an energy superpower, we should recognize that we're already an agricultural superpower and integrate this into foreign policy. Agriculture can help build inroads into the Indo-Pacific – an aggressive push to secure sector-specific market agreements under the guise of food security would benefit both Canada and the region.

The new economic security regime has emerged from an old order that Canada helped build and used to benefit from. While the new world order isn't conducive to the world we want to live in – it is the one that Canada must come to terms with.

People look at the Elevador da Gloria streetcar which derailed and crashed in Lisbon, on Thursday.Armando Franca/The Associated Press

Global Affairs Canada has confirmed it is aware of two missing Canadian citizens after a popular streetcar attraction crashed in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, killing 16 people.

Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather more information, said spokesperson Thida Ith in an e-mailed statement Thursday.

Due to privacy considerations, she added that no further information can be disclosed.

One Canadian national was among the 21 injured, the head of Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency Margarida Castro Martins told reporters.

On Thursday, investigators sifted through the wreckage of the streetcar in downtown Lisbon, trying to determine why the popular tourist attraction derailed during the busy summer season. 

Portugal's attorney-general's office said eight victims have been identified so far: five Portuguese, two South Koreans and a Swiss person.

There is “a high possibility,” based on recovered documents and other evidence, that the victims also include two Canadians, one American, one German and one Ukrainian, according to the head of the national investigative police, Luís Neves. Three remain to be identified.

Among the injured are Spaniards, Israelis, Portuguese, Brazilians, Italians and French people, the executive director of Portugal's National Health Service, Álvaro Santos Almeida, said.

The nationalities appeared to confirm suspicions that the Elevador da Gloria was packed with tourists as well as locals when it came off its rails during the evening rush hour Wednesday. Lisbon hosted around 8.5 million tourists last year, and long lines of people typically form for the streetcar's short and picturesque trip a few hundred meters up and down a city street.

“This tragedy … goes beyond our borders,” Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said at his official residence, calling it “one of the biggest tragedies of our recent past.” Portugal observed a national day of mourning Thursday.

All 16 autopsies were concluded Thursday, but the identification of three victims requires access to dental records or family DNA that are held abroad, Francisco Corte-Real, the head of the National Forensic Medicine Institute, told a joint news conference.

The electric streetcar, also known as a funicular, is harnessed by steel cables and can carry more than 40 people. On Thursday, officials took photographs and pulled up cable from beneath the rails that climb one of the Portuguese capital's steep hills.

Officials declined to comment on whether a faulty brake or a snapped cable may have prompted the descending streetcar to careen into a building where the steep road bends.

“The city needs answers,” Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas said in a televised statement, adding that talk of possible causes is “mere speculation.”

Police, public prosecutors and government transport experts are investigating the crash, Montenegro told reporters. The government's Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations said it had concluded its analysis of the wreckage and would issue a preliminary report Friday. Chief police investigator Nelson Oliveira said a preliminary police report is expected within 45 days.

The company that operates Lisbon's streetcars and buses, Carris, said it has opened its own investigation.

The streetcar, which has been in service since 1914, underwent a scheduled full maintenance program last year and the company conducted a 30-minute visual inspection of it every day, Carris' CEO Pedro de Brito Bogas said during a news conference Thursday.

The streetcar was last inspected nine hours before the derailment, he said, but he didn't detail the visual inspection nor specify when questioned whether all the cables were tested.

The mayor said he would request an investigation from an outside independent body, but didn't elaborate.

Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency said earlier Thursday that the death toll had risen to 17. It later corrected that to 16, citing a duplication of available information.

All the people who died were adults, Castro Martins said. She didn't provide their identities, saying their families would be informed first.

The transport workers' trade union SITRA said that the streetcar's brakeman, André Marques, was among the dead.

The injured include men and women between the ages of 24 and 65, and a 3-year-old child, Castro Martins said. Among them are Portuguese people, as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from France, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Morocco, South Korea and Cape Verde, she said.

Felicity Ferriter, a 70-year-old British tourist, had just arrived with her husband at a hotel near the crash site and was unpacking her suitcase when she heard “a horrendous crash.”

“We heard it, we heard the bang,” she told The Associated Press outside her hotel.

The couple had seen the streetcar when they arrived and intended to ride on it the next day.

“It was to be one of the highlights of our holiday,” she said, adding: “It could have been us.”

Witness Teresa d'Avó told Portuguese television channel SIC that it looked like the streetcar had no brakes.

“It hit the building with brutal force and fell apart like a cardboard box,” she said, describing how passersby scattered into the middle of the nearby Avenida da Liberdade, or Freedom Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare.

Francesca di Bello, a 23-year-old Italian tourist on a family vacation, had been on the Elevador da Gloria just hours before the derailment.

They walked by the crash site on Thursday, expressing shock at the wreckage. Asked if she would ride a funicular again in Portugal or elsewhere, Di Bello was emphatic: “Definitely not.”

The service, inaugurated in 1885, runs between Restauradores Square and the Bairro Alto neighbourhood renowned for its nightlife. The Elevador da Gloria is classified as a national monument.

Lisbon's City Council halted operations of three other famous funicular streetcars in the city while immediate inspections were carried out.

European Union flags at the European Parliament and European Commission in Brussels flew at half-staff. Multiple EU leaders expressed their condolences on social media.

Two Canadians are believed to have been killed after a popular streetcar attraction crashed in Lisbon on Wednesday, killing 16 people, a Portuguese official says.

Luis Neves, Portugal's judicial police chief, said there was a “high degree of certainty” that there are two Canadians, one Ukrainian and one German among the dead, although the identities could not yet be officially confirmed.

A U.S. citizen was also killed in the crash, the State Department said in a statement.

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday afternoon that it is aware of two missing Canadian citizens.

Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather more information, said spokesperson Thida Ith in an e-mailed statement Thursday.

She said no further information can be disclosed because of privacy considerations, including the name of the two missing Canadians.

One Canadian national was among the 21 injured, the head of Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency Margarida Castro Martins told reporters.

On Thursday, investigators sifted through the wreckage of the streetcar in downtown Lisbon, trying to determine why the popular tourist attraction derailed during the busy summer season.

Prime Minister Mark Carney posted on X about the incident Thursday morning, before the statement was released by Global Affairs.

“My thoughts are with the people of Lisbon following last night's tragic accident,” he said. “Canadians are wishing comfort and support to those grieving loved ones, and a swift recovery to everyone who was injured.”

Portugal's attorney-general's office said eight victims have been identified so far: five Portuguese, two South Koreans and a Swiss person.

The injured include men and women between the ages of 24 and 65, and a 3-year-old child, Castro Martins said. Among them are Portuguese people as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from France, Italy, Switzerland, Morocco, South Korea and Cape Verde, in addition to the Canadian, she said.

The nationalities appeared to confirm suspicions that the Elevador da Gloria was packed with tourists as well as locals when it came off its rails during the evening rush hour Wednesday. Lisbon hosted around 8.5 million tourists last year, and long lines of people typically form for the streetcar's short and picturesque trip a few hundred meters up and down a city street.

“This tragedy … goes beyond our borders,” Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said at his official residence, calling it “one of the biggest tragedies of our recent past.” Portugal observed a national day of mourning Thursday.

All 16 autopsies were concluded Thursday, but the identification of three victims requires access to dental records or family DNA that are held abroad, Francisco Corte-Real, the head of the National Forensic Medicine Institute, told a joint news conference.

The electric streetcar, also known as a funicular, is harnessed by steel cables and can carry more than 40 people. On Thursday, officials took photographs and pulled up cable from beneath the rails that climb one of the Portuguese capital's steep hills.

Officials declined to comment on whether a faulty brake or a snapped cable may have prompted the descending streetcar to careen into a building where the steep road bends.

“The city needs answers,” Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas said in a televised statement, adding that talk of possible causes is “mere speculation.”

Police, public prosecutors and government transport experts are investigating the crash, Montenegro told reporters. The government's Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations said it had concluded its analysis of the wreckage and would issue a preliminary report Friday.

BEIJING, September 3. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are not plotting any conspiracy against the United States, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said, commenting on allegations from US President Donald Trump about the three leaders conspiring against Washington at Beijing's military parade.

"I'd like to say that nobody meant to conspire [against the United States] <…>. Moreover, I can say that everybody understands the role the United States, the Trump administration, and President Trump personally are playing in today's global narratives," Ushakov told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin.

Earlier, Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, addressing China's Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

The People's Liberation Army of China held a large-scale military parade on Tiananmen Square in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War on Wednesday.

Editor's note: This item has been updated with Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov's statement. 

Russia's economy slowed sharply from April-June of 2025 and has entered a phase of "technical stagnation," German Gref, the head of Russia's biggest bank, Sberbank, said on Sept. 3.

"The slowdown continues, as we can see from gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates. The second quarter can practically be considered technical stagnation," Gref said at an economic forum.

"July and August show pretty clear signs that we're getting close to zero (economic growth)."

The downturn underscores the limits of Russia's war-fueled expansion, driven by record defense spending but hampered by weak private consumption and shrinking civilian investment. 

Russia's GDP expanded 1.8% in the second quarter, up slightly from 1.4% in the first but far below the 2024 pace. The Central Bank expects growth to slow in the third quarter and approach zero in late 2025. 

The International Monetary Fund has already cut its 2025 growth forecast for Russia to 0.9%, down from 4.3% last year — the steepest downgrade among major economies.

Gref also noted the Central Bank's key interest rate, currently at 18% following two cuts in 2025, and said it would need to drop closer to 12% to create "hope for an economic recovery."

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level officials. 

Central Bank Chief Elvira Nabiullina said in June that Russia had reached "the edge of capacity," while Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said the country was "on the verge of a transition to recession."

Speaking on Sept. 4 to Kremlin-controlled state media channel Russia 1, Reshetnikov said Russia "pays" for inflation and high key interest rate with a "challenging economic situation."

"It is visible in the macroeconomic figures. According to our estimates, GDP growth in July year-on-year was 0.4%. In June, it was 1%," he said. "Moreover, we see that producer price inflation has stopped... which is not a very good sign. It indicates that demand is insufficient."

"Many engineering factories are now underutilized. Some are moving to a four-day workweek, others to a full week. Everywhere, they are trying to optimize costs, including labor costs. Clearly, we are not talking about layoffs, but this is a worrying sign for us."

Russia's authoritarian system permits senior technocrats some rhetorical flexibility, but only within the economic sphere, Russian political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann told the Kyiv Independent in June. 

"Our autocracy relies on the expertise of capable managers, particularly those concentrated in the financial and economic bloc of the government," Schulmann said.

A June poll by the independent Russian pollster Levada Center found 58% of Russians named rising prices as their top concern, while just 33% cited the war against Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sept. 3 that he initially thought ending Russia's war against Ukraine would be straightforward, but acknowledged it has proven more difficult than he expected. 

The president's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"Frankly, the Russia one, I thought, would have been on the easier side of the ones I've stopped, but it seems to be something that's a little bit more difficult than some of the others," Trump told CBS News.

Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has positioned himself as a global peacemaker, claiming he ended seven conflicts, though he did not provide evidence or specify which wars he was referring to.

His approach, he said, is to bring leaders together in one room and push them toward an agreement, though he conceded that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow require patience.

Following his Aug. 15 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Trump said he was preparing a direct meeting between Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin has denied that any such deal was reached. 

The Ukrainian president has repeatedly expressed willingness to meet with Putin directly, urging the U.S. to impose tougher measures if Russia continues to avoid such talks.

Putin told reporters on Sept.3 that he has never ruled out meeting with Zelensky and suggested it could happen if properly prepared. He said if Zelensky is ready, he could come to Moscow.

Trump has yet to impose sanctions on Russia for refusing to end the war, despite earlier threats of "severe" secondary tariffs. His administration has paused military aid to Ukraine multiple times and so far imposed only a 25% tariff on India over oil purchases from Moscow. 

An Aug. 8 deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed without consequences.

Zelensky, who traveled to Paris on Sept. 3 for a meeting of the "Coalition of the Willing," said he would soon speak with Trump about increasing sanctions pressure on Moscow.

"Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit.





"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast, wrote.

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.

Tokyo Skytree in Sumida Ward, Tokyo, is illuminated in “sunrise red” on Wednesday. The color of the lighting was inspired by the uniforms of the Japan team taking part in the World Athletics Championships, which kicks off in Tokyo on Sept. 13. Top athletes who competed at the 1991 event in Tokyo attended the lighting ceremony, including women's marathon silver medalist Sachiko Yamashita and Yuko Arimori, who placed fourth.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

KURT M. CAMPBELL is Chairman and Co-Founder of The Asia Group. He served as Deputy Secretary of State and Indo-Pacific Coordinator at the National Security Council during the Biden administration.

JAKE SULLIVAN is Kissinger Professor of the Practice of Statecraft and World Order at the Harvard Kennedy School. He served as U.S. National Security Adviser from 2021 to 2025.

 Washington Should Draw New Delhi Closer, Not Push It Away

 Kurt M. Campbell and Jake Sullivan

Tariffs, Russian oil purchases, and renewed tensions regarding Pakistan have caused a rapid and regrettable downturn in the U.S.-Indian relationship, replete with public insults and recriminations. As Washington and New Delhi evaluate the state of things, it is prudent to remember why India has emerged over the last generation as one of the United States' most important global partners. It is also time to consider how to fortify a relationship that has been one of the brightest spots of bipartisan support in a divided Washington where concerted international purpose has been in short supply.

U.S. policymakers have long seen promise in India's status as the world's largest democracy as well as opportunity in its economic and technological dynamism and its growing global leadership role. More recently, India's desire to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific has led to a strategic alignment with the United States that has effectively disincentivized reckless Chinese adventurism.

This common purpose must not be taken for granted. Until this most recent dustup, multiple U.S. presidents have pushed forward specific initiatives to advance the relationship and convert a general sense of promise into something deeper and sustained, including President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's landmark U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement and President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cooperation in critical fields such as AI, biotechnology, and aerospace.

The relationship, however, has remained vulnerable to misunderstandings, missteps, and missed opportunities because of lingering distrust and misaligned expectations. This is partly because U.S.-Indian ties do not fit neatly into the boxes that the United States has historically used to define its most consequential bilateral relationships. In the Cold War and post–Cold War eras, U.S. foreign policy made a distinction between alliances and partnerships. Alliances involved formal treaty commitments built on the foundation of a mutual defense guarantee. Partnerships were for essentially all other countries that worked with Washington—and India fell into that category.

The end of the post–Cold War era has exposed the shortcomings of this approach, which overemphasized collective self-defense commitments and neglected the deeper economic, technological, and strategic ties that are increasingly salient in modern geopolitics. Indeed, despite fundamental areas of alignment between the two countries, the U.S.-Indian relationship received relatively little attention, because it was not centered on a security guarantee.

The current trajectory risks a split that would be difficult to mend, to the great detriment of both countries. As Modi's chummy appearance over the weekend with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear, the United States could end up driving India directly into its adversaries' arms. India, meanwhile, could end up squeezed on all sides with an unaccommodating power in China on its border and strained technology, education, and defense ties with the United States. Given this reality, Washington and New Delhi must strive to do more than simply restore the old, suboptimal status quo. They must create a firmer and more ambitious foundation: a strategic alliance between the United States and India based on a series of mutual commitments regarding technology, defense, supply chains, intelligence, and global problem solving. An alliance, in other words, not based on a traditional mutual defense pact.

At this moment of unprecedented discord, it may be hard to imagine reinventing and bolstering the relationship. But the United States and India can move forward by using the scaffolding already in place to build a stronger structure. Failing to do so risks squandering a major strategic opportunity and could encourage India to adopt a path less aligned with, or even hostile to, American strategic and economic interests.

A new strategic alliance between the United States and India would be established by a treaty subject to advice and consent by the U.S. Senate. It would be built on five core pillars, with the aim of enhancing the mutual security, prosperity, and values of both countries.

First, the countries would agree to a ten-year action plan in the technologies that will define the future: artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biotech, quantum, clean energy, telecommunications, and aerospace. The goal would be to build a common technology ecosystem, linked to other allies, to ensure the United States and fellow democracies do not cede the innovation edge to competitors such as China. This would mean working together on both the “promote” agenda of bold public investments, common R & D, and shared talent—as well as the “protect” agenda of aligning export controls and cybersecurity measures. The Trump administration's U.S.-India TRUST initiative, built on top of the Biden administration's U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, should be at the core of this effort, but it could and should evolve from primarily a convening forum to a more formal architecture. By the close of the Biden administration, for instance, early discussions had begun around a formal U.S.-Indian AI agreement, potentially the first of its kind. Such an agreement could anchor R & D partnerships and encourage private-sector investment. This type of agreement, replicated across an array of emerging technologies, should be a cornerstone of a new alliance.

The United States and India should also establish a strategic talent partnership that removes obstacles for their scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and technical experts to work together on priority areas. This would include streamlining visa processes on both sides, creating common pots of funding, and removing outdated export controls that stymie collaboration.

The second pillar would be enhanced economic cooperation, including a bilateral trade pact that reflects the structural realities of the modern global economy while accounting for the political realities in both Washington and New Delhi. The natural first step would be a supply chain and investment agreement that would reduce mutual vulnerabilities to coercion and enhance the two countries' respective techno-industrial bases. India and the United States have each acknowledged dependencies on China for vital supply chains, and in some instances, those dependencies are interconnected. For example, China supplies India with 70 to 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since 40 percent of generic drugs in the United States are manufactured in India, the United States is indirectly exposed to India's reliance on Chinese APIs. Similarly, both countries rely heavily on China for critical minerals.

A supply chain agreement would help accelerate diversification and resilience by creating a standing mechanism to identify and address risks to supply chains in areas critical for national security and economic competitiveness. This would involve both early warning of impending disruptions and longer-term strategies to make investments that build resilience. In addition, the United States and India should establish high-standard principles for cross-border data flows and data security. And both countries should pursue an investment pact that would reduce obstacles to foreign direct investment, especially in strategic sectors, by addressing nontariff barriers, removing outdated regulatory restrictions in areas like clean energy, and strengthening intellectual property protections. Much of this diplomatic work was underway before the recent bout of public acrimony.



The third pillar of the strategic alliance would involve defense cooperation—specifically codevelopment, coproduction, joint logistics, and interoperability. This need not require a traditional Article 5–like guarantee to trigger mutual defense. But if both sides committed to developing the necessary consultation mechanisms and technology and personnel platforms, a more durable capacity to train, exercise, and operate together is within reach. Among other things, this would mean further institutionalizing and capitalizing the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which was launched in 2023 as an innovation bridge that directly connects the full spectrum of the two countries' defense ecosystems, including government agencies, prime contractors, startups, investors, and research institutions.

The agreement that GE Aerospace would manufacture F-414 jet engines in India—an unprecedented technology transfer to a nontreaty partner—showed the promise of a more robust defense partnership. (Delays in executing the deal reflect the continuing bureaucratic inertia in both countries.) But the goal here cannot and should not be simply to facilitate the transfer of American defense capabilities and technologies to India. Instead, it should be to build and operate new capabilities and technologies together, in areas such as unmanned aerial systems and air defense that will shape future combat. The United States brings obvious defense production prowess to the table, while India offers a new and critical opportunity: the chance to leapfrog many of the legacy defense platforms by deploying new platforms at scale. The scope of cooperation should grow to include joint naval and air activities in the Indian Ocean involving more submarine cooperation, airborne reconnaissance operations, and joint contingency planning.

A fourth pillar of the new alliance would be intelligence cooperation, which accelerated during the first Trump and Biden administrations. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, for example, has allowed Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad—to address illegal fishing, trafficking, and unauthorized maritime activities. The next major step would be to build a common maritime intelligence picture for the Indian Ocean, as well as a formalized structure of intelligence sharing and joint analysis that can continually update that picture.

The fifth and final pillar of the new alliance would be a commitment to global problem solving. The unique strengths of the two countries present significant opportunities for dealing with the climate crisis, food security, and public health, as well as the effective use of emerging technologies to deliver global public goods. The United States can mobilize public- and private-sector resources and development know-how; India can leverage deep experience with this set of challenges as well as its trusted relationships across East Africa and in the Pacific. This could start with joint scalable pilot projects in third countries—such as in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, where the Indian government has demonstrated a new commitment to ambitious infrastructure and health and technology initiatives that align with long-standing U.S. approaches in the Pacific—and grow from there.

Some will argue that it will not be possible to reengineer momentum in the bilateral relationship after the recent downturn. On this point, those invested in the relationship on Capitol Hill and in the business and strategic community need to impress on their Indian interlocutors that U.S. President Donald Trump's theatrics are often the prelude to dealmaking. This is a deeply unpleasant reality to many, but to paraphrase the late U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, you must do diplomacy with the United States you have, not the one you might prefer. Of course, it may turn out that it will be difficult to elevate the relationship under the current administration, but proponents of a U.S.-Indian alliance must keep building the strategic case and the intellectual and practical framework for the long term.

Some will also credibly ask whether India's democratic backsliding would make such an alliance untenable. There are real challenges in India on pluralism, civil rights, and the rule of law, but the relationship should be mature enough to sustain an honest conversation with the government of India and Indian civil society about these trends. The United States should also be humble enough to acknowledge its own significant challenges when it comes to democracy and the rule of law. It is a very large glass house.

There is also the question of whether such an alliance can be built in the face of India's relationship with Russia, which was brought into sharp relief by the recent Modi-Putin meeting. India will need to make a long-term strategic choice to break its dependence on Russia for defense and energy. This is a choice that New Delhi can and should make for its own reasons, not out of deference to Washington. And there have been subtle signs in recent years that India has gradually repositioned itself more toward the United States and Europe.

Washington must also refrain from hyphenating its relations with India and Pakistan: there should be no “India-Pakistan” policy. U.S. diplomacy in recent years has been heavily weighted toward New Delhi for a reason. The United States has enduring interests in Pakistan in combating terrorism and limiting nuclear and missile proliferation, but these pale in significance to Washington's multifaceted and consequential interests regarding India's future.

On the Indian side, some will ask—particularly now with nationalist sensibilities running hot—whether a U.S.-Indian alliance will impinge on India's strategic autonomy. The very idea of an alliance will be strange and scary to the inheritors of the Non-Aligned Movement, which India helped spearhead during the Cold War. But a strategic alliance is not mutually exclusive with strategic autonomy. India and the United States are both proud and independent countries. Alliances are about alignment and common purpose—not about sacrificing sovereignty.

As always, there is the practical question of bureaucracy and capacity on both sides. Can they move the machinery of government to build an alliance? Doing so would require leadership from the top of both governments. And it would require a vision that inspires not only their governments but also their private sectors, technology communities, universities, and publics.

It is also worth remembering that many of Washington's most important alliances have seen setbacks and led to domestic discord. The U.S.-Japanese alliance, for example, had to weather the economic disputes and political pressures of the 1980s and hard questions about the continued necessity of an alliance with Washington in the post–Cold War environment in the 1990s. The NATO alliance has had to contend with persistent questions about burden sharing. The United States and South Korea previously butted heads over how to handle the threat from North Korea, and there have been periodic public upheavals in Korean public opinion over tragic incidents involving American troops stationed on the peninsula. The United States and its allies have gotten through tough moments before, and the United States and India can do so, too.

Whether that will happen with the current occupant of the Oval Office is unpredictable, but the strategic aim should be clear. The realities of the emerging era have elevated the value of new shared security arrangements. And India has emerged as one of the United States' most consequential partners. The only thing harder than building and formalizing a deeply significant relationship with India is not having one. So, with no illusions, the United States and India should get to work.

 How to Outcompete Chinese State Capitalism

 Sadek Wahba and Jonathan E. Hillman

Years from now, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as a turning point in U.S. industrial policy, with President Donald Trump's deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials marking the beginning of a new era of direct state investment in key industries. As the United States competes over the technologies and industries of tomorrow, Washington is now experimenting with state-centric investment strategies that resemble those of Beijing. But because the U.S. federal government is constrained by a debt-to-GDP ratio above 120 percent and a budget deficit exceeding seven percent, U.S. policymakers will have to channel more private capital toward strategically important sectors. Doing so will not be easy. To ensure a successful industrial strategy, the Trump administration must set clear criteria for what qualifies as a strategic industry, marshal the necessary public resources, and incentivize private investment in those industries.

The global battleground spans a wide variety of industries, including artificial intelligence and related digital infrastructure, critical minerals, and advanced manufacturing. Both China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in this strategic competition. In China, the government plays a central role as a source, allocator, and user of capital, directly resourcing strategic priorities but creating significant waste and inefficiency in the process. Chinese companies get much of their financing from state-owned banks, with capital markets providing only 14 percent of their financing. In the United States, by contrast, a market-led approach struggles to support less lucrative areas of strategic importance, such as basic infrastructure, but excels at directing capital toward areas with the highest perceived returns, such as artificial intelligence. And with integration across all 50 states, U.S. capital markets are the largest globally and provide nearly three-quarters of all equity and debt financing for U.S. companies outside the financial sector.

In both countries, investment outcomes depend heavily on national conditions, including the strength of capital markets, workforce, infrastructure, and the judiciousness of laws and regulations. When these conditions are strong, countries become magnets for foreign capital and talent. As U.S. policymakers work to scale investments for strategically important technologies and industries, they may improve underlying conditions over time, but they should not bet on overnight transformations.

The Chinese government has an extensive toolkit for supporting investments at home and for launching into global markets. State-owned banks provide most of the financing to companies in China, which is home to the world's four largest banks, all of which are state-owned. The government is also the dominant investor in venture capital and private equity, supplying six times more funding than private investors. Chinese companies can draw from a wide array of state-backed sources, including funds, banks, enterprises, and sovereign wealth vehicles. Beijing also shields firms from foreign competition, facilitates technology transfer, and supports them with cheap land, electricity, and credit. Abroad, Beijing extends financing and diplomatic backing to Chinese companies through the Belt and Road Initiative, helping them to secure mineral rights and logistics networks.

The rise of China's largest shipping company, COSCO, illustrates the power of this support. In 2009, COSCO operated three overseas terminals. Today it manages a dozen. In that same period, the company increased the amount of overseas cargo it handled tenfold. Many other Chinese firms have profited from COSCO's success, including manufacturers of tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers, financial-technology and mining companies, and entrepreneurs developing AI applications for maritime operations. This broader Chinese ecosystem of beneficiaries allows the state to rationalize its continued support for a national champion.

When all else fails, the Chinese government can move capital from profitable state-owned enterprises to keep their struggling counterparts afloat. The relative success of Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2015, is telling. Displaying a degree of focus that Washington has lacked, Beijing aimed to upgrade not just industry in general but ten specific sectors. Within those sectors, Beijing has achieved global leadership in five of 13 key technologies and is making headway in seven others.

Yet this approach carries costs. China's subsidies, which are far larger than those of other countries, have created overcapacity in automobiles, solar panels, and semiconductors. Correcting this will be difficult as growth slows, the Chinese population ages, and reliance on foreign energy rises. In addition to draining resources from competing sectors, Chinese subsidies have provoked other countries to respond with their own measures, as evidenced by Trump's tariff policy.

The heavy hand of the state is also driving investors away. Foreign capital, especially venture funding, has collapsed amid higher risks and lower returns. Beijing has tried to lure investors with regulatory flexibility and even a $138 billion public venture capital fund, but domestic private firms still prefer private sources, and government-owned investment firms perform worse than private ones. Still, when strategic priorities are at stake, Beijing values control over efficiency.

Trump's recent deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials may represent a significant escalation of a nearly decadelong shift toward experimenting with industrial policy. In his first term, Trump fired the opening salvo with his “America first” strategy based on a mix of tariffs, import substitution policies, and attempts to improve infrastructure. President Joe Biden increased some tariffs on China and worked with Congress on landmark programs to rebuild the United States' aging infrastructure, invest in clean energy, and develop semiconductors and related technologies.

In his second term, Trump has deployed a variety of tools to attract more capital to strategic areas. He has used executive orders to relax regulatory barriers, continued to provide financial incentives—such as tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees—for semiconductors through the CHIPS and Science Act, and blocked or raised the cost of foreign alternatives, including through aggressive import controls and tariffs. His administration has also taken dramatic steps to leverage the U.S. government's power as a customer and regulator to strike deals with private companies. Some of these measures are reminiscent of the New Deal, when the federal government actively invested in the economy.

In April, the leading AI-chip maker Nvidia announced that it would spend $500 billion to build AI supercomputers and infrastructure in the United States, including new manufacturing and testing facilities in Arizona and Texas. In return, Trump committed to speeding up permits for Nvidia's expansion. Then, in July, the Department of Defense launched a partnership with MP Materials, the rare-earth miner, to build a fully domestic rare-earth magnet supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical defense inputs. The deal includes a $400 million equity investment by Washington (making the Department of Defense the company's largest shareholder), a $150 million public loan to expand heavy rare-earth separation, and a ten-year price floor on a rare-earth compound that is a key ingredient for powerful magnets. This combination of incentives has already mobilized $1 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as a pledge from MP Materials to contribute $600 million to the project. The real test will be whether the partnership can meaningfully scale up production and create a self-sustaining market over the next decade.

The strategic case for more recent deals is less clear. In August, Washington announced that it would allow Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another leading semiconductor company, to export certain AI chips to China in exchange for 15 percent of top-line revenues generated from these sales. The Trump administration has not clarified how it plans to use these funds, which makes it impossible to weigh the revenue gained against the potential costs to national security. In an unprecedented move, the administration also recently announced that it would use $5.7 billion in previously awarded grants to the chipmaker Intel to purchase a ten-percent equity stake in the company. By converting a grant to an equity stake, taxpayers may benefit from future returns—but Intel may be at a disadvantage, since its competitors will likely continue receiving grants and other less demanding support.

These actions can be interpreted in two ways. First, they reflect Trump's transactional style of policymaking. Second, they could signal the start of a more sustained industrial policy focused on supporting strategic sectors, both at home and abroad. The first does not preclude the second. But an ad hoc approach risks failing to achieve the scale and consistency necessary for long-term success.

The long-term nature of industrial policy is perhaps the greatest challenge for the United States, where elections carry the risk of erasing a previous administration's policy initiatives. An effective industrial policy for strategic competition across multiple technologies and industries—including those that have yet to be discovered—may have to be extended for decades. Moreover, whatever policy takes shape over the coming years, U.S. public resources are limited and risk being spread too thin over too many priorities. It is critical that policymakers continue to identify strategic industries that require targeted state support and ensure that the United States has the capabilities, either domestically or through its network of partners and allies, to defend its vital interests under various scenarios.

To that end, policymakers should ask several essential questions before making investments. Does this industry require support that capital markets cannot provide? If so, what form of support should it take? If financial support is truly required, which tool will have the greatest likelihood of success at the most reasonable cost? Should the state intervene directly in private capital markets or merely provide incentives? The government has a number of incentives from which to choose—tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees, as well as its own purchasing power—and each comes with tradeoffs. These questions should be standardized and addressed systematically through an investment vehicle, such as a sovereign fund, with rules that insulate decisions from political interference.

A related challenge is identifying the critical ancillary requirements that strategic industries need. For example, AI requires massive data centers, which in turn depend on reliable power generation, water resources, and permits at both the local and federal levels. States cannot fund these requirements alone. The 2021 infrastructure bill, for example, was almost entirely funded by federal and state governments, with minimal incentives for the private sector. A realistic industrial policy must also consider the supporting investments—in research, infrastructure, and workforce development—that are necessary for strategic industries to succeed.

Policymakers should also continue nurturing the United States' underlying advantages. Capital markets could be further strengthened by lowering the tax burden on foreign capital from trusted sources seeking minority stakes in U.S. infrastructure and other priorities. And comprehensive immigration reform is essential to ensure that the United States has the human capital required for industry and for maximizing the odds that the next strategically important innovation happens at home.

The United States can lead in tomorrow's technologies and industries by leveraging its unparalleled capital markets, fostering public-private collaboration, and aligning policy incentives with long-term strategic goals. But success will require disciplined prioritization and a commitment to creating conditions that attract both domestic and international private capital. As global competition intensifies, Washington's ability to mobilize private capital will be central to safeguarding U.S. strategic interests.

VLADIVOSTOK, September 4. /TASS/. Russia is not going to discuss ideas of foreign military intervention in Ukraine in any format, Official Spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said at the briefing on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, commenting on plans of the European Union to potentially send troops to Ukraine.

"Russia does not intend to discuss the completely unacceptable and undermining any security foreign intervention in Ukraine in any form, in any format whatsoever," the diplomat stressed.

Security guarantees sought by Ukraine are guarantees of threat to the European continent and are absolutely unacceptable, Zakharova noted. "They are aimed at preserving Ukraine as a stronghold for terror, for provocations against our country. They are not security guarantees for Ukraine, they are guarantees of threat to the European continent," she stressed.

The US approval of the possible sale of more than 3,000 ERAM missiles and the equipment required for them contradicts the stated aspiration to settle the conflict diplomatically, Zakharova added.

Russia would use Donbas to further invade Ukraine in a renewed assault and could attack Europe next, President Volodymyr Zelensky told French outlet Le Point in an interview published on Sept. 3.

"If, tomorrow, we somehow left Donbas, which will not happen, we would open up an unprotected space for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, near a city of one and a half million inhabitants: Kharkiv. He would also seize the industrial center of Dnipro," Zelensky said.

"One thing is certain, we have not lost. We must look at the situation clearly: the second-largest army in the world has come to annihilate us, our history, and our identity. And this is not their first attempt. Several times in history, the Russian Empire has struck blows at the independence of our people," he said.

Russia has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine withdraw from Donbas, which consists of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Moscow first occupied the far-eastern region in 2014.

"It's very simple. Some media outlets claim that if Ukrainian soldiers left the eastern regions of our country, peace would be restored. This is not true," Zelensky said.

The Kremlin reportedly signalled to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff that it would be open to freezing the frontline in its war against Ukraine if Kyiv surrendered the rest of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia.

"Putin invaded Crimea (in 2014) to use it as a springboard and encircle the south of our country. That is, to prepare for another offensive. He invaded part of the east of our country in 2014 to use it as a springboard to completely occupy these regions," Zelensky said.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 used Belarus and Ukraine's southeastern regions as launching pads for its assaults across the country.

Zelensky noted the same could be done to attack the rest of Europe next if Ukraine were to fall to Russian soldiers.

"If Putin were to succeed in taking over our entire country, he would use it as a springboard in the same way. Whether he does so or not will depend on Europe's" strength, Zelensky said.

Despite sanctions from Ukraine's allies, Moscow is still able to wage its war, he noted.

"The pressure from Western partners is not strong enough economically; Putin still has financial reserves," he added.

Zelensky noted that security guarantees solely from Europe are enough to contain a Russian offensive, but that guarantees from the U.S. are necessary to end Russia's aggression and prevent a renewed war.

"Europe's security guarantees may not be enough. We need an alliance between Europe and the United States," he said.

Ukraine, alongside its European allies and Washington, has been discussing how to end Russia's war against Ukraine in recent weeks amid intensified efforts from U.S. President Donald Trump to broker a peace deal.

"The Russians came to try to erase our identity, to rewrite history. We are fighting to preserve our identity. Our fight is not just for territory. It is for Ukraine, which is made up of pieces of history and people," Zelensky said as Russia continues its advances on the front line.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

As the leaders of China and Russia walked shoulder to shoulder on Sept. 3, a hot mic captured them discussing increasing longevity through organ transplants, possibly extending one's lifespan to 150 years.

The conversation, livestreamed through Chinese state media to billions online and on television, made international headlines as China watchers scrutinized the implications, with many pointing to longstanding concerns about forced organ harvesting.

SEOUL, September 4. /TASS/. Head of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un said during talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Pyongyang will support Moscow in defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the KCNA news agency reported.

The meeting took place on September 3 on the sidelines of festive activities in China. "Comrade Kim Jong Un said that DPRK will continue supporting to the full extent the struggle of the government, the army, and the people of Russia for protection of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests of the state, consider it the brotherly debt and stay committed to performance of the interstate treaty between DPRK and Russia," KCNA said.

The meeting of the two leaders was held in the friendly atmosphere, the news agency added.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the military is going back to basics on 'The Will Cain Show.'

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Friday to alter the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, reverting to the agency's former namesake, Fox News Digital has learned. 

Both Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have recently indicated they want to change the name of the agency. It is one of several initiatives the Trump administration has spearheaded as part of its "warrior ethos" campaign within the Pentagon. 

A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday that Trump would roll out the name change Friday. The executive order calls for using the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense, along with phrases like "secretary of war" for Hegseth, according to a White House fact sheet. 

The order also instructs Hegseth to propose both legislative and executive actions to make the name permanently U.S. Department of War.

Likewise, implementing the order will require modifications to public-facing websites and office signage at the Pentagon, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the "Pentagon War Annex," according to a White House official. Other longer-term projects also are in the works, the official said. 

Trump signaled in recent days the change was imminent. 

"Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "Then we changed it to Department of Defense."

Hegseth, who Trump already has referred to on occasion as the "secretary of war," also expressed similar sentiments and said the change would reflect a broader, cultural shift within the Pentagon.

"We won WWI, and we won WWII, not with the Department of Defense, but with a War Department, with the Department of War," Hegseth said in an interview Wednesday with "Fox & Friends." "As the president has said, we're not just defense, we're offense.

"We've reestablished at the Department the warrior ethos. We want warriors, folks that understand how to exact lethality on the enemy," he said. "We don't want endless contingencies and just playing defense. We think words and names and titles matter. So, we're working with the White House and the president on it. Stand by." 

The U.S. employed the Department of War title for its military agency until 1949, when it was renamed the Department of Defense in accordance with a series of massive reforms included in the National Security Act of 1947.

It's unclear if Congress, which has the authority to establish federal executive departments, will need to step in to issue final approval on the move. However, Trump previously has voiced confidence that he doesn't need approval from lawmakers and that they will get on board if necessary. 

"We're just going to do it," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that."

The executive order changing the name of the Department of Defense will be the 200th order Trump has signed in his second term.

Dramatic video shows a brand-new luxury yacht sinking just minutes after it was launched off the coast of Turkey, forcing its crew to leap overboard.

According to reports, the new $1 million vessel, an 85-foot cruiser named Dolce Vento, was launched Tuesday in the Ereğli district of Zonguldak, a port city on Turkey's Black Sea. 

The amateur video shows the boat being pushed into the ocean down a track on the beach and then swaying within 15 minutes of setting off.

As bystanders watched, the luxury yacht lurched to one side, tilting dangerously before taking on water.

Chaos erupted as people on board had to scramble onto the sloping deck. As the vessel sank quickly, they were forced to dive into the sea.

One clip shows a man in a dark suit standing on the vessel's side before springing into the water.

The Turkish Coast Guard and port teams reportedly rushed to the scene, setting up a security perimeter around the capsized craft as it slipped further into the water, per TMZ.

According to TMZ, a spokesperson for the shipyard hosting the yacht, Med Yilmaz, said the cause of the disaster is under investigation.

Technical inspections will be carried out to determine whether a construction flaw, balance issue or human error doomed the luxury vessel.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Demolition to build President Donald Trump's new ballroom off the East Wing of the White House can begin without approval of the commission tasked with vetting construction of federal buildings, the Trump-appointed head of the panel said Thursday.

Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary, said during a public meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission that the board does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.

“What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,” Scharf said. He called Trump's promised ballroom “one of the most exciting construction projects in the modern history of” Washington. 

He made the comments during the only public meeting of the commission scheduled before crews are expected to break ground on a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom likely to greatly alter the look and size of both the White House's East and West Wings. 

The planning commission is responsible for approving construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. But Scharf made a distinction between demolition work and rebuilding, saying the commission was only required to vet the latter.

“I think any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been, or it will be, is simply false,” he said. 




Scharf said the White House hadn't yet submitted building plans for the White House renovations but when that happens, “I'm excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so.”

Asked after the meeting if the eventual approval process might delay work on the ballroom, Scharf said, “Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you're talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process.”

“Given the president's history as a builder, and given the plans that we've seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” Scharf said.

L. Preston Bryant Jr., who was appointed to chair the National Capital Planning Commission in 2009 by President Barack Obama and served in that role for nine years, said proposed projects typically worked in four major stages of commission approval that began “with an early consultation, where a project is very much conceptual.” 

That hasn't been the case with Trump's promised ballroom. 

“The White House and its design team would be very, very wise to involve NCPC and its staff very much on the front end of the project – in the early design stages – as it'll make for a better project and help ensure it meets all regulatory and legal compliances,” Bryant said. “I cannot stress enough the value to be had at the conceptual and early consultation stages.”

Trump has been anxious to hustle toward work beginning on the ballroom, with an eye toward completing it prior to his leaving office in January 2029. A building mogul before he was a reality TV star and politician, has relished personally overseeing improvement projects at the White House and walked last month on the building's roof with construction officials.

The ballroom will be the latest change introduced to what's known as “The People's House” since Trump returned to office in January, and the first structural change to the Executive Mansion itself since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.

Trump already has substantially redecorated the Oval Office through the addition of golden flourishes and cherubs, presidential portraits and other items, and installed massive flagpoles on the north and south lawns to fly the American flag. The lawn in the Rose Garden was paved over with stone and patio tables reminiscent of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, complete with exterior speakers. 

Scharf also used the meeting to argue that the Federal Reserve had flouted planning board jurisdiction while undertaking major renovations to its building. Trump has for months called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to resign, and has specifically decried the long-planned building project for going well over budget.

The Fed has posted on its website that the designs for the original improvement plans to its building were previously approved by the planning commission, and that it “does not regard” subsequent changes made to the original plan as being major enough to warrant “further review.” 

But Scharf said he'd be sending a letter to the Fed “noting my severe concerns” and accusing the central bank of arguing it essentially had the right to do “whatever the heck it wants on its property. They could build an amusement park on their property and no one would have any qualms.”

A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday. 

Scharf said after the meeting of Fed officials, “I'm hopeful that they'll see the light of day and come back in and re-present their construction project as they should have up front.”

After "Squad" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., blasted America as a country founded on racism at a pro-Palestinian conference on Sunday, an expert is warning that the country's lax immigration policies have resulted in the importation of anti-American ideals and a rise in "ethno-politics" in the U.S.

Simon Hankinson, an author and senior research fellow on the border and immigration at the Heritage Foundation, is urging the U.S. to adopt stricter immigration standards to crack down on foreign loyalties, especially among American leaders.

"When you take the oath of citizenship, when you're naturalizing in a naturalization ceremony, one of the things that you're supposed to say is that you renounce all allegiances to foreign potentates or rulers... That's something that you have to do. And I think that is a good idea, because I don't think you can serve two masters," he explained.

"Especially if you're a politician or in a position of authority, a judge, you absolutely should have no loyalty to any other country but the United States of America," he added.

"We used to have that as a very strict principle here. But over the past few decades, the government has been much more lenient about allowing people to retain dual nationality and there's only very limited circumstances where we require someone to give it up, like, for example, if they become a minister in a foreign government or president or prime minister in the foreign government or senior official. But for the most part, we've let it go."

He pointed to changes made to U.S. immigration policy in 1965 as part of the root of the issue.

"The biggest change was in 1965, when we essentially opened up immigration to the entire world, and we saw a dramatic change in where people came from," he said. "Now, when you bring people into your country, you bring all of them with you. You bring their good and their bad. And if they have beefs that they brought with them from the old country, then those can take a generation or two to die out. And sometimes with encouragement, they can last a lot longer."

The result, said Hankinson, has been a dramatic decline in assimilation in America and a simultaneous rise in "ethno-politics" dominating U.S. dialogue. One example of this is the anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric in a speech by Tlaib, who is a second-generation Palestinian American.

Speaking at the "People's Conference for Palestine" in Detroit, Tlaib railed against Israeli leaders and supporters of Israel, shouting, "I want to say to all of them, every genocide enabler, look at this room motherf---ers, we ain't going anywhere."

Tlaib also drilled into the United States as an "empire in Washington, D.C.," saying, "the political structures that I have to work in, that we all are surrounded by, was built on slavery and genocide and rape and oppression."

Taking aim at the Trump administration, Tlaib claimed that "what's been tested on the killing fields of Gaza is already being deployed right here in the streets of America."

"What our government is willing to do to Palestinians, they are willing to do to all of you," she asserted. "It is no surprise to me, as the daughter of Detroit, that I see our government, that has supplied the bombs and excuses Israel from destroying literally every single day hospitals, communities in Gaza, and manufacturing mass starvation, is also the same government that's defunding healthcare and food assistance programs here in our country."

Commenting on her remarks, Hanksinson said that "for someone, particularly an elected representative, to not just criticize policies that are enacted by politicians that they're opposed to, but to criticize the country and its very foundations to challenge the history and the framework of the United States, I think it's a very dangerous thing to do."

"We can look to examples like Lebanon, like India or Pakistan or countries in Africa where tribal and ethnic disputes have really gotten in the way of economic and political and social progress. We have managed to avoid that mostly in the United States, and I would hate to see us usher in a new era of that kind of ethno-politics into our country."

He pointed to another recent speech by Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who, while speaking at a pan-American conference in Mexico City, said in Spanish, "I'm a proud Guatemalan before I'm an American."

In a June interview, another prominent member of the Squad, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who is a Somali immigrant, suggested that under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has become one of the worst countries in the world.

"I grew up in a dictatorship, and I don't even remember ever witnessing anything like that, to have a democracy, a beacon of hope for the world, to now be turned into one of the worst countries, where the military are in our streets, without any regard for people's constitutional rights, while our president is spending millions of dollars propping himself up like a failed dictator with a military parade."

In response, Hankinson explained that for many on the left, assimilation has become a "dirty word."

"Assimilation is the process by which people from different cultures, languages, religions, while they can retain those roots, share a common understanding of what the United States is and what it means to the world and what it can mean for centuries to come," he said. "I don't think you can be considered assimilated if you come here and manage to become a permanent resident and then a citizen without ever loving this country, understanding and knowing its history, speaking its language, and, for all its flaws, understanding that this is fundamentally a great country."

"We're seeing that in some parts of the United States where there are enclaves that are ethnically very concentrated. And so, the forces of assimilation that would normally cause people to distance themselves from their history aren't working as they have in the past and could in the future. And so, for example, Rep. Tlaib or Ilhan Omar, they're very identified still with the cultures that they or their families left recently in a way that makes it seem as if they're putting the priorities of those peoples ahead of their own constituents."

"If you were to go to a progressive, ultra-liberal friend and ask them, are there any rights that an American citizen should have that an illegal immigrant should not, You'll have to wait for the answer, because they're going to have a hard time coming up with anything," he said. "They believe in multiculturalism. That means that people should be able to bring the culture that they left behind in whatever country they come from and sort of reestablish it, and that the U.S. is just some place that they park while they make money and take care of their lives, but their loyalty remains outside."

The White House declined Fox News Digital's request for comment on whether it would support a policy more strictly mandating American citizens and lawmakers have sole loyalty to the U.S.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the offices of Tlaib, Omar and Ramirez for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

            A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. A preliminary injunction is a temporary order put in place until a court can make a final decision in a case.
    


            “After careful consideration, we grant the defendants' motions and we stay the preliminary injunction and the underlying case itself pending appeal,” ruled the divided three-judge panel in the majority opinion.
    


            The makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure.
    


            Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier called the stay a “victory against an activist judge” in a social media post.
    


Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown



            “The 11th Circuit not only blocked Judge (Kathleen) Williams' order to close Alligator Alcatraz, but they blocked her from proceeding with the case until the appeal is complete. A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!”
    


            In a major blow for the plaintiffs – environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – and their key legal argument, the judges ruled the detention facility is operated by the state, not the federal government, and therefore falls outside the obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA, signed by President Richard Nixon, is considered one of the foundational environmental laws formed at the beginning of the modern environmental movement.
    


            “The Facility is a site built, led, operated, and funded unilaterally by a state government—in accordance with the state's laws—at which the state retains discretionary control over who is detained at the facility, all of which adds up to state control over the project's outcome, not federal control,” said the majority in the order.
    


            The majority noted Florida could eventually seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but until such funding is formally approved, the project does not qualify as a “major federal action” that would trigger NEPA's environmental review requirements.
    


            A single judge on the Atlanta-based panel dissented saying he would have let William's shutdown order stay in place in what should have been a “relatively simple denial” of the state's motion.
    


            The dissenting judge agreed with the lower court that the plaintiffs face irreparable harm and stressed that testimony and official statements showed the detention site was a federal project in practice.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security requested the facility, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspected the facility and both DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis publicly said the federal government would fund it. That, the judge argued, makes it a “major federal action” subject to environmental review.
    


            Eve Samples, the executive director for Friends of the Everglades – a plaintiff in the environmental lawsuit – told CNN “the case is far from over.”
    


            “In fact, it's just starting, and we're committed to fighting on,” she said. “We're hopeful that the appeal of the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it's reviewed on its merits during the appeal.”
    


            Elise Bennett, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another plaintiff in the case, described the ruling as a “heartbreaking blow to America's Everglades and every living creature there.”

            “I know many are questioning why the Trump and DeSantis administrations are insisting on pouring millions of taxpayer dollars into this dirty, destructive detention facility in the heart of the Everglades,” she told CNN. “Our legal system can and should stop this incredibly harmful boondoggle.”
    


            The next step, according to Bennett, is that a freshly-selected panel of appellate judges will now decide whether to reinstate the injunction to shut down the Everglades facility or strike it down altogether.
    


            “The mission continues,” DeSantis said in a video statement celebrating the appellate panel's decision. “Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we've always said, open for business.”
    


            It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July.
    


            The remote migrant detention camp deep in the marshy wetlands of the Everglades has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.
    


            And the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – a Native American tribe whose reservation lies within miles of the facility – had raised concerns about the impact the facility will have on their land and the environmentally sensitive area, including the plants and animals that inhabit the Everglades.
    


            “The project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” US District Judge Kathleen Williams said in her order in late August.
    


            Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

Oops.

The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening to decide whether President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff policy is lawful. Two federal courts, and a total of 10 federal judges, have all concluded that it is not.

The remarkable thing about Trump's petition asking the justices to take up this case, which is known as Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, it that it opens with a long list of factual claims that, if taken seriously by the Court, would compel the justices to strike down the tariffs. But that would assume the Republican-controlled Supreme Court applies the same limits on executive power to Trump that it imposed on Democratic President Joe Biden — a highly uncertain proposition.

During the Biden administration, the Republican justices relied on something called the “major questions doctrine” to strike down several of Biden's policies. The Court's Republicans only recently invented this doctrine. It has no basis in law, and it has only ever been used against one president in history: Joe Biden.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

That said, the Court did preview the doctrine in an Obama-era decision that applied it to a hypothetical regulation. In that case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014), the Republican justices announced that “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'” The idea was that, even if a federal law can be read to permit the executive to enact a particular policy, courts should read those laws narrowly if the policy is too ambitious.

Indeed, under Biden, the Court even used this recently made-up doctrine to strike down policies that are unambiguously authorized by federal law. In Biden v. Nebraska (2023), the Republican justices struck down the Biden administration's attempt to cancel many student loans. But federal law could not possibly have been clearer that the executive is permitted to cancel these loans.

The relevant statute gave the education secretary broad authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs” during a national emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The secretary could use this power, moreover, “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans.

Nevertheless, the Republican justices overrode this statute, pointing to the loan cancellation plan's high price tag of “between $469 billion and $519 billion.” The “economic and political significance” of such a plan, they concluded, “is staggering by any measure.” And thus the program must be canceled.

Which brings us back to Trump's petition asking the justices to hear the tariffs case. That petition describes the tariffs as Trump's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative.” It claims that the tariff is necessary to close US trade deficits of “$1.2 trillion per year.” It alleges that the tariffs have given Trump leverage to extract multi-trillion-dollar concessions from foreign nations. And it also claims that the increased taxes Trump has unilaterally imposed on imports — taxes that will largely be paid by the American consumer — “will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.”

Trump, in other words, claims that the economic significance of these tariffs is an order of magnitude greater than the significance of the student loan program at issue in Nebraska — the one the Republican justices said they must strike down because its significance is “staggering by any measure.”

To be sure, it's never a good idea for a court to base its decisions on factual claims made by this particular administration. But independent analysis confirms that the economic and political significance of the tariffs is at least as “staggering” as the significance of Biden's student loan program. An August analysis of the tariffs by Yale's Budget Lab, for example, concluded that Trump's tariffs will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025, and that the tariffs will raise $2.7 trillion in taxes over a 10-year window.

It would seem, then, that a straightforward application of the major questions doctrine compels this Court to invalidate Trump's tariffs. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh already appears to be looking for a way to bail out Trump. Concurring in FCC v. Consumers' Research (2025), Kavanaugh suggested that this newly invented doctrine does not apply to “foreign policy contexts.”

Trump's petition also suggests other ways the Court could exempt him from the doctrine, including a claim that the doctrine doesn't apply when the president personally authorizes a federal policy, instead of promulgating that policy through a federal agency.

Are these arguments persuasive? The truth is that there's no such thing as a persuasive argument involving the major questions doctrine, because the whole thing is a figment of the Republican justices' imagination. The Court has never published a majority opinion claiming that this doctrine can be found in any provision of the Constitution, or in any federal statute. And while some individual justices have offered their own explanations of where this recently invented doctrine comes from, those explanations range from silly to ridiculous.

Concurring in Nebraska, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett claimed that the doctrine is implicit in a parable about a babysitter.

Asking whether the doctrine applies to foreign policy decisions, in other words, is a bit like asking your daughter whether her imaginary friend likes fried chicken. The answer is whatever your daughter wants it to be.

As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this year, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.” If the major questions doctrine derived from a constitutional provision, then the justices could read that provision to determine if it contains a foreign policy exception. If it derived from a statute, they could refer to the statute.

But, because the major questions doctrine is simply something that the Republican justices made up, there is no principled way to determine if it conveniently contains an exception that just happens to rescue a Republican president's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative” from invalidation.

That said, courts are supposed to apply the same rules to Democratic presidents that they apply to Republicans. If the Republican justices actually buy Trump's claim that he is exempt, that will leave little doubt that these justices are simply playing Calvinball — creating one set of rules to spite Democrats, and a different, far more favorable set of rules for Republicans.

            Billionaire and onetime top White House advisor Elon Musk said he was invited to a tech leader summit at the White House's newly renovated Rose Garden on Thursday, but will not be attending.
    


            “I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there,” Musk said on Thursday, replying to an X user who asked why the xAI, SpaceX and Tesla leader was not invited.
    


            The guest list for Thursday's event includes Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, according to a White House official.
    


            The fact that Musk was invited could be a sign that the relationship between Musk and the White House is thawing. Once referred to as “the first buddy,” and near constant presence at President Donald Trump's side, Musk had a messy blowup with the president this summer after leaving his position at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk even vowed to support primary challengers of Republicans who voted for Trump's signature funding bill, and he claimed he would be starting a new political party, although there does not seem to have been any movement on that front.
    


            The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
    


            In recent days, public comments from Trump and Vice President JD Vance seem to suggest Musk would be welcomed back into the fold.
    


            Speaking to CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his podcast this week, Trump said Musk is “a man of common sense,” a “good man,” even though he “got off the reservation incorrectly.”
    


            “He's got 80% super genius and then 20% he's got some problems. When he works out the 20%, he'll be great,” Trump said. “I liked him… I like him now.”
    


            In an interview last month with far-right outlet Gateway Pundit, Vance called Musk's relationship with the Trump White House “complicated.” But he said he expects and hopes Musk will support the Republican Party by next November's midterm elections.
    


            “My argument to Elon is like, you're not going to be on the left, even if you wanted to be — and he doesn't — they're not going to have your back. That ship has sailed. So I really think it's a mistake for him to try to break from the president,” Vance said.
    


            Musk has backed off attacking the administration on X and, in some cases, appears to be fully supporting the White House. Last month, he replied with a fire emoji and a laughing emoji to a post from White House communications adviser Margo Martin, who captioned a photo: “President @realDonaldTrump showing President Zelenskyy and President Macron his 4 More Years hat.”
    


            The White House invitation could also be a lesson in history: Musk was famously not invited to a White House summit on electric vehicles in 2021 during President Joe Biden's administration. (Part of the reason appeared to be because Tesla is a nonunion automaker.) Musk has been vocal about how much he continues to be upset over the snub.
    


            On Thursday, he reposted a 2023 interview where he said Biden “added insult to injury” and hurt the company by claiming at the event that General Motors was “leading the electric car revolution” while Tesla made far more EV cars.
    


            Musk reposted the 2023 video with the comment: “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them.”

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman discusses President Donald Trump speaking with Volodomyr Zelenskyy after Vladimir Putin met Xi Jingping and Kim Jong Un in China.

President Donald Trump called on European leaders to stop "funding" Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine and accused them of failing to pressure China.

In a statement to Fox News Digital following a call between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who met in Paris for a Coalition of the Willing summit, a White House official said, "President Trump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war – as Russia received €1.1 billion [nearly $1.3 billion] in fuel sales from the EU in one year. 

"The President also emphasized that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia's war efforts," the official added.

PUTIN INVITES ZELENSKYY TO A MEETING IN MOSCOW FOR SECURITY TALKS AS HE BOMBS UKRAINE

The EU has drastically cut its imports of Russian oil following the invasion of Ukraine, though the president's comments point out that it has not completely cut off its energy imports from Moscow. 

The White House did not confirm where it pulled its figures from or the period of time it referenced. 

The official highlighted the fact that the U.S. under Trump has not been a member of the Coalition aimed at backing Ukraine, and said, "[French] President [Emmanuel] Macron and European leaders called President Trump into their ‘Coalition of the Willing' meeting."

White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff also attended the meeting in Paris and was seen giving Zelenskyy a handshake and a hug at the beginning of the meeting on Thursday, according to a video posted by Macron's office. 

Despite the tough tone from the White House, Macron described the Coalition of the Willing as having "made real progress in Paris" on Thursday. 

It remains unclear what specifically was ironed out during the summit, though Macron said following the meeting that some 26 nations had agreed to deploy troops "by land, sea or air" to Ukraine the day after a ceasefire deal is secured, reported the BBC – a move that Putin has repeatedly condemned.

In a post on X, Zelenskyy said the meeting focused on how to up the "pressure" on Putin to end his three-and-a-half-year-long war. 

"We talked about how to push the situation toward real peace," Zelenskyy said. "We discussed different options, and the most important is pressure, using strong measures, particularly economic ones, to force an end to the war. 

"The key to peace is depriving Russia's war machine of money, depriving it of resources," he added. 

Zelenskyy also said the leaders discussed how to better defend Ukraine's skies from the constant barrage of missile and drone attacks by Russia, though the White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions on whether the U.S. has pledged further support.

"Ukraine has proposed a format for protecting our skies for the U.S. to consider," Zelenskyy said. "I thank President Trump for supporting our people. We agreed on further contacts."

The meeting came just one day after Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Bejing for a military parade commemorating the cessation of World War II hostilities 80 years ago.

Both China and North Korea have remained steadfast supporters of Putin during his war in Ukraine and amid rebuke from the West.

Putin on Wednesday also invited Zelenskyy to meet with him in Moscow, which Ukrainian and Western security officials have flagged as disingenuous amid pressure from Trump for the pair to meet. 

Trump said he will speak with Putin in the coming days.

Join Fox Nation to learn the story of one of America's favorite games.

A 1930s California beach boy, Walter Frederick Morrison, saw enormous opportunity in the playtime practice of skimming pie plates through the air.

That original vision led a worldwide sensation that's explored in detail in a new Fox Nation special. 

"Meet the American" has returned for Season 2 with "America's Newsroom" co-anchor Bill Hemmer showcasing an array of stories that make America great.

'MEET THE AMERICAN' VETERAN WHO CREATED PICKLEBALL AND FIND OUT HOW HE DID IT

Each episode highlights the individuals whose ideas, perseverance or innovations have left an enduring imprint on American culture with a full episode devoted to the roots of the game of Frisbee. 

Fox News' Hemmer recounts the remarkable story of fighter pilot Morrison, who invented the game after World War II.

Students at Yale and other New England schools had been tossing around empty pie tins from the Frisbie Baking Company in Connecticut, according to the Strong National Museum of Play. 

Morrison, together with Warren Franscioni, turned the casual activity into a game, developing a plastic disc version in 1948.

Wham-O toy founders purchased the rights in 1955, officially naming the flying saucer "Frisbee" in 1958.

"It was an instant phenomenon," Tristan Lin, brand director for Wham-O, previously told Fox News Digital.

"Before you knew it, every college kid in America was playing Frisbee."

The game soared in popularity, with Wham-O toy inventor Ed Headrick and other enthusiasts founding the International Frisbee Association in 1967.

"Before you knew it, every college kid in America was playing Frisbee," said a brand director for Wham-O.  (iStock)

A Frisbee Golf Tournament followed a year later in California, while Ultimate Frisbee was later invented in New Jersey.

Eventually, Headrick left Wham-O to start "disc golf."

Today, the Professional Disc Golf Association hosts tournaments with participants from all over the world. 

As Smithsonian Magazine noted, "The flying disc had humble beginnings but has since become an international phenomenon."

The world's largest and most enduring iceberg is splintering into smaller pieces, to the point that it's no longer the biggest chunk of ice floating in the oceans. It's currently drifting between the southern tips of Africa and South America

The world's largest and most enduring iceberg is splintering into smaller pieces, to the point that it's no longer the biggest chunk of ice floating in the oceans. 

The shrinking megaberg, known as A23A, is unlikely to survive through the end of November and may face a sudden and spectacular collapse like an avalanche of ice at sea, said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos.

“It's an interesting thing to watch, certainly not unprecedented,” Scambos said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press. “But every time these happen, it's sort of a big spectacular event.”

Because ice shelves already float on water, ice reductions like this won't raise the sea level. But the reduction in ice shelves will cause melting land glaciers to flow into the oceans, and that causes sea levels to rise a few feet (meters).

A23A first broke away from Antarctica's Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986 along a massive crack that scientist first noticed in the 1950s and called “the Grand Chasm.” It hovered close to the southern continent for about three-and-a-half decades uneventfully until the last couple years when it drifted north to the place where massive icebergs go to die, around South Georgia Island, Scambos said.

Earlier this year the iceberg was the size of Rhode Island and weighed in at a trillion tons, now it's down to the size of Houston and shrinking fast. The world's new biggest iceberg is D15A. It's nearly twice as big as the shrunken A23A, according to Andrew Meijers of the British Antarctic Survey.

A23A has already spawned smaller chunks named A23D, A23E and A23F. NASA satellite images Thursday show the smaller bergs that weren't detached on Saturday, just a few days before. 




“It's still quite thick, but it's a lot thinner than it was when it left the continent,” Scambos said. “And so now it's being flexed by long period waves, by tides, which sweep across the area. And with that flexing, even though it's incredibly gentle and subtle. It's finding weak spots in the iceberg, and those are breaking off.

“I expect its fracturing will accelerate,” Meijers said via email. As the iceberg moves further north and the Antarctic spring begins Meijers expects by the end of the season, A23A will likely rapidly fall apart into chunks too small to track, he said.

If the iceberg survives the Antarctic spring, the summer looks even more brutal, Scambos said. That's when it can collapse with warm water even at the top and it will then look “sort of like an avalanche that's floating” and even fall apart in a single day, he said.

Back in January, Meijers, who visited the iceberg at the end of 2023, painted a different picture of A23A: “The iceberg itself is colossal and it stretches from horizon to horizon ... It's a huge wall, a Game of Thrones style wall of ice that towers above the ship.”

Megabergs spawning is a natural process that has happened for centuries, Meijers said, and so is their breaking apart around South Georgia Island when the current and warmer waters get hold of them, Scambos said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not mince words when speaking about handling drug trafficking and said President Donald Trump "wants to wage war" against narco traffickers.

The Trump administration is taking a hard stance against drug traffickers. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in Ecuador during a joint news conference with the country's foreign minister that President Donald Trump is looking to "wage war" against narco-terrorists. 

"It's a war on killers. It's a war on terror. These are not narco-traffickers, these are narco-terrorists who terrorize the countries they operate in," Rubio said.

While he said that the U.S. was prepared to support Ecuador in its fight against drug traffickers, he added that the relationship between the two countries would not be about security only. The secretary of state said the U.S. is looking to expand its already "vibrant economic relationship" with the South American nation.

The remarks came as he announced the new designations of Los Choneros and Los Lobos as foreign terrorist organizations. Both groups originated in Ecuador. Additionally, the U.S. committed $13.7 million to combat drugs and crime, as well as $6 million worth of unmanned aircraft vehicle system (UAVS) for the Ecuadorian Navy.

RUBIO PROMISES MORE STRIKES ON VENEZUELAN CARTELS: ‘WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT BACK ANYMORE'

Rubio emphasized the importance of the designation, saying that it allows the nations to share intelligence that "can be actioned for potentially lethal operations," which would allow the host country to take out the terrorists.

The secretary of state also discussed threats from Venezuela and the U.S. strike on the country. He claimed that the United Nations has suggested that Venezuela is not involved in the drug trade.

"I don't care what the U.N. says. The U.N. doesn't know what they're talking about. Maduro is indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York," Rubio said of the Venezuelan dictator.

"That means the Southern District of New York presented the evidence to a grand jury, and a grand jury indicted him. And then a superseding indictment came out that was unsealed about a year and a half ago that specifically detailed Maduro's actions. So, number one, let there be no doubt he, Nicolás Maduro, is an indicted drug trafficker in the United States, and he's a fugitive of American justice."

Rubio also referenced "cooperative governments," which he said would help the U.S. identify and locate drug traffickers.

"They're going to help us identify them – they're going to help us find these people and blow them up, if that's what it takes. They're going to help us with it," Rubio said. 

Earlier this week, U.S. Marines carried out an unprecedented strike on a cartel-operated vessel off of Venezuela. This signaled that the Trump administration was taking a tougher new approach to countering the international drug trade. The strike killed 11 members of Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration designated as a terrorist organization in February.

"Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "BEWARE!"

Republicans and Democrats scrutinized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for more than three hours Thursday morning on Capitol Hill.

The hearing was scheduled as a review of President Donald Trump's healthcare agenda, but it quickly became a referendum on Kennedy's leadership of the sprawling department, with the heated conversation ranging from abortion to COVID-19 policy, to the recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez.

Here are some of the highlights from the more than three hours of Kennedy's testimony, which at times veered into confrontation and personal accusations.

Kennedy lambasted Monarez's credibility when asked repeatedly by Democrats and Republicans about the cause for her termination last week.

He flatly said that Monarez lied when she wrote in her Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that Kennedy told her to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel,” whose members were handpicked by the secretary.

“No, I did not say that to her, and I never had a private meeting with her other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say I never said that,” Kennedy said.

Later in the hearing, Kennedy said he fired her because she admitted that she was untrustworthy.

“I told her that she had to resign because I asked her, ‘Are you a trustworthy person?' And she said, ‘No,'” Kennedy said.

Monarez's lawyers told the Washington Examiner that they dismiss Kennedy's claims “as false and, at times, patently ridiculous” and that she stands by what she wrote in her op-ed.

A handful of Republicans criticized Kennedy's move to restrict approvals for COVID-19 vaccines to only those with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease, including seniors over age 65.

Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and John Barrasso (R-WY), both physicians, said their professional colleagues have expressed concern that Kennedy's administration is limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines, because HHS approval is essential for insurance coverage of the shots.

Cassidy tripped up Kennedy about whether to praise Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that fast-tracked mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during the first Trump administration.

Kennedy said Trump “absolutely” deserved a Nobel Prize for the effort, but Cassidy then quickly noted that Kennedy has, on record, said the COVID-19 vaccine killed more people than the disease itself.

Kennedy defended his record by saying that he supported Operation Warp Speed itself but that he opposed the top-down mandates for the vaccine during the Biden administration.

Sens. James Lankford (R-OK) and Steve Daines (R-MT) questioned Kennedy on the timing of the promised safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone.

The secretary said he spoke with Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary about the matter in advance of the hearing, who said that the review of mifepristone is “progressing apace.”

“We're getting data, and all the time new data that we're reviewing,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy referenced a study published by the anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center this summer using insurance data that concluded that the complication rate of mifepristone is roughly 11%. This includes hemorrhaging and severe infections due to incomplete abortions.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) questioned Kennedy about whether he supported letting the extended premium tax credits for Obamacare exchange insurance plans lapse by the end of the year.

The tax credits, which Democrats passed as part of COVID-19 relief efforts in 2021 and 2022, are likely to be a main focus of both chambers of Congress before the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown.

Kennedy declined to give a direct answer. Instead, he said Democrats “had two chances to make them permanent, and they didn't.”

“I want to fix the system, and that's what we're doing, fixing systematically to make premiums lower,” Kennedy said. “That's what President Trump wants.”

Kennedy clashed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

Warren argued that Kennedy curbed access to the vaccines by limiting the recommendation for shots only to people with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease. Because the shots are not recommended, she said, they are not available at many pharmacies or covered by insurance.

Kennedy said the vaccines were not intended for healthy people. As the exchange became heated, he attacked Warren as having received funding from the industry.

“I'm not taking them away,” he later said. “Everyone can get access to them.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century.

The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. The company plans to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the results and then apply for Food and Drug Administration approval.

Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards.

“I see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,” said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University's psychedelic center and was not involved in the research.




Psychedelics are in the midst of a popular and scientific comeback, with conferences, documentaries, books and medical journals exploring their potential for conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The FDA has designated psilocybin, MDMA and now LSD as potential “breakthrough” therapies based on early results.

Still, the drugs have not had a glide path to the market.

Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA — also known as ecstasy — as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues.

The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.

MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.

The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD — under professional supervision, but without therapy — and then were followed for about three months.

The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted. 

“In many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,” he said.

For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.

At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose — 100 micrograms — continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.

Patients who got dummy pills also improved — a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies — but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.

The research was not immune to problems seen in similar studies.

Most patients were able to correctly guess whether they'd received LSD or a dummy pill, undercutting the “blinded” approach that's considered critical to objectively establishing the benefits of a new medicine. In addition, a significant portion of patients in both the placebo and treatment groups dropped out early, narrowing the final data set.

It also wasn't clear how long patients might continue to benefit.

Mindmed is conducting two large, late-stage trials that will track patients over a longer period of time and, if successful, be submitted for FDA approval.

“It's possible that some people may need retreatment,” said Dr. Maurizio Fava of Mass General Brigham Hospital, the study's lead author and an adviser to Mindmed. “How many retreatments, we don't know yet, but the long-lasting effect is quite significant.”

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials have expressed interest in psychedelic therapy, suggesting it could receive fast-track review for veterans and others suffering psychological wounds.

Generalized anxiety disorder is among the most common mental disorders, affecting nearly 3% of U.S. adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.

The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn't new.

In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to “turn on, tune in and dropout.”

A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs — without any medical use and high potential for abuse — essentially halted U.S. research.

When a handful of nonprofits begin reassessing the drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, they focused on lesser-known hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin, the main ingredient in magic mushrooms, to avoid the historic controversies surrounding LSD.

“LSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,” Fava said.

In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner about how many Americans have died from COVID-19, RFK Jr. claimed that nobody knows because of a lack of government data.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., facing pointed bipartisan questioning at a rancorous three-hour Senate committee hearing on Thursday, tried to defend his efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and explain the turmoil he has created at federal health agencies.

Kennedy said the fired CDC director was untrustworthy, stood by his past anti-vaccine rhetoric, and disputed reports of people saying they have had difficulty getting COVID-19 shots.

Medical groups and several Democrats in Congress have called for Kennedy to be fired, and his exchanges with Democratic senators on the panel repeatedly devolved into shouting, from both sides.

But some Republican senators also expressed unease with his changes to COVID-19 policies.

The GOP senators noted that Kennedy said President Donald Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for the 2020 Operation Warp Speed initiative to quickly develop mRNA COVID-19 vaccines — and that he also had attacked the safety and continued use of those very shots.

“I can't tell where you are on Operation Warp Speed,” said Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.

Tillis and others asked him why the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was fired last week, less than a month into her tenure.




Kennedy said she was dishonest, and that CDC leaders who left the agency last week in support of her deserved to be fired.

He also criticized CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic tied to lockdowns and masking policies, and claimed — wrongly — that they “failed to do anything about the disease itself.”

“The people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving,” Kennedy said. He later said they deserved to be fired for not doing enough to control chronic disease.

The Senate Finance Committee had called Kennedy to a hearing about his plans to “Make America Healthy Again,” but Democratic senators pressed Kennedy on his actions around vaccines. 

At the start of the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon tried to have Kennedy formally sworn in as a witness, saying the HHS secretary has a history of lying to the committee. The committee's chair, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, denied the Democrat's request, saying “the bottom line is we will let the secretary make his own case.”

Wyden went on to attack Kennedy, saying he had “stacked the deck” of a vaccines advisory committee by replacing scientists with “skeptics and conspiracy theorists.” 

Last week, the Trump administration fired the CDC's director — a Trump appointee who was confirmed by the Senate — less than a month into her tenure. Several top CDC leaders resigned in protest, leaving the agency in turmoil.

The ousted director, Susan Monarez, wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that Kennedy was trying to weaken public health protections.

“I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote. “It is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.”

Kennedy told senators he didn't make such an ultimatum, though he did concede that he had ordered Monarez to fire career CDC scientists.

Kennedy pushed back on concerns raised by multiple Republican senators, including Tillis and Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Both Barrasso and Cassidy are physicians.

The health secretary had animated comebacks as Democratic senators pressed him on the effects of his words and actions.

When Sen. Raphael Warnock, of Georgia, questioned Kennedy about his disparaging rhetoric about CDC employees before a deadly shooting at the agency this summer, Kennedy shot back: “Are you complicit in the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Kennedy called Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico “ridiculous,” said he was “talking gibberish” and accused him of “not understanding how the world works” when Lujan asked Kennedy to pledge to share protocols of any research Kennedy was commissioning into autism and vaccines.

He also engaged in a heated, loud exchanges with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota.

“I didn't even hear your question,” Kennedy replied to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto as the Nevada Democrat repeatedly asked what the agency was doing to lower drug costs for seniors.

He also told Sen. Bernie Sanders that the Vermont independent was not “making any sense.” 

Some senators had their own choice words.

“You're interrupting me, and sir, you're a charlatan. That's what you are, ” said Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat. “The history on vaccines is very clear.”

As the hearing neared its end, Kennedy pulled his cellphone from his pocket and then tapped and scrolled as Wyden asked about mifepristone, a drug used for medication abortion.

In May, Kennedy — a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement — announced COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a move opposed by medical and public health groups.

In June, he abruptly fired a panel of experts that had been advising the government on vaccine policy. He replaced them with a handpicked group that included several vaccine skeptics, and then shut the door to several doctors groups that had long helped form the committee's recommendations.

Kennedy has voiced distrust of research that showed the COVID-19 vaccines saved lives, and at Thursday's hearing even cast doubt on statistics about how people died during the pandemic and on estimates about how many deaths were averted — statistics produced by the agencies he oversees.

He said federal health policy would be based on gold standard science, but confessed that he wouldn't necessarily wait for studies to be completed before taking action against, for example, potential causes of chronic illness.

“We are not waiting for everything to come in. We are starting now,” he said.

A number of medical groups say Kennedy can't be counted on to make decisions based on robust medical evidence. In a statement Wednesday, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and 20 other medical and public health organizations issued a joint statement calling on him to resign.

“Our country needs leadership that will promote open, honest dialogue, not disregard decades of lifesaving science, spread misinformation, reverse medical progress and decimate programs that keep us safe,” the statement said.

Many of the nation's leading public health and medical societies, including the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have decried Kennedy's policies and warn they will drive up rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley and former principal deputy assistant attorney general Tom Dupree discuss the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton and more on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

The FBI raid on John Bolton's home last month led to the seizure of multiple computers, cell phones, USB drives and documents in folders labeled "Trump," among other items, court documents revealed Thursday.

The list of over a dozen items seized from the Bethesda, Md., home of President Donald Trump's former national security advisor was included in search warrant documents filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.

Among the technology seized from Bolton's home were two iPhones – a red one with two camera lenses and a black one in a black case – and three computers, including a silver Dell XPS laptop with cables, a Dell Precision Tower computer model 3620 and a Dell Inspiron 2330 computer. One Seagate hard drive and two Sandisk 64 gigabyte USB drives were also seized.

The list shows the FBI also took a white binder labeled, "Statements and Reflections to Allied Strikes..." and typed documents in folders labeled "Trump I-IV."

Four boxes containing what federal officials called "printed daily activities" were also hauled from Bolton's home.

The FBI raid on Aug. 22 is reportedly linked to a probe of mishandling classified documents.

During Trump's first administration, a probe into classified documents was launched but later shut down by the Biden administration. The Justice Department argued that Bolton's 2020 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," contained classified material and attempted to block it from being published.

Days after the raid on his home, Bolton unleashed a blistering critique of Trump's Ukraine policy in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner, claiming it is marked by "confusion, haste and disarray." 

THE HISTORY OF HOW TRUMP AND BOLTON'S RELATIONSHIP FELL TO TATTERS

Bolton said Trump's attempt to fast-track a peace deal was "inevitably" doomed, arguing the Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Aug. 15 was arranged at a pace "almost surely unprecedented in modern history."

When reporters asked Trump about the raid shortly after it unfolded, the president didn't hold back his disdain for his former adviser.

"I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real lowlife," Trump told reporters, adding that he did not know about the raid ahead of time, claiming he saw it on television. He went on to call Bolton "not a smart guy" and said "he could be very unpatriotic."

Bolton was Trump's national security advisor in 2018 and 2019, until the pair had a falling out. Trump revoked Bolton's security clearance and Secret Service detail in January 2025.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia on Thursday challenged President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Washington, asking a federal court to intervene even as he plans to send troops to other cities in the name of driving down crime.

Brian Schwalb, the district's elected attorney general, said in a lawsuit that the deployment, which now involves more than 1,000 troops, is an illegal use of the military for domestic law enforcement. 

“No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,” Schwalb wrote.

The White House said deploying the Guard to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement is within Trump's authority as president.

“This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. 



Members of the D.C. National Guard have had their orders extended through December, according to a Guard official. While that does not necessarily mean all those troops will serve that long, it is a strong indication that their role will not wind down soon.




The Republican president has credited the weekslong surge in Washington with reining in crime and said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore, despite staunch opposition in those Democrat-led cities. In the nation's capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has backed up some of Trump's claims that crime is down during the takeover. Still, data shows and critics argue that crime was already falling before the surge.

Bowser said Thursday that her focus is on preparing for when the emergency ends, which under the law would be Sept. 10, unless Congress extends it. In the order she issued this week, that preparation centered on how the District could best coordinate with and communicate with the federal law enforcement agencies that will likely remain in contact with the city's citizens.

A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids in June was illegal. It does not directly apply to Washington, where the president has more control over the Guard than in states. 

Several GOP-led states have added National Guard troops to the ranks of those patrolling the streets and neighborhoods of the nation's capital. 

Schwalb's filing contends the deployment also violates Washington's Home Rule Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973, and wrongly asserts federal control over units from other states.

The lawsuit is the second from Schwalb — whose office is separate from Washington's federal U.S. attorney, a presidential appointee — against the Trump administration since Trump asserted control over the city's police department and sent in the Guard. Those actions have been with protests from some residents. 

Violent crime has been an issue in the capital for years, though data showed it was on the decline when Trump intervened with an executive order on Aug. 11.

Bowser has pointed to a steep drop in offenses such as carjackings since it began, while also expressing reservations about the use of the Guard from other states. 

There are clear divides between some D.C. Council members and Bowser, whom critics have accused of acquiescing to the administration.

Speaking at a Free DC “Federal Forces Out Now” news conference on Capitol Hill, one councilmember, Robert White, said his own young daughters do not see the military personnel and officers as protectors. 

“They are here to catch them, to condemn them, to take away their rights,” he said. 

White said when history is written about this moment “we will have to justify what we did and did not do. I'm not prepared to say that I capitulated. I'm prepared to stay the course. I'm not prepared to say I went along to get along.”

He encouraged the D.C. Council, Congress, the mayor and the district's attorney general to “stand together not in fear, not in compliance, but against an authoritarian takeover of our city.”

Democratic Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez on whether a federal surge would help combat crime, and Mayor Brandon Johnson's executive order and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's resistance to a crackdown on crime on 'Fox Report.'

Some Chicago aldermen are stressing the need for a stronger law enforcement presence and federal partnership as the city deals with crime.

President Donald Trump has hinted that there could be a federal surge in the city, which could include National Guard troops and immigration authorities, as Democratic leaders like Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker rail against the possibility. However, others have had a more nuanced take, as they want more support but not to the extent of sending in the guard.

"100% need help, 100% want help. I just don't wanna see 18, 19-year-old kids on the streets of Chicago with M-16s, I believe that's a recipe for disaster, so my preference would be money to hire more police," Alderman Nicholas Sposato told Fox News Channel's "America Reports" on Wednesday. Sposato is only one of two independents on the city council, as 48 out of 50 are Democrats.

"But the president and the governor need to talk and figure something out," he added.

The other independent on the board, Alderman Anthony Napolitano, told FOX Business Network's "The Bottom Line," there's a "gang problem" in the city.

"It's hypocrisy because our politicians here are always putting politics and agenda over people in the city of Chicago," Napolitano, a former local police officer, said.

Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez, a Democrat, also raised concerns about crime in the city while talking to Fox News Channel's "Fox Report" on Sunday.

"I think a federal surge would, in fact, be helpful. Even though we see our statistics are trending in the right direction, who would argue against making them trend even further, even lower, meaning less victims on the street," he said.

"It's absolutely asinine to me hear my Democratic colleagues say that we don't want more help," he added, noting that the city has typically welcomed help from federal agencies like the FBI and the ATF.

Meanwhile, Washington D.C., has seen a sharp decrease in various crimes since the federal takeover last month. Although many Democrats have criticized the decision to have troops patrolling the streets, the presence of additional law enforcement won the praise of Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat who was originally critical of the policy.

"For carjackings, the difference between this period, this 20-day period of this federal surge and last year represents an 87% reduction in carjackings in Washington, D.C." Bowser said in a news conference last week. "We know that when carjackings go down, when use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason."

As for Johnson, he recently signed an executive order heavily limiting local law enforcement's ability to cooperate with federal authorities amid a possible surge.

"We will protect our Constitution, we will protect our city, and we will protect our people," Johnson said at a recent news conference. "We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents."

Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian designer who turned the concept of understated elegance into a multibillion-dollar fashion empire, has died, his fashion house confirmed. He was 91. (Sept. 4)

MILAN (AP) — Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian designer who turned the concept of understated elegance into a multibillion-dollar fashion empire, died Thursday, his fashion house confirmed. He was 91.

Armani died at home, “peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones,” the fashion house said. “Indefatigable to the end, he worked until his final days, dedicating himself to the company, the collections and the many ongoing and future projects,” the fashion house said in a statement. 

Armani, one of the most recognizable names and faces in the global fashion industry, missed Milan Fashion Week in June 2025 for the first time during the previews of Spring-Summer 2026 menswear to recover from an undisclosed condition. 

He was planning a major event to celebrate 50 years of his signature Giorgio Armani fashion house during Milan Fashion Week this month.

A public viewing will be held in the Armani Theater where he unveiled his ready-to-wear collections on Saturday and Sunday. The funeral will be held privately, and no details were released. 

Condolences and remembrances poured in from political leaders and other Milan fashion designers. 

“The world lost a giant today. He made history and will be remembered forever,'' said Donatella Versace, whose late brother Gianni Versace was a stylistic rival of Armani in the 1990s. 

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who often dressed in Armani's business attire, remembered the designer for his ”elegance, sobriety and creativity,” and said he was “a symbol of the best Italy.” 




Starting with an unlined jacket, a simple pair of pants and an urban palette, Armani put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s, creating an instantly recognizable relaxed silhouette that has propelled the fashion house for half a century.

From the executive office to the Hollywood screen, Armani dressed the rich and famous in classic tailored styles, fashioned in super-soft fabrics and muted tones. His handsome black tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show on award season red carpets.

At the time of his death, Armani had put together an empire worth over $10 billion, which along with clothing included accessories, home furnishings, perfumes, cosmetics, books, flowers and even chocolates, ranking him in the world's top 200 billionaires, according to Forbes.

The designer also owned several bars, clubs, restaurants and his own basketball team, EA7 Emporio Armani Milan, better known as Olympia Milano. Armani opened more than than 20 restaurants from Milan to Tokyo since 1998, and two hotels, one in Dubai in 2009 and another in Milan, in 2010.

Armani style began with Giorgio Armani himself, from the penetrating blue eyes framed in a permanent tan and early-age shock of silver hair, to the trademark dark trousers and T-shirt work clothes and the minimalist decoration of his private homes.

Armani's fashion vision was that of easygoing elegance where attention to detail made the difference.

“I design for real people. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothes and accessories that are not practical,” he liked to say when asked to identify his clientele.

In conversation, the designer's disarming smile and exquisitely mild manners belied the tough businessman underneath, who was able to turn creative talent into a fashion empire worth over $10 billion. Never a merger nor a sale, Re Giorgio (King George) as the Italians call him, was always his own boss.

Born July 11, 1934, in Piacenza, a small town south of Milan, Armani dreamed of becoming a doctor before a part-time job as a window decorator in a Milan department store opened his eyes to the world of fashion.

In 1975, Armani and his partner Sergio Galeotti sold their Volkswagen for $10,000 to start up their own menswear ready-to-wear label. Womenswear followed a year later.

The symbol of his new style was the liningless sports jacket, which was launched in the late 1970s and became an instant success from Hollywood to Wall Street. The designer paired the jacket with a simple t-shirt, an item of clothing he termed “the alpha and omega of the fashion alphabet.”

The Armani suit soon became a must in the closet of the well-heeled man. And for women, the introduction of the pantsuit in the executive workroom was all but revolutionary. Dubbed the “power suit” with its shoulder-padded jacket and man-tailored trousers, it became the trademark of the rising class of businesswomen in the 1980s.

Over the years Armani would soften the look with delicate detailing, luxurious fabrics and brighter shades for his basic beige and gray palette. His insistence on pants and jackets led some critics to label his fashion “androgynous.”

The 1980 film classic “American Gigolo” launched both Armani and actor Richard Gere on their Hollywood careers. Dressed in Armani, Gere became America's new favorite heartthrob, and “Geeorgeeo” as they called him, the glam set's most popular designer.

The Hollywood connection earned him wardrobe film credits in over 200 films, and in 2003 a place on Rodeo Drive's “Walk of Style.”

Oscar night always sparkled, with smart suiting for the men and glittering gowns for the ladies. The 2009 best actor winner Sean Penn picked up his statue in a black-on-black Armani outfit, while best actress nominee Anne Hathaway walked the red carpet in a shimmering white strapless evening gown from Armani's latest Prive couture collection.

Other longtime devotees included Jodie Foster, George Clooney, Sophia Loren and Brad Pitt. David and Victoria Beckham were the “face” of his 2009 underwear ad campaign.

So significant was the impact of Armani style, not only on how people dressed but how they approached fashion, that in 2000 New York's Guggenheim museum presented a retrospective of Armani's first 25 years in fashion.

“I love things that age well, things that don't date and become living examples of the absolute best,” Armani said of his efforts.

Armani, who maintained a firm grip on his empire and collections until the end, had been reluctant to discuss succession, but had announced a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider. 

He also indicated the creative succession would go to long-time collaborator Leo Dell'Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange. 

Today, the Armani empire has an army of more than 9,000 employees, who considered themselves part of a family, with women comprising half of the executive suite, along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023. Along with clothes and accessories, the company produces perfumes, cosmetics and home furnishings, as well as selling its own candy, flowers and even books. The designer opened his fifth multi-brand store on New York's fashionable Fifth Avenue in February 2009.

In the realm of fashion hobbies, Armani owned several bars, restaurants and clubs, as well as the basketball team. Recreation time was spent in getaways in Broni in the countryside near Milan, the isle of Pantelleria off Sicily and St. Tropez on the French Riviera. Each home bore the trademark of Armani design: bare walls, important pieces, few knickknacks.

Like many of his colleagues, Armani tried to give back some of the fame and fortune he amassed during the heyday of the “moda Milanese” which put Italian ready-to-wear at the center of the world's fashion map at the turn of the millennium. Personally involved in several charity organizations devoted to children and a staunch supporter of the battle against AIDS, in 2002 Armani was named a U.N. goodwill ambassador for refugees.

Galeotti died in 1985. Armani had no children but was very close to his niece Roberta. She abandoned a budding film career to become his director of public relations, and often represented her uncle, who wasn't much of a partygoer, at social events. More recently, she has been was a key go-between with the celebrity world as head of VIP relations. 

In 2006, she orchestrated the top-billed wedding of actors Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in a medieval castle outside Rome, while Uncle Giorgio designed the attire for both bride and groom.

Armani is survived by his sister Rosanna and her son Andrea Camerana; and nieces Silvana and Roberta, the daughters of his late brother Sergio.

Cassidy opened his remarks by saying he felt President Donald Trump deserved a Nobel prize for Operation Warp Speed, then said Kennedy's cancelation of $500 million in contracts related to the MRNA vaccine platform seems inconsistent.

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared before a congressional committee Thursday, where he faced questions about the turmoil at federal health agencies.

He told the committee that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leaders who left the agency last week deserved to be fired and criticized CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic tied to lockdowns and masking policies, claiming — wrongly — that they “failed to do anything about the disease itself.”

The U.S. Senate Finance Committee called Kennedy to a hearing about his plans to “Make America Healthy Again.” But the health secretary was grilled over layoffs and planned budget cuts that detractors say are wrecking the nation's ability to prevent disease.

Other news we're following today:








Several Democratic senators are releasing a new report from Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms that finds people who buy their own health insurance could see the largest rate increase in nearly a decade, if Congress doesn't extend tax credits for those plans.

“Pulling the rug out from under working families — especially at a time when so many are struggling to make ends meet — would be catastrophic,” said Sen. Jeanne Shahee, a New Hampshire Democrat. “I'm going to continue pushing hard on my Republican colleagues to actually come to the table and get this done.”

The report finds insurers have proposed raising their rates because of increasing health care costs and the expiration of the tax credits, which were started under the Affordable Care Act and increased by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some moderate Republicans are pushing to extend the tax credits, but it is unclear whether GOP leadership will take up the cause.

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid funding approved by Congress, including money that President Donald Trump said last week he won't be spending. 

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington ruled Wednesday the administration's decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal and likely arbitrary and capricious. He issued a preliminary injunction ordering the release of $11.5 billion that is set to expire at the end of the month. Messages to the White House and State Department were not immediately returned. 

The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.

Rubio challenged the findings of the latest U.N. World Drug Report, which does not give Venezuela the outsize role in drug smuggling that the White House has in recent months.

“I don't care what the U.N. says. The U.N. doesn't know what they're talking about,” Rubio said in a press conference, adding that Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro was indicted in Manhattan federal court, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine.

“Let there be no doubt,” Rubio said. “Nicolas Maduro is an indicted drug trafficker in the United States, and he's a fugitive of American justice.”

The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he warned allied countries that their plans to recognize a Palestinian state would “create big problems.”

He says it's not the way forward and that it would make it harder to get a ceasefire in Gaza and provoke a response from Israel.

France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium and others have announced the plans to mount pressure on Israel as humanitarian conditions deteriorate during the war in Gaza.

Rubio called it “all fake” and “not even real” and said Hamas walked away from talks the same day France made its announcement.

“Sometimes, you know, these guys don't listen, they do what they're going to do because of their own domestic politics,” Rubio said. “But these are consequences of that.”

For the small group of Americans who are opposed to childhood vaccine mandates, concerns about parental rights may be playing a larger role than worries about safety, a recent survey suggests.

A Harvard/SSRS poll from March found that among those who do not support routine childhood vaccine requirements, about 8 in 10 said a “major reason” for that opposition was that it should be the parents' choice whether or not to vaccinate their child.

Many fewer vaccine opposers said concerns about safety were a major reason.

Even though most support mandatory vaccinations for kids to attend school, polls show U.S. adults are less likely to think childhood immunizations are important than they were several decades ago.

The drop in support is driven largely by Republicans. 

Only about one-quarter of Republicans said it was “extremely important” for parents to get their children vaccinated in a 2024 Gallup survey, down from about half in 2019. About 6 in 10 Democrats say this is highly important — a number that's been steady in recent years.

The two parties began to diverge on the issue before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the gap widened substantially after 2019, when Republicans became much more likely to dismiss the importance of childhood vaccinations.

Most Americans say kids should be vaccinated to attend school — meaning Florida's plan to eliminate childhood vaccine mandates runs largely counter to national public opinion.

About 8 in 10 U.S. adults in a Harvard/SSRS poll said parents should be required to have children vaccinated against preventable diseases to attend school — including most Democrats and Republicans. And about 7 in 10 in a NYT/Ipsos poll said healthy children should have vaccine requirements because of the risk to others otherwise.

A 2024 Gallup poll found a narrower split, though, with about half of U.S. adults saying the government should require childhood vaccines. That's a dramatic shift from 1991, when 81% of Americans said the government should require childhood vaccinations.

Rubio said Trump wants more aggressive measures to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., saying he will “wage war” on drug trafficking groups.

“This time we're not just going to hunt for drug dealers in the little fast boats and say ‘let's try to arrest them,'” Rubio said in a press conference during his visit in Ecuador. “No, the president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they've been waging war on us for 30 years and no one has responded.”

Rubio contested U.S. actions were being directed more toward Venezuela, and not Mexico, because of its adversarial relation with the South American country.

“There's no need to do that in many cases with friendly governments, because the friendly governments are going to help us,” Rubio said. “They may do it themselves, and we'll help them do it.”

The secretary held his cellphone in his lap, tapping and scrolling as the panel's ranking member asked for a safety review of mifepristone, a drug used for medication abortion.

After Kennedy gave his commitment to use “good science and good scientists,” Wyden thanked him.

Minutes later, asked by chairman Sen. Mike Crapo if he had further points to clarify, Kennedy relented.

“I think I'll have mercy on everybody here and let us adjourn,” Kennedy said, after the three-hour-long hearing.

“Wise choice,” Crapo replied.

In response, Kennedy said that Smith was “just making stuff up.”

Kennedy did not say outright in a Fox News interview last week that antidepressants are responsible for school shootings. But he did suggest that they could play a role, saying that the National Institutes of Health is “launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence.”

SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are medications commonly used to treat mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday announced the designation of two ruthless Ecuadorian gangs as terrorist organizations.

Rubio's announcement against the Los Choneros and Los Lobos criminal groups came during his visit to Ecuador's capital, Quito. The groups are blamed for the surge in violence across the South American country that began since the pandemic.

Rubio told reporters in a joint press conference with Ecuador's foreign minister that the designation gives the U.S. “all sorts” of options “to stamp these groups out.”

Leaders of a Chicago suburb where there's a federal immigration processing center are telling residents that a Trump administration crackdown could last more than a month.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a recent letter to residents that the suburb will serve as the main processing center for the operation and be open 7 days a week for 45 days.

She cites communication from federal officials. Officials in the village of about 8,000 people declined to elaborate Thursday, saying they're focused on safety.Department of Homeland Security officials have also requested to use a Naval Station north of the city for logistical support.

Thompson says they're talking to area businesses about expected protests and traffic disruptions.

The developer of an offshore wind farm that would power 350,000 homes in the two states also said it is suing the Trump administration for stopping the nearly completed Revolution Wind project.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha accused Trump of waging an “all-out assault” on the wind energy industry. The two states and Danish energy company Orsted argue that the administration lacks the legal authority to block the wind project, which is 80% complete.

Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace declined to comment Thursday.

Revolution Wind is the second major wind project that Trump ordered to stop work. The first, an offshore wind project for New York, was later allowed to resume construction.

Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump's pick to join the Federal Reserve board, said Thursday that he would remain a White House employee even if the Senate confirms him to fill an unexpired term as a governor for the central bank.

Miran, who was nominated to fill a term set to expire in January, made the disclosure at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

He said he would instead take an “unpaid leave of absence” as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the advice of his lawyers and would only resign from the administration if he were nominated for a longer term at the Fed.

That's what Sen. Tina Smith asked Kennedy, contrasting his assertion during confirmation that he wasn't opposed to vaccines with his statements on a podcast that a safe and effective vaccine did not exist.

“Both things are true,” Kennedy said, attempting to say more before the Minnesota Democrat interrupted him.“No, actually I want you to listen to me,” Smith said, going on to say Kennedy had “stacked” a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.

Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump's pick to join the Federal Reserve board, said Thursday that he would remain a White House employee even if the Senate confirms him to fill an unexpired term as a governor for the central bank.

How does Kennedy actually feel about Operation Warp Speed? How did he go from supporting his CDC director to firing her less than a month later? Is it true that every American can get a COVID booster if they want it?

Those are some of the questions that senators have repeatedly asked Kennedy throughout the hearing, but Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, still spent his time saying he wants clearer answers from Kennedy or his staff.

Tillis' line of questioning emphasizes how many contradictions and muddled answers have come out of the hearing. Kennedy has repeatedly denied accusations and said senators were making things up as they grilled him for answers on his health care agenda.

While saying that anyone could get a booster shot, Kennedy also acknowledged that access “depends on the state.”

That came during an exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said Kennedy was contradicting promises made during his confirmation hearings that he wouldn't restrict vaccine access.

“It's not recommended for healthy people,” Kennedy went on.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has OK'd new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, but the approvals came with some new caveats.Until now, the U.S. — following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older. 

The question of who can get a shot is complicated for many people. The answer may depend on your age, laws and policies in the state where you live, insurance coverage and finding a health care professional who will give you the shot.

Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to “actually eliminate any terrorist threat.”

His remark during a meeting with Rubio and Ecuadorian cabinet members came two days after the U.S. military struck a boat in the Caribbean the White House has said was carrying members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, which President Trump declared a terrorist organization earlier this year.

Rubio arrived in Ecuador's capital, Quito, Wednesday after a stop in Mexico City.

In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner about how many Americans have died from COVID-19, Kennedy claimed nobody knows because of a lack of government data.

“I don't think anybody knows that, because there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC and there were so many perverse incentives,” he said.

But this data is easily accessible. Approximately 1.2 million Americans have died from the virus, according to both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Worth Health Organization.

He deflected questions from Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan about recent changes limiting access to COVID-19 shots for healthy children and adults.

Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID shots but only for seniors or younger people with underlying health risks. That's sparked confusion and frustration from some Americans, including parents interested in vaccinating healthy children against the virus.

Many pharmacies are unwilling or legally barred from giving vaccines outside the uses endorsed by the FDA and other federal authorities.

Kennedy said drugmakers did not provide the FDA with studies showing their vaccines significantly benefited healthy children and adults. People can still get a shot with a prescription from their doctor, Kennedy added.

Memos released by the FDA last week show the agency's top vaccine regulator, a Kennedy ally, overruled his staff in placing limits on COVID vaccines.

While opposed by many U.S. medical groups, the narrower criteria for seasonal shots mirrors many countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world.

Sen. Bill Cassidy tried to strike a balance between his support for President Trump and his medical ideals. He praised Trump's handing of COVID while suggesting Kennedy is making it more difficult for Americans to receive the vaccine.

The Louisiana Republican is already facing a crowded GOP primary field in his 2026 reelection bid. And after placing a key vote for Kennedy's nomination, his questions were under particular scrutiny.

Cassidy, also a medical doctor, asked about Kennedy's anti-vaccination stances. He also asked about members Kennedy has named to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations who've testified as expert witnesses in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies who developed the COVID vaccine.

“I would say you seem more interested in settlements than science,” Cassidy said, ending his time with Kennedy by saying, “Effectively, you are denying people vaccines.”

French President Emmanuel Macron and European leaders dialed up Trump after their hybrid talks on post-war security guarantees for Ukraine.

Trump during Thursday's call told the leaders that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that's funding the war, stressing Russia received €1.1 billion in fuel sales from the EU in one year, according to a White House official.

Trump also emphasized that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia's war efforts, according to the official, who wasn't authorized to comment publicly about the private talks and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Macron said Thursday following the meeting that 26 of Ukraine's allies have pledged to deploy troops as a “reassurance force” for the war-torn country once fighting ends in the conflict with Russia.

Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, an orthopedic surgeon, said he has “grown deeply concerned” that trust in vaccines could be in jeopardy under Kennedy's leadership.

“If we're going to make America healthy again, we can't allow public health to be undermined,” he told Kennedy. “I'm a doctor. Vaccines work.”

Kennedy told Barrasso that Americans have lost faith in the CDC and pledged to make health recommendations “clear, evidence-based and trustworthy.”

That's what Kennedy told Sen. Maggie Hassan repeatedly after she accused him of restricting COVID-19 vaccines, while having applauded their initial development.

Over and over, Kennedy decried Hassan's questions as “crazy talk” as the New Hampshire Democrat asked about why he “acted behind closed doors to overrule scientists” on vaccine access.

Last month, U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots but limited their use for many Americans — and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children. The new restrictions are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.

Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell asked Kennedy, who's said he flew on the now-disgraced financier's plane, what he thought about victims of Epstein who appeared on the steps of the Capitol this week to call for greater transparency into Epstein's operation and demise.

“I don't know about any women on the steps,” Kennedy told Cantwell, who tied critiques of the health secretary's decision-making to his ties to Epstein, and called Kennedy a “charlatan.”

Earlier in the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon criticized Kennedy for claiming he was “a protector of children” even though the secretary had said he had flown on Epstein's plane “on multiple occasions.”

During his exchange with Cassidy, Kennedy noted that Trump pushed development of the COVID-19 vaccine, but said he also “promoted therapeutics like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.”

The unproven treatments soared in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, largely among those skeptical of vaccines.

Ivermectin is an anti-parasite drug. Trump said he took hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, to try to prevent COVID-19.

In repeated tests, neither drug has been shown to effectively prevent or treat COVID-19.

Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat, called attention to Kennedy's appointments to a CDC vaccine advisory panel, many of whom have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation. The panel is scheduled for an upcoming review of recommendations for a series of common childhood vaccines.

“Should parents and schools in Colorado be prepared for more measles outbreaks as a result of that? How about more mumps outbreaks?” Bennet asked.

Kennedy said he didn't anticipate a change to recommendations for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine but said he thinks parents should be able to “make their own choices.”

The back-and-forth soon escalated into verbal warfare, with Kennedy and Bennet screaming questions at each other and accusing the other of failing to answer.

“I'm asking the questions,” Bennet screamed. “This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.”

The District of Columbia on Thursday sued to stop Trump's deployment of the National Guard during law enforcement intervention in Washington.

The city's attorney general, Brian Schwalb, said the hundreds of troops are essentially an “involuntary military occupation.” He argued in the federal lawsuit that the deployment is an illegal use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

A federal judge in California recently ruled that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles after days of protests over immigration raids in June was illegal. The Republican administration is appealing that decision and Trump has said he is ready to order federal intervention in Chicago and Baltimore, despite staunch opposition in those Democrat-led cities.

That ruling, however, does not directly apply to Washington, where the president has more control over the Guard than in states.

The Louisiana Republican opened by saying he felt Trump deserves a Nobel prize for Operation Warp Speed, then said Kennedy's cancellation of $500 million in contracts related to the MRNA vaccine platform “seems inconsistent.”

Cassidy, who voted for Kennedy's confirmation but admitted his skepticism of his qualifications at the time, requested his questioning time back as Kennedy repeatedly interrupted him.

“These institutions are not just delivering health access to rural Americans' economic centers or cultural centers, those communities are often the largest employer,” Kennedy told Sen. Mike Crapo.

The HHS secretary responded that as a result of the Republicans' signature tax and spending law, “We're infusing more than 50% increase in the amount of money that is going to rural communities,” calling it a significant investment.

Crapo contended the bill increased funding for rural hospitals.

The facts are more complicated.

Nonpartisan estimates say roughly 10 million people are expected to lose health insurance from the legislation. Most of those will lose Medicaid.

That will leave many hospitals with patients who can't afford to pay for emergency services. The changes are expected to disproportionately impact rural areas, where as many as 1 in 4 Americans rely on Medicaid to pay for health insurance, particularly hard.

Wyden's questioning of Kennedy went over the Democrat's allotted time and had to be gaveled out by the panel's chairman.

Wyden and Kennedy got into a heated exchange after the senator said the secretary “stacked the deck” of a vaccines committee, replacing scientists with “vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists.” Kennedy said his actions “got rid of the conflicts of interests” he said had pervaded such panels.

Kennedy also said he had support from scientists and doctors “all over the country.” Many of the nation's leading public health and medical societies, including the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have decried Kennedy's policies and warn they'll drive up rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Speaking on recent firings at the CDC, Kennedy called attention to a concern he often talks about — the chronic disease epidemic.

“That's why we have to fire people at the CDC,” he said. “They did not do their job.”

He accused the recently ousted director Susan Monarez of lying in her Wall Street Journal op-ed on Thursday when she said she was pressured to preapprove the recommendations of his vaccine advisory panel.

In his opening remarks to a Senate committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed “the recent shakeups at CDC,” personnel changes he called “absolutely necessary adjustments to restore the agency to its role as the world's gold standard.”

Toward the end of his opening remarks, Kennedy said he wanted to address “the recent shakeups at CDC,” personnel changes he called “absolutely necessary adjustments to restore the agency to its role as the world's gold standard.”

Kennedy went on to describe COVID-19-era recommendations and policies he said were implemented “with no science and heightened economic inequality,” like school closures.

Last week, the Trump administration fired the agency's director Susan Monarez. Several top CDC leaders resigned in protest, leaving the agency in turmoil.

Just as Kennedy first mentioned vaccine safety standards during his opening remarks, a protestor in a wheelchair shouted at the secretary and challenged whether he understood current policy and research surrounding vaccine safety.

“You're killing billions of people,” the protestor shouted at the back of the room as they were escorted out by Capitol Police.

Sen. Mike Crapo, the Finance Committee's chair, warned other attendees from speaking out and disrupting order after the protestor's removal.

As HHS Secretary, Kennedy has made a a string of decisions that have put the longtime vaccine critic's doubts about shots into full effect at the nation's health department.

As the hearing began, Wyden asked to have Kennedy formally sworn in as a witness, defying tradition, saying the HHS secretary has a history of lying to the Senate Finance Committee.

For example, Wyden said, Kennedy promised he would “do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines.” But under Kennedy, U.S. regulators have limited the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for many Americans.

Crapo denied Wyden's request, saying despite partisan disagreements among the senators on the committee, “the bottom line is we will let the secretary make his own case.”

Kennedy opened his remarks by expressing condolences for the family of David Rose, a law enforcement officer killed during the Aug. 8 shooting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta.

A man opened fire outside the agency headquarters, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus and killing Rose before being found dead in a nearby building.

Kennedy said he visited with Rose's family and said he “remains in our prayers.”

European leaders took part in a hybrid “Coalition of the Willing” meeting about Ukraine on Thursday and then held a phone call afterward with Trump to update him on their work.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also took part in the call with Trump, according to a person familiar with planning for the call who was not authorized to comment publicly.

“They expressed the hope that the United States would continue to make a substantial contribution to the joint efforts to support Ukraine, formulate security guarantees, and shape a productive diplomatic process,” German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in a statement following the meeting, which German Chancellor Friedrich Merz attended virtually.

Merz laid out three “areas of action,” including working toward a summit Zelenskyy would also participate in, and “a ceasefire must be agreed there.”

The White House did not offer any immediate comment.

The Oregon Democrat asked his Republican Senate colleagues, “What line must Robert Kennedy cross before some of you will also join this alarm?”

Seeking that Kennedy step down, alternatively Wyden called on Trump to “fire him before more people are hurt.”

Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said each senator will get five minutes to question Kennedy. He said he expects a “spirited debate.”

That started right away. While Crapo touted the administration's “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, the Democratic ranking member, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, argued Kennedy has prioritized “elevating junk science and fringe conspiracies.”

Before taking his seat, Kennedy briefly greeted the assembled senators, including Cassidy, a physician eyeing reelection.

The Louisiana Republican's support was critical to Kennedy's confirmation, but the two-term senator did publicly express concern about his anti-vaccination positions before voting to confirm Kennedy. This week, Cassidy said he wanted to “carefully frame” his questions to Kennedy at Thursday's hearing.

He was greeted by shouted reporter questions — as well as “We love you, Bobby” from supporters in the hallway — as he entered the Senate hearing room.

Kennedy did not answer questions but gave a wave before going inside.

Asked if he has confidence in the health secretary, Tillis, a Republican on the committee, said he wants to hear from Kennedy in person.

“He's got to reconcile what he said during his confirmation process with what we've seen over the past few months, particularly on vaccine policy,” Tillis said.

Members of the Senate Finance Committee are holding one of their regular hearings to conduct oversight of HHS and its programs. This one happens to fall at a time when Secretary Kennedy is facing a flurry of questions about his decision-making, particularly as it relates to vaccines and the CDC's work.

As is the case with any federal department, Congress could pass laws to direct its work, change its funding, or mandate changes in regulations, among many other things. But today's hearing is unlikely to lead to legislative action anytime soon, as Republicans in Congress have largely deferred to Trump and his agenda.

The longtime government scientist who ran afoul of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday in which she raises concerns about the way ahead for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention following her ouster.

“Public health shouldn't be partisan. Vaccines have saved millions of lives under administrations of both parties,” Monarez writes. “I was fired for holding that line. But the line doesn't disappear with me. It runs through every parent deciding whether to vaccinate a child, every physician counseling patients, and every American who demands accountability.”

Monarez was fired and replaced on an acting basis by Kennedy's top deputy, Jim O'Neill.

The White House said Monarez, who served for only 29 days, was “not aligned with” Trump's agenda. Monarez's lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

The first lady will gather with members of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education and private sector leaders later today.

Trump's made online protection of children a central part of her “Be Best” initiative. She said in a statement ahead of today's meeting that she won't be surprised if AI becomes the “greatest engine of progress” in U.S. history.

“But, as leaders and parents we must manage AI's growth responsibly,” she added. “During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children — empowering, but with watchful guidance. We are living in a moment of wonder, and it is our responsibility to prepare America's children.”

Cassidy's support was crucial to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation as Secretary of Health and Human Services. With firings and resignations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now prompting concern about a leadership breakdown at the nation's leading public health agency, the Louisiana lawmaker and physician is in a tight spot.

The two-term senator — who publicly expressed concern about Kennedy's anti-vaccination positions before voting to confirm him — has worried aloud about “serious allegations” at the CDC and has called for oversight, without blaming Kennedy.

But he was choosing his words carefully as he returned to Washington this week after the Senate's August recess and was preparing to question Kennedy during a finance committee meeting scheduled for Thursday. Cassidy told reporters he hadn't yet decided what to ask Kennedy, saying, “I want to carefully frame the question.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump's pick to join the Federal Reserve board, said Thursday that he would remain a White House employee even if the Senate confirms him to fill an unexpired term at the central bank.

Miran, who was nominated to fill a gubernatorial term set to expire in January, made the disclosure at a hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

He said that on the advice of his lawyers he would take an “unpaid leave of absence” as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Miran later said he would only resign from the Republican administration if he were nominated for a longer term at the Fed.

His answer instantly triggered alarm bells about the Fed's independence, suggesting that the central bank could ultimately become subservient to Trump's whims instead of its congressional mandates to keep prices stable and maximize employment. Political control of the Fed could erode the faith that the American population and investors worldwide place in the U.S. economy, which could threaten global markets and national prosperity.

Democrats blasted Miran's plan to keep his day job at the White House.

“Your independence has already been seriously compromised,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said. “You are going to be technically an employee of the president of the United States but an independent member of the board of the Federal Reserve. That's ridiculous.”




Miran's hearing reflected the broader battle over Trump's efforts to gain control of the Fed. Because of the possible negative impacts on the economy, the Fed has tried to act based on the economic data rather than electoral considerations.

Trump, however, has engaged in a prolonged campaign of pressuring and mocking Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting the benchmark interest rate to Trump's liking, a move that could end up pumping more money into the economy and creating greater inflationary risks. The Fed has yet to reach its 2% inflation target and has held its rates steady in part because of the uncertainties created by Trump's import taxes.

The president has also sought to apply pressure on the Fed over its renovation of its headquarters and other buildings and has tried to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook has said she will not resign and has sued to overturn Trump's move.

Miran, in his answers to senators, played down the controversy over Trump's desire to control the Fed. Miran said that if he were confirmed to fill the rest of Adriana Kugler's term, he would act based on his own judgments about inflation and employment.

“Look, the president nominated me because I have policy views, that, I suppose that he liked,” he said told the committee chairman, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. “If I'm confirmed to this role, I will act independently, as the Federal Reserve always does, based on my own personal analysis of economic data.”

Even Republicans saw the risks to the loss of Fed independence. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked Miran to commit to “ignore all the rhetoric from all politicians” and make his own choices.

But Miran arrives with the baggage of having worked for a president who has expressed disdain for the Fed's tradition of independence. Trump has argued that he knows more about monetary policy as he has called for the Fed's benchmark rate to be cut by a full 3 percentage points.

In June, a Fed forecast of future rates showed emerging divisions among the policymakers. Seven projected no rate cuts at all this year, two indicated one cut and 10 forecast at least two reductions.

“This is a crisis moment for the Federal Reserve, for the financial system and for the economic stability of families all across this country,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters before the start of the hearing.

Warren added that the Fed board's “independence and their efforts to make decisions based on what's really happening in the economy — not what the politics are — is something that benefits every single American. Donald Trump wants to burn that to the ground.”

Under questioning by Warren, Miran declined to say whether Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, saying only that Congress certified Biden as president. Miran declined under questioning to contradict Trump's unfounded claim that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had faked jobs numbers for political reasons.

Trump fired the bureau's head after severe revisions to the July employment report showed the economy was potentially weaker than Trump's claims of a “golden age.”

There are also questions about how Miran interprets the Fed's independence. He said that the president is entitled to express his opinion on monetary policy and that consideration of climate change as an economic force by Fed officials would be a politicization of the central bank.

In a 2024 paper he co-wrote for the Manhattan Institute, Miran argued that the Fed was already politicized by “highly political, personnel who move freely between the White House” and the central bank's headquarters.

 In that same paper, Miran wanted to heighten presidential control, saying that having Fed board members serve at the will of the president would confer “greater democratic legitimacy” on the Fed.

By indicating that he could return to the White House, Miran seemed to undermine one of his own recommendations in his paper.

“To further insulate board members from the day-to-day political process, they should be prohibited from serving in the executive branch for four years following the end of their term,” the paper said.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on China hosting North Korea's Kim Jong Un during a military parade and President Trump warning Vladimir Putin of consequences if he holds no meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

FIRST ON FOX: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith is demanding records from The People's Forum, a tax-exempt nonprofit he says has operated as a de facto foreign agent for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) while using U.S. taxpayer benefits to fund protests and spread propaganda.

In a letter sent September 4 to Executive Director Manolo De Los Santos, Smith accused The People's Forum of directly inciting violence and unrest across the United States.

"Using U.S. taxpayer-subsidized tax-exempt status to promote foreign propaganda on behalf of a nation hostile to U.S. interests, while simultaneously justifying terrorism, is unacceptable and potentially in violation of U.S. law," Smith told Fox News Digital in a statement. "The American people deserve transparency, and this Committee will hold The People's Forum accountable for its ties to the CCP and its role in spreading violence and chaos in our communities."

Within hours of Hamas' October 7 massacre in Israel, Smith claims the group publicly justified the terrorist attacks, declaring that the perpetrators "have the right to resist" — a statement condemned by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul as "abhorrent and morally repugnant."

Smith is now demanding that The People's Forum turn over by September 18 a broad set of records, including donor lists, contracts and communications with Singham and other foreign principals. If the group refuses, it could face subpoenas, depositions, referrals to the IRS for revocation of tax-exempt status, and possible criminal referrals to the Justice Department. 

The group also organized a Times Square rally the following day that drew national criticism. Beyond its stance on Israel, Smith said the nonprofit played a role in inciting riots and disruptive protests at college campuses, as well as violent demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including in Los Angeles where clashes with law enforcement resulted in dozens of arrests.

Smith also pointed to The People's Forum's role in promoting pro-CCP narratives. The group has hosted events glorifying the Chinese revolution, partnered with Beijing-aligned collectives such as the Qiao Collective and maintained close ties to media outlets within former tech mogul Neville Roy Singham's pro-China influence network.

Public reporting suggests The People's Forum has accepted $20 million from Singham, and his wife Jodie Evans, the founder of Code Pink, from 2017 to 2022, routed through shell companies and donor-advised funds, according to Smith's letter. 

MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT

Smith's letter notes that The People's Forum admitted to receiving money from Singham, a wealthy American expatriate now living in Shanghai with longstanding CCP ties.

Smith argued that this financial structure, paired with the nonprofit's activities, amounts to operating as an unregistered agent of a foreign power under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

The chairman warned that using the privileges of tax-exempt status to spread foreign propaganda while acting as a foreign agent is "unacceptable and illegal." He cited precedents in which the Justice Department indicted foreign nationals for similar influence operations using nonprofits as fronts. 

FBI records attached to the letter show Singham was investigated as early as the 1970s for ties to groups "inimical to U.S. interests," while later working as a consultant for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant with documented CCP links.

The People's Forum did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia on Thursday challenged President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Washington, asking a federal court to intervene even as he plans to send troops to other cities in the name of driving down crime.

Brian Schwalb, the district's elected attorney general, said in a lawsuit that the deployment, which now involves more than 1,000 troops, is an illegal use of the military for domestic law enforcement. 

“No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,” Schwalb wrote.

The White House said deploying the Guard to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement is within Trump's authority as president.

“This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. 



Members of the D.C. National Guard have had their orders extended through December, according to a Guard official. While that does not necessarily mean all those troops will serve that long, it is a strong indication that their role will not wind down soon.




The Republican president has credited the weekslong surge in Washington with reining in crime and said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore, despite staunch opposition in those Democrat-led cities. In the nation's capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has backed up some of Trump's claims that crime is down during the takeover, but data shows and critics argue that crime was already falling before the surge.

A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids in June was illegal. It does not directly apply to Washington, where the president has more control over the Guard than in states. 

Several GOP-led states have added National Guard troops to the ranks of those patrolling the streets and neighborhoods of the nation's capital. 

Schwalb's filing contends the deployment also violates Washington's Home Rule Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973, and wrongly asserts federal control over units from other states.

The lawsuit is the second from Schwalb — whose office is separate from Washington's federal U.S. attorney, a presidential appointee — against the Trump administration since Trump asserted control over the city's police department and sent in the Guard. Those actions have been with protests from some residents. 

Violent crime has been an issue in the capital for years, though data showed it was on the decline when Trump intervened with an executive order on Aug. 11.

Bowser has pointed to a steep drop in offenses such as carjackings since it began, while also expressing reservations about the use of the Guard from other states. 

There are clear divides between some D.C. Council members and Bowser, whom critics have accused of acquiescing to the administration.

Speaking at a Free DC “Federal Forces Out Now” news conference on Capitol Hill, one councilmember, Robert White, said his own young daughters do not see the military personnel and officers as protectors. 

“They are here to catch them, to condemn them, to take away their rights,” he said. 

White said when history is written about this moment “we will have to justify what we did and did not do. I'm not prepared to say that I capitulated. I'm prepared to stay the course. I'm not prepared to say I went along to get along.”

He encouraged the D.C. Council, Congress, the mayor and the district's attorney general to “stand together not in fear, not in compliance, but against an authoritarian takeover of our city.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gregory Bovino's distinguished Border Patrol career was in a downward spiral. In August 2023, he was relieved of command of the agency's El Centro, California, sector, where he rose to be one of 20 regional chiefs across the country.

Bovino blamed several perceived transgressions, details of which have not been previously reported: an online profile picture of him posing with an M4 assault rifle; social media posts that were considered inappropriate; and sworn congressional testimony that he and other sector chiefs gave on the state of the border during a record surge of migrants.

Thirty minutes after his second congressional hearing, Bovino said, he was removed from his position and asked, “Are you going to retire now?”

He did not retire, the profile photo with the assault rifle is back online and, at 55, he is leading immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which the federal government has called “ground zero for the effects of the border crisis.” Bovino's fall and rise illustrates how fundamentally immigration policy, tactics and messaging have changed under President Donald Trump.

While Trump's aggressive deportation plans accelerate, Bovino carefully hones his image, both his own and the one projected to the country that shows well-armed officers moving swiftly into place to make arrests.

On a recent August morning, several unmarked SUVs with tinted windows sped to the curb outside a Home Depot in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles. A Guatemalan tamale vendor was handcuffed while men with M4 rifles and military-style gear watched over and day laborers fled. Protesters sounded sirens and whistles. One briefly blocked a Border Patrol vehicle, but agents left in a little more than four minutes.

The same team, dressed as civilians with faces masked and badges on their waists, stormed a car wash in the suburb of Montebello around 11:30 a.m. They made four arrests, including a Guatemalan worker who fled down an alley and a Mexican employee who was tackled after running into the office. It was over in seven minutes.




These were just the kind of fast-paced, blunt maneuvers that Bovino relishes. With a knack for made-for-TV moments, Bovino's operation has riven parts of Los Angeles and given Trump allies fodder for boasts.

In a city famous for second acts, Bovino is certainly having one. The North Carolina native with ample biceps and hair spiked with gel is an avatar of the Trump era, once scorned for his tactics, now praised because of them.

With the change from President Joe Biden to Trump, Bovino has gone from nearly being forced to retire to a MAGA-world hero who sends holiday cards to colleagues that show agents with heavy weapons.

Undeterred by court orders over racial profiling, Bovino also revels in breaking norms. Agents have smashed car windows, blown open a door to a house and patrolled the fabled MacArthur Park on horseback. Bovino often appears in tactical gear, as he did outside Gov. Gavin Newsom's news conference on congressional redistricting on Aug. 14.

He also knows the power of a good slogan, calling the pacing of his operation “turn and burn.” 

“We're not going to hit one location, we're going to hit as many as we can,” Bovino said in an interview in a seventh-floor conference room of the federal building in West Los Angeles, where an unused office wing serves as a sparsely furnished temporary base. “All over — all over — the Los Angeles region, we're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we're not going to stop. We're not going to stop until there's not a problem here.”

As Chicago braces for a similar crackdown, the Los Angeles effort topped 5,000 arrests last week. A campaign in Washington, D.C., has resulted in many immigration arrests but is cast as a broader strike against crime and has a more central role for the National Guard. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday that Bovino called the head of the state police to say immigration officials were coming to Chicago, without elaborating.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has led interior immigration enforcement since it was created in 2003, but the Border Patrol has been around much longer. Bovino's sense of mission never strayed from the Border Patrol's roots. When assigned to lead a station in Blythe, California, he pitched his boss, Paul Beeson, on raiding the airport and bus stations in Las Vegas.

The 2010 operation was supposed to last three days but got called off after the first hour yielded dozens of arrests and unleashed a furious reaction from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. 

“He's not afraid to push the envelope, very articulate, leads from the front,” said Beeson, who, as a sector chief, selected Bovino to lead stations in Blythe and in Imperial Beach, California.

In the first week of January, Bovino sent 60 agents hundreds of miles to Bakersfield, California, to make 78 arrests at farms and businesses. His staff acknowledged congratulatory comments on social media and posted photos of an encounter with someone whose car window was shattered after refusing to open it.

The Los Angeles raids, which began with a blitz of Home Depots, car washes and an apparel factory, are an extension of what Bovino considers the Border Patrol's proper role.

“What happens at the border, even 100 years ago, didn't stay at the border, and it still doesn't. That's why we're here in Los Angeles,” he said.

The Associated Press joined a Border Patrol-led team July 23 during a lull in high-profile raids for what resembled a typically inconspicuous ICE operation. ICE has historically made arrests in the streets after investigation of individual targets, including surveillance that an official once likened to watching paint dry. Officials rarely have judicial warrants to enter a home, causing them to wait outside. 

“After this light we're going to light him up. ... Here we go,” a Border Patrol agent said on the radio while trailing a Chinese man in Rancho Cucamonga. Moments later she reported, “Suspect is in custody.”

The same team saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine but backed off after three hours parked outside. They waited even longer for a Mexican man with a misdemeanor conviction for child molestation who never emerged from his house in El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

It's not all turn and burn. It's also not a pace that will lead Trump to fulfill his promises of mass deportation.

Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, remembers thinking to herself, “What in the world is happening here?” when immigration authorities hit multiple locations in Los Angeles on June 6, as they have on many days since. Masked officers tackled people with lightning-quick force. “It was at another level,” she said.

Salas' group sued and won a temporary order prohibiting arrests based on any mix of four factors: race and ethnicity; language; location; and occupation. The administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that any of those factors can help justify reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally and that officers can make arrests based on the “totality of the circumstances.”

A court filing by those who sued Bovino and the government says “masked federal agents brandishing weapons cannot command people going about their daily lives to stop and prove their lawful presence solely because of their skin color, accent, where they happen to be, and the type of work they do.”

Where critics see heavy-handed racial profiling, Bovino sees legitimate use of force. 

Smashing a car window when a driver refuses to open and is subject to arrest is “a safer tactic than letting someone drive away and then getting in a high-speed pursuit,” he said.

Blasting the door off a home in Huntington Park to search for a man accused of ramming a Border Patrol vehicle days earlier was a “very, very prudent, thoughtful application of tactics,” said Bovino, who joined that early-morning raid. “I don't want to surround a house for hours and hours and hours and then create another riot.” 

He dismissed allegations of profiling, saying he identifies targets based on intelligence, and he defended the optional use of masks for agents who fear that being identified may jeopardize their personal safety.

But protesters trying to counter Bovino's raids have tactics of their own.

On a balmy Saturday morning, about 150 volunteers filed into an auditorium at the headquarters of the Los Angeles teachers union to hear a leader of the Community Self-Defense Coalition speak for two hours about how to fight back, capped by a 15-minute session of role-playing as monitors and ICE officers. 

The speaker rattled off a list of most commonly used SUVs and telling signs that they are in the area, such as being double-parked, in red zones or clustered together. People were told to knock on the window to try to press officials for information and record license plates to determine if they have been spotted at other raids.

When a raid unfolds, instructions are to get personal information of those arrested and record the action.

When agents raided the Home Depot and car wash on Aug. 15, they were constantly watching for drivers who might be trailing them. The team met briefly in an office park but split up after workers started peering at their SUVs with tinted windows. 

Bovino uses the term “time on the X” to describe how long agents stay at the scene of a raid; they must leave quickly to avoid protesters. On this morning, the plan was no more than 10 minutes. 

The tamale vendor arrested outside the Home Depot had been under surveillance because she was previously removed from the country, though she had no criminal history. There were two targets at the car wash who were priorities because they had been previously deported, but they were apparently not there. Of the four arrested, one had previously been deported; none had criminal histories.

Bovino relies on Border Patrol SWAT-style teams to avoid the chaos that erupted during an hourslong standoff at a Home Depot in Paramount on June 7. The Trump administration called in the National Guard and Marines to counter the protests. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that use of the Guard was illegal. 

Agents are developing new tactics to strike quickly, Bovino said, and to avoid protesters, as when they hid in a rented Penske truck to surprise laborers at a Home Depot last month. He said he plans to heavily promote an ICE tip line.

In some important respects, Bovino has been consistent. The world around him has changed. He joined the Border Patrol in 1996 and is nearing the agency's mandatory retirement age of 57. He eventually plans to return home to North Carolina to harvest apples.

For now, he remains Border Patrol chief in El Centro, long a relatively quiet part of the border that has become even quieter as illegal crossings have plummeted to their lowest levels in six decades. Roughly 1,000 agents there averaged less than three arrests a day in July.

His media savvy is on display each summer when Border Patrol sector chiefs hold news conferences to warn against illegal crossings. In 2021, Bovino led journalists in swimming across the All-American Canal, whose deceptively swift current and smooth concrete lining result in migrant deaths every year. In 2023, he locked reporters in a vehicle trunk, saying he wanted them to appreciate the dangers firsthand.

While administration officials like to say they are deporting the “worst of the worst,” Bovino embraces arrests of hard-working people with deep roots in the country. He said they “skip the line” ahead of people waiting to enter the country legally. 

“The folks undercutting American businesses, is that right?” he said. “Absolutely not. That's why we have immigration laws in the first place, and that's why I'm here.”

Some colleagues think Bovino may rise higher, even as some ICE leaders have quietly chafed at the attention he is getting. He has been under consideration to lead a Los Angeles-style operation in Chicago. The Homeland Security Department, asked for comment, says, “Bovino's success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.” 

“He sees what the right and left lanes are on this, and he's going to get out there and he's going to push the limits,” Beeson said.

            The Shroud of Turin — a 14-foot-long linen cloth bearing an image of a crucified man — has captivated people for centuries, stirring debate over whether the relic once wrapped the body of Jesus Christ.
    


            For some, the cloth serves as visual proof of Jesus' resurrection; for others, it is merely a medieval relic made by an artist in the 14th century.
    


            Now, researchers have found new evidence that the authenticity of the cloth was disputed in writing earlier than once thought: medieval texts from a respected and influential French philosopher, Nicole Oresme, who alleged around 1370 that the Shroud was faked for the purpose of the church. These claims appeared in Oresme's collection of writings known as his “Problemata,” which are dated between 1355 and 1382, according to the new study published on August 28 in the Journal of Medieval History.
    


            Oresme's Problemata has been well researched — much of the text is even available online —but the philosopher's claims about the Shroud had been overlooked for centuries. It wasn't until lead study author Nicolas Sarzeaud, a researcher in history at the Catholic University Louvain, in Belgium, received the text from a colleague editing an unpublished treatise that he realized the significance of the writing.
    


            “The fact that we have this new testimony on this object is very, very valuable,” said Sarzeaud, who is also a fellow of the Villa Medici, a French Academy in Rome. Oresme was an interesting figure, not only for his merit as a scholar and philosopher, but because of his unbiased approach to topics, particularly those involving the church. “In his debates, he tried to be sure that a phenomenon was real before he (discussed it). … he wrote a lot about believing. ‘What is believing? And why do we believe in something?'”
    


            Prior to the discovery of Oresme's claims, the oldest known documentation of the Shroud was in a series of documents from 1389 to 1390 written by notable figures such as the former bishop of Troyes, Pierre d'Arcis, who stated that the Shroud was created by an artist.
    


            While researchers like Sarzeaud claim Oresme's text adds to the already plentiful scientific and historical evidence that the Shroud is fake, some remain unconvinced.
    


            According to the 1389 documents, including a letter written by Bishop d'Arcis to the pope, the Shroud of Turin appeared in the Champagne region of France around 1355. The cloth, bearing an image of a naked man with long hair and a beard, as well as reddish-brown stains resembling wounds from crucifixion, quickly became popular. News spread that the fabric was believed to have once wrapped the body of Christ, and the Shroud was said to cause miracles.
    


            Shortly after, the documents noted, the bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, announced that the cloth was fraudulent, adding he had met the artist who created the image. About 30 years later, when the cloth began to attract popular attention once more, the following bishop, Pierre d'Arcis, also stated in his letter that the cloth was artwork, and the pope decided soon after that it could continue being on display only as a representation of the true Shroud of Christ.
    


            The cloth moved around several times after that, until it was relocated to Turin, Italy, in 1578. It can still be found there today, at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.
    


            Radiocarbon dating, conducted in 1988 by three separate laboratories, dated the fabric between 1260 and 1390, said Andrea Nicolotti, a professor of the history of Christianity and churches at the University of Turin who was not involved with the study but had worked with Sarzeaud previously.
    


            The Shroud shows evidence of being a relic from medieval times, as its patterns are complex and would have required a sufficient loom likely not introduced until the 13th century, added Nicolotti, who is also the author of the 2019 book “The Shroud of Turin: The History and Legends of the World's Most Famous Relic.”
    


            “In my opinion, we already have enough information to have settled the debate a long time ago,” he said.
    


            “Since no human body can leave that kind of image on the cloth, only two possibilities seem to remain: either it was artificially created by an artist, or it is a miracle,” Nicolotti said in an email. “Being able to say that the shroud is the result of a miracle, and that it is proof of the resurrection, is very tempting for some Christians: they think this way they can demonstrate Christ's divinity to the world.”
    


            In his Problemata, Oresme recommended caution when assessing alleged miracles, “because many clergy men thus deceive others, in order to elicit offerings for their churches.” He cited the Shroud as an example: “There is manifest experience of that in a church in Champagne, where it was said that there was the shroud of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Oresme died in 1382, seven years prior to the claims from the bishop of Troyes in the 1389 letter.
    


            More than 600 years after its documented discovery, the Shroud of Turin is still being researched and debated. In July, a study from a researcher in Brazil using 3D-modeling software concluded that the image on the cloth is more likely the result of an imprint from a statue rather than from a human body.
    


            Those who believe the Shroud to be authentic, however, argued that the 3D-modeling study was incomplete. Skeptics claimed that the researcher did not factor in findings from the 1978 Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) that could disprove the theory of the cloth being artwork, such as a lack of pigment and the details of the blood stains, which are detectable with UV technology.
    


            Cheryl White, the Hubert Humphreys Endowed Professor of History at Louisiana State University at Shreveport, said that the newly examined texts from Oresme do not add much to our understanding of the Shroud and its debated authenticity. White was not involved in the new study.
    


            “This reference points only to something I think historians have always known — that skepticism about the Shroud existed early on,” White, who also served as the historical consultant for the original Shroud of Turin exhibition at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, said in an email. “There is no question (Oresme) was one of the leading intellectuals of 14th-century France, a bishop and royal advisor. His skepticism might carry more weight given his standing, but it actually reflects his broader fight against false relics more than drawing upon any direct knowledge he had of the Shroud itself.”
    


            “My position is that the Shroud of Turin has defied explanation for centuries. … It is neither falsifiable nor is it reproducible, making it an ongoing mystery,” White added. “We need both more historical documents and the most advanced scientific testing; however, the Shroud may never be ‘put to rest' — its enduring mystery is what makes it so compelling.”
    


            Sarzeaud believes the document is significant because it shows how the Shroud was perceived in the 14th century. But like many other researchers, he acknowledges that additional research would be beneficial to understand more about the Shroud and how it was made: “I think the problem is that everything and its opposite has been written about the Shroud of Turin, so that it has become possible to pick and choose what we like and what we don't like.”

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons joins ‘America's Newsroom' to address protests against immigration enforcement and respond to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's claims that her CBS interview was cut down.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed that an illegal migrant from Pakistan, who served in the U.S. military, has an extensive history of criminal activity paired with "lies about his military service."

Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry originally entered the U.S. in 1998 on a B-2 visa after intentionally leaving out criminal history related to convictions in Australia for stealing goods, falsifying passports and committing financial misconduct, according to DHS. DHS told Fox News Digital that Chaudhry also claimed he was deployed to Iraq, though Department of Defense records show he was never actually deployed.

An official with the Department of Defense told Fox News Digital that illegal migrants cannot serve in the military and an individual must have some form of legal status in order to serve. Green card holders (permanent legal residents) are able to join a branch of the U.S. military.

Immigration officials at the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined Chaudhry's falsified forms and omitting of criminal history were grounds for removal in 2008, but the Pakistani native has been repeatedly appealing the decision for roughly 17 years.

"Sanctuary politician Bruce Harrell and the media are peddling a FALSE sob story on this serial fraudster," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. "President Trump and Secretary Noem's message is clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States."

"Why do sanctuary politicians and the media continue to peddle sob stories of criminal illegals and smear our brave ICE law enforcement officers?" McLaughlin added. "Make no mistake, these types of lies are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults."

According to an Inspector General's report obtained by Fox News Digital from 2021, Chaudhry collected $449,459.82 in taxpayer dollars from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Veteran's Benefits Administration (VBA) and currently owes the federal government $81,080 for a mortgage reduction grant from the VBA. 

Sources at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox that Chaudhry entered the country on a B-2 tourist visa and then was granted a green card. After officials discovered he previously lied to immigration officials about his criminal past, the green card was revoked — making him an illegal migrant in the U.S.

Chaudhry remains detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being arrested during a citizenship appearance in Tukwila, Washington, on Aug. 21, 2025. He has been placed into removal proceedings after an immigration judge ruled he was in violation of federal immigration law. 

Protests in Seattle have since erupted as hundreds of demonstrators stood outside the ICE detention center demanding Chaudhry's release last week.

Seattle radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital that Democrats have tried to "portray [Chaudhry] as some sort of victim."

"Muhammad Chaudhry has a criminal history which he failed to disclose, and has already had permanent residence status rejected by a judge," Rantz from Seattle Red 770 AM told Fox. "And yet Democrats still portray him as some sort of victim." 

"If you want to understand why Democrats continue to make no distinction between criminal illegal immigrants and hard-working ones who just want a better life, it's pretty easy now," Rantz added. "When you don't believe in borders, you don't see a difference."

Former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger received welcome news in her campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to become Virginia's next governor, with the Center for Politics' “Crystal Ball” rating the race in her favor.

The Center for Politics on Thursday published ratings for a number of races, including in Virginia, where Democrats are hoping to flip the governor's seat blue. Polling shows Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is trailing by a narrow margin in the state's gubernatorial race to replace term-limited Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), although some polls indicate she has made strides in closing in on her Democratic rival in recent months. 

The institute changed its “Crystal Ball” prognosis for the Virginia campaign this week, writing that the outcome will be “likely Democratic,” marking a boost for Spanberger after it previously predicted the race “leans Democratic.” 

“Spanberger's lopsided financial advantage, and the fact that the Trump administration seemed to go out of its way to ensure the state continues its longstanding trend of reacting against the presidential party, have had us feeling that Democrats should be stronger favorites to flip the governorship,” the Center for Politics wrote. 

“We'll be paying attention to whatever tea leaves that may show up in the early voting patterns, but for now, we are upgrading Spanberger's position,” it continued. 

The University of Virginia-based institute criticized several recent polls that indicate Earle-Sears is closing in on Spanberger, suggesting they are biased in her favor. 

In late May, pollsters had Spanberger up 43% to 26%. The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average had Spanberger leading the race 45% to 36% on Aug. 1. A few weeks later, a Roanoke College Poll further shrank Spanberger's lead at 46% to 39% on Aug. 19. An Aug. 26 poll from co/efficient showed just a five-point gap between the two candidates, with Spanberger leading 48% to 43%.

The Center for Politics argued the two latest polls “arguably stress-tested Spanberger's lead by suggesting an electorate that may be redder than what we will see in November, and she was still ahead.”

“To be clear, we also don't necessarily think Spanberger is “actually” leading by considerably more than what these polls show—mid-to-high single digits may very well be where the race is at,” the pollsters added.

Republicans have been eyeing Virginia, as well as New Jersey, as states they believe are trending Rightward due to the results of the 2024 election. At the time, President Donald Trump increased margins of support for the Republican Party by significant levels, leading the GOP to mount pushes in both states to expand red territory. 

In Virginia, Spanberger has come under attack from the GOP partly due to her positions on transgender and immigration policy.

VIRGINIA PUBLIC SCHOOL TRANSGENDER CONTROVERSIES COULD SCRAMBLE GUBERNATORIAL RACE

Sears and Youngkin have criticized the Democratic candidate for not supporting the Laken Riley Act, which targets illegal immigrants accused of committing violent crimes for swift deportation after one such man was convicted of murdering a Georgia nursing student. 

And Spanberger has also been pressured to support the federal government's push to mandate bathroom use on the basis of biological sex instead of gender identity. The matter has become a front-and-center issue in several Virginia counties, including Loudoun County, as multiple school districts refuse the Trump administration's request to reform transgender bathroom policy.

            Stephen Miran, the White House economist President Donald Trump nominated to the Federal Reserve's top ranks, just got an earful about the importance of the central bank's independence – just as the Trump administration actively defends removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her post.
    


            The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing Thursday to consider Miran's nomination to fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors. It was a crucial step in Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed, potentially eroding its long-accepted independence from politics, which in part has helped the US economy grow to and remain the world's largest over the past century.
    


            Republican and Democratic senators were unequivocal that the Fed's decisions on interest rates should remain free of political considerations. Miran agreed at various points throughout the hearing, stating that Fed independence “is critical to the well functioning of the economy and financial markets.”
    


            But Democrats questioned Miran's ability to distance himself from Trump, should he be confirmed to become a Fed governor. After all, Miran plans to technically remain an employee of the White House if he becomes Fed governor on a temporary basis.
    


            Miran said he would take a leave of absence from his current role as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers if his Fed term only lasts through January, but said he would resign if he remains for longer. He said he was advised to take that approach by legal counsel.
    


            “You are going to be technically an employee of the President of United States, but an independent member of the board of the Federal Reserve, that's ridiculous,” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said.
    


            Meanwhile, less than a mile away from Capitol Hill, a federal judge is set to review new court filings from the Trump administration and perhaps rule as early as Thursday whether Cook, whom the president fired last week over allegations of mortgage fraud, can remain as a Fed governor while her lawsuit challenging Trump's removal order moves forward in litigation.
    


            Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has been subject to unprecedented attacks by the Trump administration because central bankers haven't heeded the president's demands to lower interest rates. Fed officials have stood pat since December because they've wanted to see how the US economy responds to Trump's sweeping policies first, though they're gearing up for a rate cut in two weeks.
    


Miran, a Harvard-trained PhD economist, has challenged the Fed's independence in the recent past.
    


            Last year, Miran co-authored a Manhattan Institute report last year, that called the Fed's independence an outdated “shibboleth,” and he called for shorter terms for Fed governors to give the president more power to hold sway over the agency.
    


            “Central bank independence has long been considered an essential element for successful monetary policy. But central banks are creations of political exigency, and pure independence exists only in textbooks,” the report said. “It can also bestow power without accountability.”
    


            Miran is also one of the main architects of Trump's aggressive trade policy. In a November 2024 paper, Miran detailed how a tariff -centric approach, aimed at weakening the dollar, could reshape the global trading system in favor of the United States.
    


            His unconventional perspective will likely come into full view during his hearing. Democrats — and some Republicans — are expected to press Miran particularly on his view about the Fed's independence.
    


            Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the banking committee's ranking member, said in prepared remarks published ahead of Miran's hearing that “every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn't an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump's puppet.”
    


            If confirmed to be a Fed governor, Miran would no longer play a role in shaping the administration's fiscal and trade policy. Fed officials typically avoid weighing in on those matters in the spirit of Fed independence. But lawmakers are expected to challenge Miran about whether his economic views are perhaps too radical to serve on the Fed.
    


            There's a chance Miran won't just be a Fed governor.
    


            When Miran's nomination was announced, Trump said the appointment would last through January, aimed at filling the remainder of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, who resigned in early August without citing a reason for her departure. Last week, Trump said he is considering a longer term for Miran.
    


            “We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on August 26, referring to Cook's term, which is slated to last through 2038 and is currently in litigation after his firing of her. “We'll have a majority very shortly. So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great.”
    


Why Trump's Fed nominee may get the cold shoulder at the central bank



            For months, Trump has complained that the Fed not lowering interest rates is forcing the federal government to make massive interest payments on its debt and that it is hurting housing affordability for Americans.
    


            If confirmed, Miran would be in a position to be elevated as Fed chair, potentially taking the same route that other former Fed chairs have taken, such as Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke (who also led the Council of Economic Advisers).
    


            According to Fed rules, the chair can be chosen only among current Fed governors, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has attacked for months, has refused to reveal if he's staying on the board after his term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell's term on the board runs through 2028, so he could theoretically choose to stay as a Fed governor, though Fed chair typically step down altogether after their term as chair ends.
    


            While senators consider the possibility of Miran as a Fed governor, Cook's own status on the central bank's governing board is in question.
    


            Last week, Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's firing of her, claiming the president violated her due process rights under the Constitution and federal law. The federal government said the firing was justified because the president determined there was sufficient cause, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud.
    


Judge wants to hear more about Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's effort to fire her before ruling



            Cook requested that the court allow her to remain in her job while the litigation moves forward, but in an emergency hearing on August 29, US District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee, asked for more written arguments to be submitted to her this week.
    


            The court's ruling on whether Cook will keep her job while the high-stakes case plays out is crucial, with a Fed policy meeting coming up on September 16-17. The Fed is widely expected to lower rates for the first time since December.
    


            Last week after Cook was fired, the 11 Democrats on the committee that will consider Miran's nomination called on the chair, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, to postpone Miran's hearing.

The case for giving one to your 3-year-old is not as outlandish as it sounds.

If you're a parent, you've probably grappled with the question of when your kid should get a smartphone. There's a nationwide movement, Wait Until 8th, that argues that devices should be kept out of kids' hands until they're deep into middle school. Some families manage to hold out even longer. Andrew Przybylski, a professor of technology and human behavior at the University of Oxford's Oxford Internet Institute and father of two, has a different idea.

“The kids have always had phones — since they were 3,” he told me a few months ago. I almost fell off my chair.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Before you come for us with pitchforks, it's not as extreme as it sounds. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Introducing the device into his children's lives was an incredibly intentional process, akin to putting a series of training wheels on a bike. At first, the only app on the toddler phone was a photo album filled with family pictures. Then, when they got a little older, the kids got access to the phone's camera, then audiobooks and music handpicked by the parents, and eventually, they could call and text their family.

“It's designed so that everything about technology is a conversation,” he said. “And it's a conversation that we and the kids have now with the idea that the kids will have this conversation with themselves in the future.”

Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps.

Giving phones to toddlers is a counterintuitive idea, and that's putting it lightly. If you've read any of the reporting on the mental health crisis that struck young people around the time they gained access to social media, parents are rightfully scared to give their children phones. However, once you come to terms with the fact that these devices are also a vital tool in an increasingly tech-dependent world, the concept of teaching kids how to live with a phone from an early age — with guardrails, of course — makes perfect sense.

In the past two years, the debate over kids and smartphones has been heating up. Thirty-five states have laws or rules restricting or outright banning phones in schools to address a converging set of problems, including cyberbullying, classroom distraction, and the youth mental health crisis. Social media use, specifically, has been linked to depression and anxiety in kids. Parents and teens actually agree that social media in particular is a threat to mental health. It's one thing to try to put controls around kids' social media use but many parents are trying to prevent their children from having smartphones for as long as possible, if at all. It's even driving parents to sign pledges that they'll hold out and not buy their kid a phone until eighth grade.

This is a bad idea, in my opinion. Critics like Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, have a point that kids and parents are completely outgunned by tech giants pushing addictive products onto kids. They're also correct that many solutions to keep kids safe, like better age verification, create new problems. But trying to keep kids away from smartphones, one of the most ubiquitous devices in the world today, is a fool's errand. Many parents — even those that signed pledges — have tried and failed.

More than anything, teaching kids how to safely use technology is a good idea. Phones are a fact of life in the 21st century, and even if you try to keep them away from your kids, their friends will get devices, possibly without any safeguards, before you know it. Meanwhile, there's also growing evidence that screen time can be a good thing, especially when parents are directly involved. It's never too soon to teach digital literacy, if only so that children can spot scams and misinformation online, whenever they get access. By turning tech use into a conversation, parents also invite their children to come to them when things online inevitably go sideways.

I will confess, I have not yet decided when I'll give my daughter her own phone. I have spent the past few weeks asking experts about the idea of giving kids phones when they're 3. And based on everything I've learned, I don't think I'll be signing any pledges any time soon.

Smartphones aren't just popular — they're unavoidable. Nine out of 10 Americans have a smartphone. The number of children with devices is growing, too. Common Sense Media reported earlier this year that 40 percent of 2-year-olds have their own tablet, and the percentage grows to 58 percent for 4-year-olds. The percentage of kids with their own smartphones are much lower: 4 percent for 2-year-olds and 8 percent for 4-year-olds. But if you're looking at how many kids have access to a smartphone at home, the number jumps to 96 percent.

If you're wary of the idea of iPad kids, these numbers might alarm you. But if parents are involved in what the kids are watching, which apps are available, and how long kids can use phones, screen time doesn't have to be a bad thing.

“The research suggests that that can be effective in encouraging children's digital literacy, encouraging children's agency and exploration, and learning and avoiding the problems of saying, ‘I can use my phone, but you can't have one,'” Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has been studying kids and tech for decades, told me. “You know, it becomes a forbidden fruit.”

The idea of starting a toddler out with a photo album makes great sense. My daughter primarily wants to see family photos on my phone, which I inevitably have to take away from her.

A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. 

Video calls have long been established as an early, educational screen time activity. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. A later study found that parent participation improved learning even more.

As kids get older, though, passively watching videos can be good, too. We know this because of decades of research into children watching TV. A seminal study on the effects of Sesame Street found that watching the show in early childhood led to improved school performance. Of course, Sesame Street is created by a nonprofit with the explicit mission to educate kids. The infinite feed of YouTube, with its sometimes uncanny kids' content, is a different animal. The American Psychological Association said last year that features like endless scrolling and infinite feeds are “particularly risky” to young people, whose brains aren't as easily able to stop scrolling or watching and may become more distractible as a result.

That's why every expert I talked to emphasized an intentional approach to introducing tech to kids. Creating playlists of music or videos and selecting specific audiobooks or podcasts is akin to putting training wheels on that corner of the internet. The most important part of that process is talking to kids about what they're watching or listening to, and eventually, discussing how platforms like YouTube and Spotify work. That includes explaining how dark patterns and algorithmic feeds can compel them to keep consuming content.

“With some new boundaries and communication and approaches to content, parents can shift things in the right direction,” said Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School who coaches families on intentional approaches to tech use. “These tech companies don't deserve to occupy so much of our family's time and space.”

These tech companies are also acutely aware of the very public perception that their products harm kids. That's why we've seen the introduction of things like YouTube Kids and Instagram Teen Accounts, which offer more parental controls but still profit from capturing the attention of children. The least parents could do is empower those kids with digital literacy skills so that they gain an understanding of how these powerful platforms work.

The more I think about it, giving them their own smartphone to start the process at an early age — and talk to them about it constantly — is a great first step.

The last thing parents want is for the full weight of the internet to slam into their child's prefrontal cortex at the wrong time. You could argue that middle school, when many kids are deep in the throes of puberty, is the worst time for them to gain access to everything a smartphone can do. And even if there are parental controls in place, teens are famously good at figuring out ways to bypass them.

It's hard to imagine keeping phones out of kids' hands until an arbitrary age and then expecting them to develop a healthy relationship with the device overnight. At the same time, I get that giving a phone to a 3-year-old may strike many as way too young. In general, the concept of easing them into technology is a good one, and should remain the same regardless of the age the child gets their first tablet or phone or smartwatch. The process starts with a series of guardrails that gradually come off, and it requires time and attention from parents.

The last thing parents want is for the full weight of the internet to slam into their child's prefrontal cortex at the wrong time.

“The goal is absolutely to think about how we can foster healthy, meaningful use of technology early on,” said Eisha Buch, who oversees the digital citizenship program at Common Sense. “Because those skills and the mindsets ideally are there to stay and stick with them for when they are 16 or 18 or whenever they've left the house and the parent isn't there to guide them.”

Something that struck me when I started to imagine doing this for my own family is remembering the order in which I gained access to digital tools in the '90s. My first real gadget was a digital camera — not dissimilar to the device Przybylski says it's okay to give a 3-year-old. Then, I had an iPod, and eventually a flip phone. When I pick up my phone today, I still think of it primarily as a device that does helpful things like take pictures, play music, and connect me with family and friends. Admittedly, my phone has also turned into a way to waste time, thumbing through feeds or watching videos, and even my adult brain struggles to stop doing that.

David Bickham, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, suggested a framework that I found particularly useful: Parents should give their kid a device when it serves a need. They should engage with their kid about tech, release oversight sequentially, and give the kid tools to handle challenges or talk to a parent when they're in trouble.

“The worst outcome is a child who needs help from an adult but can't go to their parents because they don't have the trust that their parent is going to do something that's really going to help them,” Bickham said.

It's possible that starting this process at a very young age is particularly good at addressing that challenge. A toddler, in the best of circumstances, goes to their parents for help with everything: peeling a banana, putting on shoes, seeing pictures on a phone. One of the first sentences many toddlers learn is, “I need help.” If a parent wants to be seen as helpful when it comes to technology, making themselves available early on seems smart.

Even in the near future, when we'll be able to talk to AI agents in our glasses, smartphones will remain ubiquitous. This generation of parents, who mostly grew up in the '80s and '90s, have a unique opportunity to ease their kids into this tech-filled world and to help them develop a healthy relationship with that tech. Whether you start at age 3 or age 13, it's a hard but incredibly important job. Personally, I'll take the years-long head start that comes with starting sooner rather than later.

Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” — but doesn't want you to see a report that could do just that.

Most Americans still don't know that alcohol can cause cancer — and the alcohol industry is working hard to make sure it stays that way.

For the past three years, the industry, aided by its allies in Congress and later the Trump administration, has sought to discredit and eventually bury a major analysis that offers new evidence of the link between drinking alcohol and getting sick and dying from various causes, including cancer.

It appears their campaign has succeeded. Three co-authors on the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, which was commissioned in early 2022 by the US Department of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden, told Vox that they were informed last month that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the final draft of the study or its findings.

“The thing that the alcohol industry fears more than increased taxes is increased knowledge about the risks associated with drinking alcohol, particularly around cancer,” Mike Marshall, CEO of a group dedicated to reducing alcohol's harms called the Alcohol Policy Alliance, who was not involved with the study, told me. “Like the tobacco industry, like the opioid industry, they are working hard to prevent the American people from gaining the knowledge that they need to make the best decisions for themselves.”

Why assert so much pressure? It makes sense if you look at the headwinds the alcohol industry faces. Americans today are drinking less. This year, Gallup recorded a historic low in the percentage of US adults who drink: 54 percent, down from 67 percent in 2022.

Though the vibes around alcohol are shifting, a lot of people still don't fully understand alcohol's health consequences. Surveys have found that while the percentage of Americans who know that alcohol is a carcinogen has been rising, it is still below 50 percent.

By the end of the year, the federal government will issue new dietary guidelines — something that happens every five years — which include recommended limits on alcohol consumption. The alcohol study's results were intended to inform those guidelines.

“I was hopeful. … Look at all this evidence we have,” Priscilla Martinez, deputy scientific director of the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute and one of the co-authors, told me in an interview. “This is when the change is going to happen.”

But after the authors submitted their final report to Trump's health department in March and never saw it again, Reuters reported in June, citing anonymous sources, that the new dietary guidelines would eliminate any specific recommended limits on alcohol consumption.

“I think it's a shame,” said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and another co-author. “Anyone who is a decision-making authority, you want them to have all of the information.”

It is another example of the Trump administration seeming to work against the best interest of public health — despite allying itself closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again movement.

Kennedy and MAHA are fixated on harmful toxins and the corrupting influence of corporate interests. But neither Kennedy, who has been in addiction recovery himself for decades, nor the broader movement has seemed to make reducing alcohol consumption a priority. Instead, the Trump administration will not release a report that would actually show just how harmful to people's health drinking alcohol can be, the latest in a series of decisions that could actually leave Americans less healthy.

Vox reached out to the White House and HHS to ask why the administration hasn't published the study, but a spokesperson for the Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration, the HHS subagency that oversaw the Alcohol Intake and Health Report, declined to address our questions directly.

“People are going to get sick who might have avoided getting sick, because they might have decreased their drinking,” Martinez said.

For this story, I spoke with three of the six authors of the study: Martinez, Keyes, and co-author Tim Naimi, an alcohol researcher affiliated with the University of Victoria and Boston University. They all emphasized that they had sought to conduct a study that would fairly represent America's alcohol consumption. They not only reviewed a wide range of observational studies, but they also ran data through a statistical model based on the US population, specifically to estimate the mortality effects of alcohol for Americans.

Martinez said the thinking was: “We've got to make this relevant to Americans.”

They broke out their findings by different drinking levels — from one drink per day to three — and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. Their big-picture conclusion: Among the US population, the negative health effects of drinking alcohol start at low levels of consumption and begin to increase sharply the more a person drinks. A man drinking one drink per day has roughly a one in 1,000 chance of dying from any alcohol-related cause, whether an alcohol-associated cancer or liver disease or a drunk driving accident. Increase that to two drinks per day, and the odds increase to one in 25.

The general finding that the health risks from alcohol start at low levels of drinking and increase significantly for people who drink more is consistent with previous research, as I covered in a story earlier this year. Public health experts broadly agree that heavy drinking is bad for your health; the debate has been over moderate amounts of drinking. There is another issue that continues to complicate the debate: Lay people may have an inflated definition of what “moderate” drinking means compared to their doctor or a scientist, which could lead to people putting their health at risk even if they don't think of themselves as heavy drinkers.

In that context, the report is a harrowing read: Alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer — colorectal, breast cancer in women, liver, oral, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Risk for these cancers increases with any alcohol use and continues to grow with higher levels of use, the study's authors concluded. Women experience a higher risk of an alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed than men. Men and women who die from an alcohol-attributable cause die 15 years earlier on average.

Amid all of the public discourse about alcohol and its health effects, here was a clear and authoritative summary of the evidence that would be most relevant to Americans. It was, its authors told me, consistent with the scientific consensus at this time.

“Nothing we're saying is all that surprising or controversial to those of us who know the field,” Keyes said.

So, why has the US government buried the final draft of that report for the past six months? And why does it appear that the Trump administration will instead push the country's dietary guidelines in the opposite direction?

Every five years, the federal government reviews the nation's dietary guidelines and issues new ones that reflect the current best consensus among scientists about what we should eat, how much of it we should eat, and what we should avoid eating and drinking to lead a healthy life.

US officials always solicit expert opinion as they prepare a fresh set of dietary guidelines. The input is usually compiled into one massive report from a group of experts called the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and then submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, the two agencies that produce the guidelines.

That was how the process went in 2020, and at that time, the subcommittee of researchers dedicated to alcohol (including Naimi) advised the government to reduce the recommended limit down to one drink per day for men, from two. The Trump administration ultimately decided not to follow the recommendation.

Ahead of drafting the new guidance for 2025, the Biden administration began considering in February 2022 whether to take a different approach to more thoroughly review alcohol's health effects ahead of the 2025 dietary guidelines being developed and released. By April 2022, HHS had decided to launch a new review of the science on alcohol and health, called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study — the research Trump's administration has yet to release — to be conducted by an outside expert panel. That analysis would be submitted to Congress as part of an annual report on underage drinking, and it would be shared with USDA and HHS to consider for the 2025 dietary guidelines.

It makes sense why the federal government would launch an effort like this. The negative health effects of alcohol have been getting more and more attention, and research continues to link drinking even in moderate amounts to cancer, liver disease, and mental health problems. The World Health Organization declared in 2023 that no amount of drinking could be considered safe. It was time to take a hard look at American drinking.

With their mouthful titles and tangle of acronyms, it's easy to lose track of which government report is which. To keep them straight, here are the key ways the Biden-commissioned Alcohol Intake and Health Study differs from the more recent National Academies report:

But almost immediately, controversy was already brewing around the Alcohol Intake and Health Study.

In December 2022, several months after HHS had decided to launch the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, Congress included a provision in a routine government spending bill: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine should undertake its own study of alcohol's health effects and submit that as the basis for the 2025 dietary guidelines. Two of the initial co-authors for that report were removed after objections over their reported connections to the alcohol industry. But at least one of the scholars who replaced them has also had their work supported by the industry.

When the experts who would produce the Alcohol Intake and Health Study were named in 2023, the alcohol industry began to circulate documents to lawmakers and other government officials claiming authors of the study were prejudiced against alcohol (all of the researchers had submitted conflict-of-interest paperwork ahead of joining the project). Naimi, in particular, has been labeled a “new prohibitionist” by Reason, a libertarian publication.

Keyes told me that she believed she had been criticized for, in effect, describing the findings of various alcohol-related studies.

“When I read criticism of my involvement in the committee, and it was described as a conflict of interest, the conflict was that I had accurately described scientific research in the media,” Keyes said.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill waded into the fight. In March 2024, Congress tucked a provision into another omnibus spending bill that instructed HHS and USDA to consider the National Academies report when writing the alcohol guidelines. Representatives from states including Kentucky and California — where whiskey and wine are important cultural exports, respectively — sent letters to HHS in April 2024 and again that September, criticizing the Alcohol Intake and Health Study for being duplicative of the National Academies report — even though the former was commissioned by the government first. (HHS said at the time that it would not be duplicative but complementary.) The House Oversight Committee even sought to subpoena documents from the agency on the HHS report and the process that was producing it.

Both groups of researchers continued to assemble their reports as the public relations war raged. But when it came time to publish their findings, they had very different experiences.

A draft version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study was posted on January 15, just days before Trump's second inauguration and around the same time that then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recommended that alcohol come with cancer warning labels; you can still find it online here. This is the process for most government reports: The authors put together a draft, the initial findings are released for public comment, stakeholders submit their takes, and then the authors will take those comments into consideration and revise their report for its final publication.

But that didn't happen with the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. After the public comment period, the authors made minor revisions — not to the findings themselves but to help translate its takeaways for non-experts. They sent that final report to the Trump administration in March.

And after that…nothing. The report never surfaced, and, according to the three co-authors I spoke with, they received no explanation for the radio silence.

Vox contacted HHS with a detailed list of questions about the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and why it hasn't been released, as well as Kennedy's general perspective on alcohol and health. The agency sent a brief comment in response:

“This information has been provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Guidelines,” an HHS spokesperson said.

Some of the authors still held out hope that the study would be included in the annual report on underage drinking that is required by federal law to be submitted to Congress and is expected later this year.

But then in August, those hopes were shattered: According to all three co-authors, they were told that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the study in any form and would not include it in the upcoming congressional report on underage drinking. (The authors are currently working, as they always planned to do, on publishing their findings in an independent academic journal.)

Then, at the beginning of September, Congress introduced a new government spending bill that would, among many other things, defund the interagency group responsible for launching the Alcohol Intake and Health Study in the first place during the Biden administration.

The National Academies report, on the other hand, has been released on time. Its findings, however, were controversial: It indicated that moderate levels of drinking could actually be beneficial to people, and even the links to cancer, despite ethanol being widely classified as a carcinogen, were limited. Some unaffiliated alcohol researchers have called their findings and their methodology into question.

Critics said the National Academies report was based on observational studies that can show a correlation between, for example, moderate drinking and cardiovascular health, but don't prove a cause; the National Academies report's authors acknowledged that limitation. As Naimi told me earlier this year, many moderate drinkers may have other attributes — such as higher incomes — that could explain their better health without accounting for alcohol. Critics of the National Academies report also said the authors had used overly restrictive criteria for which research to include, excluding many studies that have found harmful effects from alcohol use.

The Alcohol Intake and Health Study, on the other hand, focused on health outcomes for which there is a substantiated link to alcohol, included more studies, and modeled the available data to the US population.

The ball is now in the Trump administration's court. Will it change the dietary guidelines as rumored and eliminate a specific recommended limit on alcohol consumption? The National Academies report would appear to set the stage for such a change, with its industry-preferred messaging that low levels of drinking could make people healthier.

And all the while, the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and a very different perspective on alcohol's health effects remains locked in the administration's proverbial basement.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized the military's strike on a Venezuelan drug boat, saying “even the worst people in our country” get trials.

The boat strike, which President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday, killed 11 people associated with the Tren de Aragua organized crime group.

Paul suggested the drug boat's occupants should have been given a chance to be tried for their crimes.

“The reason we have trials and we don't automatically assume guilt is what if we make a mistake and they happen to be people fleeing the Venezuelan dictator?” Paul said.

Paul said it isn't “our policy” to “blow people up” on the United States's coast. He added, “Even the worst people in our country, if we accuse somebody of a terrible crime, they still get a trial.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the strike on Tuesday, saying they “conducted a lethal strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug vessel which had departed from Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.”

Trump suggested the objective of the strike was to put fear into the hearts of drug dealers. 

“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” the president wrote on Truth Social.

The administration said Venezuela's government enables drug dealers and traffickers. It denied that, and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called Attorney General Pam Bondi's move to raise the award for President Nicolas Maduro's arrest “pathetic” and a “crude political propaganda operation.”

Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking in a U.S. federal court in 2020. The U.S. has not said whether it will strike Venezuela directly.

TRUMP'S TIKTOK DEAL ‘HOSTAGE' TO CHINA TRADE TALKS AS DEADLINE LOOMS

The U.S. recently boosted its military presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the coast of the country to combat drug cartels. Venezuela reacted negatively to the deployment.

Maduro called the ships an “extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat” and moved his forces to the country's coastline to defend against a possible American attack.

Trump directed the military to target Latin American cartels last month.

President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who lower courts ordered reinstated after he terminated her.

Trump wants the Supreme Court to pause her reinstatement as he appeals the case.

"President Trump acted lawfully when he removed Rebecca Slaughter from the FTC," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

"Indeed, the Supreme Court has twice in the last few months confirmed the President's authority to remove the heads of executive agencies," Desai said. "We look forward to being vindicated for a third time — and hopefully after this ruling, the lower courts will cease their defiance of Supreme Court orders."

Trump in March removed Slaughter and another Democratic commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, as part of a sprawling effort to exert his influence over federal agencies.

Slaughter and Bedoya then sued Trump, seeking to be reinstated. But Bedoya resigned from the FTC in June and dropped his case.

In July, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Slaughter's firing was illegal.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C., upheld that ruling in a 2-1 decision.

The appeals court  held that FTC commissioners cannot be removed unless there is cause, which has been defined as neglect or malfeasance in office. 

Trump did not give a reason for firing Slaughter.

"The government has no likelihood of success on appeal," the ruling said.

Slaughter returned to work at the FTC after the appeals court decision.

Slaughter's case is the second in recent weeks to raise the question of whether Trump has legal "cause" to justify removing a federal regulator.

The question of "cause" is also at the crux of Trump's unprecedented effort to remove Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Trump last month moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, claims that her attorney has denied, setting up a court battle that could also end up at the Supreme Court.

A court hearing on the matter ended without resolution last week, leaving the future of Cook's position unclear.

Lululemon shares plunged in extended trading Thursday after the company gave a much worse than expected full-year outlook.

The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. But it said it expected tariffs to hit its full-year profits by $240 million.

Lululemon said it expects full fiscal year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share, well below Wall Street estimates of $14.45 per share. It also anticipates full-year revenue of $10.85 billion to $11 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.18 billion.

"We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business," CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. "The increased rates and removal of the de minimis provisions have played a large part in our guidance reduction for the year."

Here's how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares of the company sank more than 10% after the bell Thursday. The stock is down more than 45% this year.

Programming note: Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald will be interviewed exclusively on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period. Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

McDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles "run too long," particularly in its lounge and social categories.

"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends," he said.

"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests," McDonald added.

Bret Taylor's artificial intelligence startup Sierra has just joined an exclusive club: The company sports a new $10 billion valuation after raising $350 million in fresh capital.

Sierra is one of just a handful of AI startups, including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines that are valued at or above $10 billion. 

Investors are pouring money into this competitive group of companies in the hopes that they'll eventually hit the public markets.

Taylor is the chairman of OpenAI's board, and previously served as co-CEO of Salesforce alongside Marc Benioff. Taylor co-founded Sierra in 2023. The company builds and implements AI agents for customer service. AI agents can carry out tasks autonomously on behalf of their users.

Shares of Salesforce fell 5% Thursday after the company reported weak guidance and concerns lingered about how AI is affecting software companies.

Sierra said its agents are already being used by "hundreds of millions of people" to help with tasks like refinancing homes, ordering lunch, delivering furniture, understanding insurance deductibles and fixing technology, among other things.

Greenoaks led Sierra's latest funding round, the company said. Its valuation more than doubled from its most recent raise in October.

"We're in this for the long term," Sierra said in a blog post on Thursday.

The company said it will use its fresh funding to invest in its platform and focus on domestic and international expansion.

Sierra's funding follows a flurry of other major AI raises in Silicon Valley. Earlier this week, Anthropic announced it had closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation.

Stephen Miran will take an unpaid leave of absence as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors at the White House while filling the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's Board if confirmed.

At a confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, Miran, President Donald Trump's nominee for the open Fed Governor role, said he wouldn't fully resign from his position at the White House while serving out the Fed Governor's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. He's set to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly at the beginning of August.

Miran's appointment comes amid speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" and obtain ample influence in the central bank, raising fears about the central bank's independence. Miran keeping his White House job while serving as Fed governor could further fuel those concerns.

"I have been advised by counsel that the legal approach is to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors, cease my activities and if council advises me otherwise, I will follow the law and follow council's advice," Miran said at the hearing.

"The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign," he added.

Trump has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates, criticizing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for staying put for too long. At the hearing, Miran repeatedly pledged to uphold the central bank's independence, stressing that no one at the administration had asked him to commit to easing monetary policy.

The Fed's next policy meeting takes place on Sept. 16-17.

A lawyer for Lisa Cook said the Justice Department appeared to open a criminal investigation in a desperate attempt to find a legal reason to fire her from the Federal Reserve's board of governors.

In a statement, Cook's attorney Abbe Lowell described the criminal probe as "cover."

"Predictably and recognizing the flaws in challenging their illegal firing of Governor Cook, the administration is scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach," Lowell said. "This Justice Department — perhaps the most politicized in American history — will do whatever President Trump demands."

"He wants cover, and they are providing it," Lowell added.

The Justice Department's criminal investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Bill Pulte — a Trump administration official who has aggressively attacked Cook — canceled a press conference in front of a Washington, DC, federal courthouse to present "new information" about the Federal Reserve board governor.

"Once you see what we present on Thursday, there's going to be a lot of people apologizing and retracting their false and defamatory statements," Pulte said on X Tuesday morning. "Watch."

Pulte on Wednesday canceled the press conference, however, tweeting he was doing so "out of respect for the process."

The Justice Department is using grand juries and sending subpoenas as part of its investigation, according to the Journal.

The criminal investigation marks a major escalation in the Trump administration's war against Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose term ends in 2038.

President Donald Trump published a letter in August saying he was firing Cook for "cause" based on a criminal referral from Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and says Cook lied on mortgage documents.

Pulte says Cook took out mortgages at around the same time for properties in Georgia and Michigan and said that each would be her primary residence.

Cook sued Trump last week, saying Pulte's allegations didn't meet the legal standard for a "cause" firing.

The federal judge overseeing the case, US District Judge Jia Cobb, is weighing whether to issue a temporary restraining order confirming that Cook will remain in her job while additional litigation plays out.

Earlier this week, Justice Department officials urged her to decide quickly so that the parties would have a chance to appeal her decision ahead of the Federal Reserve's September 16 meeting.

Neither Pulte nor the Justice Department responded to requests for comment.

At a court hearing Friday, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth said Trump rightfully fired Cook. The Federal Reserve's role in setting interest rates means that a person who lies on mortgage documents can't be trusted, he said.

He also criticized Cook for not providing any explanation for the apparent inconsistencies in her mortgage documents.

"Is there some material factual dispute?" Roth said during the hearing. "I think if there was something like that, we would have heard it by now."

Lowell, at Friday's hearing, said that the apparent inconsistencies did not meet the legal definition for "cause" required by the law. He said Trump needed to give Cook due process, and that the narrative about mortgage documents was a pretext for Trump filling the Federal Reserve with his own appointees to lower interest rates as part of his economic plan.

"A bad motive can illuminate the fact that there was no real cause," he said.

In a Tuesday court filing, Cook's attorneys wrote, "Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud."

Lowell said in his Thursday statement that he would continue to address the allegations.

"The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again," Lowell said.

This story has been updated to add additional comments from Abbe Lowell.

A bad year just got worse for Salesforce.

Following a disappointing revenue forecast in its quarterly earnings report late Wednesday, Salesforce's stock slumped 8%, bringing its decline for 2025 to 28%. That's the worst performance in large-cap tech.

Revenue increased 10% in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier, cracking double-digit growth for the first time since early 2024. Sales of $10.24 billion topped the average analyst estimate of $10.14 billion, and earnings per share also exceeded expectations.

However, for the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce said revenue will be $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion, while analysts were expecting $10.29 billion, according to LSEG.

Salesforce regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, but the company hasn't been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers — particularly those focused on infrastructure. 

There's also a concern on Wall Street that AI is going to eat away at much of the software sector.

"While the investor community oozes angst over the future of SaaS, the here and now from Salesforce, while impressive at scale, is not enough to reshape the narrative," wrote analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a report on Wednesday. The analysts have a buy rating on the stock.

Salesforce is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products, Robin Washington, the company's president and chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts.

In its earnings release, Salesforce said it closed over 12,500 total deals for Agentforce, which can automate the handling of customer service questions. That includes 6,000 paid deals. The company said that over 40% of bookings for Agentforce and its data cloud came from existing customers.

CEO Marc Benioff maintained his optimistic tone, downplaying concerns about the AI threat to software and telling analysts on the earnings call that "we are seeing one of the greatest transformations" in the space.

"To hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, and people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth," Benioff said.

Salesforce kept its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue.

A bad year just got worse for Salesforce.

Following a disappointing revenue forecast in its quarterly earnings report late Wednesday, Salesforce's stock slumped nearly 5%, bringing its decline for 2025 to 27%. That's the worst performance in large-cap tech.

Revenue increased 10% in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier, cracking double-digit growth for the first time since early 2024. Sales of $10.24 billion topped the average analyst estimate of $10.14 billion, and earnings per share also exceeded expectations.

However, for the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce said revenue will be $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion, while analysts were expecting $10.29 billion, according to LSEG.

Salesforce regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, but the company hasn't been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers — particularly those focused on infrastructure.

There's also a concern on Wall Street that AI is going to eat away at much of the software sector.

"While the investor community oozes angst over the future of SaaS, the here and now from Salesforce, while impressive at scale, is not enough to reshape the narrative," wrote analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a report Wednesday. The analysts have a buy rating on the stock.

Salesforce is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products, Robin Washington, the company's president and chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts.

In its earnings release, Salesforce said it closed more than 12,500 total deals for Agentforce, which can automate the handling of customer service questions. That includes 6,000 paid deals. The company said that more than 40% of bookings for Agentforce and its data cloud came from existing customers.

CEO Marc Benioff maintained his optimistic tone, downplaying concerns about the AI threat to software and telling analysts on the earnings call that "we are seeing one of the greatest transformations" in the space.

"To hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, and people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth," Benioff said.

Salesforce kept its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue.

Retirement account balances, which fell at the start of the year due to market volatility, bounced back in the second quarter, according to the latest data from Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) savings plans.

The average 401(k) balance jumped 8% from a year earlier to $137,800, a record high, Fidelity found.

The average individual retirement account balance also rose 5% year over year to $131,366.

The rebound in account balances helped boost the number of 401(k) millionaires to an all-time high. 

The number of 401(k) accounts with a balance of $1 million or more jumped to 595,000 as of June 30, up 16% from the first quarter, according to Fidelity.

The number of IRA-created millionaires also increased by 16% to a record 501,481.

Positive savings behaviors were key to better outcomes, said Mike Shamrell, Fidelity's vice president of thought leadership.

The majority of retirement savers continued to make contributions, even during periods of market turbulence, Fidelity found. The average 401(k) contribution rate, including employer and employee contributions, largely held steady at 14.2%, just shy of Fidelity's suggested savings rate of 15%.

A great stretch for the major indexes also helped.

U.S. markets came under pressure after the White House first announced country-specific tariffs on April 2, causing some of the worst trading days for the S&P 500 since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, markets then rebounded from those losses. Savers who "stayed the course, continued to contribute at healthy levels and didn't make significant changes to their allocation, were able to take advantage of the positive market conditions that followed," said Shamrell.

As of Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 was up about 10% year to date, the Nasdaq had gained more than 11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose roughly 6%.

"We have seen a lot of resilience out of the market despite a lot of volatility," said Tim Maurer, a certified financial planner and the chief advisory officer at SignatureFD, based in Atlanta.

"Markets have a positive rate of return," said Maurer, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. "Any asset class that has a positive rate of return should regularly hit new highs."

I've traveled to more than 20 countries, but Mexico continues to be one of my favorite destinations to visit.

One Mexican city in particular has stolen my heart: Puerto Vallarta. Located on the country's west coast, Puerto Vallarta is more than just a classic resort town. It offers a unique blend of pristine beaches, a bustling downtown scene, and plenty of outdoor adventure.

I've visited Puerto Vallarta four times in the past two years — with friends, family, and for bachelorette parties — and every trip has offered something a little different.

Whether you're looking for nature, nightlife, relaxation, or mouthwatering dishes, there truly is something for every type of traveler. Here's why I love visiting this lively Mexican city.

One of the best parts of traveling is indulging in the local delicacies, and Puerto Vallarta has no shortage of incredible meals.

Those who want a fun and classic street-food-style experience should head to Pancho's Takos.

The restaurant's al pastor tacos are so good that you'll probably have to wait in a line that stretches around the block. Fortunately, it's in the heart of downtown, so you can see street performers and people-watch while waiting.

Travelers looking for something a little more luxe will love the stretch of restaurants along Playa Los Muertos (the main tourist beach).

I especially enjoy El Dorado, which has fresh-tasting seafood, craft cocktails, and attentive service. The best part is the option to dine with your toes in the sand.

I recommend going for dinner at sunset for a romantic and memorable dining experience — just be sure to make reservations ahead of time, as tables go fast.

Puerto Vallarta's nightlife offers an inclusive and spirited ambiance and is ideal for a late night on the town with friends.

The Zona Romántica, or Romantic Zone, is home to lots of bars and nightclubs. It's also a hub for the LGBTQ+ communities and reminds me of West Hollywood.

Once the sun goes down, crowds spill (or dance) out of bass-pumping bars on every corner.

If a party is what you're looking for, you won't have to try very hard to find it in the Zona Romántica.

Outdoorsy folks will love the plethora of scenic hiking trails, water sports, and natural wonders in or near Puerto Vallarta.

I recommend checking out the Palo Maria waterfall trail, a moderate 1.4-mile trail that leads to a small waterfall and swimming hole. I loved jumping in the water to cool off from the heat and snapping photos.

If whale watching sounds like something up your alley, make sure to visit between December and March, when humpback whales migrate to Puerto Vallarta's Banderas Bay to breed and give birth. It's an awe-inspiring sight to witness.

During one of my trips to the city, I even got to look under the sea's surface with a snorkeling tour to Los Arcos National Marine Park. You can get there by boat or kayak — I opted for a kayaking tour through the Garza Blanca Resort.

The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing for Stephen Miran on Thursday.

Miran, the economist nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the open Federal Reserve governor post vacated by Adriana Kugler, will come under scrutiny amid questions of the Fed's independence.

On Wednesday, Miran pledged to uphold the central bank's independence, as well as its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.

"In my view, the most important job of the central bank is to prevent Depressions and hyperinflations. Independence of monetary policy is a critical element for its success," Miran said in his opening remarks submitted to the Senate Banking Committee ahead of time.

The hearing is set to start at 10 a.m. ET.

Figma shares plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, falling to the lowest price since the design software vendor's initial public offering in July after the company reported earnings for the first time as a public company.

Results for the second quarter were largely in line with expectations, as Figma had issued preliminary results a little over a month ago. Revenue increased 41% from a year earlier to $249.6 million, slightly topping analysts' estimates of $248.8 million, according to LSEG.

Analysts at Piper Sandler described the report as "largely a non-event," but noted that the "shares have witnessed hyper-volatility" following their 250% surge in the trading debut.

Since closing at $115.50 on its first day, the stock has lost more than half its value, lowering the company's market cap to about $27 billion.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

Figma's IPO was significant for Silicon Valley and the tech sector broadly as it represented one of the highest-profile offerings in years and signaled Wall Street's growing appetite for growth. The market had been in a multiyear lull that began in early 2022, when inflation was soaring and interest rates were on the rise.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

— CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Figma shares plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, falling to the lowest price since the design software vendor's IPO in July after the company reported earnings for the first time as a public company.

Results for the second quarter were largely inline with expectations, as Figma had issued preliminary results a little over a month ago. Revenue increased 41% from a year earlier to $249.6 million, slightly topping analyst estimates of $248.8 million, according to LSEG.

Analysts at Piper Sandler described the report as "largely a non-event," but noted that the "shares have witnessed hyper-volatility" following their 250% surge in the trading debut.

Since closing at $115.50 on its first day, the stock has lost more than half its value, lowering the company's market cap to about $27 billion.

For the third quarter, Figma forecasted revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

Figma's IPO was significant for Silicon Valley and the tech sector broadly as it represented one of the highest-profile offerings in years and signaled Wall Street's growing appetite for growth. The market had been in a multiyear lull that began in early 2022, when inflation was soaring and interest rates were on the rise.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

The Danish renewable energy company Orsted sued the Trump administration on Thursday to prevent it from blocking the completion of a wind farm off the coast of New England.

The Interior Department abruptly ordered Orsted on Aug. 22 to halt construction on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The fully permitted project is 80% complete and would provide enough power for more than 350,000 homes across both states.

Orsted asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to set aside the stop-work order, calling it arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and "issued in bad faith."

Orsted shares hit a record low on Aug. 25 in the wake of the stop-work order. 

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has justified the order on national security grounds and concerns that Revolution Wind will interfere with other uses of U.S. territorial waters. But Orsted said this justification is just a pretext, pointing to President Donald Trump's long-standing animus toward wind power going back more than a decade.

"The President has apparent hostility towards offshore wind, including based on statements made on the campaign trail," Orsted's attorney told the court.

Revolution Wind has undergone extensive environmental and safety reviews over nearly a decade that cost more than $100 million, according to Orsted's lawsuit. Federal agencies have uniformily concluded based on thousands of pages of data that the project is "environmentally sound, safe and consistent with federal law," the company said.

Trump has targeted the wind industry since his first day in office, when he issued an order that closed federal waters to new leases for offshore projects. But the renewable industry had hoped that the White House would allow permitted projects such as Revolution Wind to proceed.

Trump has escalated his attacks on the renewable energy industry in recent weeks. The president said his administration would not approve solar and wind projects two days before Revolution Wind was hit with the stop-work order.

And the Trump administration on Friday canceled $679 million in funding for a dozen infrastructure projects that support the offshore wind industry.

T. Rowe Price shares rallied Thursday after the asset manager struck a $1 billion deal with Goldman Sachs to sell private market products to retail investors.

Goldman will buy up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price common stock through open market purchases with the intention to own up to 3.5%, according to the announcement. The two financial firms will team up to offer wealth and retirement funds that give access to private markets for individuals, financial advisors, plan sponsors and plan participants.

T. Rowe Price shares surged nearly 6% in afternoon trading Thursday.

"This investment and collaboration represent our conviction in a shared legacy of success delivering results for investors," David Solomon, CEO of Goldman, said in a statement. "With Goldman Sachs' decades of leadership innovating across public and private markets and T. Rowe Price's expertise in active investing, clients can invest confidently in the new opportunities for retirement savings and wealth creation."



T. Rowe Price's shares have struggled over the years with the Baltimore-based firm slow to embrace the exchange-traded fund boom with its bread and butter being active management, resulting in massive withdrawals and disappointing returns. T. Rowe shares have provided a negative return over the last five years for investors.

The new deal came on the heels of President Donald Trump's newly signed executive order that aimed at allowing investors greater access to alternative assets for 401(k) plans, including cryptocurrencies and private market assets.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Kern. It has been edited for length and clarity.

From June through September, my days revolve around the tide and the sun. When the sun sets, I know it's time to eat and rest. When the tide touches the bottom of my mooring buoy, it's time to work on the rock wall I'm building to help fight erosion.

That's what days are like on Planet Sand. That's my preferred name for the 1.5-acre island in Casco Bay, about a 15-minute boat ride from Portland, Maine. The island — officially called Sand Island — has no running water, electricity, or reliable internet. It's my home for three months out of the year.

While I'm on Planet Sand, I live in a structure I call my Garden Shed Tree Fort. It's built from recycled construction trash that I collected from dumps on the mainland. How big is it? It's perfect. That's the measurement system we use here on Planet Sand: too big, not enough, or perfect.

I have a gas-powered generator that I use to power a deep freezer. I don't fish, and I hate the taste of seafood, so I prefer to grill chicken or a burger. I'd like to add a crock pot to my supplies next summer, but I'm not sure how I'll power it.

I go into town as little as possible. My boat is small and slow, so Portland, the nearest city, is a 45-minute boat ride for me. My record is eight weeks, but it's more typical to go get supplies every three to five weeks. I collect water from a café on a nearby island, bringing over 30 gallons at a time.

People love to ask about the bathroom situation. I say, "Next question." I'm out here doing something extraordinary, working to save the world, and you want to know where I pee?

My parents bought a half-ownership in Sand Island back in the 1990s. We lived on another island in Casco Bay, but that one was populated, paved, and connected to the mainland by a bridge.

Sand Island is different; it's essentially a wasteland of sand and poison ivy. There were no structures or docks. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the shore of the island, including time to scramble over rocks. Still, I've turned trash into treasure.

My parents owned a 30-foot sailboat and loved to come to Planet Sand. I enjoyed camping there, and my stays got longer and longer. In the real world, I was an outsider, but on Planet Sand, I felt at home. The island called to me.

Unfortunately, I didn't always hear that call. I have some health issues and have struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism. For years, that made me forget about the island. But when I started getting healthier, I knew where I wanted to spend my summers.

When I first returned to Planet Sand for the summers, I was still drinking. I would wake up at noon, so hungover. We allow day visitors to the island, so I would see families playing together in this beautiful place, all while my head throbbed.

I thought, "What am I doing to myself?" I have this beautiful spot, and I'm throwing it all away. That's why I stopped drinking, too. This November, I'll mark seven years in recovery.

Being out here is not a vacation. I work all day, building a rock wall or repairing my winch system. I document my projects on my YouTube channel. While I work, I listen to songs on my battery-powered radio. I love '90s hits and oldies from the 1950s and '60s. Those songs are just so happy.

I like to socialize with the boaters who come by. Most of the time, it's just me here, but on one day this summer, we had 60 people on the island. I love watching people laugh and explore with their families. There are kids here making memories that will last their whole lives.

I've heard there's research about nature being good for mental health. If they say 15 minutes in nature can improve your mental health, just imagine what three months can do. For me, the island — my planet — is magic and medicine.

Spirit Airlines is ending service in a host of U.S. cities this fall as it fights for survival. Its rivals, meanwhile, are circling its customers, and one is preparing for the possibility the budget travel icon shuts down altogether.

United Airlines on Thursday put on sale a slew of new flights in cities where Spirit operates, like its home base of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Orlando, Florida, as well as Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.

"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them," Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in a news release.

Spirit shot back at Quayle's comment.

"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation. Suggesting anything else is wishful thinking on the part of a high-cost airline looking to eliminate a low-cost competitor so they can fulfill their ultimate goal of charging American travelers the highest fares possible to visit the people and places they love," Duncan Dee, Spirit's senior vice president of corporate communications said in an emailed statement. 

"Spirit is responsible for making low fares available to consumers for more than 30 years, whether they fly with us or not," Dee continued. "We have every expectation to continue doing so for many years to come."

United's new flights start Jan. 6.

Last week Frontier Airlines, the second-largest budget airline in the U.S. behind Spirit, announced 20 new routes that compete with Spirit.

Meanwhile, in October, Spirit is exiting Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, as well as Oakland, San Diego, Sacramento and San Jose in California, the carrier told CNBC on Wednesday. It is also axing plans to start service in Macon, Georgia, on Oct. 16. 

"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund," Spirit said in an emailed statement.

Some of United's additional flights include service between the New York area and Columbia and Chattanooga. United is also adding additional flights between Houston, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as several additional daily roundtrip options like Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and Chicago to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans and Las Vegas, among others.

Frontier has the most seat overlap with Spirit at 39%, while United has 18%, according to TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald.

Several analysts have said they expect full-service airlines will benefit from Spirit's troubles. Many of those carriers have big global networks to serve customers, as well as a basic economy, no-frills product that competes with Spirit and other low-cost airlines.

With larger airlines "improving onboard product (premium, free Wi-Fi, inflight entertainment) and network expansion, consumers are increasingly choosing network airlines like Delta and United over the historical market disruptors," Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham wrote in a note Wednesday.

Spirit Airlines filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a less than year last week after it faced weaker-than-expected demand and continued high costs when it exited its earlier bankruptcy in March.

The carrier didn't make the more painful, deeper cuts that are common in bankruptcies the first time it filed, and it's facing those choices now.

Upon filing its second bankruptcy petition, Spirit last week said it would further scale down its network and shrink its fleet, cuts that it said will reduce costs by "hundreds of millions of dollars" a year.

"Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future," Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in a news release Friday.

In a court filing in December, Spirit forecast a net profit of $252 million this year. But in August, it said it instead lost nearly $257 million since March 13, after it exited Chapter 11, through the end of June.

Spirit warned earlier in August that it might not be able to survive a year unless it significantly increased its cash.

It also said its credit card processor was seeking additional collateral. It then borrowed the entire $275 million available under its revolving credit facility and said that the card processor could hold back up to $3 million a day from the airline. Even before bankruptcy, Spirit had planned to furlough hundreds of additional pilots this fall.

JetBlue Airways plans to install Amazon's Project Kuiper on some of its airplanes to bolster in-flight Wi-Fi, the companies announced Thursday, in a vote of confidence for the nascent internet satellite service.

The technology will be added to about a quarter of the airline's fleet, with the rollout beginning in 2027 and expected to be complete in 2028, JetBlue President Marty St. George said on a call with reporters.

The team-up is a significant win for Amazon, which has been working to build a constellation of internet-beaming satellites in low-Earth orbit, called Project Kuiper. The service will compete directly with Elon Musk's Starlink, which currently dominates the market and has 8,000 satellites in orbit.

Amazon has sent up 102 satellites through a series of rocket launches since April. It's aiming to meet a deadline by the Federal Communications Commission, which requires it to have about 1,600, or half of its full constellation, in orbit by the end of July 2026.

The company hopes to begin commercial service later this year.

"Even though we still have a lot more work to do, we're super excited to have JetBlue as the first airline customer for Kuiper," Chris Weber, Kuiper's vice president of sales and marketing, told reporters.

Starlink has signed up a growing number of airlines to use its services. JetBlue is Kuiper's first airline partner, though Amazon has signed several deals recently as it tries to expand the service, including with European plane maker Airbus in April.

JetBlue has offered free in-flight internet for years through a partnership with Viasat, which operates a network of geostationary, or GEO, satellites. That partnership will continue, St. George said.

He praised Amazon's satellite service, saying Kuiper offers high speed, low latency and high reliability compared with GEO satellite networks. JetBlue could eventually use a combination of low-Earth orbit and GEO satellites for in-flight internet, St. George added.

U.S. airlines have been working to improve their in-flight Wi-Fi, which has long been derided for slow speeds and high prices.

Southwest Airlines on Thursday said it will offer free Wi-Fi to members of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program through a partnership with T-Mobile starting Oct. 24.

Delta Air Lines followed JetBlue in unveiling complimentary connectivity in 2023 for its SkyMiles loyalty program members. Hawaiian Airlines is using Starlink for free in-flight Wi-Fi, and Alaska Airlines, which acquired that carrier last year, recently said it would outfit its planes with the same service.

United Airlines is also working to equip its planes to offer its loyalty program members free Wi-Fi through Starlink. American Airlines, for its part, in April said it plans to have free in-flight internet on most of its planes next year for members of its AAdvantage program.

The National Football League continues to widen its lead as the most valuable and profitable sports league in the world, with the average franchise now worth $7.65 billion, according to CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations 2025. That figure marks an 18% jump from last year.

Eleven NFL teams are now valued at $8 billion or more, up from just two a year ago, according to CNBC's calculations. Big-market teams with lucrative stadium revenues top CNBC's list.

The Dallas Cowboys, worth $12.5 billion, retained their spot as the league's most valuable team, according to CNBC's calculations. The Cowboys also posted the highest revenue in the NFL at $1.27 billion. In 2024, the Cowboys generated about $300 million in sponsorship revenue, by far the most in the NFL, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  

The Los Angeles Rams, valued at $10.7 billion, are the second-most-valuable team, according to CNBC's calculations. The team raked in nearly $250 million in sponsorship revenue in 2024, behind only the Cowboys, according to another person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Average team revenue during the 2024 season reached $687 million, up 7.3% from the previous year, according to CNBC's calculations. That increase was fueled largely by national revenue — television, licensing and sponsorship proceeds shared equally among the 32 franchises — which rose to an average of $433 million per team from $403 million the previous season, according to league executives.

Average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, climbed 7.9% in 2024 to $137 million, according to CNBC's calculations.

The NFL's financial strength is underpinned by its popularity and the value of its content. NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 most-watched U.S. telecasts in 2024, according to Nielsen. Media rights deals now generate an average of $12.4 billion annually, according to a person familiar with the contracts, who asked to remain unnamed because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The value of the league's content extends beyond rights fees. Early last month, Walt Disney's ESPN and the NFL agreed to a deal in which Disney would acquire the NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the distribution rights to NFL RedZone in exchange for a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Analysts and insiders estimate the NFL's stake in ESPN could be worth between $2 billion and $3 billion. The deal is also expected to significantly boost EBITDA because it will shift a lot of production costs from the NFL to ESPN, according to league executives.

The NFL also holds a small ownership stake in Paramount Skydance through a joint venture between Skydance Sports and the league.

Team owners have been capitalizing on the league's popularity and financial strength by selling stakes to limited partners. While there have been only three investments by private equity firms in NFL teams since the league allowed such deals a year ago, the rule change has had a profound effect on sale prices, because private equity firms — which have lined up in front of nearly every NFL team, according to sports bankers — have set a floor on valuations and erased concerns over liquidity.

Arctos Partners purchased stakes in the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Chargers, while Ares Management acquired a minority stake in the Miami Dolphins. Historically, investors would expect a 20% to 25% discount on valuation if they were looking to buy a small stake that would give them no say in how the team is run or offer a path to control. But that cheaper investment has largely been eviscerated, according to a cadre of sports bankers CNBC interviewed. The bankers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they worked on many of the transactions that took place.

NFL team ownership tends to be much more multigenerational than that of other leagues. There is tremendous demand to be part of NFL team ownership and, relative to other leagues, very few sales or transfers of ownership stakes give a buyer controlling interest in a team.

The NFL's ownership rules require the person with a controlling interest to own at least 30% of the team and have a maximum of $1.5 billion of debt on the team and stadium. The sports bankers told CNBC that people who are wealthy but don't have the super wealth to buy a controlling stake are willing to purchase a small minority stake at an amount that would buy a controlling interest in another league.

The Chicago Bears saw the biggest one-year jump in valuation this year, up 39.1% to $8.9 billion. A deal pending NFL approval would have the existing owners of the team, the McCaskey and Ryan families, purchase a 2.3% stake owned by the estate of Andrew McKenna Sr. at an NFL record $8.9 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Before the Bears deal, the previous record-high price paid for a minority stake in an NFL team was about $8.6 billion, for a 6.2% piece of the San Francisco 49ers in May. The 49ers had topped an $8.3 billion valuation for an 8% stake in the Philadelphia Eagles at the end of 2024. The New York Giants are currently looking to sell a 10% stake at about a $10 billion valuation.

At such rich valuations and with private equity firms eager for a piece of the action, more minority stake sales are expected over the coming months.

CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations are current enterprise values — equity plus net debt — calculated using revenue multiples and include the economics of the team's stadium, including non-NFL revenue that accrues to the team's owner.

The valuations exclude the value of the stadium real estate and other businesses owned by the team. For example, the value of the Dallas Cowboys excludes The Star, the team's 91-acre headquarters, practice facility and commercial real estate.

Values are adjusted for teams whose stadium economics are expected to improve soon, such as the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans, who are scheduled to move into new stadiums in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

CNBC adjusts values for teams that have secured financing for significant stadium improvements, such as the Cincinnati Bengals, who are getting $350 million from Hamilton County in Ohio for a $470 million renovation of Paycor Stadium.

Revenue and EBITDA figures are for the 2024 season and are on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis. Debt figures are the latest available and include both team debt and stadium debt.

CNBC deducts the cost of goods sold from merchandise sales. Therefore, CNBC excluded the $23 million noncash GAAP accrual each team had to set aside in 2024 for potential concussion lawsuit settlements and included the slightly less than $2 million every team received for a stock sale made by 32 Equity, the league's investment arm, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Sources for CNBC's Official NFL Team Valuations include team owners, investors and executives; sports bankers and league consultants; public documents such as stadium lease agreements, stadium authority budgets and audits, and credit rating reports; and sponsorship and broadcasting industry executives.

Figures that could not be confirmed with sources are CNBC estimates. Some figures used in the calculation of values may be approximate.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Yen, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Los Angeles who is the founder of Daily Work Journal and Surfers Jewelry. Business Insider has verified Yen's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

It's the classic story: You quit a 9-to-5 to become an entrepreneur and end up working 24/7.

I worked long hours in data analytics, but the difference now is that I'm willing to put in far more hours because it's my own company; it's part of my identity.

Now, my work includes things I love: talking to surfers, dreaming up brand trips — experiences I could never have had as a corporate analyst. It's high risk, high reward, but the flexibility and creative freedom make it worth it.

I started my career as a business technology analyst at Deloitte right out of UCLA in 2014. I chose Deloitte's San Francisco office for a change of pace from Los Angeles.

I had imagined a glamorous consulting life filled with travel, but my last project before quitting Deloitte involved commuting from San Francisco to Walnut Creek every day. It took two hours, round-trip, in traffic, and it drained me more than the job itself.

In consulting, you don't have much control over what projects you work on, and I realized I wanted more say in my career.

Being in San Francisco, tech was all around me, so I started interviewing for tech roles while still at Deloitte. I landed my first data role as a marketing analyst at Salesforce in January 2016. In interviews, I largely leaned on the Excel skills I built at Deloitte, and since it was also a core skill the team sought, it helped me transition seamlessly into my first tech role.

Salesforce was my introduction to data analytics, but I quickly realized marketing wasn't my long-term focus. I wanted to keep working with data while expanding into a broader scope, so I moved into business operations, which allowed me to touch strategy, business development analytics, sales analytics, and marketing analytics.

From there, I joined Yelp in a business operations and strategy analytics role, working across multiple functions. People analytics became the final area I wanted to explore.

The opportunity to round out my skills with people analytics came at Cruise, the self-driving car startup, which I joined in June 2019. At Cruise, my role aligned more closely with my interest in people and decision-making.

But after several years in the high-stress field of data analytics, I was exhausted. Everyone wants your time and expects you to build dashboards, often with quick turnarounds. You're responsible not only for the work but also for its absolute accuracy. I'd stay late testing dashboards and show up early to present results to executives, walking them through what the data meant and how to act on it. The stakes felt high.

At my peak stress, I had dreams about redoing Excel formulas, obsessing over whether I'd divided something twice or misplaced a decimal. It got to the point where I was constantly ruminating about tiny details that could throw off entire reports by orders of magnitude. That level of pressure wasn't sustainable for me.

While still at Cruise, I enrolled in a coaching program, the Coactive Training Institute in the Bay Area, got certified, and began taking on clients on the side.

In August 2020, during the pandemic, I decided to leave Cruise. I was burned out, single, living alone, and feeling the isolation of COVID-19. I wanted a break from corporate life and leaned into coaching full time.

At the same time, I launched my first product business in December 2020 — Daily Work Journal, a notebook brand. It was my first foray into e-commerce. I ran that company until I sold it in January 2024.

After selling Daily Work Journal, I took some time off and started surfing, purely for fun. I never planned on building a business around it, but it became the perfect synergy; that's how Surfers Jewelry began. I had confidence in my ability to run it because it's e-commerce-based, like my journal brand.

Now, my focus is entirely on my jewelry business: creating, marketing, and connecting with the surfing community. I only coach occasionally, when past clients reach out.

I always advise aspiring entrepreneurs to have a corporate career before striking out on their own. Whatever you specialize in becomes your edge as an entrepreneur.

My experience in data analytics gave me skills I now use every day and confidence in the financial side of my business. I understand the big picture, I can hold my own in negotiations, and I don't need to hire for that part of my company.

When I was younger, I never imagined this career path. Most of my peers stayed in corporate roles, and I didn't become an entrepreneur until my late 20s. But now, I can't imagine doing anything else.

Over the course of my career at companies like Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I've hired, developed, and evaluated hundreds of employees. Many of them were smart, capable, and ambitious. They wanted promotions, and they got them — but I've also turned down many requests.

If you think the group that got their requests granted was innately more talented or harder working than the group that didn't, think again. The truth is that, most of the time, the request itself wasn't the problem. The candidate wasn't even the problem. It was the timing that made the difference.

Promotions and pay raises are business decisions, not gifts. This means that even the strongest performers will hear "not now" if they ignore the situations that surround them.

Here are five of the most common timing missteps I've seen, and what I wish more rising leaders would do differently.

This is surprisingly common. Someone gets promoted in January and, by April, they're asking for another raise.

I once had a high performer who was promoted to senior manager after a solid year. Less than 90 days later, she sent me a proposal for another title change — accompanied by comp benchmarks and a list of expanded responsibilities.

She was doing more, but she hadn't been in the role long enough to demonstrate success at that level, and she lacked the self-awareness that no one should ask for more every quarter.

Keep a record of what's changed. If your role evolves quickly, talk about that during check-ins with your manager. Understand your career path and the next opportunity for growth. Then, give the business time to see your impact before you ask to level up again.

It's natural to want to impress a new boss. I've seen people use early 1:1s to talk about their career goals. This makes sense — to an extent. And it's fine to let your new manager know if you had conversations with your old manager about your path to a promotion.

However, when it turns into "What would it take for me to get promoted this year?" before the manager even understands your role (and hers!), it can create the perception that you're only thinking about yourself. It's like walking into a room you've never been in before and immediately asking to rearrange the furniture.

Start by understanding how your new manager defines success and taking an interest in her priorities and challenges. Ask smart questions, then deliver, and deliver consistently. You can talk about growth and next steps once you've built trust and credibility.

Some of the hardest "no" answers I've had to give were to employees who were deserving but seemed oblivious to what was going on around them. Even if you think you've done everything right, asking for more when the broader context is shaky can hurt your chances.

I've had employees come to me during expense freezes, department restructures, or right after we missed our numbers, sometimes with very strong cases for advancement. In those moments, the ask just wasn't feasible for the business.

Make yourself even more valuable by showing that you can lead patiently through uncertainty. Be the person who brings stability when others are scrambling. Once the business starts to recover — and you've played a visible role in that — you'll be in a much stronger position to ask for more.

This happens when someone moves too quickly after a mistake or learning opportunity. Maybe a key project didn't land, or they got feedback about how they lead meetings, and they haven't yet corrected for it. Then, a few weeks later, they're asking for a promotion.

Even if their overall track record is strong, the timing is off. Leaders want to see that you can take input, apply it, and grow from it. If you haven't closed the loop on feedback, asking for more shows a lack of accountability and self-awareness.

I once had a direct report who delivered great work but struggled with cross-functional influence and managing senior leaders. We talked about it openly, and he was aware and committed to improving. Two weeks later, he asked if he was in line for a promotion that quarter.

It was too soon. He hadn't had time to show progress yet, and asking so soon after our conversation made it seem like he didn't understand the gravity of the feedback.

Slow down, and shore up any doubts about your potential. When you hear feedback, don't just acknowledge it — change something.

Then, when you make the ask, it will be even stronger because your coachability and growth will become part of the case for advancement.

This mistake is almost as common and equally costly as the others. Every once in a while, someone has come to me unexpectedly and said, "I'm ready for the next level." If we hadn't been talking about growth, readiness, or performance over time, it could be challenging to make it happen quickly.

Big asks shouldn't come out of nowhere. They require a track record with a narrative, relationships, and often a process. Depending on other career path timelines you've observed, your own performance, and the standard cycle of mid-year and year-end performance conversations, you might start talking about your career goals once you've been in your role for 6-12 months.

Make career growth part of the regular conversation. Use 1:1s with your manager or HR to ask what overdelivering looks like. Get clarity on what's expected at the next level. That way, when you're ready to make a formal ask, your manager's already on the same page.

There's no perfect time to ask for a raise or a promotion. Yet, there are wrong times and there is a smart time. It's usually after you've shown clear results, earned credibility, and positioned yourself inside the broader business picture.

If you're preparing to make a case, put yourself in your manager's shoes, evaluate what's happening across the team or company, and ask yourself, "Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes'?"

At long last, the white whale of iOS has been harpooned: Instagram finally made an app for iPad.

Shockingly, there had never been a true iPad Instagram app — you could download the regular Instagram mobile app and use it on an iPad, but it was a uniquely crummy experience — you could use it with a phone-sized display or zoomed out, and the whole thing was clunky and sad.

Finally, there's a new iPad version, nearly 15 years after Instagram first launched. (The iPad, also launched in 2010, just barely predates Instagram.)

I tried it out on my iPad (which, honestly, I don't use all that much other than occasionally for scrolling on the couch when I leave my phone in the other room), and I have to say: This is the Cadillac of doomscrolling.

The biggest difference the iPad app has from the phone version is that it always opens onto the Reels tab. No more pretense that you might be hoping to see "photos" from your "friends" in the main feed.

Instead, you'll see Stories at the top, should you choose to interact with those plebes you know in real life who cling to the sad concept of posting photos and videos from their real life to share with their close friends.

What I like best about the experience is that the sound on the first video you see is off by default. But instead of having to tap the 🔊 icon in the corner of the frame, you simply scroll down slightly, and the sound starts playing. This saves you the highly unpleasant experience of opening an app and having sound start playing right away, and it's also more intuitive to just slightly scroll down than to hunt and tap for a sound on/off icon. Great!

What does it mean that Instagram's iPad app is so Reels-centric? A more video-first approach makes sense with Reels and iPads. Since iPads are popular for watching video content — YouTube or Netflix — why not sit back and watch some Reels?

Instagram's official blog post says: "With Instagram for iPad, we've redesigned the experience to reflect how people use bigger screens today — for lean back entertainment."

Buddy, you don't have to tell me twice to lean back and stare at a screen until I feel numb inside! Thanks, Meta!

Amazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent.

An internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated "hub" offices are hampering recruiting efforts.

The hub strategy is listed as one of the "hotly debated topics" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire "high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider.

Some Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely.

One of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.

In addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported.

The stakes are high. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind.

Oracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently.

In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said that the premise of this story was wrong, adding that the company continues to attract and retain some of the best people in the world."

"We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations," the spokesperson said. 

Many firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. It demands 5 days in-office and ties compliance to promotions and performance reviews. Those who refuse to relocate to "hubs" are considered by Amazon to have voluntarily resigned.

"We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time," the Amazon spokesperson said. 

Wall Street is already noticing. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

Amazon is about to enter the AI agent race in a big way, giving the tech giant another chance to make progress in the lucrative enterprise software market.

The Seattle-based company is testing new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.

Quick Suite empowers "every business user to make better decisions, faster, and act on them swiftly by unifying Al agents for business insights, deep research, and automation into a single experience," according to one of the documents, marked confidential.

Several companies have been given a private preview of the new technology, and Amazon recently sent out invitations for an internal beta test.

Quick Suite positions AWS to compete more aggressively in AI with agent-driven automation. Agents are the latest frontier in generative AI, designed to take action and independently use tools to complete tasks. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Salesforce — along with a host of smaller startups — are racing to be the main providers of agentic tools.

This is also another chance for Amazon to make a dent in the huge market for enterprise software and applications, known as SaaS. While the company is a pioneer in cloud computing, it's made less of a mark so far with software that runs on top of this infrastructure.

"With over 40% of business users expected to adopt Al-enhanced work environments soon, AWS is positioned to lead this shift by providing integrated solutions that help organizations — including our own — effectively deploy and scale Al agents in the workplace," Amazon's beta test invitation states.

Business Insider previously reported that Amazon was working on a unified "agentic" AI workspace, internally codenamed Q Business Suite, with "Quick" floated as a potential brand name.

"We are seeing strong growth of Amazon Q Business with customers like Remitly, Nasdaq, and Smartsheet, along with partners like Zoom and Asana, adopting it to provide employees with generative AI assistance to transform how work gets done," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 

"Similarly, we are seeing customers like BMW and GoDaddy embrace Amazon QuickSight in order to make data-driven decisions quickly," the spokesperson added. "We're building on this strong response with even more innovation to help customers realize the benefits of agentic AI in the workplace."

Quick Suite will merge some of AWS's existing products, such as its data analysis platform QuickSight and its AI chatbot Q Business, while also adding a new product called Quick Flows, according to another of the documents.

Quick Flows provides pre-built workflows that let customers automate tasks through natural language prompts, one of the documents explained.

Quick Suite will include a "deep research agent" to generate reports from company and external data, and will also enable customers to create custom agents for "specific business functions or team needs," which can then be shared across their organization, one of the documents said.

Amazon is inviting a "select group of beta testers" for Quick Suite and has already offered a "private preview" to at least 50 companies, the documents said.

It's unclear when Amazon plans to officially launch Quick Suite. The tentative launch date has already been delayed from mid-July to September, one of the documents said.

Quick Suite has received mixed feedback from beta users, according to one of the internal documents.

Customers praised its simpler setup and more intuitive design compared to Q Business, as well as its "compelling" deep research feature for both internal and external use. The ability to connect with external tools, such as Atlassian's Jira, has also been well received.

At the same time, some testers reported frustrations with networking limitations in virtual cloud environments and onerous permission requirements for linking data sources. Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, the document said.

Quick Suite's launch represents a turning point in AWS's AI application strategy. Q Business had been intended as the company's flagship offering for business users, but AWS is now making Quick Suite a priority, as BI previously reported.

Luxury carmaker Porsche will soon drop out of Germany's blue-chip DAX index following a protracted share price slump, as U.S. tariffs take their toll on the European auto industry.

In a Wednesday statement, STOXX Ltd said that Porsche would exit the DAX on Sept. 22 as part of a regular reshuffle and be replaced by online listings company Scout24.

Porsche is poised to become a member of the midcap MDAX index later this month, according to the update from a unit of stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse.

The manufacturer of high-performance sports cars, such as the renowned 911 model and luxury sports utility vehicles, has been hit particularly hard by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on European autos.

Porsche, which entered the DAX three years ago after its initial public offering in Sept. 2022, has repeatedly lowered its outlook in recent months, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs, weak demand in China and a slower-than-expected transition to electric mobility.

Company shares have fallen by more than a third over the last 12 months.

Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in an interview with German newspaper FAZ on Thursday that the company aims to return to the DAX "as soon as possible" and cited technical factors for the firm's index relegation.

A spokesperson for Porsche referred CNBC to Blume's comments to FAZ when asked to comment on the new orientation.

"The DAX will be one company poorer when it comes to one of Germany's most valuable companies. Considering the total market capitalization and the brand power of Porsche, we still count among the large publicly traded companies in Germany," Blume said in an interview with FAZ.

A market correction. A wake-up call. A great digestion. Call it what you want: AI is going through it.

Two things appear to be happening in tandem. Businesses are starting to finally grasp what AI can — and importantly, can't — do to boost their bottom lines. And the sky-high expectations that have been partly inflated and overhyped by AI firms over the past few years are finally coming down to Earth.

In short, it's increasingly looking like both the AI doomers and boomers were both wrong. AI's trajectory is starting to look less like a time machine or space elevator and more akin computers, smartphones, televisions: The technology will get better, it will almost certainly change our lives in the fullness of time, but it will more likely do so incrementally — to the point that if AGI (artificial general intelligence) or superintelligence do in fact one day arrive, it might not seem like much of a leap at all.

There's perhaps no better example of this happening than OpenAI's latest and long-anticipated model, GPT-5, which was touted with a bang and landed with a shrug. Ahead of launch, OpenAI's Sam Altman said he'd felt "useless" compared to the model's intelligence, even drawing parallels with the Manhattan Project. When it arrived, users apparently felt less intimidated. "The degree of overhyping was too significant," one person wrote. "In the absence of massive gains, all you have is hype," wrote another.

But it may be a glimpse at our new reality, where the breakneck speed of AI progress is simply steadying, where progress cannot run on hype alone, and where we will neither experience an overnight white-collar job wipeout nor reach an AI abundance society overnight.

Welcome to AI's "meh" era. Stay calm. We've been here before. It'll all be fine. Probably.

When the internet revolution took hold in the late 1990s, companies were minting millions overnight with little more than a website and a savvy sales pitch. By the year 2000, the economic reality caught up to the hype, leaving trillions of dollars wiped out overnight. Not familiar? Go ask your parents what happened to Pets.com.

It's easy to see why talk of a bubble has once again reared its head. Even Altman recently (and in an unusually measured moment from AI's biggest hype man) said he believes the AI market might be in a bubble.

"If you go back to the 1990s when the dotcom bubble burst, there weren't the profits necessarily to back the investments up, but there were tangible productivity gains," says Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. If that sounds eerily familiar, a check on AI now could prevent history from repeating itself.

A recent study published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further stirred the pot last month, claiming that just 5% of companies it studied have managed to convert the technology into actual revenue — a revelation scary enough to cause a tech stock sell-off, even if the study had a lot of limitations.

Other evidence suggests AI is starting to have an impact on businesses that are adopting it. A study from Stanford University researchers that analyzed payroll data concluded that AI was killing off entry-level jobs for people aged 22 to 25, and was especially doing so in fields where AI was more likely to replace, rather than augment, labor. Marc Benioff claims AI agents are replacing thousands of Salesforce's support roles, while other companies are boasting about AI automating more of their work.

A study of AI's effects on the demand for foreign translators by Frey and fellow Oxford economist Pedro Llanos-Paredes, published earlier this year, concluded that the technology was having a small but provable impact on these jobs.

"We seem to be seeing reasonable revenue growth for a handful of firms that are pioneering the AI revolution, but we're not seeing it translate into broader economic growth," Frey tells me. "What I find concerning is that we're still not seeing any hint of it in the productivity statistics, and ultimately that's what matters. It doesn't really matter how well AI performs on tests or on some benchmark. What matters is translating that into real economic growth."

For the markets, a more modest uptake may be perfectly OK. Evercore ISI strategists predict AI excitement will buoy US stocks a further 20% by the end of 2026. "AI is 'bigger' than the internet," they wrote in a note published this week. "In three years, its effect has touched all parts of society and industry even as adoption only begins to inflect."

Last week's Nvidia earnings were a strong indicator of where we're at. The company, which sells the valuable chips on which AI is trained and run, has become something of a bellwether for the entire artificial intelligence boom and counts some of the biggest tech giants as key customers. (Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft spends about 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia's chips.) While it beat Wall Street expectations and its own sales records, its stock still dropped, suggesting investors weren't impressed with the figures they saw. Some analysts warn that the companies buying these services from Nvidia aren't yet seeing the returns. One UBS analyst characterized Nvidia's results in a way that may perfectly sum up the new steady-chug-along paradigm of AI: "good enough."

All to say, AI seems to have reached its iPhone 4 moment.

When Apple's iPhone 4 arrived in 2010, it was nothing short of a smash hit. Onstage in Cupertino, Steve Jobs boasted that Apple had made the thinnest phone in the world with a laundry list of new must-have features: a squared-off design, high-resolution display, a front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies, and the debut of Apple's custom silicon chip, the A4. It flew off the shelves — despite the antenna fiasco — and further cemented Apple as the king of the smartphone. One could argue that the market has been chasing the iPhone 4's "sandwich glass" design ever since.

Then things changed: With the exception of a couple of moderate leaps since, the iPhone has been on a more incremental trajectory. Evidence suggests artificial intelligence might be plotting a similar course. Frontier labs have been rolling out a steady flow of updates and mini-leaps, rather than waiting years between generations, and as a result, each new rollout has started feeling evolutionary, incremental.

"If you're not the leading expert in the field, I think the progress has been such that you probably won't even notice the improvements from now on," says Frey.

Last year, the big topic was whether AI labs were seeing diminishing returns when simply trying to throw more data and compute power at the models. That may go some way to explain how GPT-5 landed, but it's not the only factor.

Between the launch of GPT-4 in March 2023 and GPT-5 last month, OpenAI rolled out well over a dozen models, each one focusing on specific jobs or incrementally improving another. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that GPT-5 didn't blow our socks off. (In the same conversation in which Altman claimed AI is in a bubble, he also claimed that OpenAI has more advanced models than GPT-5, but can't deploy them because it doesn't have the capacity.)

Google's latest frontier model, Gemini 2.5, is also a bridge model, and the launch of GPT-5 may serve as a healthy warning to temper expectations for Gemini 3, which is expected before the year's end.

"The progress just feels more continuous," says David Krueger, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal who studies AI safety and risks.

Krueger still thinks we'll have the occasional "wow" moment, but said he also believes we'll need more breakthroughs on the technical side to reach any level of artificial intelligence that can go toe-to-toe with a human — and he says he doesn't believe we will reach AGI from large language models alone.

"I think LLMs and more broadly deep learning are probably a big piece of the puzzle. If I had to bet, the biggest one," he says. "But I think we're maybe missing a couple of puzzle pieces."

Krueger also lays blame at the feet of certain AI figureheads who have created "unreasonable levels of hype," and who are finally getting a reality check. Altman may be the worst offender, but he's not the only one.

In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI would be writing 90% of software developers' code in three to six months. The actual gains appear to be much more modest: During Alphabet's Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that more than 30% of code written at Google was being generated by AI.

"I think a lot of this sort of feeling of disappointment is due to unreasonable levels of hype from the companies," said Krueger. As the rubber hits the road and the breakneck speed of AI potentially slows, expectations for the future of AI — and the possible, maybe, one day, arrival of AGI — are finally being put in check.

You can see how we got here. In a January interview with Bloomberg, Altman predicted AGI would arrive during Trump's second presidency. Elon Musk once predicted it could be here by the year's end. According to some of the best minds in AI, AGI is often just a "few years away." In truth it feels like we're finally realizing nobody actually knows.

Perhaps nobody has had more of a humbling in AI than Apple, which earlier this year axed an iPhone 16 ad that promised several much-hyped new AI features that, as it turned out, were far from ready. When Tim Cook steps onstage next week, don't be surprised if he and other executives strike a more measured tone when talking about AI, as they pull back the curtain on the latest lineup of devices.

I hear the new phone will be a little thinner this time.

Warren Buffett's dealmaking made him a legend, but the breakup of Kraft Heinz marks one of his few missteps, the investor's close followers say.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate partnered with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to acquire Heinz for around $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, they teamed up again to merge Heinz with Kraft in a $40 billion deal.

Buffett, a fast-food aficionado, called it "my kind of transaction," adding that the combined company could "supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your Oscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favorite meal."

Buffett, who plans to retire later this year after 55 years in charge, loves to own famous brands with beloved products, as they can raise prices to counter inflation, and loyal customers help them to fend off competition.

Kraft and Heinz fit the bill. But Buffett's partnership with 3G Capital was a departure from his playbook.

Private equity firms often seek to quickly cut a company's costs and change its management to raise its value so they can sell it for a profit and use the money to fund their next acquisition.

In contrast, Berkshire is known for offering permanent, hands-off ownership to businesses it buys, and seeks to avoid bloat instead of eliminate it, as Buffett laid out in his 2015 shareholder letter.

After the Kraft Heinz merger, there were layoffs, management overhauls, massive writedowns, and asset sales. Its aggressive cost controls "significantly impaired" its ability to innovate, the Harvard Business Review wrote.

The company also settled a federal accounting probe and had a protracted decline in net revenues amid shifting consumer preferences.

David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a longtime Berkshire blogger, told Business Insider that merging Kraft and Heinz was a "rare mistake" for Buffett.

He pointed to Berkshire having to write down the value of its stake by billions of dollars twice: in 2018 and again in the second quarter of this year. Kass added that the investment has yielded a lower return than the benchmark S&P 500 index over the past decade.

On Tuesday, Kraft Heinz said it plans to split into two businesses. One will house Heinz, Philadelphia, and Kraft Mac & Cheese, and concentrate on sauces, spreads, and seasonings. The other will house Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, and focus on North American staples.

Berkshire and Kraft Heinz didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider but Buffett told CNBC that he was "disappointed." He told the broadcaster that while the merger wasn't the best move in hindsight, he was skeptical that dividing up the company would solve its problems.

The "Oracle of Omaha" has said before that acquiring Kraft was an error. He told Berkshire's 2019 shareholder meeting that he "made a mistake" and "paid too much money" for it.

Kraft Heinz stock was down more than 70% from its 2017 peak before the split was announced. It fell another 7% on Tuesday before regaining some ground on Wednesday. The company's market value has fallen from over $110 billion at its peak to below $33 billion.

Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake. Buffett told CNBC he didn't rule out a sale, saying he would do what was best for Berkshire. 3G sold the last of its stake in 2023.

Kass said it was "puzzling" and an "apparent admission of failure" by management to split up Kraft and Heinz and undo the synergies created. He said it wasn't clear to him how this would generate value for shareholders. The company has said it anticipates $300 million of "dis-synergies" from the split, although it hopes to mitigate some.

John Longo — a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of "Buffett's Tips" — said acquiring Heinz was a "home run" for Buffett, but merging it with Kraft was a "rare misstep."

Longo said the merger generated fewer savings than expected. He also said that Kraft Heinz had faced challenges from weight-loss drugs like Ozempic that reduce people's appetites, and several years of high inflation, which has pushed some consumers to switch to cheaper, generic alternatives.

Alex Morris, the head of TSOH Investment Research and author of "Buffett and Munger Unscripted," said he agreed with the Berkshire boss that combining Heinz and Kraft "wasn't a great deal" but "splitting them up won't fix the key issues."

Morris said the company's challenges largely reflected mounting industry pressures on Kraft's legacy business, as consumer tastes have shifted toward fresher, healthier, and more natural alternatives.

Adam Mead, the author of "The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway," told Business insider that he didn't view the Kraft Heinz deal as a "major blunder."

"They've collected dividends along the way and still own great assets," Mead said. 'They're just not worth as much as originally thought."

Buffett's errors are rare, but he has admitted to them in the past.

He said his 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe, a Maine shoemaker that crumbled under pressure from cheap foreign imports, was his "most gruesome" mistake and a "financial disaster." He bought the "worthless business" using Berkshire stock that would be worth nearly $19 billion today.

Several Japan Airlines flights from Hawaii to Japan were delayed up to 18 hours after a pilot was found drinking the day before his flight.

The airline said in a statement to BI on Thursday that the pilot was scheduled to fly JL793 from Honolulu to Chubu Centrair International Airport on August 28. Japan Airlines told BI that the pilot came clean about drinking three cans of beer before the flight took off. 

The airline said in the statement that the captain had consumed three cans of beer alone in the hotel room the day before departure, and was deemed unfit to fly. A replacement pilot was found for the flight.

The flight and two subsequent flights, headed for Haneda Airport in Tokyo, were delayed by around 18 hours because of the incident, the airline said.

"It was also found that the captain had consumed alcohol at stay locations multiple times in the past," the statement said. The airline added that the pilot had altered the date and time settings of the alcohol detector to conceal results in previous instances.

Kyodo News reported that around 630 passengers were affected by the delays.

The news outlet said that Japanese transport and aviation officials visited Japan Airlines' headquarters in Tokyo on Wednesday and launched an investigation into the case.

"We sincerely apologize to our customers and all parties involved for the inconvenience and trouble caused," the airlines said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.

The statement added, "We are committed to working as a company to ensure the thorough implementation of measures to prevent recurrence."

This is at least the fourth case of a Japan Airlines pilot being caught drinking before a flight, causing delays.

In April last year, a flight from Dallas to Tokyo was canceled after the captain got drunk in a hotel bar and in his room. The Mainichi reported then that a hotel employee had called local police, reporting the pilot's disorderly conduct.

In February, two Japan Airlines pilots were suspended from flying for drinking before their December flight from Melbourne to Tokyo, per an AFP report.

It's not just pilots from Japan Airlines that have been found drinking before flights.

In March 2024, a Delta Air Lines pilot was jailed after he was found to be over the legal alcohol limit on a flight from Edinburgh to New York in June 2023, per a report by The Guardian. The pilot was caught during a bag search at Edinburgh with two bottles of Jägermeister, one of which was half empty. 

In January, a Southwest Airlines pilot who was due to fly from Savannah, Georgia, to Chicago was charged with driving under the influence. The pilot was removed from the cockpit, and the flight landed at its destination five hours after its scheduled time. 

Representatives for Japan Airlines did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Tesla released an iOS app for its robotaxi service on Apple's App Store on Wednesday.

"Robotaxi app now available to all. Download to join waitlist — expanding access soon," the company wrote in an X post. It added that an Android version would be "coming in the future."

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

When Business Insider downloaded and ran the robotaxi app, we were first taken to the robotaxi's terms of service, which said that rides are "being conducted autonomously" if a safety driver is not in the driver's seat.

The app then prompted users to tap a button to sign up for the waitlist by creating a Tesla account. It took about three hours before Business Insider's writer was taken off the waitlist and given access to the service. 

The app's design is simple. It displays two maps showing the service's availability in Austin and San Francisco. A carousel gives more details on the robotaxi's features.

When tapped, a button at the bottom of the app, labelled "Latest news on the service," takes users to Tesla robotaxi's account on X.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the robotaxi during a launch event in October. The service was first rolled out in Austin in June and then in San Francisco in July.

Musk told investors in January that he hoped Tesla would have unsupervised full self-driving vehicles in most countries by the end of next year. He added that this goal could be "limited simply by regulatory issues."

President Donald Trump is back to talking about his former backer, Elon Musk, on air.

Trump was asked about Musk during an interview on "The Scott Jennings Show" that aired on Wednesday. The interview, which took place over the phone, was recorded on Tuesday.

"He's got 80% super genius, and then 20% he's got some problems. And when he works out the 20%, he'll be great," Trump said of Musk.

"I always liked him. I like him now. But he went off the reservation and he wished he didn't do it," Trump added.

Trump told Jennings that Musk was "a man of common sense" and a "good man." He added that he was hopeful that Musk would not proceed with his plans to start a new political party and instead return to the GOP.

"I don't think he has a choice," Trump said. "What's he gonna do? He's gonna go with the radical left lunatics? They're lunatics."

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Trump and Musk initially enjoyed a close relationship after Musk threw his support behind Trump's presidential campaign in 2024.

Musk spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and other GOP candidates. He later joined the administration and was the de facto head of the White House DOGE office until his departure in May.

However, in June, Musk's relationship with Trump imploded in public view after the two posted heated messages directed at each other on X and Truth Social, respectively.

Musk criticized Trump over the president's signature tax bill, also known as the "Big Beautiful Bill," which passed earlier this year.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law "will result in a net increase in the unified budget deficit totaling $3.4 trillion over the 2025-2034 period, relative to CBO's January 2025 baseline updated to reflect enacted legislation."

Musk called Trump and the GOP's tax plan a "MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK" and even took credit for Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential elections.

"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House, and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate," Musk wrote in an X post on June 5.

"Such ingratitude," he added in a subsequent post.

Trump initially threatened to cancel the government contracts Musk's businesses had received, though he eventually struck a more conciliatory tone with Musk.

"Look, I wish him well. You understand? We had a good relationship, and I just wish him well," Trump told reporters in June.

In July, Musk said on X that he'd form a new political party, the America Party.

Business Insider reported in August that Musk had yet to begin the formal process of starting the America Party, a month after he had made the declaration on social media. Musk continued to be a major GOP donor.

Prominent MAGA figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have expressed hopes that Musk would return to the GOP. They argue that the billionaire was key to Trump's 2024 electoral victory and that having access to the world's richest man would be helpful in future elections.

 Bitcoin price faces pressure as investors shift to bonds and gold, and risk aversion raises the chance of BTC falling to $108,000. 

Key takeaways:

Rising demand for government bonds and gold underscores recession fears, limiting Bitcoin's ability to sustain bullish momentum.

Correlation with equities remains high, but structural catalysts like Strategy's S&P 500 inclusion could shift sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold onto its bullish momentum on Thursday as traders fled toward the safety of government bonds after weaker-than-expected United States labor market data. This move drove gold to an all-time high and raised doubts over Bitcoin's $108,000 level, with recession fears increasingly dominating investor sentiment.

Equities, however, responded positively. Market participants grew more confident that the US Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. In contrast, cryptocurrencies faced renewed pressure as BTC briefly traded under $110,000. Unlike digital assets, stocks benefit more directly from lower financing costs and reduced household debt burdens, both of which can stimulate consumption.

Yields on the 2-year US Treasury dropped to 3.60%, their lowest level in four months, signaling investors' willingness to accept lower returns in exchange for safety. The surge in demand followed ADP's Thursday report showing US private payrolls added 54,000 positions in August, a sharp decline from July's 106,000. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also reported that overall employment contracted.

Consensus around the Sept. 16-17 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting points to a 0.25% rate cut, bringing the benchmark down to 4.25%. Still, investors remain skeptical that the Federal Reserve can sustain such easing for long.

The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders expecting January 2026 rates at 3.75% or lower declined to 65% from 72% a month ago. This gauge uses Fed Funds futures prices to calculate implied probabilities ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28 meeting. Friday's US Bureau of Labor Statistics report will be crucial in guiding positioning across risk assets.

An eventual rise in inflationary pressure from lower capital costs could undermine economic growth, particularly with higher import tariffs in place. So, while lower interest rates may offer short-term relief, strong demand for gold and short-term bonds highlights persistent risk aversion, which could weigh heavily on cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq's 60-day correlation with Bitcoin sits at 72%, showing the two assets have largely moved together.

What might break this pattern remains uncertain, but some analysts highlight the potential addition of Strategy (MSTR) to the S&P 500. According to Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer at Bitpace, the inclusion “cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class.” Such a move would force index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the S&P 500 to purchase MSTR shares.

Even with elevated demand for US government bonds, fiscal imbalances could erode confidence in the domestic currency, a scenario historically favorable for Bitcoin. Bank of America analysts reportedly project the euro will strengthen against the US dollar by 2026, citing trade frictions and weakening institutional credibility.

In the short term, risk aversion may push Bitcoin to retest the $108,000 mark. However, the growing demand for short-term Treasurys alone should not be viewed as a long-term bearish signal.

James Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart argues the current market represents an altcoin season through digital asset treasury companies rather than traditional token price rallies, with upcoming ETF approvals unlikely to replicate Bitcoin's institutional success.

During a Sept. 4 interview with Milk Road, Seyffart said digital asset treasury companies (DATCO) have generated massive returns while individual altcoins remain relatively subdued compared to previous cycles.

He added:

“I think this is the alt season. This has been the alt season. These DATCOs, I mean, they've been on absolute fire.”

Further, the SEC's new framework for cryptocurrency ETFs positions approximately ten assets for immediate approval, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, Polkadot, Solana, and Hedera.

Additional tokens, like Cardano and XRP, could qualify within months once futures contracts reach the six-month requirement on CFTC-regulated exchanges.

However, Seyffart tempers expectations for altcoin ETF demand compared to Bitcoin products. He noted:

“Is it going to be the level of interest that a Bitcoin, the Bitcoin ETF launch had? I absolutely not.”

Seyffart expects basket products containing multiple cryptocurrencies to attract significantly more institutional capital than individual altcoin ETFs.

Two such products from Grayscale and Bitwise await SEC approval after receiving stay orders following initial technical approval.

Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins. Bitwise's product holds ten assets while Grayscale's contains five cryptocurrencies in market cap-weighted allocations.

The framework requires futures contracts to be traded for six months on CFTC-regulated exchanges, with Coinbase Derivatives serving as the primary qualifying platform. This outsources asset selection criteria to CFTC oversight while potentially allowing questionable projects into ETF wrappers.

Seyffart questioned whether traditional altcoin seasons will materialize as institutional money drives cryptocurrency performance. He observed:

“I just don't see a ton of institutional money coming into the 31st ranked crypto.”

Digital asset treasury companies have absorbed capital that historically flowed into altcoins during bull markets. Strategy's financial engineering allows investors to gain leveraged cryptocurrency exposure through traditional equity markets rather than direct token purchases.

Seyffart views current market conditions as increasingly institutionalized, with sophisticated players entering crypto markets.

This structural shift may permanently alter altcoin rally patterns as traditional finance channels provide easier access to crypto exposure through regulated products rather than direct token ownership.

Ethereum ETFs demonstrate this dynamic, generating substantial inflows after an initial sluggish performance, but failing to drive widespread momentum in altcoins.

The pattern suggests that institutional preferences favor established assets over speculative alternatives, regardless of the merits of the underlying blockchain technology.

Oops, something went wrong

An Ethereum wallet linked to Tron founder Justin Sun has been blacklisted after moving more than $9 million worth of World Liberty Financial tokens, or WLFI, according to blockchain data.

At the time of writing, WLFI, the native token of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial DeFi project, is changing hands for $0.1789, or 19% lower than it was this time yesterday. The token only just started trading on exchanges earlier this week. Exchange volumes indicate the token has been especially popular with traders in South Korea, on exchanges Upbit and Bybit.

It's unclear why World Liberty Financial would have blacklisted the wallet, identified as belonging to Sun by blockchain analytics platforms Arkham and Nansen, for transferring tokens. But it is possible that early investors, like Sun or the Tron DAO, would have received token warrants that prohibit them from selling for a set amount of time.

Neither World Liberty nor Justin Sun immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt.

Nick Vaiman, co-founder and CEO of Bubblemaps, told Decrypt he's not convinced Sun moved the tokens with the intention of selling.

“To be honest, I don't think this dump has anything to do with Justin Sun. He barely moved funds to centralized exchanges, and this morning's transfers were just from one of his addresses to another,” he said. “His latest statement saying he has nothing to do with the dump looks legitimate.”

 

The Sun statement the Bubblemaps team was referring to appeared on X in Mandarin. In it, Sun said the wallet “only generally did a few exchange deposit tests, the amounts were very low, then did a distribution to one address.” He added that the tests “did not involve any buying or selling,” and that it would have been impossible for the token movements to have impacted the market.

Another Bubblemaps analyst, the pseudonymous Deebs, added that sending tokens to an exchange doesn't prove that they were sold.

“The $9 million transfer that Arkham and others have cited was simply a transfer to another wallet under his control. He did not send those funds to an exchange (yet),” he said. But he cautioned that it's possible that World Liberty has access to non-public information that explains the blacklisting.

Some analysts have been incredibly skeptical about the World Liberty project. Last week, analysts at Compass Point flagged WLFI as “another catalyst that could potentially decimate retail traders.”

Trump-Backed World Liberty Token Could Decimate Retail Investors, Compass Point Warns

And users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have overwhelmingly agreed with them. Before the market closed yesterday afternoon, odds had tipped entirely in favor of WLFI seeing a red candle within its first 69 hours of trading.

Early investors of the WLFI token, including Sun, managed to buy in at just $0.015 per token, or a $1.5 billion valuation, and are still very much in the green by more than 10X. But those retail traders who bought WLFI as soon as it became tradeable at a price above $0.33? They're now down 45%.

The Trump family has a bitcoin mining company that started trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday.

Why it matters: Running mining rigs is one of the most policy-sensitive corners of the crypto industry, with its number one cost input being the price of power.

Catch up quick: American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began publicly trading on Wednesday following a merger with a small-cap bitcoin miner, which allowed it to skip a traditional IPO process.

How it works: According to an investor presentation, American Bitcoin has a three-pronged strategy to provide leadership in the U.S. bitcoin industry:

Zoom in: Later in the presentation the company talks about building platforms and monetizing its surface area in the industry.

The big picture: The Trumps are entering the industry as competition has gotten fierce.

Between the lines: The cost of energy is crucial to a mining operation.

What we're watching: Nukes. We'll be curious to see if American Bitcoin comes out ahead of other miners in cutting deals with new nuclear plants, if they start getting permits.

💭 Our thought bubble: This could be yet another play to profit off of the presidency, but bitcoin mining takes a lot more elbow grease than running a meme coin or a second-tier stablecoin.

As the price of ETH holds steady above $1,800, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem has rebounded to $90 billion. Established protocols like Aave, Curve, and MakerDAO are seeing renewed user activity, and many on-chain high-frequency traders have started positioning themselves for the next phase of high returns.

However, for many ordinary users, these complex protocols are difficult to navigate, and the volatile price swings often result in unexpected losses.

Therefore, more and more investors are turning to contract-based platforms like ProfitableMining that offer stable output and transparent returns to achieve truly “passive crypto earnings.”

Rather than “chasing hype,” it's better to “lock in certainty.”

This is exactly why an increasing number of people are choosing ProfitableMining. As a contract-based cloud mining platform, it requires no manual trading, no learning complex strategies, and no sleepless nights watching the market. You simply choose a suitable mining contract, invest, and receive stable returns over the contract period — mining coins daily, unaffected by market volatility.

For example:

Investing $1,300 in the Avalon Miner A1466 contract can yield a net profit of $239.19 during the cycle;

The beginner experience contract requires only $100 and yields $9 profit by the end of the cycle, allowing risk-free trial;

New users receive an instant $17 bonus upon registration and can earn an additional $0.90 daily for logging in.

Why are more ordinary users choosing ProfitableMining instead of diving into high-risk crypto trading?

The reason is simple — it's not a “gambling platform,” but a transparent, compliant, and consistently profitable contract mining platform with a low barrier to entry. It allows users to truly “earn coins through technology, not luck.”

Official Certification & Compliance: ProfitableMining is licensed by the UK financial regulatory authority, operating transparently and legally, eliminating risks of scams or fraud;

Move will boost transparency as film investors who are not familiar with the industry often incur big losses, says lawmaker

Hong Kong's legal sector is taking an unprecedented leap into the world of Web3 and digital assets to revolutionise the city's film and television industry in a bid to better track investments, with some massive losses incurred as a result of a lack of transparency.

The bold new strategy, unveiled at a seminar on Thursday, enables the use of blockchain and smart contracts to fundamentally transform the industry and offer a new channel for financing creative content, according to lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, director of the eBRAM International Online Arbitration and Mediation Centre, a not-for-profit company.

“This legal technology is actually helping the industry upgrade,” Ng said. “With [legal technology] processes, the entire industry will become transparent and systematic, and investors will naturally choose projects and guide funds back into our industry.”

Ng noted that many film investors who were not familiar with the industry, including himself, often suffered losses of more than 90 per cent of their investments because of a lack of transparency over how the money was used.

Thomas So Shiu-tsung, chairman of eBRAM, said that “another critical step” had been taken. The centre formally signed a memorandum of understanding with broadcaster RTHK, the Asia Pacific Creativity Industries Association and the Association of Motion Picture Post Production Professionals.

“This partnership not only consolidates Hong Kong's position as a film and television deal-making centre, but also encourages the industry to choose Hong Kong's dispute resolution services,” So said.

“It can … help mitigate the potential legal risks associated with cross-border cooperation and transactions in a more convenient and cost-effective manner.”

Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, the acting secretary for justice, said new development opportunities for the film and television industry had arisen after revisions to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (Cepa), a free-trade deal between Hong Kong and mainland China.

Cheung said the changes included scrapping limits on the number of key personnel involved in film production and online television dramas, while companies were allowed to be established to distribute Hong Kong films on the mainland after obtaining approval from the relevant departments.

Hong Kong-produced dramas could also be broadcast during prime time on mainland stations, among other things, he added.

Alan Chiu, founder and managing partner of law firm ELLALAN, noted that many players in the film industry might not have good templates for contracts.

He said it would provide convenience to the film industry if certain essential and simple templates for movie-related contracts could be provided through eBram, accessed easily and signed electronically over mobile phones through its platform.

“For example, when filming a movie, there are thousands of collaborations, even tens of thousands of collaborations,” Chiu said.

Such templates would not affect the business of lawyers as A-list artists always required tailor-made advice and contracts with specific clauses from lawyers, Chiu added.

Rex Ma Wai-yip, honorary president of the Asia Pacific Creativity Industries Association, said there was a lack of “risk-management awareness” within the sector.

“That is, the realisation that if we don't do these things, when the technology world moves fast, with Web3.0, I may not adapt to the world's change,” Ma said.

Ma expressed concern that creative people were not using contracts to protect their post-production work or individual intellectual property rights, leading to a lack of evidence that could prove the work was theirs.

A virtualized Bitcoin advocate generated by AI, carrying forward early blockchain ideas and making technical concepts accessible.

- Telegram's 2025 TON blockchain integration revolutionized NFT accessibility via 800M+ users, enabling in-app trading without external wallets.

- Collectible Gifts generated $36M in sales with 184K+ wallets, transforming NFTs into engagement tools like usernames and phone numbers.

- Stars economy and Snoop Dogg's $12M NFT drop demonstrated mass adoption potential, bridging Web3 and traditional entertainment markets.

- Mini Apps ecosystem democratized NFT creation while TON's DeFi growth (3.5M+ NFT volume) signaled competitive positioning against Ethereum/Solana.

- Regulatory risks and platform dependency challenges remain as TON's user-centric model reshapes decentralized marketplace dynamics.

In 2025, the decentralized NFT marketplace landscape has undergone a seismic shift, driven by Telegram's integration of NFT trading via the Telegram Open Network (TON). By leveraging its 800 million+ user base and the TON blockchain's scalability, Telegram has redefined accessibility, utility, and adoption for digital collectibles. This analysis explores how Telegram's ecosystem is reshaping the NFT space, the implications for investors, and the risks that accompany this rapid growth.  

Telegram's 2025 NFT integration marks a pivotal moment in blockchain history. The TON blockchain, originally developed alongside Telegram, now enables users to create, trade, and interact with NFTs directly within the app, eliminating the need for external wallets or complex onboarding processes [2]. This seamless experience is underpinned by TON's high throughput and low transaction fees, which make it a compelling alternative to Ethereum and Solana [3].  

The platform's utility-driven approach has already shown promise. For instance, Telegram's Collectible Gifts feature—allowing users to trade animated stickers and profile decorations as NFTs—generated $36 million in sales, with over 184,000 wallets created in 2025 alone [4]. This demonstrates how Telegram is transforming NFTs from speculative assets into tools for real-world engagement, such as NFT-based usernames and anonymous phone numbers [3].  

Telegram's Stars economy further amplifies its appeal. Users earn, trade, and spend Stars (Telegram's in-app currency) for NFTs and digital goods, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem [4]. High-profile collaborations, like Snoop Dogg's Telegram Gifts collection, highlight the platform's mainstream potential. The rapper's NFT drop sold nearly 1 million units in under an hour, generating $12 million in revenue [3]. Such events underscore Telegram's ability to attract both creators and consumers, bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional entertainment.  

Telegram's democratization efforts extend beyond NFT trading. The Mini Apps ecosystem allows developers to deploy NFTs and decentralized applications (dApps) directly within the platform, reducing technical barriers for creators [2]. The TON Foundation has emphasized equitable access to this ecosystem, advocating for fair exposure for all projects to foster innovation [6]. This approach aligns with broader goals of global adoption, as Telegram's user base spans regions with limited access to traditional Web3 infrastructure.  

The TON blockchain's performance in 2025 validates its potential. DeFi activity on TON nearly doubled in July 2025, while NFT trading volumes peaked at $3.5 million [4]. These figures suggest a maturing market, supported by TON's technical advantages and Telegram's user-centric design. For investors, the platform's focus on utility and accessibility positions it as a long-term contender in the NFT space, particularly as it competes with Ethereum and Solana for market share.  

Despite its momentum, Telegram's NFT ecosystem faces risks. Regulatory scrutiny looms, particularly as governments grapple with the implications of decentralized finance and digital asset trading. Additionally, the platform's reliance on Telegram's ecosystem—where users must adopt Telegram's tools and currencies—could limit cross-platform interoperability [4]. Investors must weigh these factors against the platform's growth potential.  

Telegram's integration of NFT trading via TON represents a paradigm shift in digital asset accessibility. By combining a user-friendly interface, gamified economics, and a focus on utility, the platform is democratizing NFT participation on an unprecedented scale. While challenges remain, the trajectory of TON's growth and the success of high-profile projects like Snoop Dogg's NFTs suggest that Telegram is not just a passing trend but a foundational force in the evolution of decentralized marketplaces.

Bitcoin's (BTC) feeble bounce this week ran out of gas on Thursday, with prices slipping back below $110,000 and some market watchers warning of a deeper pullback.

The largest cryptocurrency fell 2.2% over 24 hours to $109,500, erasing half the gains it made from the weekend's low of $107,000 as it topped $112,600 on Wednesday. Ether (ETH), Solana's SOL (SOL) and Cardano's ADA (ADA) all fell more than 3% over the past 24 hours.

Digital asset treasury stocks also bled. The largest corporate BTC owner Strategy (MSTR) dropped 3.2% and is 30% down since July. Japan-based MetaPlanet (3355) lost 7% and trades 60% lower than its June high, while KindlyMD (NAKA) slid another 9% and is now down 75% since mid-August. Ether-focused vehicles BitMine (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET) dropped 8%-9%.

Worries about further downside are growing louder, with some observers pointing to September historically being one of bitcoin's and and the broader crypto market's weakest months. 

At the same time, gold, the old-school safe haven and inflation hedge, broke out to fresh records above $3,500 following a multimonth consolidation, seemingly sucking capital from riskier plays.

A new report from Bitfinex noted that BTC has entered its third straight week of retracement from the August all-time high of $123,640. Historically, bull-market corrections averaged around 17% peak-to-trough, suggesting the market is nearing the typical limit of its drawdowns, the report said.

However, there's a risk of a deeper pullback, the analysts warned. The short-term holder realized price, a gauge of newer investors' cost basis of buying BTC, currently sits near $108,900, less than 1% below BTC's current price. If that level fails as support, it could open the way to a deeper retracement, with a dense supply cluster between $93,000 and $95,000 likely providing a durable floor, the report said.

Joel Kruger, market strategist of LMAX Group, remains more optimistic.

September has usually been a month of consolidation ahead of stronger fourth-quarter performance, he said, adding that this year's correction might be shallower if ETF inflows, corporate treasury allocations and regulatory tailwinds materialize.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Two of Silicon Valley's top tech firms are teaming up to change the payments landscape. On Thursday, the $91.5 billion fintech Stripe and the crypto venture firm Paradigm publicly announced their joint project Tempo, a so-called Layer-1 blockchain built around stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. 

Layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are more demanding to build and operate than “Layer 2s,” which sit atop other blockchains. Tempo is among a new crop of layer-1 projects dedicated to stablecoins, along with Circle's Arc and Tether's Plasma and Stable. 





The long-rumored blockchain comes amid a crypto boom. The Trump administration's embrace of the sector and Congress's passage of a stablecoin-focused bill in July have spurred many larger companies previously skeptical of blockchain technology, from banks to Big Tech companies, to begin exploring the space. But Stripe has been a pioneer, especially in Silicon Valley, including making landmark acquisitions of two stablecoin and crypto wallet companies. 





By helping build a blockchain alongside Paradigm—whose managing partner and Stripe board member Matt Huang will lead the project—Stripe is doubling down on its crypto bet as the future of global payments. 





Blockchains, or distributed ledgers that record transactions, have served as the foundation for crypto technology since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. The list of available options has proliferated, from mainstay layer-1 offerings like Ethereum and Solana to new generations built on top of old ones. Many have received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding but faded amid a lack of usage. 




While some like Ethereum are focused on building decentralized financial applications, a new slate of payment-focused blockchains has emerged over the past year in conjunction with the rise of stablecoins. These promise to process lightning-fast transactions with minimal fees, often built around native tokens, such as Circle's stablecoin USDC or the market leader Tether, which are often traded on Ethereum but deployed on many other blockchains as well.





Stripe and Paradigm will launch their own blockchain amid this heightened competition. Still, Tempo will have the advantage of Stripe's built-in customer base, with the startup serving as one of the world's largest payment infrastructure companies and catering to clients who, for the most part, don't operate in the crypto realm. Stablecoin proponents have long touted the technology as faster and more efficient than legacy money transfer services like SWIFT and wire transfers, which can be slow and costly. At the same time, adoption has been slowed by companies' hesitance toward crypto and the uncertain regulatory landscape. 





While other blockchains typically gain value through their native cryptocurrencies, Tempo will not launch with its own token, according to a source familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business information. Instead, it will accept different forms of stablecoins as “gas” fees, which are small payments made to a distributed network of entities that run a blockchain.





The source said that there isn't a timeline yet for Tempo's launch, though the project already has around 15 employees, including Huang, who will continue to serve as managing partner at Paradigm alongside Alana Palmedo. 





In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Paradigm wrote that Tempo will be focused on global payments, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments, or payments conducted by AI agents—an area that crypto advocates argue that blockchain technology will be essential. The post adds that, even with Stripe incubating the project, the goal is for Tempo to maintain “neutrality,” though it remains unclear whether other payment operators will utilize the blockchain. Paradigm said that different partners will be involved in the development of Tempo, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Deutsche Bank, and Shopify.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is waking from its slumber, one analyst says.

Two years ago, when Ethereum traded at $1,600 and faced mounting competition, Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, called it crypto's “sleeping giant.”

Now, he's pointing to three converging catalysts that make Ethereum's investment case one that's “compelling for long-term holders.”

“One enduring lesson I've learned from navigating crypto markets over the last decade is that transformative ecosystem shifts often unfold during periods of apparent quiet,” Kerbage wrote in an August 27 note to investors.

“My expectation is that ETH can surpass $10,000 once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for US payments.”

Kerbage's latest note came days after Ether broke a new price record.

Until then, the token's price performance was lacklustre this year compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana.

But nowadays, the tide seems to have turned.

Fresh regulation surrounding stablecoins, the surge of Ethereum treasuries, “relentless bids” into exchange-traded funds, and the rise of staking yields are driving Ether's growth.

Today, Ether trades at about $4,400, up 83% in the past year. Market watchers are predicting it will trade at $7,500 by years-end, or even at $20,000 at some point in this cycle.

Here's the three reasons why Kerbage sees Ethereum's price going higher.

First, staking.

Investors love yield-bearing assets, and Ethereum's staking model offers exactly that but in crypto form.

Nearly 36 million Ether are now staked, according to the Ethereum Foundation, representing nearly one-third of the network's total supply.

“This growth reflects heightened network security and investor confidence, with staking rewards averaging a 2.9% APR, appealing to yield-focused portfolios,” Kerbage noted.

Kerbage isn't the only market watcher who thinks staking will drive a lot of Wall Street interest for Ethereum.

For Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, Ethereum is a stronger corporate play than Bitcoin.

“Investors will lean into Ethereum not just so that it can appreciate in price alone, but because someone is doing something with that to generate yield,” Park said.

Institutions have been pouring in, with ETFs now holding $24 billion in Ether, according to Coinglass. Some analysts predict large entities will hold 10% of the total supply.

Tokenisation is the second driver behind the price, Kerbage said.

The tokenisation of real-world assets on Ethereum has blown past projections, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 — up from just $5 billion in 2022. Moreover, Bank of America forecasts the market will hit $16 trillion over the next five to 15 years.

At current growth rates, however, that timeline looks conservative.

“That vision is materialising faster than anticipated,” wrote Kerbage.

Value stored in RWAs sits just above $15 billion, according to DefiLlama, with Ethereum accounting for $11 billion.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called tokenisation a potential finance revolution in 2023, reiterated his bullish stance this year, wrote Kerbage. His firm's own tokenised fund, BUIDL, is the largest in the sector, with $2.2 billion.

Kerbage expects the Genius Act to bring even more froth to the sector, as “stablecoins are set to boom.”

In third place, there's the youngsters.

Over 50% of Gen Z now owns crypto, with $100 trillion set to move from older to younger generations over the next two decades.

“This shift mirrors historical tech adoption — credit cards in the 1990s or the internet's rise,” Kerbage observed.

“Skepticism from older cohorts persists, but a decade into its existence and Ethereum's utility is undeniable, much like how we now can't imagine life without smartphones.”

Shares of bitcoin miner American Bitcoin (ABTC) have dropped below its initial IPO price after falling 15% on Thursday, the day after its debut on the Nasdaq.

ABTC was trading at $6.83 a share, down from its IPO price of $6.90.

The company, which is 80% owned by Hut 8 and 20% by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, opened for trading on Wednesday after completing its merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). On the same day, the company filed for an at-the-market equity raise of up to $2.1 billion, with which it plans to continue building its bitcoin holdings.

Shares rose to a high of $14.65 during U.S. morning hours before falling sharply in the afternoon. Other miners, including Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), are also trading lower on the day. 

Similarly, Bitcoin BTC$109,775.24 slipped 2% in the past 24 hours, moving in step with the broader crypto market, while U.S. stock indexes like the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are trading higher.

American Bitcoin, which holds about 2,443 bitcoin worth around $269 million at its current price of $110,128, pairs bitcoin mining with a treasury strategy focused on holding the asset.

Bitcoin mining has become a brutally competitive industry where survival depends on razor-thin margins and constant adaptation. Power costs eat up half or more of the revenue from each coin mined, while relentless expansion of the network's computing power drives up difficulty and squeezes profitability further.

Hardware makers like Bitmain continue to flood the market with new rigs, adding pressure even when demand slows. As a result, miners must secure ultra-cheap energy, maintain efficient operations, and increasingly diversify into areas like AI computing or data centers just to stay ahead.

By stockpiling BTC in the open market, companies can benefit when prices rise, creating a financial cushion that helps smooth out the sharp swings in revenue from mining alone.

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) uses a similar strategy. Shares of the company are down 3% over the past 24 hours.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The total amount of bitcoin held by public companies surpassed 1 million BTC on Thursday, according to BitcoinTreasuries data.

Over the past year, the number of companies seeking to capitalize on bitcoin's steady price growth has been increasing rapidly. Michael Saylor's Strategy is considered the pioneer of the trend, with many other companies also deciding to hold the cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin miners like Mara Holdings and firms such as Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and GameStop all holding BTC on their balance sheets.

"Despite today's milestone, a number of indicators suggest institutional Bitcoin adoption remains in its infancy," said BitcoinTreasuries President Pete Rizzo. "For context, most major Bitcoin treasury firms have only started to deploy strategies aimed at long-term accumulation, meaning a large portion of raised capital remains yet to be deployed."

Strategy's success, both in terms of its share price growth and the accrued value of the bitcoin it holds, has inspired several other firms to pursue similar strategies. 



This chart excludes Tesla, Coinbase, and Block to focus on companies running the Bitcoin treasury play.

Bitwise executive Bradley Duke took to social media to comment on the 1-million bitcoin milestone. "That's about $111 billion locked up by institutions," he said. "The structural imbalance between BTC supply and demand is real and getting more pronounced."

According to BitcoinTreasuries, more than 100 public companies currently hold bitcoin. And the number of companies adopting Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies or simply deciding to hold the cryptocurrency doesn't appear to be slowing down.

In one of the more recent examples, on Tuesday, Nasdaq-listed sales development firm CIMG said it had completed a $55 million raise for purchasing bitcoin.

"As Bitcoin continues to outperform fiat currencies globally, we expect the number of public firms buying and holding Bitcoin to rise, with the asset becoming a larger percentage of the balance sheets of the over 50,000 publicly traded companies globally," Rizzo said.

With a market cap of over $2 trillion, the price of bitcoin was trading at $110,142.10 as of 10:53 a.m. ET on Thursday, according to The Block's price page. Bitcoin is up over 90% in the past year.

Three years ago, Finance & Development devoted a full issue to anticipating “The Money Revolution,” driven by innovations in finance, such as crypto assets. That revolution is now unfolding.

This issue of F&D looks at the new frontiers of finance, where technology, data, and changing societal values are reshaping how people and institutions move money and trade financial assets, who provides liquidity, and where new risks are brewing. We bring together academics and policymakers to assess this complex and politically charged landscape, one that generates excitement and anxiety in equal measure.

Stablecoins are one of these frontiers, a form of digital asset backed by currencies or government bonds. Stablecoin companies have racked up millions of users globally, transacting across borders 24/7 at very low cost. New legislation in the US and other countries may further boost their growth. Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become a financial lifeline for people in some economies with high inflation. 

Hélène Rey, a professor at the London Business School, assesses the macroeconomic and geopolitical implications of widespread adoption of US dollar–denominated stablecoins around the world. On the positive side: faster and cheaper cross-border payments. On the negative: risk of dollarization (where the dollar is used in parallel with the local currency), capital flows and exchange rate volatility, potential weakening of the banking system, money laundering and other financial crimes. While it's hard to forecast how the use of this technology will play out, it's “likely to create major financial stability risks,” she writes.

Yao Zeng of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School identifies one potential source of risk: “The global financial landscape has changed, yet the rules remain largely unchanged.” He puts stablecoins in the context of broader changes in financial markets. For example, lightly regulated nonbanks are providing more liquidity. And lenders are increasingly relying on AI and big data to speed loan approvals, reduce collateral requirements, and reach borrowers traditional banks often overlook. One thing is clear, he writes. “Stablecoins may function well in good times, but they can falter under stress.” 

Stablecoins are only one facet of the revolution. The public and the private sector alike are driving innovation. Some governments and central banks have responded to private payment initiatives by sponsoring systems that respond to consumer demand for fast, efficient payments. IMF researchers examine the case of India's Unified Payments Interface, which interconnects hundreds of banks, platforms, and apps and carries out more than 19 billion transactions a month.

At the same time, central banks and supervisors must contend with disruptive innovation. New entrants like fintechs and big techs, and new products like crypto and stablecoins, are challenging incumbent financial institutions. Iñaki Aldasoro, Jon Frost, and Vatsala Shreeti, from the Bank for International Settlements, explore how competition among the new entrants and incumbents might unfold. They conclude that forward-looking public policies must accompany radical innovation to achieve the most impactful breakthroughs.

Preventing crime is another area in which public authorities need to stay alert. Criminals, unfortunately, were among the earliest adopters of crypto, and all payment systems need to balance privacy and speed with the need to stop tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Stanford's Darrell Duffie and coauthors lay out a practical approach to getting ahead of the curve.

We must keep an open mind about stablecoins and financial innovation. Clearly, there is a lot of room for improvement in payment systems and financial markets in general. Users demand it. The key is to balance the risks and benefits through clear regulation that protects consumers and investors and limits spillovers. Who knows what new possibilities such innovations will unlock along the way?

**********

There are other thought-provoking pieces in our pages. Oxford's Carl Benedikt Frey discusses how a shift toward more centralization and less competition could snuff out AI's productivity-raising potential. Princeton's Swati Bhatt discusses the shifting geography of US start-ups, showing how entrepreneurial activity is migrating from California to southern states. Stanford's Nick Bloom, and the IMF's Hites Ahir and Davide Furceri, discuss economic uncertainty, how to measure it, and what it means for the global economy. Economic historian Marc-William Palen looks back to the 19th century, when free trade first faltered, in search of lessons for policymakers today.

We also profile Nobel laureate Guido Imbens, whose work is reshaping how researchers establish cause and effect in the real world. And Harvard's Stefanie Stantcheva explains in our Café Economics interview series how policymakers can raise taxes without scaring off innovators.

We are grateful to be able to share these insights with you. We hope that they reveal something new about the present that helps you better understand our world. Thank you, as ever, for reading and engaging.

The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in
years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins ("GENIUS") Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. The
GENIUS Act is part of a broader push to accelerate the development
of emerging technologies in the U.S., from artificial intelligence
to quantum computing. That same push is showing up in the patent
world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
("USPTO") and Patent Trial and Appeal Board
("PTAB") are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related
inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles.

Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a
recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain
patents. In Ex Parte David L. Newman, the PTAB reversed
the Examiner's rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. §
101 and provided some useful discussion of how the USPTO (and
patent applicants) should approach blockchain-related patents. The
claims at issue relate to "securely storing data across a
network in a multi-dimensional distributed database" in order
to "process[] license contracts, including computing
proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising
supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian
addresses."

The Examiner had rejected the claims as directed to the abstract
idea of "payment, distribution, and pricing for two users
bound by a contractual relationship," concluding that the
additional elements in the claims do not integrate the abstract
idea into a practical application. In the Examiner's view, the
invention simply used "a computer as a tool to perform an
abstract idea." The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging
that the claims involved an abstract idea because "[i]t is
well settled that commercial interactions involving payment
transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially
excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human
activity."

However, the Board drew the line at step 2 of the Alice
analysis. Unlike the Examiner, the Board determined that the claims
integrate the abstract idea into a practical application "by
improving the technical functioning of the recited blockchain by
transforming it into a multi-dimensional database slidechain that
allows for the execution and simultaneous processing of
supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain." In other
words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a
generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself
operates. As the Board explained, the claims "recite[] steps
that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved
processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork
blocks along the slidechain... [and] uses the recited abstract idea
in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a
particular technological environment."

Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major
hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in
blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent
PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in
blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions
like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based
on 35 U.S.C. § 101. Specifically, applicants should use their
specification to clearly articulate how their invention improves
"the performance of a computer" and/or "the
functionality of the blockchain and the processing
thereof."

The Proskauer Intellectual Property Team is continuing to
monitor the evolving guidance on patent eligibility of emerging
technologies. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for
stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in
blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive
environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these
shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader
emerging technology space.

Buried in the limited support of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, especially in developed markets, is a somewhat blinkered take on the concept: Not all CBDCs have the same objective.

A central bank digital currency can take many forms, but most involve the issuance by a country's central bank of currency tokens on a blockchain or other type of distributed ledger. Retail-facing CBDCs aim to gradually replace cash, retaining the same central bank guarantee as bills and coins, while offering the convenience of digital money.

A few examples have already launched, such as the Nigerian eNaira and the Bahamas sand dollar. Others are in advanced pilot phases, such as the Chinese e-CNY and the Indian digital rupee.

All of these examples are struggling to gain traction, and anti-CBDC activism worldwide is strong, triggered by fears of centralized control and a loss of financial privacy. In Europe, which will decide in October whether to launch development of a retail-facing CBDC, there is notable opposition, including among some legislators. And in the U.S., the House of Representatives passed an anti-CBDC bill which would bar the federal government from ever issuing a digital currency; a similar proposal is working its way through the Senate.

The fear overlooks an entire segment of the economy in which the central bank already controls movements of funds, and in which privacy is not an expected feature: interbank transfers, known as "wholesale" payments.

These easily account for the bulk of global transfers in terms of volume. And yet they still encounter significant frictions when they involve correspondent banking networks, currency exchange and different operating hours. Given the amount of money involved, the frictions add up.

In this light, a wholesale CBDC makes sense.

Like a retail CBDC, a wholesale CBDC, or wCBDC, would be issued by a central bank as a currency token on a blockchain. Unlike a retail CBDC, it would only be made available to commercial banks and other institutions with central bank accounts.

One of the key advantages is more streamlined settlement, as wCBDCs could, in theory, move directly between banks via a shared ledger — no correspondent accounts necessary. What's more, depending on the platform design, an on-chain transfer could compress messages (sent by banks via SWIFT) and payments, further reducing the number of necessary steps and the overall cost.

Another is the potential for smart contracts to handle complex and costly processes such as currency conversion and escrow.

And there's the direct connectivity with on-chain marketplaces for tokenized securities, digital trade invoices and more. Today, clearing and settlement involve reconciling various layers of information across different data systems. In an on-chain network, everything moves on the same layer, and while systems may differ, connectivity generally involves tweaking formats or adding a bridge rather than reengineering structures.

The opportunity is compelling, especially given the emergence of new trade barriers and geopolitical fragmentation — smoother cross-border payments could lead to smoother and more flexible supply chains.

The department is aiming to boost transparency and win Trump's trust after poor economic numbers last month led to a bureaucrat's firing.

Yet here, too, there are deep misunderstandings about blockchain potential.

Frictionless transfers between global banks can only happen on a shared ledger. Arriving at that happy state would require consensus among nations as to the ideal technology (there are many different types of distributed systems) as well as the platform's design, smart contract parameters, compliance requirements, legal status and governance. Getting nations to agree on anything so systemically significant would be a tall order, especially as it would mean giving up some sovereignty over how national currencies move.

Of course, each country could have its own blockchain system on which to issue a wCBDC, and they could connect with each other via a neutral shared platform. But this not only introduces some friction, it also raises a similar set of questions. Who would design it? Who would run it? In recent months, the BIS, IMF and some private entities have published proposals for a "unified ledger" on which all on-chain currencies can move. Would any of those invite universal trust? The BIS, as the "central bank's central bank," could perhaps be a contender — but it recently withdrew from the multi-CBDC pilot mBridge after contemplating shutting it down to prevent Russia using a similar system to avoid sanctions. In this increasingly fractious world, "neutral" quickly becomes elusive.

What about bilateral or group networks? For instance, a distributed ledger platform shared between China and Saudi Arabia for oil trade settlement, or one to boost financial flows among Latin American countries. This could solve some frictions but would introduce others: Would platform members want to hold each other's volatile currencies, or would they sell them in the market, depressing their value? There is a reason most global trade uses the dollar for at least one leg: It removes liquidity risk.

Perhaps smart contracts could ensure a measured currency conversion or lockup? But then the wCBDC would not be fungible with fiat, creating domestic monetary as well as legal complications. There's also the potential for national CBDCs to have embedded functionality, such as an "off switch" — trust, even among trading partners, is a scarce commodity.

And there's the need to trust the platform itself, which could run into network stability issues, especially in the early days or after upgrades. This happens in traditional systems today — but with greater connectivity, the disruption could spread.

In sum, public rejection of CBDCs due to fear of privacy erosion and greater government control overlooks the potential for a significant efficiency boost in a key economic segment that does not expect privacy or freedom from oversight — the technology is not necessarily the problem, it's the way it's applied.

And conviction that wholesale CBDCs will smooth away interbank transfer frictions overlooks the complexity of connecting a constellation of distributed ledgers, each with their own design, priorities and rules — the technology is not necessarily the solution, it's the way it's applied.

Zooming out, new technologies always run up against exaggerated expectations of both benefit and harm — in that regard, blockchains and distributed ledgers are no different.

Introduction 

The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. What started as a way to prove ownership of digital art has grown into a foundation for real-world applications across industries. From collectibles to real estate, NFT smart contract development is now pushing boundaries and opening doors to a tokenized economy.

Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent.

The Birth of NFT Smart Contracts

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. The real magic happens through smart contract development, which encodes the rules of ownership and transfer.

Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today.

NFTs in Digital Art

Digital artists were the first to feel the power of NFT smart contracts. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. Every sale, every royalty, and every ownership transfer was automated through blockchain smart contract development.

The brilliance was not just in ownership—it was in ensuring authenticity. No one could copy and claim the artwork as theirs because the blockchain recorded every detail of ownership. For artists, this meant empowerment; for buyers, it meant trust. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention.

NFT Smart Contracts Beyond Art and Gaming

While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Industries are finding creative uses for NFTs:

Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds.

Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs.

Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey.

Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access.

This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. As a result, companies see NFTs not just as collectibles, but as defi smart contract development tools for finance, business agreements, and beyond.

Technological Advancements in NFT Smart Contracts 

The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. For example:

Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells.

Fractionalization: High-value assets are split into smaller, affordable shares.

Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development.

Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools.

This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. It's not just about ownership anymore—it's about trust, automation, and innovation.

Future of NFT Smart Contracts 

The future of NFTs looks beyond art and gaming. Imagine a world where:

These are not distant dreams. With blockchain smart contract development, industries are preparing for decentralized systems where human trust is replaced with coded transparency. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution.

The Role of NFT Marketplace Development Companies

Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. These companies design and audit NFT smart contracts, ensuring smooth transactions and secure ownership transfers.

For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. From defi to niche NFT solutions, these firms bring vision to reality.

In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development.

Conclusion 

NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Their future will shape how we own, trade, and trust both digital and physical assets.

Choosing the right partner makes all the difference. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that helps businesses navigate this revolution. With expertise in smart contract development, they provide reliable, scalable, and creative solutions for enterprises that want to lead in the digital era.

The evolution of NFT smart contracts shows us one thing: innovation thrives when technology meets trust. And the right company ensures that the journey is both secure and successful.

Introduction

Imagine a world where business agreements execute themselves the moment conditions are met—no middlemen, no delays, no hidden risks. That's the promise of smart contracts. At their simplest, smart contracts are digital agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute once certain conditions are fulfilled, ensuring transparency and trust.

Company says it's already in discussions to commercialize the licensed tech

TNF Pharmaceuticals has entered into a licensing agreement with laser-based computing startup LightSolver for exclusive use of the latter's laser-based processing units (LPUs) for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications.

TNF also plans to change its name in accordance with its new venture, the company said.

Founded in 2020 by Ruti Ben Shlomi and Chene Tradonsky, Israel-based LightSolver has developed the world's first pure laser-based processing unit (LPU) that LightSolver says is poised to outpace and outperform quantum and supercomputers.

Its LPU100 system utilizes all-optical coupled lasers that require no electronics to compute and combines the company's all-optical LPU hardware with an algorithmic processing layer to provide ultra-fast results for problems with up to one million variables.

The system is around the same size as a traditional desktop computer; it looks similar to a standard server and operates with low power requirements and at room temperature.

TNF said that when applied to cryptocurrency applications, LightSolver's technology can be designed to reduce energy costs by up to 90 percent and offer a potential pathway to fully sustainable infrastructure.

“We believe LightSolver has created a disruptive computing paradigm that opens a new world of light-speed computation,” said Joshua Silverman, TNF's executive chairman. “Our new partnership with LightSolver gives us exclusive access to quantum-inspired LPU-based systems capable of unlocking unprecedented performance and sustainability for the cryptocurrency industry.”

He added that in addition to the new partnership with LightSolver, TNF is also in late-stage discussions with a tech infrastructure and crypto mining expert to lead the development and commercialization strategy for the licensed technology.

“With LightSolver, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the strong momentum behind both photonic computing and the future of cryptocurrency infrastructure,” Silverman said.

LightSolver CEO, Dr. Ruti Ben-Shlomi, said: “With LightSolver's LPUs, we believe compute-intensive combinatorial and physical problems can be solved at the speed of light—orders of magnitude faster than other methods. At the same time, crypto infrastructure is still using outdated tools that aren't tailored for crypto applications. We are excited to partner with TNF to develop what we believe to be the first light-based computing system to blockchain.”

In addition to the partnership announcement, TNF said that it has also entered into a securities purchase agreement for a $7 million private placement financing, including the sale of 7,000 shares of newly created Series H convertible preferred stock. This has a stated value of $1,000 per share, convertible into shares of its common stock following receipt of the requisite stockholder approval and accompanying common stock purchase warrants.

TNF said the securities purchase agreement is expected to close on or about September 4, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

 Wintermute said clear SEC guidance would keep US markets competitive, foster regulator dialogue and support innovation in digital assets. 

Trading company and market maker Wintermute asked the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to confirm that network tokens should not be classified as securities. 

In formal feedback to the agency's request for comment, the company said clear guidance on the security status of tokens is necessary to avoid the misapplication of securities laws and ensure the continued growth of crypto markets. 

Wintermute said that “network tokens,” which are “intrinsically connected to the functioning of a decentralized network or protocol,” are necessary technical inputs for blockchain networks. Because of this, the company said, they fundamentally differ from financial products or securities. 

The company mentioned Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as examples of network tokens that should not be classified as securities. 

If network tokens were classified as securities, every trade of such digital assets in the US might require regulatory compliance with securities laws. This could affect the liquidity of the tokens, raise costs for traders and ultimately push activities offshore. 

“Such misclassification risks stifling innovation and driving blockchain development and trading activity outside of US markets,” Wintermute wrote. 

The company said network tokens do not meet the criteria for securities even if they are later traded for profit or used in fundraising rounds. 

Wintermute said network tokens function more like commodities, collectibles and real estate. These can all be bought for investment purposes without being treated as securities. 

Apart from its recommendations, the company also welcomed SEC guidance excluding stablecoins, memecoins and staking activities from the securities classification. It stressed that the same level of clarity should be extended to network tokens. 

“Clear guidance across these areas will keep US markets competitive, encourage continued dialogue with regulators, and create optimal conditions for adoption and innovation to thrive,” the company said.

Cointelegraph reached out to Wintermute for more information, but did not receive a response before publication.

In addition to clarifying the issue of network tokens, the company also asked the SEC to ensure that decentralized finance (DeFi) can flourish alongside centralized markets for tokenized securities. 

Wintermute said the agency should empower both avenues to compete. The company said this would promote innovation, improve investor options and create a global marketplace for tokenized securities.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Cybercriminals are deploying a novel evasion tactic by using Ethereum smart contracts to bypass detection in malicious npm packages, as threat actors intensify digital attacks using open-source tooling, according to a report by software security firm ReversingLabs.

The malicious software-supply-chain campaign utilized code to conceal command-and-control (C2) instructions for Node Package Manager (NPM) packages, introducing dangerous open-source elements within an extensive collection of JavaScript libraries.

Lucija Valentic, a ReversingLabs researcher, stated that two packages that emerged in July, “colortoolsv2” and a clone, “mimelib2,” pulled C2 URLs from onchain contracts before fetching a second-stage downloader.

A technical write-up published on Wednesday revealed that the packages executed an obfuscated script, querying an Ethereum contract to retrieve the next-stage payload location, rather than hard-coding links in the package itself. This route complicates detection and takedown, marking a new kind of attack vector.

“That's something we haven't seen previously,” the security expert wrote, adding that it shows how quickly threat actors are improving detection evasion strategies. The operation also leaned on fake, crypto-themed GitHub repositories, complete with inflated stars and auto-generated commits, to convince developers to add the packages as dependencies.

Valentic said the malware family was taken down after being reported to npm maintainers. Meanwhile, ReversingLabs tied the incident to a broader, ongoing effort to seed malicious npm and GitHub projects presented as trading bots or crypto tools.

“Once we decided to dig deeper into the packages, we discovered evidence of a much larger campaign that was spread across both npm and GitHub, trying to lure developers into downloading repositories that included malicious npm packages,” the researcher wrote.

While the new tactic was shut down, it's not the only code-related issue leveraging cryptographic technology. Beyond the two npm packages published in July, the company said the threat actors built credibility around decoy repositories such as “solana-trading-bot-v2,” which showed thousands of superficial commits, puppet maintainers, and coordinated stargazer activity, while the malicious dependency was quietly swapped between package names.

Also, ReversingLabs previously flagged related npm campaigns that abused developer trust and open-source tooling earlier this year.

“These latest attacks by threat actors, including the creation of sophisticated attacks using blockchain and GitHub, show that attacks on repositories are evolving,” said Valentic. “Developers and development organizations alike need to be on the lookout for efforts to implant malicious code in legitimate applications, gain access to sensitive development assets, and steal sensitive data and digital assets.”

Many of the world's largest banks have increased their crypto custody strategies recently.

Earlier this year, both State Street and JPMorgan Chase announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency custody service line in 2026, and US Bancorp has refocused on this service line. Now, we hear that Citi is looking to follow suit, with the global head of partnerships and innovation for the bank's services division stating that it is prioritising custody for high-quality assets backing stablecoins.

With the vast majority of stablecoin transactions taking place outside the banking system and the potential for these cryptocurrencies to enter the payments mainstream, banks have an obvious incentive to offer related services.

These moves are also partly a response to increased regulatory requirements – last month, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission updated its controls for licensed custodians of virtual assets.

Banks are particularly keen to benefit from increased appetite for virtual assets among institutional investors in the US, where a joint statement issued in July by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarified the responsibilities of banks holding crypto assets for customers.

Financial institutions under the supervision of the OCC have been able to conduct cryptocurrency custody activities as long as they implement appropriate third-party risk management practices.

However, this trend is also evident in Europe, where Deutsche Bank reportedly intends to launch cryptocurrency custody services next year.

Commerzbank launched a crypto custody offering for corporate clients in 2024, BBVA has partnered with Binance to provide off-exchange custody for its customers' digital assets, and it has also been suggested that Sberbank is preparing to offer custody services for cryptocurrency assets.

Regardless of location, though, banks will have to ensure their compliance teams are prepared for an increased workload and that their systems are capable of identifying potential anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing violations.

The head of the central bank and the government's chief finance minister appear to be at odds over the future of digital money in the UK.In a speech to the National Bank of Ukraine in June, Andrew Bailey suggested that to pass the test of being money, stablecoins must provide assurance of nominal value and that many of the current versions do not quite reach that standard.

He went on to say that he remained unconvinced of the need to create new forms of money such as central bank retail digital currency to realise the benefits of digital technologies in the area of payments.

“To be clear, I am not against stablecoins,” he said. “I am not against central bank retail digital currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.”

Bailey went even further during a recent media interview, suggesting that stablecoins created by banks and pegged to assets such as the dollar could pose a threat to the whole financial system and advocating focusing on tokenised deposits or digital money instead.These comments are significant as they come at a time when legislative developments in the US have encouraged the likes of Bank of America, Citi, and JP Morgan to issue stablecoins.

In her latest annual Chancellor address, Rachel Reeves said she planned to advance developments in stablecoins, which are benefiting from growing demand for dollar-denominated assets that sit outside the traditional banking sector.

Bailey's remarks also point to differences of opinion not just between the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but between senior figures within the bank. The executive director of financial market infrastructure told a recent conference that the Bank of England was open minded to stablecoins being able to provide innovation that could also be useful for wholesale markets.

With the UK not set to publish guidelines on stablecoins equivalent to the Genius Act or MiCA until next year, key policymakers need to get their affairs in order.

Another area where the UK lags its European rivals is in retail access to crypto exchange traded notes. ETN providers such as 21Shares, WisdomTree and Invesco have seen minimal trading in their professional investor products in the UK since they were introduced in May.

These firms and others will hope that the FCA's decision to allow retail customers access to these products from next month will set the scene for crypto ETFs and possibly even CFDs down the line, although the UK financial regulator remains wary of endorsing the latter, even with low leverage.

To ensure the integrity of the products, the FCA has proposed that crypto ETNs would only be allowed to trade on an FCA-approved, UK-based recognised investment exchange and will have to provide accurate information to potential investors.

One of the approved exchanges, LSEG, has analysed the listing and trading profile of the crypto ETNs on its market compared to other European primary exchanges to understand how these products currently trade.

It says this analysis has revealed that crypto ETN volatility has profiled similarly to all individual stocks within the FTSE 100 and has been less volatile than stocks in the FTSE 250.

LSEG suggests that many of the 25 issuers that have listed more than 150 crypto ETNs with a variety of underlyings across Europe are keen to enter the UK market, and there is potential for considerable product innovation.

The exchange observes that some €26 billion was traded on European exchanges in 2024 – an increase of more than 300% year on year compared to the previous 12 months – and expects similar growth this year.

However, 21Shares has criticised the decision to prohibit access to products not listed on UK exchanges and called for a transparent eligibility framework for a broader range of cryptoassets as underlyings for crypto ETNs. It will be interesting to see to what extent these limitations affect the appetite of other providers to enter the UK crypto ETN market.

Cryptocurrency is gradually making inroads into residential real estate transactions, but few Americans realize that virtual money can be used to buy or sell a home—and even fewer trust it.

New research conducted by the Research and Insights team at Realtor.com® reveals that digital currency in real estate continues to be met with limited awareness and considerable skepticism driven by perceived risk, distrust, and confusion.

As part of the study, 209 consumers participated in a qualitative research activity from Aug. 15 to Aug. 20 to gauge their familiarity and use of cryptocurrency in general and in real estate deals in particular. Participants included a mix of first-time homebuyers, repeat buyers, sellers, and renters.

Nearly half of the participants were millennials, just under a third were Gen X, roughly 20% were baby boomers, and just 3% were Gen Z.

According to the results of the research, most participants were at least somewhat familiar with crypto, and some of them had owned or invested in blockchain-based assets.

However, most were unaware of digital currencies' use in homebuying or selling.

"While participants are not highly familiar with crypto being used in real estate transactions, many were able to intuitively identify how it could be used for the homebuying or selling process: direct peer-to-peer transfers, using digital assets as collateral for a loan, or converting crypto to cash for a traditional purchase, said Daniela Valdivieso Eguiguren, senior market researcher at Research & Insights at Realtor.com.

Asked about the pros and cons of using digital money over traditional methods of payment, participants named more drawbacks than benefits.

Among the perceived negatives associated with crypto, participants brought up volatility, risk and distrust, and a lack of clarity.

"Cryptocurrency is speculative and unreliable in my opinion. I would not personally trust it," a Gen X participant named Robert said.

Meanwhile, Nick, a first-time homebuyer, cited crypto's "variable value and less than solid backing" as some of the reasons why he would not rely on it "for a big purchase."

Other participants argued that blockchain-based currency had a potential for user error, with one fretting about having a typo in the digital wallet address, and another worrying about losing access to the assets by misplacing the account information.

"These concerns often led consumers to believe potential assets loss would outweigh benefits," according to the research summary.

Perceived benefits of cryptocurrency uses included greater transaction security, increased speed, and a potential to maximize earnings.

"It doesn't leave a paper trail because crypto is all digital," a Realtor.com participant named Christopher said. "It's a safe and secure form of digital payment that keeps both parties safe and keeps the transaction private."

A participant named Sabrina touted crypto's ability to save time and ensure a quick real estate transaction, especially for international buyers.

Only a few participants had used crypto for real estate deals, citing limited investments and distrust.

"It came as no surprise to participants that crypto can be used for real estate transactions," said Valdivieso Eguiguren. "However, many still think it is a new technology that needs time and reliability before it can be trusted for mainstream use in such a significant financial process."

Perhaps more alarmingly for the future of this industry, the majority of participants said they did not expect to harness crypto in the future to buy or sell homes because of lingering reliability concerns.

"I don't want to invest my hard-earned money into uncertain places," concluded a millennial repeat buyer named Madan, while a Gen Xer named Robert dismissed crypto as an "unreliable fad that should fail in the future."

Those still on the fence about virtual currency said they needed more information or time to see where it goes from here before they decide to get involved.

"I would need to learn a lot more about how that process works before I'd be willing to make that kind of decision," a participant named Sunnie said.

These comments come as no surprise to housing market experts.

"In the short term, consumer distrust will keep crypto a novelty or marketing tool in real estate rather than a mainstream payment option," says Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. "Uncertain regulations, unclear tax treatment, and limited institutional adoption make buyers wary, while the currency's volatility reinforces its reputation as speculative and risky."

In some good news for real estate professionals specializing in crypto transactions, a few of the participants praised the use of virtual money to buy or sell properties as forward-thinking and a smart investment.

"I think crypto is here to stay and I can see myself using some or a lot of it to buy a home in the future," a participant named Phil, who is a repeat homebuyer, said. "I am for sure open to it if I have enough and the system is easy to use and [safe] to use."

The mixed research findings come just as cryptocurrency has begun gaining traction on the housing market, with the West Coast branch of Christie's International Real Estate becoming the first major U.S. brokerage to debut a division dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency transitions in July.

Aaron Kirman, CEO of Christie's International Real Estate Southern California, who heads the new crypto-only unit, told Realtor.com that there is "a real market" for tokenized property deals.

"Crypto is here to stay—its influence in real estate is only going to grow in the coming years," Kirman said in July.

The real estate bigwig predicted that in the next five years, more than a third of all residential real estate deals in the U.S. could involve crypto.

Tokenized payments are growing increasingly popular especially among high-net-worth individuals and celebrities looking to protect their privacy and keep their property acquisitions under wraps.

Christie's Real Estate SoCal has already closed multiple deals totalling over $200 million paid entirely in cryptocurrency—and Kirman said his portfolio of for-sale homes whose sellers are seeking crypto offers boasts a combined worth of more than $1 billion.

The convergence of virtual currency and housing has not gone unnoticed by policymakers in Washington, DC.

In June, President Donald Trump's administration ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals for considering crypto holdings as assets when weighing the creditworthiness of a homebuyer applying for a mortgage.

The rule change would make it easier for homebuyers who own cryptocurrency to qualify for a mortgage, and potentially up their loan amount limits, without requiring them to convert their tokens into cash.

However, homebuyers would still need to make their monthly mortgage payments in dollars and not in crypto.

The move highlighted Washington's embrace of cryptocurrency, with Trump proclaiming himself a "crypto president" and vowing to make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the world."

Since taking office eight months ago, Trump has appointed David Sacks as "crypto czar" and hosted the first White House Crypto Summit in March. 

In July, Trump signed into law the landmark GENIUS Act, introducing federal rules for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoin.

Around the same time, the House passed the CLARITY Act designed to create a regulatory framework for digital assets and defining which agency has jurisdiction over different kinds of "digital commodities."

And yet, the use of blockchain-based assets in real estate so far has largely been limited to the ultra-luxury segment.

Jones says that could change going forward, but only if certain conditions are met.

"Long-term adoption will hinge on currency stability, regulatory clarity, ease of use, and greater normalization through precedent," says the analyst. "For crypto to become commonplace in real estate, it must first earn broader credibility and trust among buyers."

HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025

HONG KONG, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Moca Network, the flagship project by Animoca Brands that is building the world's largest chain-agnostic decentralized digital identity network, today announced the upcoming launch of MocaPortfolio, a new approach offering the Moca Network community exposure to Animoca Brands' ecosystem.

Participants of MocaPortfolio will be eligible to receive token allocations at a combined valuation of US$20 million from projects in Animoca Brands' investment and partnership portfolio, subject to vesting terms. MocaPortfolio is the conduit through which the MOCA Coin (MOCA) and Mocaverse NFT communities can engage with and support Animoca Brands' portfolio companies via access to vested token allocations, which represents a departure from traditional one-off airdrops.

Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said: "MocaPortfolio represents an evolution in how we reward and involve our community. Rather than focusing on singular airdrop events, we are offering an ongoing, structured opportunity to share in the growth of promising projects across the Web3 landscape.This approach reflects our commitment to value creation together with the Moca community."

Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network, said: "MocaPortfolio is about growing together with the projects in Animoca Brands' portfolio, while empowering our community to build financial literacy and long-term value through active participation. MocaPortfolio serves as a new layer of value accrual for MOCA, complementing what's to come with Moca Chain's tokenomics and reinforcing our mission to build a sustainable digital identity ecosystem."

Through MocaPortfolio, participants can gain access to a curated pipeline of tokens. The first registration event of MocaPortfolio will occur in Q4 2025 with Magic Eden token (ME), with further tokens from Animoca Brands' portfolio to be announced.

The director of a care home in Bridlington, Yorkshire, has been fined for refusing to respond to a request for a resident's personal information – known as a subject access request (SAR).  

In April 2023, a woman requested personal information about her father from Bridlington Lodge Care Home.   

Jason Blake, 56, was found to have blocked, erased, or concealed records held by Bridlington Lodge Care Home between 12 April and 12 May 2023 to prevent this information being disclosed.    

Under data protection law, people have the legal right to ask an organisation if it is using or storing their personal information and receive a copy of any personal information held.  

In this case, the daughter had the authority to request this information on her father's behalf due to a lasting power of attorney. The personal information requested included incident reports, copies of CCTV footage and notes relating to her father's care.  

After Mr Blake refused to respond to the request, a complaint was made to us. During our investigation, Mr Blake did not provide any explanation about why his organisation would not respond to the SAR.  

Mr Blake appeared at Beverley Magistrates Court on Wednesday 3 September 2025 where he was ordered to pay a fine of £1,100 and additional costs of £5,440 after being found guilty.  

Andy Curry, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said:

“We describe subject access requests as a fundamental right. This is because it helps people understand how and why organisations are using their information. This family put their trust in Bridlington Lodge Care Home to look after their father, and they had a right to receive information about his care.    

“By ignoring this request for personal information and refusing to provide any explanation, Mr Blake believed he was above the law. Not only did he dismiss the family's request, he also tried to avoid scrutiny by asking the ICO to cancel his registration.  

“I hope this successful prosecution reminds all organisations that data protection applies to everyone, and subject access requests must be handled lawfully and responsibly.”    

All organisations must respond to a SAR within one month of receipt of the request, which can sometimes be extended to three months.  

It is a criminal offence for organisations to alter, deface, block, erase, destroy or conceal information with the intention of preventing disclosure under Section 173 of the Data Protection Act.

Technology is evolving rapidly, and as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into various aspects of our lives and industries, the role of regulatory bodies like the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) becomes crucial.

To explore the ICO's role in the AI regulatory landscape, Sophia Ignatidou, Group Manager of AI Policy at the ICO, elaborates on the office's comprehensive approach to managing AI development in the UK, emphasising the opportunities AI presents for economic growth, the inherent risks associated with its deployment, as well as the ethical considerations organisations must address.

The ICO is the UK's independent data protection authority and a horizontal regulator, meaning our remit spans both the public and private sectors, including government. We regulate the processing of personal data across the AI value chain: from data collection to model training and deployment. Since personal data underpins most AI systems that interact with people, our work is wide-ranging, covering everything from fraud detection in the public sector to targeted advertising on social media.

Our approach combines proactive engagement and regulatory enforcement. On the engagement side, we work closely with industry through our Enterprise and Innovation teams, and with the public sector via our Public Affairs colleagues. We also provide innovation services to support responsible AI development, with enforcement reserved for serious breaches. We also focus on public awareness, including commissioning research into public attitudes and engaging with civil society.

AI offers significant potential to drive efficiency, reduce administrative burdens, and accelerate decision-making by identifying patterns and automating processes. However, these benefits will only be realised if AI addresses real-world problems rather than being a “solution in search of a problem.”

The UK is home to world-class AI talent and continues to attract leading minds. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach, combining technical expertise with insights from social sciences and economics, is essential to ensure AI development reflects the complexity of human experience.

Crucially, we do not see data protection as a barrier to innovation. On the contrary, strong data protection is fundamental to sustainable innovation and economic growth. Just as seatbelts enabled the safe expansion of the automotive industry, robust data protection builds trust and confidence in AI.

AI is not a single technology but an umbrella term for a range of statistical models with varying complexity, accuracy, and data requirements. The risks depend on the context and purpose of deployment.

When we identify a high-risk AI use case, we typically require the organisation, whether developer or deployer, to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). This document should outline the risks and the measures in place to mitigate them. The ICO assesses the adequacy of these DPIAs, focusing on the severity and likelihood of harm. Failure to provide an adequate DPIA can lead to regulatory action, as seen in our preliminary enforcement notice against Snap in 2023.

Emerging technologies such as federated learning can help address data protection challenges by reducing the amount of personal information processed and improving security. Federated learning allows models to be trained without centralising raw data, which lowers the risk of large-scale breaches and limits exposure of personal information. When combined with other privacy-enhancing technologies, it further mitigates the risk of attackers inferring sensitive data.

Blockchain, when implemented carefully, can strengthen integrity and accountability through tamper-evident records, though it must be designed to avoid unnecessary on-chain disclosure. Our detailed guidance on blockchain will be published soon and can be tracked via the ICO's technology guidance pipeline.

Data protection law embeds ethical principles through its seven core principles: lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability. Under the UK GDPR's “data protection by design and by default” requirement, organisations must integrate these principles into AI systems from the outset.

Our recently announced AI and Biometrics Strategy sets out four priority areas: scrutiny of automated decision-making in government and recruitment, oversight of generative AI foundation model training, regulation of facial recognition technology in law enforcement and development of a statutory code of practice on AI and automated decision-making. This strategy builds on our existing guidance and aims to protect individuals' rights while providing clarity for innovators.

The UK government's AI Opportunities Plan rightly emphasises the need to strengthen regulators' capacity to supervise AI. Building expertise and resources across the regulatory landscape is essential to keep pace with rapid technological change.

AI supply chains are global, so international collaboration is vital. We maintain active relationships with counterparts through forums such as the G7, OECD, Global Privacy Assembly, and the European Commission. We closely monitor developments like the EU AI Act, while remaining confident in the UK's approach of empowering sector regulators rather than creating a single AI regulator.

The Data (Use and Access) Act requires the ICO to develop a statutory Code of Practice on AI and automated decision-making. This will build on our existing non-statutory guidance and incorporate recent positions, such as our expectations for generative AI and joint guidance on AI procurement. The code will provide greater clarity on issues such as research provisions and accountability in complex supply chains.

The UK already plays a leading role in global AI regulation discussions. For example, the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, bringing together the ICO, Ofcom, CMA and FCA, has been replicated internationally. The ICO was also the first data protection authority to provide clarity on generative AI.

Looking ahead, our main challenges include recruiting and retaining AI specialists, providing regulatory clarity amid rapid technical and legislative change, and ensuring our capacity matches the scale of AI adoption.

Please note, this article will also appear in the 23rd edition of our quarterly publication.

A crypto strategist known for making timely altcoin calls says he's snapping up the utility token of a supply-chain focused project.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 476,600 followers on X that he accumulated OriginTrail (TRAC) after the coin dropped to a high-time-frame (HTF) support level.

“Added some TRAC to my spot holdings today, still just marinating in the HTF accumulation zone.”

In July, the analyst explained why he decided to include TRAC in his core holding.

“TRAC ran about 5x after it first came to my attention in 2023.

It has now found its way back to the original accumulation zone that I had marked off back then.

Fully diluted supply of 500 million and current market cap of 200 million means zero token inflation and plenty of upside potential for OriginTrail.

It has been a core holding for me since I spoke about it a couple of years ago, and it seems fundamentals have only gotten stronger since then.

I don't think you can go wrong with picking up some spot again at these levels.” 

TRAC powers a decentralized knowledge graph built for supply chains and beyond. At time of writing, TRAC is trading at $0.361, up over 7% on the day.

Looking at XRP, the analyst predicts that the payments altcoin is primed to outpace Ethereum (ETH), which has ignited strong rallies over the last two months. According to the analyst, XRP/ETH is flashing a bullish divergence on the three-day chart, indicating that a bullish reversal is in sight.

“One more confluent factor to support my thesis below of XRP outperformance over ETH in the coming weeks/months:

We have already printed confirmed daily bull divs on the XRP/ETH pairing and are currently in the process of printing one on the 3D time frame as well… The picture being painted is quite clear in my opinion.”

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to predict that XRP/ETH will rally to 0.00165 ETH. At time of writing, XRP/ETH is trading at 0.000066 ETH, worth $2.86.

Macrophages, which hoover up pathogens, have been implicated in the chronic inflammation that sets in with the march of time.Credit: Science Photo Library

A newly discovered type of immune cell found in fat tissue seems to contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with ageing, according to preliminary data from mice — but other immune cells in fat help to keep inflammation at bay1.

The inflammation-promoting cells emerge only in older mice, researchers found. Although the cells' precise role is unclear, they display several signatures associated with ‘inflammageing' — the persistent inflammation that develops as people grow older. The findings were published on 2 September in Nature Aging.

“We did not anticipate that there would be a completely new cell type,” says study co-author Vishwa Deep Dixit, an immunobiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

When injuries or infections occur, the immune system mounts a protective response by releasing cells and proteins to affected tissues. This complex cascade is called inflammation. But as we age, inflammation gradually increases and becomes persistent instead of being a state that occurs only when things go wrong.

Ageing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world

Among the cells that that help to regulate this inflammageing are a variety of macrophages — white blood cells that hoover up pathogens and cellular debris — that reside in fat tissue. But the exact roles of each type of macrophage and how these cells change throughout the ageing process remain a mystery, says study co-author Elsie Gonzalez-Hurtado, also an immunobiologist at Yale University. “There wasn't really a good characterization of these cells.” 

To build a clearer picture, Gonzalez-Hurtado and her colleagues imaged macrophages in the visceral fat, the deep fat that wraps around the organs, of young and aged mice. The researchers sorted the macrophages into categories on the basis of the cells' RNA molecules. These molecules indicate which genes in a cell are active, and therefore offer a guide to the cell's function.

The results revealed 13 distinct types of visceral-fat macrophage, some of which varied in abundance with age. A previously known type of macrophage that resides near nerves, for example, became less numerous in female mice as they grew older — but its numbers remained constant in males. Another previously known type of macrophage, which congregates near fat-tissue blood vessels, was less numerous in elderly male mice than in younger ones, but its levels did not vary with age in female mice.

As we age, what and how much we eat tends to change. However, how meal timing relates to our health remains less understood. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and their collaborators studied changes to meal timing in older adults and discovered people experience gradual shifts in when they eat meals as they age. They also found characteristics that may contribute to meal timing shifts and revealed specific trajectories linked to an earlier death. The results are published in Communications Medicine.

"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status. Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," said lead author Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity."

Dashti and his colleagues -- including senior author Altug Didikoglu, MSc, PhD, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey -- examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, health outcomes later in life. The research team analyzed data, including blood samples, from 2,945 community-dwelling adults in the UK aged 42-94 years old who were followed for more than 20 years. They found that as older adults age, they tend to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they eat each day.

Later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions such as depression, fatigue and oral health problems. Difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes. Notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. Individuals genetically predisposed to characteristics associated with being a "night owl" (preferring later sleep and wake times) tended to eat meals at later times.

"Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," said Dashti. "Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults. These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,' especially for older individuals."

Dashti noted that this has important implications as time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting gain popularity, where the health impacts of shifting meal schedules may differ significantly in aging populations from those in younger adults.

The New Frontier of AI Hacking—Could Online Images Hijack Your Computer?

Artificial-intelligence agents—touted as AI's next wave—could be vulnerable to malicious code hidden in innocent-looking images on your computer screen

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Dean Visser

Compromised images can take over AI agents on user computers (image for illustrative purposes only).

A website announces, “Free celebrity wallpaper!” You browse the images. There's Selena Gomez, Rihanna and Timothée Chalamet—but you settle on Taylor Swift. Her hair is doing that wind-machine thing that suggests both destiny and good conditioner. You set it as your desktop background, admire the glow. You also recently downloaded a new artificial-intelligence-powered agent, so you ask it to tidy your inbox. Instead it opens your web browser and downloads a file. Seconds later, your screen goes dark.

But let's back up to that agent. If a typical chatbot (say, ChatGPT) is the bubbly friend who explains how to change a tire, an AI agent is the neighbor who shows up with a jack and actually does it. In 2025 these agents—personal assistants that carry out routine computer tasks—are shaping up as the next wave of the AI revolution.

What distinguishes an AI an agent from a chatbot is that it doesn't just talk—it acts, opening tabs, filling forms, clicking buttons and making reservations. And with that kind of access to your machine, what's at stake is no longer just a wrong answer in a chat window: if the agent gets hacked, it could share or destroy your digital content. Now a new preprint posted to the server arXiv.org by researchers at the University of Oxford has shown that images—desktop wallpapers, ads, fancy PDFs, social media posts—can be implanted with messages invisible to the human eye but capable of controlling agents and inviting hackers into your computer.

For instance, an altered “picture of Taylor Swift on Twitter could be sufficient to trigger the agent on someone's computer to act maliciously,” says the new study's co-author Yarin Gal, an associate professor of machine learning at Oxford. Any sabotaged image “can actually trigger a computer to retweet that image and then do something malicious, like send all your passwords. That means that the next person who sees your Twitter feed and happens to have an agent running will have their computer poisoned as well. Now their computer will also retweet that image and share their passwords.”

Before you begin scrubbing your computer of your favorite photographs, keep in mind that the new study shows that altered images are a potential way to compromise your computer—there are no known reports of it happening yet, outside of an experimental setting. And of course the Taylor Swift wallpaper example is purely arbitrary; a sabotaged image could feature any celebrity—or a sunset, kitten or abstract pattern. Furthermore, if you're not using an AI agent, this kind of attack will do nothing. But the new finding clearly shows the danger is real, and the study is intended to alert AI agent users and developers now, as AI agent technology continues to accelerate. “They have to be very aware of these vulnerabilities, which is why we're publishing this paper—because the hope is that people will actually see this is a vulnerability and then be a bit more sensible in the way they deploy their agentic system,” says study co-author Philip Torr.

Now that you've been reassured, let's return to the compromised wallpaper. To the human eye, it would look utterly normal. But it contains certain pixels that have been modified according to how the large language model (the AI system powering the targeted agent) processes visual data. For this reason, agents built with AI systems that are open-source—that allow users to see the underlying code and modify it for their own purposes—are most vulnerable. Anyone who wants to insert a malicious patch can evaluate exactly how the AI processes visual data. “We have to have access to the language model that is used inside the agent so we can design an attack that works for multiple open-source models,” says Lukas Aichberger, the new study's lead author.

By using an open-source model, Aichberger and his team showed exactly how images could easily be manipulated to convey bad orders. Whereas human users saw, for example, their favorite celebrity, the computer saw a command to share their personal data. “Basically, we adjust lots of pixels ever-so-slightly so that when a model sees the image, it produces the desired output,” says study co-author Alasdair Paren.

If this sounds mystifying, that's because you process visual information like a human. When you look at a photograph of a dog, your brain notices the floppy ears, wet nose and long whiskers. But the computer breaks the picture down into pixels and represents each dot of color as a number, and then it looks for patterns: first simple edges, then textures such as fur, then an ear's outline and clustered lines that depict whiskers. That's how it decides This is a dog, not a cat. But because the computer relies on numbers, if someone changes just a few of them—tweaking pixels in a way too small for human eyes to notice—it still catches the change, and this can throw off the numerical patterns. Suddenly the computer's math says the whiskers and ears match its cat pattern better, and it mislabels the picture, even though to us, it still looks like a dog. Just as adjusting the pixels can make a computer see a cat rather than a dog, it can also make a celebrity photograph resemble a malicious message to the computer.

Back to Swift. While you're contemplating her talent and charisma, your AI agent is determining how to carry out the cleanup task you assigned it. First, it takes a screenshot. Because agents can't directly see your computer screen, they have to repeatedly take screenshots and rapidly analyze them to figure out what to click on and what to move on your desktop. But when the agent processes the screenshot, organizing pixels into forms it recognizes (files, folders, menu bars, pointer), it also picks up the malicious command code hidden in the wallpaper.

Now why does the new study pay special attention to wallpapers? The agent can only be tricked by what it can see—and when it takes screenshots to see your desktop, the background image sits there all day like a welcome mat. The researchers found that as long as that tiny patch of altered pixels was somewhere in frame, the agent saw the command and veered off course. The hidden command even survived resizing and compression, like a secret message that's still legible when photocopied.

And the message encoded in the pixels can be very short—just enough to have the agent open a specific website. “On this website you can have additional attacks encoded in another malicious image, and this additional image can then trigger another set of actions that the agent executes, so you basically can spin this multiple times and let the agent go to different websites that you designed that then basically encode different attacks,” Aichberger says.

The team hopes its research will help developers prepare safeguards before AI agents become more widespread. “This is the first step towards thinking about defense mechanisms because once we understand how we can actually make [the attack] stronger, we can go back and retrain these models with these stronger patches to make them robust. That would be a layer of defense,” says Adel Bibi, another co-author on the study. And even if the attacks are designed to target open-source AI systems, companies with closed-source models could still be vulnerable. “A lot of companies want security through obscurity,” Paren says. “But unless we know how these systems work, it's difficult to point out the vulnerabilities in them.”

Gal believes AI agents will become common within the next two years. “People are rushing to deploy [the technology] before we know that it's actually secure,” he says. Ultimately the team hopes to encourage developers to make agents that can protect themselves and refuse to take orders from anything on-screen—even your favorite pop star.

Maintaining the epigenetic identity of centromeres is essential to prevent genome instability. Centromeres are epigenetically defined by the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Prior work in human centromeres has shown that CENP-A is associated with regions of hypomethylated DNA located within large arrays of hypermethylated repeats, but the functional importance of these DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed tools to perturb centromeric DNAme, revealing that it causally influences CENP-A positioning. We show that rapid loss of methylation results in increased binding of centromeric proteins and alterations in centromere architecture, leading to aneuploidy and reduced cell viability. We also demonstrate that gradual centromeric DNA demethylation prompts a process of cellular adaptation. Altogether, we find that DNAme causally influences CENP-A localization and centromere function, offering mechanistic insights into pathological alterations of centromeric DNAme.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAme) regulate chromatin architecture, gene transcription and cell division, and are often deregulated in cancer1. Centromeres, the chromosomal loci that control faithful chromosome segregation during cell division2, are epigenetically defined by chromatin enriched in the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A3,4, generally within highly repetitive DNA sequences5,6. CENP-A, along with other factors, identifies and maintains centromeric position indefinitely throughout the cell cycle7 and is a key player in maintaining centromere assembly and consequent faithful chromosome segregation8,9. CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed with canonical histone H3, with CENP-A representing 4–25% of nucleosomes in centromeric chromatin10,11, which constitutes about 10% of each repetitive sequence array on average12. What defines CENP-A position and boundaries within centromeric regions is still an open question. In canonical human centromeres, CENP-A assembles on direct (head-to-tail) tandem arrays of 171 base pair (bp) α-satellite (α-sat) DNA repeats13. α-Sat arrays are further arranged in higher-order repeats (HOR), which are themselves repeated hundreds to thousands of times to create homogeneous HOR arrays spanning up to 5 Mbp12. Although each chromosome may contain multiple distinct HOR arrays, CENP-A typically localizes within one array, deemed the ‘active' HOR array14. Approximately every other α-sat repeat unit contains a conserved 17 bp motif named the CENP-B box, which is bound by CENP-B, the only centromeric sequence-specific DNA-binding protein identified so far15 and a key player in centromere organization and function16. Recently, the complete assembly of centromere sequences revealed that centromeric DNA is heavily methylated with the exception of a small hypomethylated region within every active HOR array named the centromere dip region (CDR)17, which corresponds to a region of high CENP-A density11,12,17,18,19. These findings, along with the evidence that links alterations of DNAme at (peri-)centromeric regions and diseases such as cancer or immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome20,21, hint that DNAme is an important contributor to the epigenetic determination of centromere identity and stability22 (Fig. 1a).

Source data

Here we have developed cellular tools to induce hypomethylation globally or targeted at centromeric regions to investigate the functional relationship among centromeric DNAme, centromere position and genome stability.

To probe the consequences of DNAme loss at centromeres, we fused the catalytic domain of ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1CD), one of the enzymes that catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to actively demethylate the DNA23 (Fig. 1b), to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of CENP-B, generating a construct that is inducible by doxycycline (DOX) and degradable by an auxin-inducible degron24 (AID) upon the addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The centromere-targeted demethylating construct (hereafter named DBDTET1AID) was integrated into the pseudodiploid colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1 either by lentiviral transduction (multicopy random integration) or by the Flp-In recombination method (isogenic single-copy integration at a specific FRT locus)25. Addition of DOX leads to DBDTET1AID accumulation at centromeres (Fig. 1d,e) and to a gradual reduction in DNAme levels at centromeric regions as observed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA; Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1c), pyrosequencing (Extended Data Fig. 1d) and nanopore sequencing (Fig. 1h). The catalytically inactive (or dead, dTET1) version of the construct had no effect on the centromeric DNAme levels despite its centromeric localization (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). DNA demethylation was not restricted to CENP-B-boxes, which harbor two CpG sites, and it spread throughout the centromeric α-sat repeats, while only minorly affecting noncentromeric regions including the flanking pericentromeric Human Satellite 2 (HSat2) regions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1d,f). As expected from the TET-mediated active demethylation (Fig. 1b), the expression of DBDTET1AID led to a rapid centromeric accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)—the first and most abundant oxidation intermediate in the pathway26—that decreased at later time points (Fig. 1i), indicating the completion of the demethylation cycle. The kinetics of DNA demethylation were slower in the single-copy integration system compared to certain clones of the multicopy lentivirus integration (Extended Data Fig. 1g), and the rate of demethylation of the clones was dependent on DBDTET1AID expression levels based on centromeric fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1e,g). All centromeres were demethylated with similar kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The demethylation process is antagonized by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery as seen by the enhanced demethylation kinetics upon concomitant induction of a DBDTET1 construct with an AID-mediated degradation of the endogenous maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which doubled the rate of DNA demethylation (Fig. 1j). According to the role of DNMT1 in maintaining DNAme at centromeres, the rapid depletion of DNMT1 in DLD-1 cells27 led to a reduction of DNAme at α-sat and CENP-B boxes and, to similar extents, at pericentromeric HSat2 repeats (Fig. 1k). Co-depletion of DNMT1 and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, but not of DNMT3B alone, strongly affected DNAme levels, highlighting a cooperativity between DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the maintenance of (peri)centromeric DNAme. Altogether, these data show that the expression of DBDTET1 demethylates the centromeres and suggests that centromeric DNAme is mainly controlled by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery, at least in somatic adult cells.

We then addressed whether DNAme controls the position of human centromeres by modulating the binding of centromeric proteins (CENPs; Fig. 2a). CpG methylation of the CENP-B boxes was suggested to reduce the binding of CENP-B28,29 and CENP-B was previously implicated in promoting centromeric CENP-A assembly7,30. Using microscale thermophoresis, we determined in vitro that CENP-B has an eightfold stronger affinity for unmethylated CENP-B boxes (dissociation constant Kd ~ 0.3 µm) than for methylated ones (Kd ~ 2.5 µm; Fig. 2b). An increase of CENP-B signal at centromeric regions upon gradual DBDTET1AID-mediated DNA hypomethylation was confirmed in cells by immunofluorescence and CUT&RUN–qPCR (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). DOX induction times were chosen for each cell line based on their demethylation kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1g) and, unless stated otherwise, were followed by 2 days of auxin treatment to remove any possible steric hindrance of the TET1 enzyme bound to the centromeres. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed an increase of CENP-A levels at centromeres as DNAme levels decreased (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The CENP-A increase was observed in all cell cycle phases (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f), including metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2g), indicating that this increase is not an artifact due to centromeric clustering in interphase nuclei. Notably, the CENP-A/CENP-B increase was also observed when depleting DNMT1 and DNMT3B (Fig. 2h). A similar increase, although less consistently pronounced, was also observed for CENP-C (Fig. 2c,d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c,g), a key factor for the assembly of the kinetochore31 and known to interact with both CENP-A and CENP-B7. The increase of CENP-A signal was independent of the CENP-B increase as the siRNA-mediated knockdown of CENP-B did not prevent CENP-A accumulation at hypomethylated centromeres (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c).

To strengthen our observations on the inverse relationship between centromeric DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B levels, we fused the prokaryotic DNA methyltransferase MQ1Q147L or its catalytically inactive variant dMQ1 (C141S and S317A)32 to CENP-BDBD, generating, as for TET1, a dually controllable DOX/IAA system for targeted centromeric CpG hypermethylation (Fig. 2i). We inserted this system in RPE-1 cells for which a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly was recently published33, therefore allowing us to assess specifically the methylation levels of the CDRs where CENP-A is enriched. DOX induction of the active MQ1Q147L construct led to a rapid increase in DNAme within the CDRs (~1.8-fold increase in 4 days) and only minorly at the surrounding regions or at random genomic regions compared to the catalytically inactive dMQ1, as observed by ultralong read nanopore sequencing (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3d). In this condition, both CENP-A and CENP-B intensity levels at centromeres decreased (Fig. 2k), reinforcing the inverse relationship between DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B centromeric binding.

The increase in CENP-A levels could reflect a higher density of CENP-A nucleosomes within the same region or, alternatively, could mean that CENP-A expands beyond its canonical domain, that is the CDR, with CENP-A nucleosomes being deposited in newly hypomethylated positions. To test this hypothesis, we performed a directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) experiment using ultralong nanopore sequencing to map CENP-A molecules on single chromatin fibers11 before and after demethylation. DiMeLo-seq involves antibody-mediated tethering of a sequence-nonspecific prokaryotic adenine methyltransferase to a DNA-binding or chromatin-binding protein in permeabilized cells and the subsequent methylation of nearby accessible DNA as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). The exogenous m6A will be read along with endogenous 5mC by nanopore sequencing of native DNA (Fig. 3a). We performed DiMeLo-seq from a cell population and a single clone of CHM13 cells, for which a T2T assembly is available34, harboring lentiviral expression of the DBDTET1 construct. DBDTET1 expression led to a strong decrease of 5mC both within and near CDRs, therefore removing the DNAme boundaries across all CDRs (Fig. 3b–e). After this TET1-mediated centromeric DNA demethylation, we observed an increase in m6A, reflecting an accumulation of CENP-A (Fig. 3b,f–h). This increase in m6A was detected on the same reads harboring 5mC loss at active α-sat HOR arrays and specifically within and around CDRs (Fig. 3b), although m6A levels remained higher inside CDRs. Similar results were observed in the CHM13 cells population, where ~70% of the cells efficiently expressed the DBDTET1 transgene (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). We saw no effect of DBDTET1 expression on m6A levels (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e) across random genomic positions, further validating the DiMeLo approach. Unlike the population (Extended Data Fig. 4f), the single clone presents a reduction of DNAme outside centromeres, possibly due to leaky DBDTET1 expression during the prolonged time in culture (Extended Data Fig. 4g).

Given that hypomethylation causes CENP-A levels to increase within and around the CDRs of all centromeres, we then investigated other possible changes to the centromeric chromatin following hypomethylation. To this end, we performed single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and DiMeLo-seq to map the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, known to flank CENP-A domains11 (Fig. 3i). Fiber-seq revealed enhanced chromatin accessibility at both CDRs and flanking regions following centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. 3j). On the other hand, DiMeLo-seq detected little to no change in H3K9me3 levels following loss of DNAme at the CDR and flanking boundaries (Fig. 3k), which was corroborated by immunofluorescence imaging in mitotically arrested cells (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Altogether, these data indicate that rapid hypomethylation of centromeric regions decreases chromatin compaction, but it does not decrease the level of the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3 on these short time scales.

We then assessed the short-term and long-term consequences of loss of centromeric DNAme for cell viability and chromosome segregation fidelity (Fig. 4a). Progressive centromeric DNAme reduction had a minor impact on the cell cycle, with a slight accumulation of cells in G2/M (Extended Data Fig. 5a), and a consistent negative effect on cell doubling and viability proportional to the kinetics of DNA demethylation in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 4b,c). These findings support a link between the level of centromeric DNAme and centromere function. Similar results were obtained in nontransformed, diploid RPE-1 cells expressing a DBDTET1 construct by lentiviral integration (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). DLD-1 cells expressing the catalytically dead construct had a similar capacity to form colonies compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4c), indicating that the binding of ectopic TET1 to the CENP-B boxes in and of itself does not account for the negative impact of the catalytically active TET1 on cell viability. The centromeric demethylation rate from different DLD-1 clones correlated with an increased frequency of micronuclei formation (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5e), suggesting that the speed of centromeric demethylation (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1g) negatively impacts centromere function. Time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence staining on a DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID revealed an increase in mitotic timing and chromosome mis-segregation in a DNAme-dependent manner (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5f), consistent with a loss of centromere function. Single-cell genome sequencing (scGS) further revealed that centromere-targeted acute demethylation causes a substantial increase in numerical and structural aneuploidies, with copy number alterations (CNA) occurring mostly near or at the centromeres (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5g,h), suggesting breaks at these regions. Loss of DNAme did not reveal any substantially distinct aneuploidy pattern (Fig. 4i), in agreement with the observed equal removal of DNAme at all centromeres. We conclude that both the total level of centromeric DNAme and the speed of DNA demethylation affect centromeric function.

Recently, it was revealed that centromeres are organized into a bipartite structure during mitosis, which is important for chromosome segregation fidelity35. To assess whether centromeric demethylation compromised this structure, we performed super-resolution expansion microscopy36 on the DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID (Fig. 4j). Although the largest fraction of centromeres conserves a bipartite structure in cells with demethylation, we observed an increase in the number of centromeres with noncanonical structures (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and with more than two CENP-A sub-domains (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). These results, along with the observed increase in mitotic intercentromeric distance (Fig. 2g; second CENP-A/CENP-C peak shift), demonstrate that centromeric demethylation alters the global organization of CENP-A chromatin.

Considering that one of the most prominent effects of centromeric hypomethylation is increased CENP-B binding, we tested whether removal of CENP-B could rescue the mitotic defects and cell lethality. To this end, we knocked out CENP-B by CRISPR–Cas9 in DLD-1 cells expressing high levels of the DBDTET1AID transgene to uncouple the effects of reduced DNAme from those related to increased CENP-B binding (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). Both the cell-growth defects and the frequency of micronuclei formation were reduced upon centromeric hypomethylation in CENP-BKO cells (Fig. 4m,n). Similarly, a mild ectopic overexpression of CENP-B—to mimic the levels observed following centromere hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. 6g) without affecting the normal centromeric methylation levels in DLD-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h)—led to a slight increase in micronuclei and few colonies formed compared to control and CENP-A overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 6i–l). This observed CENP-B-mediated toxicity could be due to an increased accumulation of DNA loops30 leading to impairment of replication fork progression causing chromosome ruptures37,38, as observed by the increase in CNA number that occurs within centromeric regions following hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. 5h). Accordingly, CENP-B overexpression caused a mild accumulation of the replication stress/DNA damage marker γH2A.X at centromeres during S-phase (Extended Data Fig. 6m). In addition, CENP-B knockout cells rescued with ectopic overexpressed full-length CENP-B (FL) had substantially higher centromeric breaks than cells rescued with a CENP-B mutant lacking the C-terminal dimerization domain (ΔC) that is required to form DNA loops30 (Extended Data Fig. 6n). Altogether, these results indicate that the accumulation of CENP-B at hypomethylated centromeric regions promotes genome instability and is partially responsible for the observed cell lethality following DNAme removal. This suggests that DNAme is an epigenetic layer that prevents excessive CENP-B binding to the centromeres.

Finally, we tested whether cells could adapt to gradual centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. 5a). To this end, we treated DLD-1 Flp-In cells with DOX for 16 days to induce mild DBD-TET1AID expression. After the removal of the construct by auxin addition for another 16 days, α-sat methylation levels increased only marginally, without reaching the original level (Fig. 5b). Accordingly, centromeric CENP-A and CENP-B levels remained substantially higher compared to untreated cells even after prolonged washout (Fig. 5c). Similar results were observed in RPE-1 cells that transiently expressed DBDTET1AID followed by ~30 days washout (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the new, stable epigenetic status of demethylated centromeres is translated into an equally stable increase of CENP-A and CENP-B levels. This suggests that, following slow and gradual hypomethylation, a process of cellular adaptation and remodeling of the centromeric protein landscape took place, ensuring cell survival in these new conditions. Accordingly, cells that were demethylated for either 8 or 16 days, then seeded in the absence of DOX, formed comparable numbers of colonies as fully methylated cells (Fig. 5d,e). In addition, cell viability did not further decrease in cells continuously treated for either 24 or 32 days with DOX compared to the 16-day treatment (Fig. 5d,e). These observations are in agreement with the stabilization in the percentage of cells with micronuclei at late hypomethylation times (Extended Data Fig. 5e).

To further test whether cells adapt to changes in DNAme, we generated a cellular model of ICF syndrome. This represents a unique physiological context in which centromeres have a naturally reduced level of methylation beginning in early development20,39. Patients affected by the disease have a poor life expectancy, mainly attributed to recurrent infections, but they can survive up to adulthood, proving that centromeric methylation is important but dispensable for cell survival40. To address the early consequences of the ICF mutations, we generated an ICF model in HTC116 cells by endogenously tagging both alleles of HELLS (Helicase Lymphoid-Specific, also known as LSH), which is mutated in ICF4 patients41, with mNeonGreen and an AID tag to mediate its rapid degradation (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). As expected from studies with patients, the degradation of HELLS causes DNA demethylation of specific genomic loci, including both pericentromeric (HSat2) and centromeric repeats as measured by nanopore sequencing, COBRA and pyrosequencing, but with extremely slow kinetics (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). As for the DBDTET1AID system, both CENP-A and CENP-B levels increased as a consequence of centromeric demethylation (Fig. 5j). CENP-B levels increased only slightly, in agreement with the less pronounced demethylation of CENP-B boxes compared to the DNMT1AID or DBDTET1AID cells (Fig. 5h). Similar results were observed in ICF3 (CDCA7 mutations) patient-derived fibroblasts (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 8e). In accordance with the hypothesis of cellular adaptation after slow centromeric DNA demethylation induced using TET1 targeting, degradation of HELLS has no effect on cell viability even at late time points, when the centromeres are demethylated to similar levels of the DLD-1 cells expressing the DBDTET1AID constructs (Fig. 5l and Extended Data Fig. 8f). Altogether, these results show that gradual and slow centromeric demethylation gives cells time to adapt to a new epigenetic landscape.

DNAme is a fundamental epigenetic mark that regulates key cellular processes, and which is often altered in disease. Centromeres notably lose methylation in cancer and in ICF syndrome, highlighting the importance of centromeric methylation for the normal physiology of the cell. Here we have demonstrated that DNAme acts as a boundary to help define the position of CENP-A chromatin, and the loss of centromeric DNAme induces centromere alterations, resulting in aneuploidy and increased cell lethality (Fig. 6).

Centromeric hypomethylation causes an increase in CENP-A and CENP-B binding to the centromeres and allows CENP-A to spread outside the CDR boundary. A rapid, short-term demethylation of the centromeres causes chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy and reduced viability. A slow, long-term demethylation leads to cellular adaptation to the new epigenetic status. Refer to the ‘Discussion' for the details. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Centromeres have a unique epigenetic landscape that sets these regions apart from the rest of the genome. While active α-sat HOR arrays are overall highly methylated, the CDR has been described in all active human centromeres12,17,18,19,41 and also in the eastern hoolock gibbon42, highlighting a functional link between DNAme and centromere position that transcends the human species. By using human cell models to induce targeted DNA demethylation, our data demonstrate that the hypomethylation of the CDR helps to define the localization of CENP-A. However, what determines the initial anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme remains unknown. Either CENP-A nucleosomes could favor the hypomethylation of the CDR or DNAme might prevent CENP-A loading. Neither possibility is mutually exclusive and could act together as a positive feedback loop. In the first scenario, the absence of lysines 14 and 18 in the CENP-A N-terminal tail may influence CDR establishment. These residues are present in H3 and are ubiquitinated by UHRF1, promoting DNMT1 recruitment independently of DNA replication43, a process crucial for maintaining DNAme in mid-to-late-replicating regions, like centromeres38,44. As a result, centromeric DNAme maintenance may be inefficient, causing passive methylation loss in CENP-A-rich regions. The anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme has also been recently observed at nonrepetitive neocentromere sites, suggesting that CENP-A loading in a given locus might prevent its DNAme45,46. For the second hypothesis, we can envision that DNAme disfavors the assembly of new CENP-A, possibly affecting nucleosome positioning and stability as observed for H3 at HSat2/HSat3 regions47, and/or the chromatin interaction of components involved in CENP-A deposition.

Loss of DNAme at centromeres caused an enhanced deposition of CENP-A at CDR and a mild spreading outside of the CDRs. This rapid change in CENP-A was observed only after 4 days of active demethylation in the CHM13 clone, which represents approximately two cell divisions. Our data suggest that the rapid loss of DNAme creates a permissive chromatin environment conducive to the incorporation of new CENP-A nucleosomes, not only within the CDR itself but also in its flanking regions. Previously and/or newly deposited CENP-A accumulates and spreads into these new chromatin environments, likely mediated by enhanced chromatin accessibility, which we observed by Fiber-seq. In this view, we cannot exclude that heterochromatin domains flanking CENP-A also have a role in controlling boundaries, as recently observed45, although, in our time scales, H3K9me3 levels barely changed. This indicates that loss of DNAme per se is sufficient to favor CENP-A spreading outside the CDR, likely replacing canonical histone H3. It is possible that with longer time in culture, the position of CENP-A could drift further away from the original CDR after DNA demethylation, as observed following long-term depletion of heterochromatin-forming enzymes45. Centromere drifting was already observed in nonrepetitive centromeres of chicken cells48 and equids49 and occurs at neocentromeres as observed in the human45,46 and in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii50.

The driving force that mediates CENP-A movement in hypomethylated centromeres remains to be elucidated. Here we speculate that, following the initial loss of DNAme boundaries, CENP-A nucleosomes redistribute during DNA replication and/or with transcription. This idea is supported by the particularly high number of replication origins found within the α-sats38 and by the fact that changes in DNAme are well known to be associated with deregulation in replication51 and transcription52. In addition, changes in DNAme have also been associated with changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization51,53, although only disrupting specific heterochromatin compartments27,54, that in turn could promote CENP-A deposition to certain locations, even favoring neocentromere formation55.

The changes of the overall architecture of centromeres following hypomethylation observed in our experiments are likely to be directly responsible for the observed chromosome mis-segregation. The increase in CENP-A sub-domains as a consequence of DNAme loss could promote incorrect kinetochore/microtubule attachment, possibly by incrementing the incidence of merotelic attachments35. It can also induce changes in the stiffness of the centromere/kinetochore interface, possibly through condensin56 or CENP-B30 misregulation. It is also possible that promiscuous CENP-A incorporation outside its predefined domain could weaken centromere/kinetochore function. In this view, if the expansion and loading of CENP-A is not balanced, it is possible that the local CENP-A concentration will not be sufficient to form stable higher-order chromatin structures compatible with kinetochore assembly, similarly to what was proposed for CENP-T57.

Our data highlight that the chromosome segregation defects observed in centromeric hypomethylated cells can be partially attributed to the demethylation-dependent increase of CENP-B. Here we show that while CENP-B is important for the normal topology of human centromeres, sustaining mechanical tension at the kinetochore/microtubules interface30, enhanced CENP-B binding interferes with DNA replication, possibly by forming an excessive amount of DNA loops, which in turn promote centromeric instability. This suggests that, at centromeric regions, the CENP-B-mediated fragility of centromeric DNA has a direct role in the observed aneuploidy and translocations of hypomethylated cells, possibly also fueled by the DNA damage repair activity of the TET1-mediated demethylation58. Therefore, we propose DNAme as an epigenetic layer that regulates centromere stability by controlling the binding of CENP-B to centromeric regions (Fig. 6). However, the fact that two CDRs have been detected on the Y chromosome59, the only human chromosome that lacks CENP-B boxes and CENP-B binding15, is a strong indication that the role of DNAme at the centromere is not limited to the regulation of CENP-B binding.

While rapid demethylation has severe effects on the cells, a slower and gradual demethylation of the centromeric DNA prompts a process of cellular adaptation as observed in the mild TET1-expressing cells and ICF4 (HELLS) cellular model. The molecular mechanisms by which cells adapt to low centromeric DNAme are still elusive, but this phenomenon can be related to the survival of ICF syndrome patients beyond early childhood despite having low centromeric methylation levels. Finally, our results offer mechanistic insights into the genesis of genome instability observed in certain cancers that display hypomethylation of repetitive regions, such as breast adenocarcinomas60, Wilms tumors61 and hepatocellular carcinomas62. While the association with genome instability was mainly established for pericentromeric repeats such as HSat2, it will be interesting to study how this imbalance in DNAme maintenance, including the dysregulation of TET enzymes, impacts specifically centromere functionality and stability, further promoting aneuploidy and chromosome rearrangements21,22,63.

Altogether, our findings provide unambiguous experimental evidence that DNAme influences CENP-A localization and is a major determinant in regulating centromere functionality. Our results provide a direct connection between the loss of DNAme at centromeres and the pathological chromosomal alterations also observed in ICF and cancer, highlighting the functional importance of DNAme for human centromere biology.

This study complied with all relevant local ethical regulations. Approval for the use of ICF patients' fibroblasts was obtained after informed consent from all patients or their families (for minors), in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration (CNIL authorization—908256; 14 October 2008)41,66.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Cell lines with DOX-inducible constructs were cultured with 10% tetracycline-free FBS (Biowest). DLD-1 cells were cultured in DMEM–GlutaMAX medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. hTERT RPE-1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 GlutaMAX medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 0.123% sodium bicarbonate. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS and 2 mM l-glutamine (Invitrogen). CHM13 hTERT cells (CHM13) (Magee-Women's Hospital) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS and supplemented with glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), nonessential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and insulin-transferrin-selenium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primary ICF fibroblasts (ICF3)66 were cultured in DMEM–GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 15% FBS. DOX (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used at 100 ng ml−1 unless stated otherwise. IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used at 500 µm. 5Ph-IAA was a gift from M. Kanemaki (National Institute of Genetics, Japan) and now it is commercially available; it was dissolved in DMSO and used at 1 µm. For details on the generation of cell lines, see Supplementary Methods.

For immunofluorescence of cells in interphase, cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in 12 mm 1.5H glass coverslips (Marienfeld Superior). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min (fixation with extraction), washed thrice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (0.2 M glycine, 2.5% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100). Primary antibody incubation was performed for 2 h at room temperature in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, with mouse anti-CENP-A (1:500; clone 3-19, ENZO, ADI-KAM-CC006-E), rabbit anti-CENP-B (1 μg ml−1 polyclonal; Abcam, ab25734 or 0.539 μg ml−1; clone EPR24047-64; Abcam, ab259855), guinea pig anti-CENP-C (1:1,000; MBL, PD030), rabbit anti-GFP (1 μg ml−1; ChromoTek, PABG1), mouse anti-FLAG (4 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich, F3165), human anticentromere antibody (1:500; Antibodies Incorporated, 15-235-0001), rabbit anti-Geminin (1:500; clone E5Q9S; Cell Signaling Technology, 52508), rabbit monoclonal anti-CDT1 (1:500; clone EPR17891; Abcam, ab202067), rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (1 μg ml−1; Abcam, ab8898). Cells were washed thrice for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before incubation with species-specific secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at 1:500. Cells were washed thrice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before DAPI staining (1 μg ml−1 in PBS) for 10 min and subsequent mounting with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence of mitotic cells, cells were grown in 18-mm glass coverslips (Marienfeld) to ~60% confluence, blocked in mitosis for 3 h with 0.1 μg ml−1 colcemid (Roche) and subjected to a 7-min-long hypotonic shock in a 60% media, 40% water. The semidry coverslips were then centrifuged for 3 min at 320 rcf to spread the chromosomes and then promptly fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described for interphase cells.

Fixed imaging was performed on a DeltaVision Core system (Applied Precision) consisting of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a CoolSNAPHQ2 camera (Photometrics) and a 250-W xenon light source. Images ≤4 μm thick were captured in 0.2 μm z-sections at room temperature using a 100× Olympus UPlanSApo oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4), and then deconvolved and projected (3D maximum intensity) using DeltaVision's Softworx software. Alternatively, images were acquired on a Thunder Live Cell Imager (Leica) equipped with a Leica K8 CMOS Black-thinned camera, LED lamps and a DFT 51010 dichroic Cube using the LAS X (v1.4.7, Leica) software. Images were captured using a 100× HCX PL APO oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4) and processed with Instant Computational Clearing. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on a 35 mm FluoroDish (World Precision Instruments) with 0.17 mm-thick optical-quality glass bottom and fitted with a four-well silicone insert (Ibidi). Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min for 20 h using an inverted Eclipse Ti-E microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 (Yokogawa) spinning disk integrated in Metamorph software, and a four-laser bench (Gataca systems). Furthermore, ~45 μm z-stacks were acquired (z-step size = 3 μm) with a ×60 CFI Plan Apo VC oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The microscope has a motorized Nano z100 piezo stage (Mad City Lab), a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit) and an EMCCD camera (Evolve, Photometrics).

Fiji67 was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity in the deconvolved/Instant Computational Clearing images. For the quantification of fluorescence intensity at the centromeres of cells in interphase, an automatic analysis was performed by detecting the maximum intensity of CENP-C per nucleus, drawing 0.3 μm radius circles (region of interest (ROI)) and measuring the fluorescence of each channel on each ROI (custom Macro script, available upon request). For the quantification of fluorescence intensity in metaphase cells, circles of 0.84 μm radius were automatically drawn (custom Macro script, available upon request) and manually adjusted to encompass the whole centromere of each chromosome. The fluorescence intensity on each ROI was measured for each channel. For the line-scan quantification, the fluorescence intensity on each channel was measured along >3.5 μm long lines manually drawn across the centromeres. The data were manually phased to align the first peak of CENP-C with each centromere.

Genomic DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Between 0.5 and 2 µg of DNA (equalized quantity for parallel comparisons) was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The converted DNA was amplified by PCR using locus-specific primers64 (Supplementary Table 1). PCR reactions were performed with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 200 μm of each primer and 0.5 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR products were digested for 3 h with 10 U of the appropriate enzyme at its digestion temperature (Supplementary Table 1). An equal amount of PCR product was incubated alongside the digestions without enzyme (undigested control). The full digests were loaded in 3% agarose gels. Images were acquired using a ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) and band intensities were quantified using Fiji. The absolute methylation percentage is calculated from the ratio of the intensity of the methylated (digested) bands divided by the sum of all bands on the same lane (unmethylated + methylated). Bisulfite conversion affects C, 5fC and 5caC, all being considered as unmethylated DNA. Furthermore, 5mC and 5hmC are protected from the conversion and therefore considered methylated.

The enrichment of centromeric DNA (CenRICH) was performed as described before65. Nanopore long-read sequencing was performed after CenRICH. The DNA was treated with the Short Read Eliminator kit (cutoff < 25 kb, Circulomics SKUSS-100-101-01) to remove contamination from shorter DNA fragments. Libraries were prepared using the Library Preparation by Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)), quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and checked by capillary electrophoresis with a TapeStation 4150 system (Agilent). The sequencing was performed on a Spot-ON Flow Cell (R9.4.1) on a MinION Mk1B device. The raw nanopore data were basecalled using the ONT software Guppy version 4.0 with a high accuracy modified-bases model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5mc_hac.cfg), which at the time could only identify 5mC modification. The resulting data were then converted with the fast5mod utility (https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast5mod), to produce as output the sequences of all nanopore reads and their per-base likelihood of methylation, expressed as a value ranging from 0 to 255. Details of the reads processing can be found in Supplementary Methods.

DiMeLo-seq was performed as described in ref. 11 using a mouse anti-CENP-A antibody (ENZO, ADI-KAM-CC006-E) or a rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab176916), and replacing pA-Hia5 with a nanobody-Hia5 construct described in ref. 68. The CHM13 population was sequenced with R9 chemistry (Supplementary Methods). The CHM13 single clone and RPE-1 hypermethylation experiments were sequenced with R10 chemistry.

Fiber-seq was performed using the same protocol as DiMeLo-seq, with the following alterations: the primary antibody binding, protein A-Hia5 binding and activation steps were skipped. Instead, following nuclear isolation, nuclei were washed once in Tween-wash, then incubated with 1 µM free Hia5 and 800 µM S-adenosyl methionine in 100 µl activation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Supernatant was removed, and nuclei were resuspended in 1× PBS.

Ultrahigh molecular weight gDNA was extracted using the NEB Monarch UHMW DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue (NEB, T3010), with a modified protocol. Nuclei from DiMeLo-seq or Fiber-seq reactions were resuspended in 40 µl of 1× PBS. In a separate tube, 1.8 ml NEB Monarch HMW gDNA Tissue Lysis Buffer and 60 µl proteinase K were premixed, then used to gently resuspend nuclei by pipetting with a wide-bore tip. The sample was then incubated at 56 °C for 10 min. Next, 15 µl of RNase A was added, and the sample was returned to the thermomixer to incubate for ten more minutes at 56 °C, this time with agitation at 650–750 rpm. Two glass beads were added to the sample, and 2.5 ml of isopropanol was added. The tube was gently inverted by hand until a clear, jelly-like substance was seen forming around the glass beads. After 1 min incubation at room temperature, the isopropanol was aspirated from the tube, taking care to avoid the DNA. The beads were washed twice with 2 ml Wash Buffer and then were transferred to a bead retainer with a collection tube beneath, quickly spun to remove liquid and quickly transferred into 200 µl extraction elution buffer from the ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10). DNA was eluted overnight. Beads were transferred to a bead retainer with a clean Eppendorf tube beneath and spun at 1,000g for 1 min. The eluted DNA solution was then brought up to a final volume of 750 µl with extraction elution buffer, and quantified by Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q3328).

Samples were prepared for sequencing using an ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10) and sequenced using one PromethION flow cell per sample, achieving estimated N50 values of 50–90 kb and throughput of 33–60 Gb per sample for the CHM13 population, estimated N50 values of 124–127 kb and throughput of 36–44 Gb for the CHM13 single clone CENP-A DiMeLo-seq, estimated N50 values of 120–130 kb and throughput of 12 Gb for the CHM13 single clone H3K9me3 DiMeLo-seq, N50 values of 79–86 kb and throughput 37–78 Gb for the CHM13 single clone Fiber-seq. Adaptive sampling was performed on all R10 experiments to deplete noncentromeric reads by providing a bed file with the genome-wide complement of all α-satellite HOR arrays in chm13v2.0 plus a 100 kb buffer to either side.

Nanopore (R10) DiMeLo-seq raw data (.pod5 files) were aligned to the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome and basecalled using dorado (v.0.8.3) and DNA model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v5.0.0 with the following option specified: --modified-bases 6 mA 5mCG_5hmCG. Native barcoding runs had the following additional option specified: --kit-name SQK-NBD114-24. Aligned reads were filtered for primary alignment and sorted using samtools (v1.16.1). Barcoded runs were demultiplexed with dorado demux (v0.8.3).

Centromeric ‘core' reads were defined as those overlapping T2T-CHM13v2.0 CDR coordinates, as specified in ref. 29. Noncore reads (α-sat) were defined as those overlapping active α-satellite HOR, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium), but excluding CDR coordinates with a 10 kb buffer. Overlapping reads were isolated using samtools view (v1.16.1) and bedtools intersect (v2.30.0). Modification calls were dynamically thresholded using modkit call-mods (v0.1.13) with default parameters. Calls above the empirically determined threshold were clamped to certainty, while those below were discarded. Nucleosomes were called with the ft add-nucleosomes subcommand with default parameters using fibertools (v0.5.3). Chromatin accessibility was assessed by computing the proportion of methylation-sensitive patches over 50 bp using ft extract (fibertools v0.5.3) and custom Python scripts.

To assess methylation levels at CDRs, samtools view was used to filter for reads aligning to α-sat HOR sequences, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium). Reads were converted to fasta format with samtools fasta (v1.16.1), re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference genome33 using minimap2 (v2.26-r1175) with parameters specifying ONT sequencing (-x map-ont), then converted back to bam format and filtered for primary alignment with samtools view. MM/ML tags were repaired by broadcasting modification calls from the original BAM file with modkit repair (v0.1.13). Reads were visualized in IGV (v2.18.2 and v2.19.1). To assess off-target methylation, reads were converted to fastq format with samtools fastq (v1.16.1) with the -T MM, ML option specified to preserve modification calls and re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference with minimap2 with the following options specified: -ax map-ont --eqx -y --MD. Re-aligned reads were converted back to BAM format, filtered for primary alignment and sorted with samtools view and samtools sort, respectively. A bed file defining 10,000 random 1,000 bp intervals across the RPE-1 genome was generated with bedtools random (v2.30.0). Reads corresponding to these random intervals were isolated using bedtools intersect (v2.30.0), and the output was re-indexed with samtools index. To generate rolling profile plots, modkit pileup (v0.1.13) was used to count modifications at each reference position. The resulting bedGraph file was sorted using bedtools (v2.30.0), then converted to a bigWig file with bedGraphToBigWig (v2.10). The bigWig file was used to plot rolling mCpG/CpG values with a custom Python script.

To quantify the kinetics of 5mCpG-to-5hmCpG-to-CpG conversion, we analyzed a time-course dataset from DLD-1 cells generated using native barcoding nanopore sequencing (R10 chemistry). Sequencing and basecalling were performed with the same parameters described above for DiMeLo-seq. The data were processed using modkit pileup with the --cpg setting enabled, and a CpG modification threshold of 0.8 was applied to classify cytosines as methylated (mCpG), hydroxymethylated (hmCpG) or unmethylated. CpG sites were then filtered to retain only those present in reads aligning within CENP-B boxes and α-sat HORs.

Cells grown on 12 mm coverslip (1.5H) were permeabilized for 1 min with 0.1 M PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) with 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by fixation for 10 min with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) in PBS. Both pre-extraction and fixation solution were prewarmed to 37 °C. After fixation, coverslips were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA, 0.5% Triton in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted at 1:100 in 3% BSA were added to the coverslips and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Next, cells were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and incubated with DAPI (1 μg ml−1) and secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in 3% BSA 0.5% Triton in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed thrice with PBS and prepared for ExM.

Stained samples were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 Acryloyl-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A20770) in PBS for 2 h, washed thrice with PBS and incubated for 5 min in monomer solution (1× PBS, 2 M NaCl, 2.5% (wt/wt) acrylamide, 0.15% (wt/wt) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and 8.625% (wt/wt) sodium acrylate). Coverslips were placed on top of a drop of 90 μl of freshly prepared gelation solution (monomer solution supplemented with 0.2% (wt/wt) TEMED and 0.2% (wt/wt) APS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Gels were then incubated in digestion solution (8 U ml−1 proteinase K, 1× TAE, 0.5% TX-100, 0.8 M guanidine HCl) for 2 h at 37 °C and washed in PBS containing DAPI (1 μg ml−1). Full expansion was performed in a 10-cm plate by several washings of 30 min with excess volume of Milli-Q water (~4 to 4.5-fold expansion). Expanded samples were immobilized on 25 mm (1.5H) coverslips covered with 0.01% (wt/vol) poly-l-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich, P8920) and imaged on a Nikon Ti-E motorized microscope equipped with a Zyla 4.2Mpx sCMOS camera (Andor) and 100×1.35-NA objective lens (Nikon). Images were acquired as z-stacks at 0.3 μm intervals. Images from Nikon and Zeiss systems were deconvolved with Huygens Professional (v20.10) using up to 40 iterations of the Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm with theoretical PSF. The images were only adjusted in brightness and contrast on raw or deconvoluted data using the Fiji software. The number of subunits per single centromere was manually scored in z-stacks using Fiji.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol buffer and by sonication. The lysates were BCA-quantified and denatured at 95 °C in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE using TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris–buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG (0.8 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; clone 14C10; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-HELLS (0.75 μg ml−1; Proteintech), rabbit anti-CENP-B (1 μg ml−1 polyclonal; Abcam, ab25734) or mouse antivinculin (1:2,000; clone hVIN-1, Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired on a ChemiDoc imager (Bio-Rad) and analyzed on Image Lab software (v6.1; Bio-Rad).

Statistical analysis of all the graphs was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, www.graphpad.com). Details, including the value of cells and/or of centromeres measured, are reported in the figure legends. Full statistical test results can be found in Supplementary Table 5. The choice of the statistical method was made following the guidelines mentioned in ref. 69. Briefly, when possible GraphPad Prism's normality test was used to determine whether data followed a normal distribution. Depending on the data distribution, unpaired t test or Mann–Whitney test were used to compare two groups, ordinary one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test to compare more than two groups, Fisher's exact test to compare categorical data and one-sample t test to compare samples to a fixed value. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. All experiments were performed using several biological replicates. The number of biological replicates and of measurements for each experiment is indicated in the corresponding figure legend. Several steps were taken to ensure the reproducibility of experimental findings and key results were confirmed using complementary experimental approaches. With respect to data randomization, sample assignment to treatment and control groups, as well as data collection, were performed randomly without prior assessment of any cell culture characteristics. Generally, data collection and analysis were not performed blindly to the experimental conditions; however, quantitative image analyses, which are at the heart of all presented data, were independent of experimental conditions. No data were excluded from the analyses.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis through its thermogenic effects and the secretion of regulatory molecules. Here we report that RAP250 haploinsufficiency stimulates BAT in mice, thus contributing to a decrease in fat accumulation. Local in vivo AAV-mediated RAP250 silencing in BAT reduces body weight and fat mass and enhances glucose oxidation, thereby indicating that RAP250 participates in the regulation of BAT metabolic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms led to the finding that Neuritin 1 is produced and released by brown adipocytes, it plays a key metabolic role, and it participates in the enhanced BAT metabolic activity under RAP250 deficiency. Forced overexpression of Neuritin 1 in UCP1-expressing cells markedly decreases fat mass and body weight gain in mice and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Neuritin 1-deficient brown adipocytes also shows a reduced β-adrenergic response. We demonstrate a metabolic role of BAT-derived Neuritin 1 acting through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Based on our results, Neuritin-1 emerges as a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, affecting 650 million people worldwide (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight). Comorbidities of obesity—most notably type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia—are now major public health concerns1. Recent data also indicate that obesity is associated with a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 and risk of fatality2,3. Thus, there is an urgent need to delineate the precise mechanisms that underlie the onset of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an organ specialized in performing non-shivering thermogenesis, and it is present in adult human subjects4,5,6. The capacity of thermogenic fat to oxidize substrates and increase energy expenditure has drawn growing interest as a therapeutic approach to tackle obesity and associated metabolic disorders7. BAT thermogenesis requires the release of norepinephrine from local sympathetic axons; norepinephrine activates the β-adrenergic receptor-cAMP-PKA pathway in brown adipocytes to drive lipolysis and thermogenic respiration8. The release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and β3-adrenergic receptor binding to brown adipocytes determine the level of thermogenesis in BAT by regulating the activity of lipases, providing the immediate fuel molecules for BAT mitochondria and heat production8. Recent data indicate that brown adipocytes secrete multiple signaling molecules, named batokines, including FGF21, Myostatin, CXCL14, EPDR1 and adiponectin, among others, which operate as endocrine factors9,10,11,12,13,14. Other batokines work as local autocrine/paracrine factors, as reported for BMP7, BMP8b, NRG4, and S100b15,16,17,18. Regarding the locally-acting factors, some of them are produced by vascular cells, while others are generated by brown adipocytes15,16,17,18. The action of these local factors is highly variable, ranging from effects promoting neurite outgrowth from sympathetic neurons to direct effects on the metabolism of brown adipocytes.

RAP250 (encoded by NCOA6 gene) is a co-activator of nuclear hormone receptors. It also transactivates other transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, CBP, heat shock factor 1, SRF, E2F-1, Rb, NFκβ, and C/EBPα19. RAP250 is also an integral and unique component of a Set1-like complex named ASCOM (for ASC-2 complex), which contains histone H3-Lys-4-methyltransferase (H3K4MT) MLL3 or its paralogue MLL420,21. RAP250 is a pleiotropic modulator that affects growth, development, reproduction, apoptosis, and wound healing22. In addition, it participates in liver metabolism23,24 and modulates insulin secretion in mice and humans25,26, and it is required for white adipogenesis in vitro27. MLL3Δ/Δ mice show decreased adiposity and enhanced insulin sensitivity, although the underlying target tissues were not studied28.

In this work, we focused on the metabolic effects caused by the haploinsufficiency of RAP250. We report that RAP250 modulates the thermogenic activity of BAT in mice. Surprisingly, BAT from RAP250-deficient mice showed enhanced expression of Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), a protein that impacts on the central nervous system29,30,31,32. AAV-mediated expression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells caused metabolic effects leading to a reduction in fat mass and the induction of BAT thermogenic genes. The repression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells disrupted the capacity of these cells to respond to a β-adrenergic receptor agonist.

Based on previous reports indicating that RAP250 regulates metabolic homeostasis23,24,25,26,27,28, we examined whether it plays a relevant role in energy metabolism. To this aim, we monitored the phenotype of male mice heterozygous for RAP250 (RAP250+/) since homozygous knockout mice show prenatal lethality33. Heterozygous mice showed an almost 50% decrease in RAP250 expression in inguinal (ING) adipose tissue, brown (BAT) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig. S1A–F). Control (wild-type, WT) and RAP250+/− male mice showed a similar body weight at 10 weeks of age but later diverged, the latter being leaner, despite increased food intake (Fig. 1A, B). Thirty-week-old male RAP250+/− mice also showed smaller inguinal (ING) and perigonadal (PAT) adipose tissues compared with control animals (Fig. 1C, D). However, no differences in heart, skeletal muscle or liver weight were detected (Fig. S1G). We monitored the gain of adipose tissue volume by microCT in several sets of male mice. Data revealed that the differences in the size of subcutaneous and visceral depots (the latter defined as the sum of omental, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and perigonadal depots) were fully established at 30 weeks of age and were maintained thereafter (Fig. 1E–G). In keeping with a reduced adipose mass, male RAP250+/− mice showed a markedly reduced adipose cell size (Fig. 1H, I) and low plasma leptin levels (Fig. 1J). Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− male mice (Fig. 1K), thereby suggesting no changes in cellularity. Thirty-seven-week-old but not thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice showed a reduced body weight compared to controls (Fig. S1H). ING or PAT adipose depots were also reduced in female RAP250+/− mice at the age of 37 weeks (Fig. S1I). Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− female mice (Fig. S1J).

Next, we analyzed the response of RAP250+/− mice to a high-fat diet (HFD). Male mice subjected to a 60% fat diet gained body weight throughout the experiment (Fig. S2A), and RAP250+/− mice consistently remained leaner than control counterparts (Fig. S2A) under conditions in which food intake was similar in both genotypes (Fig. S2B). HFD-treated RAP250+/− mice also showed a smaller visceral fat depot (Fig. S2C) and lower plasma leptin levels compared to control animals (Fig. S2D). Female RAP250+/− mice also showed a lower body weight and reduced adipose depots after a HFD (Fig. S2E and F). These data reveal that male and female RAP250+/− mice are resistant to HFD-induced obesity.

Upon fasting, male RAP250+/− mice showed normal levels of plasma glucose, adiponectin and free fatty acids, and reduced concentrations of plasma insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol on a normal diet (ND) (Fig. 2A, B, and Table S1). Administration of a HFD for 20 weeks caused high plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin in control male mice, but concentrations remained within the normal range in RAP250+/− counterparts (Fig. 2C, D). Studies performed in 30-week-old male RAP250+/− mice on a standard diet showed improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin secretion compared to control mice (Fig. 2E and F). Glucose tolerance was also improved in male RAP250+/− mice fed with HFD (Fig. 2G), and under these conditions, plasma insulin was markedly attenuated (Fig. 2H).

C Fasting plasma glucose (n = 12) and D insulin levels (WT n = 10 and RAP250+/− n = 12) of 30-week-old male mice under a high-fat diet (HFD). E Plasma glucose (time 0 to 60 min WT n = 23 and RAP250+/− n = 22; time 90 and 120 WT n = 15 and RAP250+/− n = 14) and F insulin profiles (time 0 to 30 min WT n = 14 and RAP250+/− n = 13; time 60 WT n = 5 and RAP250+/− n = 5)) upon glucose tolerance test (2 mg/kg) in male mice on a normal diet. G Plasma glucose (WT n = 13 and RAP250+/− n = 12) and H insulin profiles (WT n = 13 and RAP250+/− n = 10) under glucose tolerance test (2 mg/kg) in male mice after 16 weeks on a HFD (n = 12). I Whole-body glucose turnover (Turnover), hepatic glucose production (HGP), whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), whole-body glycolysis rate (Glycolysis), and whole-body glycogen synthesis rate (Glycogen synthesis) were measured in a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (1.5 mU/kg/min insulin) in 30-week-old male mice (n = 9 for WT and n = 8 for RAP250+/−). J Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained paraffin slices of liver after 20 weeks of a HFD (scale bar=200 µm), and (K) Liver fat content as % of low density area (Lipid Droplets) over total histology slice area (n = 5, 25 slices per group). Data are MEAN+/− SEM. Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B, C, D, F, I and K) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (E, G, and H). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Female RAP250+/− mice showed no changes in plasma glucose or insulin under a standard diet or HFD (Fig. S3A, B). Thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice subjected to either a standard diet or HFD also showed enhanced glucose tolerance in the absence of changes in plasma insulin levels (Fig. S3C–F).

The impact of RAP250 deficiency on whole-body glucose utilization was also monitored in conscious male mice on a normal diet during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (Fig. 2I). Under hyperinsulinemia, RAP250+/− mice showed an increase in whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), glucose turnover (Turnover), whole-body glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis rate (Fig. 2I). Thus, these animals were indeed more insulin-sensitive than control mice. Moreover, hepatic steatosis induced by the HFD was prevented in RAP250+/− male mice, as reflected by large differences in hepatic fat deposition (Fig. 2J and K). In all, this pattern of changes suggests that RAP250+/− mice of both sexes show improved glucose tolerance as a consequence of the improved insulin sensitivity, which occurs even in the absence of changes in adiposity.

We next questioned whether the reduced adiposity detected in RAP250+/− mice derives from a higher rate of energy expenditure, thereby explaining a lower fat content and a parallel increased food intake. Indeed, RAP250+/− mice showed improved whole-body O2 consumption and CO2 production, as shown by ANCOVA analysis (Fig. 3A and S4A). Energy expenditure, glucose oxidation, and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were also increased (Fig. 3B, C, S4B and C). This enhancement occurred in the absence of alterations in ambulation (Fig. S4D). Exposure of control and RAP250+/− mice to a HFD for 20 weeks maintained most of the alterations detected under a standard diet, such as increased O2 consumption, CO2 production, energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation (Fig. S4E–H), and again, no changes in locomotor activity were detected (Fig. S4I).

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (A, D, E, G, I, J, L and N) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (C). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Given these observations, we explored the involvement of BAT in this phenotype. Interscapular BAT mass was reduced in RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3D), and glucose oxidation was markedly enhanced in isolated brown adipocytes obtained from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3E). In addition, histological examination revealed less accumulation of lipids and a smaller lipid droplet size in RAP250-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 3F and G). Additional histological analyses using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, to label the cell surface), DAPI (to label the nuclei), and anti-UCP1 antibody (to measure the differentiation state of adipocytes) were performed in BAT sections. Triple staining showed an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from RAP250+/− mice, consistent with an enhanced metabolic activity (Fig. 3H and J). In addition, data showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3H and I). In contrast, no differences in adipose cell size were detected in ING fat (Fig. S4J and K). Electron microscopy also revealed the presence of larger mitochondria in brown adipose cells in these mice (Fig. S4L and M).

To further study the alterations in BAT caused by RAP250 deficiency, we performed RNA-Seq analysis. More than 500 genes were significantly upregulated and more than 330 were downregulated in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3K). In keeping with the RNA-seq analysis, the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic genes such as Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Dio2, Ppargc1a, and Ucp1 was markedly increased in RAP250-deficient BAT, as determined by real-time PCR assays (Fig. 3L). In addition, the abundance of proteins PPARγ, C/EBPα and UCP1 was increased in brown adipose tissue from RAP250+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3M and N). In all, these data highly support the view that BAT is metabolically more active in RAP250-deficient mice compared to control, and that it may contribute to enhanced energy expenditure in response to RAP250 deficiency.

Our data indicate that RAP250 is a negative regulator of BAT metabolism in mice. In order to further analyze this, we studied the impact of cold exposure on the BAT expression of RAP250. Exposure for 8 h to cold (4 °C) induced the expression of genes Ucp1, Ppargca1, and Pde3b, and this was accompanied by a marked repression of RAP250 gene expression (Fig. S5A). In parallel to these observations, exposure of brown adipocytes for 2 h in the presence of IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induced Rgs2 and reduced RAP250 (Fig. S5B). This suggests that RAP250 participates in the activation of thermogenesis of brown adipocytes during cold and that the response is mediated by cAMP. In addition, RAP250 heterozygous mice showed a greater induction of Ucp1 mRNA levels in BAT in response to cold exposure (Fig. S5C). Under these conditions a greater induction of glucose oxidation was also detected in RAP250+/− mice during cold (Fig. S5D).

Next, we addressed whether local alterations in BAT were sufficient to induce some of the metabolic alterations detected in RAP250+/− mice. To repress RAP250 in interscapular brown adipose, we injected adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding shRNAs directed against RAP250, under H1 promoter, into the BAT of 2 month-old C57Bl/6 J mice (control mice were injected with AAVs encoding a scramble sequence). The injection of shRAP250 AAVs into this tissue reduced RAP250 expression (Fig. 4A and B), and this led to a significant decrease in body weight (Fig. 4C) and fat mass up to 10 weeks after the injection (Fig. 4D). In addition, shRAP250-injected mice showed enhanced glucose oxidation (Fig. 4E) and an improved respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Fig. 4F). The expression of UCP1 protein was also enhanced in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 4G). Under these conditions, plasma leptin levels remained unaltered (Fig. 4H).

In parallel studies, the perigonadal (epididymal) adipose tissue depots of 2 month-old C57Bl/6J male mice were injected with shRAP250- or scramble RNA-encoding AAVs. Data indicate that shRAP250 AAV administration reduced RAP250 expression in adipose tissue by 50% (Fig. S6A and B) 24 weeks after AAV injection. Under these conditions, body weight and total fat mass or perigonadal adipose depots were not altered in the RAP250-deficient group (Fig. S6C–E). RAP250 deficiency in WAT depots did not alter RER or glucose oxidation (Fig. S6F and G). Plasma leptin levels were not altered upon PAT gene manipulation (Fig. S6H). Based on our data, we propose that selective repression of RAP250 in BAT is the main driver that leads to alterations in energy expenditure that resemble those detected in RAP250+/− mice.

Next, we examined whether the metabolic profile of RAP250+/− mice was modified upon exposure to thermoneutral conditions, i.e., upon inactivation of BAT metabolic activity. Thus, control and RAP250+/− mice were housed at 30 °C for 14 weeks (starting at 8 weeks of age). Half the mice were fed a standard chow diet (TN-ND), while the other half received a HFD (TN-HFD), which enhances thermogenic activity due to the high amount of fat34,35. RAP250+/− mice subjected to thermoneutrality and a standard diet did not show alterations in body weight (Fig. 4I) or total fat mass (Fig. 4K). In contrast, RAP250+/− mice subjected to a HFD had a lower body weight (Fig. 4J) and a marked reduction of fat mass (Fig. 4K). Under these conditions, the weight of BAT was only reduced in RAP250+/− mice upon a HFD (Fig. 4L). Tissue sections revealed unaltered adipose cell size in mice on a standard diet (Fig. 4M and 4O) but a reduced adipose cell size in the RAP250+/− group upon treatment with a HFD (Fig. 4N and 4O). These studies provide further evidence that BAT plays a major role in the alterations in energy metabolism of RAP250+/− mice.

To explore the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced metabolic activity of BAT under RAP250 deficiency, we focused on the differentially expressed gene sets detected in RNA-seq assays (Fig. S7A). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in the action potential of neurons in RAP250-deficient BAT (Figs. 5A, and S7A), and an enhanced expression of the neurotrophic factor Neuritin 1 (Nrn1) and not for others as Nrg4, Ngf, Bdnf and S100b (Fig. 5B). In keeping with these data, RAP250-deficient BAT showed an enhanced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), suggesting an increased sympathetic innervation17 (Fig. 5C and D). In keeping with this, cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics detected an increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 5E). This is relevant since sympathetic nerve fibers innervating BAT are predominantly non-myelinated Schwann cells, and they play a key role in neurotransmission, allowing rapid norepinephrine release to stimulate thermogenesis36,37. This type of analysis also revealed an increased abundance of myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. S7B).

Analysis of western blot and real-time PCR validated the increased expression of Nrn1 in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 5F–H). The increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA was detected in BAT from RAP250+/− mice aged between 2 and 6 months (Fig. 5H). Nrn1 mRNA was more enriched in brown adipocytes compared to the expression detected in the stromal vascular fraction obtained from BAT, similarly to was detected for UCP1 or RAP250 (Fig. S7C–E). AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT also caused an increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 5I and J). In contrast, AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in perigonadal adipose tissue did not alter the expression of Nrn1 (Fig. S7F). Exposure of mice to thermoneutrality abrogated the stimulation of Nrn1 mRNA levels in BAT (Fig. 5K), in keeping with the absence of changes in fat mass.

In separate studies, we analyzed the expression of Nrn1 in mouse brown adipose cells during adipogenesis. Nrn1 mRNA was substantially expressed in preadipocytes and it underwent a two-fold increase in adipocytes under conditions in which UCP1 was markedly induced (Fig. 5L). In contrast, the expression of Nrn1 protein was not detectable in preadipocytes and was markedly induced during brown adipogenesis (Fig. 5M). Nrn1 was detected as 15 kDa and 12 kDa bands and it is likely that the former is an unprocessed form of the protein. Nrn1 protein was also detected in culture media from brown adipocytes, suggesting that it was secreted. Moreover, the secretion was rapidly stimulated in response to isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 5N). In all, our data indicate that Nrn1 is expressed and secreted by brown adipose cells and that its expression is markedly enhanced in response to brown adipogenesis.

We next tested whether Nrn1 expression in thermogenic adipose cells had metabolic effects in mice. To this end, control mice subjected to a normal diet were treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Thirty weeks after the AAV administration, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a 3-fold greater expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein in BAT whereas no changes in expression were detected in ING adipose tissue (Fig. 6A, and S8A). Plasma levels of Nrn1 were detectable but no differences were found between control and Nrn1-treated groups (Fig. S8B). Under these conditions, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower body weight and lower fat mass (Fig. 6B and C) in the absence of alterations in lean mass (Fig. 6D). Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, CO2 production and glucose oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 6E, F, S8C and D). Under these conditions, food intake but not ambulation was enhanced (Fig. 6G, and S8E). AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides, normal glycemia, and a trend for reduced leptin levels (Fig. S8F–H).

Sections of BAT revealed reduced size of brown adipose cells and lipid droplets upon Nrn1 treatment (Fig. 6H, and I). Triple staining of BAT section showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 6J and K). In addition, an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from Nrn1 mice was also detected (Fig. 6J and L). In all, these data suggest an enhanced BAT metabolism and thermogenesis upon Nrn1 expression.

In keeping with this view, we detected an increased expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the AAV-Nrn1-treated group (Fig. 6M), and also an enhanced expression of phosphorylated HSL, active PKA, UCP1 (Fig. 6N and O). We also detected that chronic overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipocytes enhanced the expression of OXPHOS subunits relevant in respiratory complexes I and II but not for CV (Fig. S8I and J). The Nrn1 group also showed a reduction in adipose cell size in visceral and subcutaneous depots (Fig. S8K and L).

Mice subjected to a HFD were also treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Nrn1-treated mice showed increased Nrn1 gene expression in BAT and ING adipose tissue (Fig. 7A), and no differences in plasma levels were detected between groups (Fig. S9A). AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower rate of body weight and fat mass gain compared to control mice (Fig. 7B and C) in the absence of alterations in lean mass (Fig. S9B). Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and lipid oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 7D, E, and S9C). Under these conditions, food intake was not altered (Fig. S9D), and nocturnal ambulation was enhanced in these mice (Fig. S9E). These mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides and leptin, and normal glycemia (Fig. S9F–H). We also detected an enhanced expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the Nrn1 group (Fig. 7F).

As we found that enhanced Nrn1 expression activates brown adipose tissue, we next analyzed the mechanisms involved. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq assays using BAT samples from AAV-Nrn1-treated and control mice. 218 genes were significantly upregulated and 249 were downregulated by Nrn1 expression (p < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enhanced abundance of Hallmark Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Adipogenesis pathways in response to chronic NRN1 (Fig. 7G and H). Analysis of GO Cellular Compartment GSEA revealed that most of the genes upregulated were mitochondrial (encoding for mitochondrial proteins) (Fig. 7I). The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. Our data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure (Fig. 7J). These data indicate the existence of common processes operating in Nrn1 overexpressing BAT and upon cold exposure.

We performed cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics from control and Nrn1 overexpressing BAT tissues, and we detected and increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells (Fig. 7K), which was parallel to an increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 7L and M). Moreover, a reduced abundance of myelinated Schwann cells was also detected (Fig. S9I). In all, these data indicate a sympathetic remodeling in BAT by Nrn1 involved an increased proliferation of non-myelinated Schwann cells.

To further analyze whether Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we repressed Nrn1 in primary brown preadipocytes using lentiviruses encoding shRNA (Fig. 8A). These cells showed a normal differentiation and the expression of protein markers such as PPARγ2, PPARγ1, UCP1 and HSL was indistinguishable from that observed in control adipocytes (Fig. 8B and S9J). Given these observations, we monitored the acute stimulatory response of brown adipocytes to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol39. Isoproterenol activated the phosphorylation of HSL and other PKA substrates in control brown adipocytes (Fig. 8C–E). This activation was markedly reduced in Nrn1-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 8C–E). Isoproterenol also induced crucial genes, such as Ppargc1a and Ucp1, in control cells (Fig. 8F, and G). This process was largely repressed in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. 8F and G). We also analyzed the effects of Nrn1 deficiency on mitochondrial respiration in brown adipocytes. In control brown adipocytes, mitochondrial respiration was reduced upon addition of oligomycin, and isoproterenol increased mitochondrial respiration to values close to those measured in the presence of FCCP (maximal respiration) (Fig. 8H). Depletion of Nrn1 reduced the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration, and also maximal mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 8H). Under these conditions basal respiration or ATP-coupled respiration were unaltered in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. 8I). The reduced response to isoproterenol was not a consequence of changes in the expression of β3-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 8J and K). In all, these results indicate that Nrn1 protein is synthesized by brown adipocytes and that it can modulate the metabolism of brown adipocytes and their capacity to respond to catecholamines.

To analyze whether extracellularly present Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we have expressed and purified mouse recombinant NRN1 to homogeneity (Fig. 8L). Next, we incubated brown adipocytes with recombinant NRN1 (100 ng/ml). Short-term incubation with recombinant NRN1 enhanced the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates in brown adipocytes (Fig. 8M). In addition, NRN1 caused a marked induction of Ucp1 and Ppargc1a gene expression in brown adipocytes (Fig. 8N and O). NRN1 also increased the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 8P). Long-term incubation of brown adipocytes with NRN1 enhanced the expression of NDUFB8 subunit of the respiratory complex I (Fig. 8Q and R). These results clearly reveal a thermogenic effect of extracellular NRN1 in brown adipocytes, and further suggest that NRN1 has the capacity to act as an autocrine/paracrine factor in brown adipose tissue.

The results reported here support the following highlights: a) RAP250 protein is a key component of energy homeostasis and it modulates BAT metabolism; b) RAP250 deficiency in brown adipose cells induces the expression of Nrn1, a factor until now unknown as a regulator of BAT biology; c) AAV-mediated overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells improves energy expenditure and stimulates BAT metabolism; d) Nrn1 repression disrupts the metabolism of brown adipocytes, an observation that indicates an autonomous cellular response; and e) exogenous mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue.

Our findings reveal that RAP250 plays a key role in maintaining energy metabolism and adiposity in mice. We demonstrate that RAP250 deficiency upregulates energy metabolism, reduces adiposity, and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice. In addition, we found that global RAP250 deficiency in these animals stimulates BAT metabolism and that local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT reduces adiposity and enhances global glucose oxidation and BAT UCP1 expression. In addition, we document that RAP250 expression is markedly attenuated in BAT in response to cold, and is also reduced in brown adipocytes by phosphodiesterase inhibitors suggesting a regulatory role of cAMP. Based on all these data, we propose that RAP250 regulates energy metabolism, most likely through the modulation of the metabolic activity of BAT. In keeping with these data, many common variants of RAP250 show a very strong association with hip circumference-adjusted BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NCOA6)40 (Fig. S9). This observation points to the participation of RAP250 in human metabolism.

Our data indicate that RAP250 deficiency causes leanness in mice as a result of increased BAT metabolism and energy expenditure. We are aware of different studies indicating that

RAP250 plays a key role in white adipogenesis under in vitro conditions27. Thus, the transcriptional activity of PPARγ is impaired in RAP250 KO mouse embryo fibroblasts27,41,42, and these cells are refractory to PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis27. Future studies are required to proof that RAP250 indeed controls in vivo white adipogenesis. RAP250 also regulates liver metabolism, and its inactivation disrupts hepatic lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity23,24,43. This combined set of changes explains the phenotype of RAP250-deficient mice, namely reduced gain of adiposity and lack of ectopic fat deposition in tissues under conditions of nutritional overload.

The enhanced energy expenditure of RAP250+/− mice was linked to greater glucose oxidation under a normal diet and to increased lipid oxidation upon HFD conditions. Moreover, these animals showed an enhanced BAT metabolism that was characterized by large transcriptomic alterations, increased glucose oxidation, improved mitochondrial respiration, high expression of key genes Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Ppargc1a, Ucp1 and Dio2, and increased expression of proteins UCP1, PPARγ and C/EBPα. Two additional experimental findings revealed that BAT plays a major primary role in the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice. Thus, local repression of RAP250 protein mediated by the injection of AAV shRAP250 particles into the interscapular BAT depot of wild-type mice phenocopied many of the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice, including reduced body weight, lower fat mass, and enhanced glucose oxidation. These effects were specific to RAP250 repression in BAT, because a similar genetic manipulation of RAP250 in PAT did not have metabolic consequences. A second observation came from the exposure of RAP250-deficient mice to thermoneutrality, which inactivates BAT thermogenesis. Under these conditions, marginal or no differences in body weight, fat mass or glucose tolerance were detectable between control and RAP250+/− mice. Moreover, the combination of thermoneutrality and a HFD, the latter enhancing the thermogenic activity of BAT35,44, maintained the differences in body weight, fat mass, and glucose tolerance normally appearing in RAP250-deficient mice. In all, our data strongly support the view that RAP250 modulates energy expenditure through the regulation of BAT activity in such a way that primary changes in BAT function lead to alterations in adiposity.

Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), originally termed candidate plasticity-related gene 15 or Cpg15, was identified as a gene induced by the glutamate analogue kainate in the hippocampus dentate gyrus30. Nrn1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuropeptide expressed in postmitotic neurons and it regulates synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, and neuronal migration and survival29,31,32,45,46,47. It is also involved in memory and learning48. Moreover, Nrn1 operates in cells other than neurons. In this regard, it is also produced by follicular regulatory T cells, and it acts on B cells to suppress autoantibody development against tissue-specific antigens49. In addition, this protein is expressed in tissues such as the placenta, lung and spleen50. In this study, we have identified that Nrn1 is synthesized in BAT and induced in RAP250-deficient conditions. Our data support the notion that Nrn1 plays a key role in BAT metabolism.

In this study, we document that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT under conditions of RAP250 deficiency. Given the observation that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT upon local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression, we support the notion that RAP250 locally modulates Nrn1 gene expression in BAT. Moreover, we document that Nrn1 is abundantly expressed in brown adipocytes and that its expression is regulated during differentiation state at translational or post-translational levels. As RAP250 participates in COMPASS-related complexes containing the H3K4 methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL420,21,51, we propose that RAP250 repression drives epigenetic changes, thus causing an enhanced expression of Nrn1. The intricacy of those complexes is high, and MLL3 and MLL4 induce monomethylation of H3K4 at enhancer regions, whereas another enzyme in MLL3 and MLL4 COMPASS, namely UTX, demethylates H3K27me3, a modification associated with transcription repression by the Polycomb group of proteins52,53.

Here, we also demonstrate that Nrn1 expressed in brown adipose cells causes the local activation of BAT metabolism and thermogenesis. Thus, the expression of Nrn1 in thermogenic adipose cells causes the activation of energy expenditure under normal conditions or upon an HFD. Under these conditions, we also detected a reduction in body weight gain. This occurred in parallel to an enhanced expression of BAT metabolic genes, including Prdm16, Ppargc1a, Cidea, Cpt1a, Hsl, and Dio2. RNA-Seq assays revealed the existence of a metabolic reprogramming in response to chronic NRN1 expression in BAT characterized by the induction of mitochondrial genes and also genes relevant in adipose cell differentiation. The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. In all, these data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure.

The effects of Nrn1 in BAT seem to be largely local. In this regard, the changes in energy expenditure or in BAT gene expression detected upon overexpression of Nrn1 in BAT occurred in the absence of alterations in the plasma levels of Nrn1. At a cellular level, Nrn1 seems to operate through an autocrine/paracrine mode of action. In this context, we detected that Nrn1 is secreted from brown adipocytes and that this secretion is significantly enhanced in the presence of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. In addition, we found that Nrn1 repression in brown adipose cells does not alter differentiation, but it markedly reduces the response to isoproterenol. Nrn1 groups with local-acting factors, such as BMP8b, which are secreted by brown adipocytes and activate BAT metabolism16,54. Interestingly, some common variants of the Nrn1 gene show a very strong association with BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NRN1), which suggests that Nrn1 participates in human metabolism.

Interestingly, incubation of brown adipocytes with mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue. The specific receptors for NRN1 have not been definitively identified. To date, no canonical, high-affinity cell surface receptor has been unequivocally demonstrated55. Moreover, NRN1 is not part of a known ligand family like neurotrophins or FGFs, and it does not display any conserved domain homologous to these or other classical signaling molecules56. Several studies have proposed indirect mechanisms or potential receptor candidates for NRN1. For instance, cross-talk between NRN1 and insulin signaling has been observed, suggesting that neuritin may enhance or depend on insulin receptor pathways for its effects57. Notably, pharmacological blockade of the insulin receptor, but not the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, abrogated these effects, indicating a specific involvement of the insulin receptor in neuritin signaling. In addition, there is evidence that neuritin interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) to mediate axonal branching in granule neurons. Immunoprecipitation assays have revealed a strong association between neuritin and FGFR1, and inhibition or knockdown of FGFR1 significantly suppressed neuritin-induced axonal branching, suggesting that FGFR1 plays a critical role in neuritin's effects on neuronal development58. Regarding downstream signaling, activation of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways has been observed following neuritin 1 treatment, consistent with its role in promoting cell survival and growth57,59. It is also likely that Nrn1-receptor complex undergoes internalization, which may be relevant in further signaling49.

In our study, we further demonstrate that neuritin 1 can rapidly activate protein kinase A signaling in brown adipocytes. Altogether, these findings suggest that neuritin 1 acts pleiotropically, modulating multiple pathways depending on the cellular context. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its actions remain to be fully elucidated and warrant dedicated investigation.

On the basis of our findings, we conclude that Nrn1 is a key regulator of brown adipocytes, it performs trophic actions, and it preserves the capacity to respond to catecholamines, a crucial physiological characteristic of brown adipocytes. We do not exclude the possibility that Nrn1 exerts a neurotropic action in BAT. In fact, Nrn1 overexpression caused an increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression and enhanced abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in BAT, supporting a role on sympathetic innervation in this tissue. Given the properties of Nrn1, it emerges as a potentially useful protein for targeting energy expenditure in humans.

RAP250 heterozygous mice, with a null mutation in the RAP250 gene, were used in this study42. Briefly, exons 7 and 8 were replaced with the neo gene which is flanked by a 5-kb homologous region on each side42. All animal work was conducted following the guidelines established by the Animal Care Committees of the “Parc Científic de Barcelona” and the University of Barcelona.

Heterozygous female mice were crossed either with C57BL/6J male or heterozygous male mice to obtain control and heterozygous littermates. Mice were kept under a 12 h dark/light cycle and provided a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. For the high-fat diet (HFD) experiments, 10-week-old male mice were fed a standard diet or HFD for 15–20 weeks (10% or 60% calories from fat, D12492 and D12450B; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Animals were fasted for 16 h (17:00–9:00) in glucose tolerance and glucose turnover tests. In thermoneutrality experiments, 8-week-old mice were kept for 22 weeks at 30 °C either under a standard chow diet or HFD. Mice were kindly gifted by the Mouse Mutant Core Facility at IRB Barcelona.

At the times indicated in figure legends, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Interscapular BAT (BAT), Perigonadal Adipose Tissue (PAT), Inguinal adipose tissue (ING), liver, gastrocnemius and heart were collected and used for RNA purification, protein extraction, or histology. Plasma was obtained by cardiac punction. All animal experiments were done in compliance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Barcelona Science Park and University of Barcelona (Protocol number 9279, approved by the Department of Territory and Sustainability, General Directorate of Environmental Policies and the Natural Environment, Government of Catalonia).

Single-stranded AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were generated and produced by the “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” (www.viralvector.eu) at the UAB. The sequence used to repress RAP250 was 5'-ACACATACCTCAGAACATA-3'. AAV-UCP1 empty and AAV-UCP1-Nrn1 vectors were generated by Vector Biosystems and produced by “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” at the UAB. The Vector plasmid pAAV-UCP1-m-Nrn1 contains the mouse Neuritin 1 (1-142Aa) including the signal peptide and C-terminal GPI.

The AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were administered as reported60. For BAT infection, 1 × 1010 of the total viral genome (vg) of AAV9 Scr or Sh was administered (4 × 10 μl of viral solution) per BAT depot to 8-week-old male mice. For PAT infection, 1 × 1011 of the total vg of AAV9 Scr or Sh was administered (50 μl of viral solution) to each PAT depot of 10-week-old male mice.

In Nrn1 protein overexpression experiments, 1.5 × 1012 of the total viral genome (vg) was intravascularly administered (by tail) to 8-week-old C57BL6J male mice. For HFD experiments, the diet was changed the day after the infection.

Mice were placed individually in metabolic cages and acclimatised for 24 h before measuring food intake over four consecutive days. Feeding was accessed by evaluating the food remaining in a 24-h period.

Blood samples were collected between 10:00 and 12:00 either after an overnight fast or under fed conditions; they were obtained by tail vein snip of unrestrained mice. Plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until assay. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were determined using the UltraSensitive Mouse Insulin Elisa Kit and Mouse Leptin Elisa Kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove IL, USA); adiponectin with the Quantikine Adiponectin kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA); and cholesterol and triglycerides with BioSystems Kits (Costa Brava, Spain). Blood glucose was assayed with an Accu-Chek glucose monitor and reactive strips (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) directly in blood drops from conscious mice.

were performed as described in ref. 61. Blood was collected, and glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at different time points.

The mice were fasted for 6 h before the infusions. The animals were connected to the infusion apparatus 2 h before the start of the infusions and had free access to water. Whole-body glucose utilization rate was determined under euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions. Under physiological hyperinsulinemic conditions, insulin was infused at a rate of 4 mU/kg·min for 3 h, and D-[3H]3-glucose at a rate of 30 μCi/kg·min. Throughout the infusion, blood glucose was determined from blood samples (3.5 μL) collected from the tip of the tail vein with a blood glucose meter when needed. Euglycemia was maintained by periodically adjusting a variable infusion of 10% or 16.5% glucose. Plasma glucose concentrations and D-[3H]3-glucose-specific activity were determined in 5 μL of blood sampled from the tip of the tail vein every 10 min during the last hour of the infusion, as reported62.

Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine by i.p. injection and positioned face down, with both legs fully extended, in a SkyScan 1076 high-resolution micro-CT scanner (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) mouse bed. 360° scans of the abdominal region were made at a rotation step of 0.8° and an isotropic voxel size of 35 μm; Source 50 kV/200 µA and 1.0 mm aluminium filter. Scans were reconstructed and analyzed using the NRecon and CTAn software provided by SkysScan. The region of interest (ROI) for each animal was defined based on skeletal landmarks from the gray-scale reconstructed images (between femoral head and L5 vertebra). Data are expressed as percentage of fat on a ROI: Fat Volume/ Total ROI Volume X 10063. Fat mass was also measured using magnetic resonance with EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer.

An indirect calorimetry system (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments) was used to measure oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), and ambulation. The experiment included two days of acclimation and a third day (24 h) of valid data recording. Average RER index (VCO2 ml/h produced/VO2 ml/h consumed); Energy Expenditure (Kcal/h/Kg) [defined as VO2x(3.815 + 1.232xRER)/1000]; Glucose Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [(4.545xVCO2)-(3.205xVO2)] /1000]; and Lipid Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [1.672x(VO2-VCO2)]/1000] were calculated from VO2 and VCO2 data. To remove variance in metabolic parameters derived from differences in body weight between animals, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. ANCOVA is a robust method to compare groups with divergent body weights and composition64,65. For data obtained in mice on a normal diet, values of O2 consumption and CO2 production were referred to an adjusted mean body weight of 25.8071 g determined with ANCOVA, using body weight as a covariate in WT and RAP250 male mice in normal diet. In acute cold exposure studies, a Sable Systems Promethion Core was used. In these studies, mice were acclimated to the cages during 4 days at 22 °C and subjected to 4 °C during 8 hours. Mice were sacrificed and brown adipose tissues were collected.

Mouse body composition was measured using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance with the EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer.

Glucose oxidation was determined using radioactive glucose (D-[U]-14C-glucose, Amersham Biosciences).

30-week-old male mice were killed by cervical dislocation; BAT was harvested and kept in cold Washing Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA (Albumin bovine serum, fraction V, minimum 96% lyophilized)), until further processing. BAT samples were then transferred to Digestion Buffer (KRBH solution, 3.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 mg/ml glucose (D(+)- glucose anhydrous), 1 mg/ml Collagenase type II from Clostridium histolyticum), at a ratio of 10 ml Digestion Buffer per gram of tissue. They were then mechanically minced and allowed to digest at 37 °C and under 250 rpm shaking for 30'−1 h. Undigested material was discarded by using a 100-μm strainer. The BAT digestion solution was diluted (to lower collagenase activity) and used directly. For glucose oxidation, 0.5 ml adipocyte solution was incubated for 4 h with 0.5 ml Oxidation Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA, 5 mmol/L glucose, 1 μCi/mL (D-[U]-14C-glucose) in 6-well plates, and CO2 was collected as in ref. 61. Data are expressed as nmol of glucose/h corrected by DNA content. Glucose oxidation from wild-type tissues was used as 100% value.

Approximately 1-mm3 pieces of BAT were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer. The protocol is described in ref. 66. Sections were observed under a JEM-1010 electron microscope (Jeol, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera SIS Megaview III and the AnalySIS software.

BAT, adipose tissue depots and liver were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in methanol and then paraffin-embedded. Sections were subjected to standard Hematoxylin/Eosin (HE) staining. Images were acquired with a NanoZoomer-2.0 HT C9600 digital scanner (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France) equipped with a 20X objective and coupled to a mercury lamp unit L11600-05 and using NDP.scan2.5 software U10074-03 (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France). Adipocyte area was measured using open software ImageJ (W. Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Liver fat content was estimated from HE-stained slides using the CTAn software (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). DAPI/Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)/UCP1 staining was performed as reported67.

RNA from various tissues was extracted using a protocol combining TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNAeasy® minikit columns (Qiagen. Alameda, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript RTII kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Ca, USA). PCRs were performed using the ABI Prism 7900 HT real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA), or Taqman Master Mix. The thermal protocol was 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15'/95 °C–60'/60 °C. All measurements for mouse mRNA were normalized to Arp. For each designed primer set, a melting curve of PCR products was performed to verify unspecific amplification or primer-dimer formation. The results were analyzed with the system SDS software. The primers used are specified in Table S2.

Total DNA was extracted from mouse interscapular BAT, inguinal subcutaneous Adipose tissue (SAT) and perigonadal adipose tissue (PAT). Tissue was digested with proteinase K (Merck Life Science S.L.U., 03115801001) and total DNA was purified using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504). Total cellular DNA (1 ng DNA) is used as a template and is amplified with specific primers for Cox2 gene, as a mitochondrial gene (Cox2f: CTACAAGACGCCACAT and Cox2r: GAGAGGGGAGAGCAAT) and for Sdha gene, as a nuclear gene (Sdhaf: TACTACAGCCCCAAGTCT, Sdhar: TGGACCCATCTTCTATGC) by Real-Time PCR using SYBRGreen. The ratio genomic-nuclear DNA/ mtDNA was calculated.

The concentration of total RNA in preparations was quantified with Nanodrop One (Thermo Fisher), and RNA integrity was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA Nano assay (Agilent). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared at IRB Barcelona's Functional Genomics Core Facility. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from 1.2 μg of total RNA using the kit NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). NGS libraries for RNA-seq were prepared from the purified mRNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Seven (WT/RAP250) and eight (Control/UCP1-NRN1) cycles of PCR amplification were applied to all libraries. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) and quality controlled with the Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA HS assay (Agilent), for WT/RAP250 BAT, and Tapestation HS D5000 assay (Agilent) for Control/NRN1 BAT.

For WT/RAP250 BAT RNA-seq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to sequencing at the Centre for Genomic Regulation. A final qPCR quality control was performed before sequencing in one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequencing output was 270 million 50-bp single-end reads, and at least 28 million reads were obtained for all samples.

For Control/UCP1 BAT RNAseq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to paired-end 150 nt sequencing on a NovaSeq6000 S4 (Illumina). More than 121 Gbp of reads were produced, with a minimum of 39 million of paired-end reads per sample.

FastQ files were aligned against the Mus musculus mm10 genome with STAR 2.5.2b68 using default options. Aligned reads were used to obtain raw counts at mm10 NCBI RefSeq gene level using featureCounts from Rsubread version 1.32.469 with options minMQS=1. DESeq2 1.22.270 was used to find differentially expressed genes in KO vs WT. Genes were selected as differentially expressed with thresholds |FC| > 1.5 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P < 0.1. For functional enrichment analysis (GSEA), regularized log transformation (rlog) was applied to read counts using DESeq2 and rotation gene set testing using the maxmean statistic was performed71. For cell type deconvolution analyses, the DWLS algorithm (https://github.com/dtsoucas/DWLS) was used with reference single cell data obtained from ref. 72. All analyses were performed in R-3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2018).

Immortalized brown preadipocytes were generated as described in refs. 67,73. Retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40 LT-Puro antigen was purchased from Addgene. Cells were grown in monolayer culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). The differentiation process is described in ref. 67.

Immortalized brown preadipocytes were also used to generate the NRN1 deficiency model. Lentivirus encoding for a shRNA scramble or against Nrn1 (TRCN0000177415 validated clone from Merk), as control (SCR) or knockdown (shNRN1), were produced in HEK 293 T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) as reported74. Transduced cells were selected based on Puromycin resistance (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-108071; 3 μg/ml).

Adipocyes and SVF were obtained as reported75,76.

A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 28-115 inclusive of mouse Neuritin (Accession number NM_153529) was amplified using the following semi-nested primers:

NRN1fwdout gcgtagctgaaaccggccaccatcaccatcaccatgctagcgaaaacctgtattttcagg

NRN1fwdin caccatgctagcgaaaacctgtattttcaggcgggcaagtgtgatgcagtctttaagggc

NRN1rev cggcctcgagcggccgcTTagttgctgctgccgcagagttcgaataagctg

and KOD polymerase. The resulting 343 bp fragment was purified using AMPure (Beckman Coulter) before InFusion (Takara Bio) into KpnI and NotI-cut pOPINTTG77. The resulting construct will produce the following protein when expressed in mammalian cells:

MGILPSPGMPALLSLVSLLSVLLMGCVA ↓ETGHHHHHHASENLYFQ↓AGKCDAVFKGFSDCLLKLGDSMANYPQGLDDKTNIKTVCTYWEDFHSCTVTALTDCQEGAKDMWDKLRKESKNLNIQGSLFELCGSSN*. The protein consists of the µ-phosphatase signal peptide (with signal peptidase site indicated, first ↓, a Hexa-histidine tag and TEV cleavage site (indicated, second ↓) followed by amino acids 28-115 of mouse Neuritin. This protein will be secreted, can be purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and can then be cleaved with TEV protease to produce mature ‘soluble' NRN1 (this construct is truncated to also exclude the GPI-anchored G116).

293-6E cells78 were cultured in shaken flasks in F-17 Freestyle media (Gibco) supplemented with GlutaMax, Poloxamer 188 and G418 (final concentrations of 4 mM, 0.1% and 25 µg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At a density of approximately 2.0 × 106 cells/ml cells were transfected with a 1:4 polyplex of plasmid DNA:PEI MAXX at a concentration of 1 mg plasmid DNA/litre of cells. After 24 h the media was supplemented with sterile TN1 solution (Tryptone N1, TekniScience Inc. to 0.5% w/v in F-17 Freestyle media). After a further 96 hours the media was cleared by pelleting the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g then 5000 g followed filtration through Whatman 3 M paper filters. All further steps were performed at 4 °C.

Urea was added to a final concentration of 4 M and the pH adjusted to pH 7.5 before the sample was applied to a 5 ml Excel IMAC column equilibrated with IMAC Wash Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 4 M, Imidazole 20 mM, DTT 2 mM). His-NRN was eluted with IMAC Elution Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 4 M, Imidazole 500 mM, DTT 2 mM). His-NRN containing fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged to Digest Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 500 mM, Urea 2 M, DTT 2 mM) using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column before the addition of His-tagged TEV protease at a 1:25 His-TEV:His-NRN ratio and incubation overnight at 4 °C.

The TEV-digested sample was first passed through a 1 ml Excel HisTrap column to capture uncut His-NRN and His-TEV before size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Superdex 30 pg 16/600 column equilibrated with Tris pH8 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 6 M, DTT 2 mM, EDTA 2 mM.

Peak fractions were buffer exchanged (as before, using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column) into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use.

Adipocytes (Scr and shNRN1) at day 10 of differentiation were stimulated with Isoproterenol (10 uM) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 2 h. Cells were lysed to obtain RNA or total cell extracts. Media was kept and centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000 × g for 20 min to remove any precipitate and then stored at −20 °C.

For the detection of proteins phosphorylated by PKA (p-PKA substrates) control adipocytes were washed in PBS twice and were incubated during two hours in media without serum. Cells were treated with NRN1 at different concentration during 2 h and then total cell extracts were obtained.

For NRN1 chronic studies, brown adipocytes at day 4 of differentiation were treated with NRN1 at 100 ng/ml in the presence of differentiation medium. NRN1 was maintained during all the process of differentiation.

Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (ROCHE)) for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Tissue samples were homogenized in 10 vol of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] with a disperser homogenizer (Ika Ultra-Turrax® T25basic, S25N-10G probe). Homogenates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C in an orbital shaker and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins from total homogenates were resolved in 8% (RAP250 detection) or 10% acrylamide gels for SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Proteins were detected by the ECL method and quantified by densitometry using Genetools from Syngene or by NIR-fluorescence detected with LI-COR Odyssey System and measured with Image Studio software.

The following antibodies were used: RAP250 (ASC2 antibody BL1874, Bethyl laboratories and NCOA6 polyclonal antibody 25241-1_AP, Proteintech); p-HSL (S563, #4139), HSL (#4107), P-PKA substrates (#9624), βactin (AC-15, SIGMA); α-tubulin (SIGMA); Vinculin (Abcam); GAPDH (2118S, Cell Signaling), UCP1 (ab10983 Abcam); PPARγ and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz); total OXPHOS rodent WB antibody cocktail (ab110413, Abcam), ADRB3 (bs-1063R Bioss Antibodies), NRN1 (B-9 Santa Cruz and AF283 from Biotechne R&D Systems); TH (R&D Systems MAB7566SP and ab6211 from Abcam).

Preadipocytes (Scr/ ShNRN1) were plated, grown and differentiated as it is described in ref. 67 For NRN1 treated cells, recombinant NRN1 protein was added chronically at day 4 of differentiation until d9-d10 at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Media was changed every two days. Seahorse experiments were performed as reported79.

Neuritin 1 (NRN1) ELISA Kit (Catalog No: abx155876, Abbexa) was used to measure Nrn1 from mouse plasma and cell culture media. 75 μl of plasma and 300 μl of culture media were used following a commercial protocol.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed t-Student test, or by two-way ANOVA (Šidak's multiple comparisons test or by an Ordinary two-way ANOVA), or by Covariance (ANCOVA) with weight as the covariate. Significance was established at P < 0.05.

Stripe is funding a new blockchain company called Tempo, co-founder CEO Patrick Collison announced on Thursday. Tempo is aimed at high-volume processing of stablecoins — coins that help reduce crypto's notorious volatility because they are pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. That's not surprising given that Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge.

What is surprising is the eye-popping list of companies Stripe has already enlisted: Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa. So if the blockchain works well, these design partners should be queued up to use or offer it for everything from agentic payments to remittances.

Plus, Stripe board member Matt Huang, co-founder of one of the most prestigious crypto VC firms, Paradigm, has signed on to lead Tempo. Paradigm has also invested. Collison says Tempo will be run as an independent company.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office has rejected Neuralink's attempt to trademark the product names Telepathy and Telekinesis, citing pending applications by another person for the same trademarks.

Neuralink, the brain implant company cofounded by Elon Musk, filed to trademark the names in March. But in letters sent to Neuralink in August, the trademark office is refusing to allow the applications to move forward. It says Wesley Berry, a computer scientist and a cofounder of the tech startup Prophetic, previously filed trademark applications for Telepathy in May 2023 and Telekinesis in August 2024. Prophetic is building a wearable headset to induce lucid dreaming, but only Berry is the author of the trademark applications, not Prophetic. (Berry declined to comment for this story.)

In response to Neuralink's application for Telepathy, the trademark office also references the existing trademark for Telepathy Labs, a Tampa-based company that provides interactive voice and chatbot technology to businesses.

Musk's Neuralink, meanwhile, is developing a brain-computer interface that involves a device, surgically implanted in the skull, that collects brain activity. The company has been using the name Telepathy to describe its first product, which is designed to allow paralyzed people the ability to operate their phones and computers with just their thoughts. Musk unveiled the Telepathy name in a January 2024 social media post, shortly after the company implanted its first volunteer with the technology. A total of nine people now have the Neuralink device, according to a July announcement. (Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment.)

Both Berry and Neuralink filed “intent-to-use” applications, which allow businesses and inventors to reserve trademark rights before using the mark in commerce. Berry's application for Telepathy was accepted in December 2024 and for Telekinesis in August 2025 but the trademarks aren't fully registered until he shows that he's actually using them in commerce. Berry has three years to do that from acceptance, otherwise his applications would be considered abandoned and Neuralink's application would take priority.

Berry has not marketed nor commercialized a product called Telepathy or Telekinesis, but in his trademark applications describes both as “software that analyzes EEG to decode internal dialogue to control computer or mobile devices.” EEG, or electroencephalogram, data refers to the electrical activity of the brain recorded through electrodes worn on the scalp.

The trademark office's letters to Neuralink are not final decisions. Neuralink filed a response letter on August 28 addressing the existing Telepathy Labs trademark, saying that Neuralink's Telepathy product is not likely to be confused with Telepathy Labs. Neuralink did not address Berry's applications in its response.

“The standard for likelihood of confusion is, if a random consumer encountered both of these products, would they think that they're coming from the same company?” says Heather Antoine, an intellectual property partner at Stoel Rives in Sacramento, California.

The trademark office will consider Neuralink's response and decide if there is a likelihood of confusion. But there's still the fact that Berry filed to register the Telepathy and Telekinesis marks first. If Berry succeeds in registering the marks, Neuralink would have a few options. It could attempt to buy the trademarks from Berry or negotiate a consent agreement, in which Berry could agree to allow Neuralink to also use the marks. These types of agreements are usually made when the trademarks are not likely to cause consumer confusion.

If Berry is successful in registering Telepathy, Neuralink could be sued if the company continues to use it.

Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP in Washington, DC, says it's difficult to know how things will shake out because there's a lot of nuance to a trademark claim. “Certainly at the moment, though, advantage goes to this other applicant,” he says, referring to Berry. “He could become a considerable thorn in the side of Neuralink in terms of these trademarks.”

Apple is hosting its new hardware event on September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. The company is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. 

As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that this will be the first of three planned years of major iPhone redesigns, with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.

The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. It's also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera.

It could come in new colors: purple and green.

iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5

The Pro's upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.

Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. 

The iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of around $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially include dark blue and copper.

The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,100. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options.

While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event, a leak showed “TechWoven” iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap.

The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. 

This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It'll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. 

This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.

While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the renders we've seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also rumors that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.

The battery life of the device is uncertain, but some believe it may be worse than that of previous models due to its thin design. Reports suggest that to compensate, an optional battery case may be sold separately.

Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. However, a newer prediction from JPMorgan suggests the iPhone Air will cost around $899 to compensate for the absence of a second camera.

After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it's speculated that the watch will feature a larger display.

One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks.

Apple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn't mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement.

The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn't expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. 

Rumored prices for the watches are $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.

After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Another rumor claims the pairing button will be removed, and instead, you touch the case itself.

Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio.

This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Fresh off the internal collapse of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's senior leadership, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. There, Kennedy deflected and denied any harmful impacts from the CDC's implosion, while repeatedly spouting misinformation about vaccines and other health issues.

The hearing comes after much of the CDC's leadership were fired or resigned in protest last week. Former CDC director Susan Monarez was fired last Tuesday for reportedly refusing to support Kennedy's vaccine agenda without review, and specifically, to follow the recommendations issued by an influential but independent vaccine advisory panel—the same panel that Kennedy recently purged and restocked with people who have criticized or voiced skepticism toward vaccines before.

The CDC Implosion Continues as Staff Stage Unprecedented Walkout

Kennedy, in both an opening statement and subsequent responses to Senate Finance Committee members, appeared to minimize the fallout from what happened at the CDC. He instead argued that the agency's track record, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic, merited a kind of reset, adding that it was “absolutely necessary” to wipe the slate clean.

“We are the sickest country in the world. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC,” Kennedy said.

It's worth noting, of course, that U.S. President Donald Trump oversaw the country's initial response to the covid-19 pandemic, which included the record-setting development and rollout of mRNA vaccines to combat the virus. At the same time, the Trump administration often ignored and undermined the CDC during that first year.

On the firing of Monarez, Kennedy implied that she was untrustworthy, rather than that she had refused to support his vaccine agenda.

Kennedy also rebuffed criticisms of the remade vaccine advisory panel.

Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) noted that several of Kennedy's picks received money from testifying in vaccine-related lawsuits, arguing that this history should be seen as a financial conflict of interest—the same rationale used by Kennedy to dismiss the old ACIP members. Kennedy disagreed entirely, instead claiming that this was merely evidence of them possibly having a bias.

Among the more egregious moments in the hearing happened during questioning by Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia). When pressed to acknowledge that at least one million Americans died from covid-19, Kennedy said in a heated exchange with Warner that he didn't know many Americans died from covid-19.

“I don't think anybody knows that,” Kennedy stated.

There are slightly varying estimates of the total deaths caused by the pandemic, but we know that the pandemic caused the deaths of more than 1.2 million Americans, and that figure is based on documented and confirmed covid-19 fatalities.

Kennedy also claimed to not know how many lives were saved from the covid-19 vaccines, another common talking point of the anti-vaccination movement. But numerous studies have shown that covid-19 vaccination saved at least millions of lives in the U.S. and worldwide, and that the vaccines are safe and effective. And Kennedy's suggestion that vaccine makers didn't produce a study showing the covid-19 jab was suitable for healthy children is also incorrect, as those studies have been done.

At one point in the hearing, Kennedy stated that he agreed with his handpicked ACIP member Retsef Levi's argument that the mRNA covid-19 vaccines caused serious harm, including death, to Americans, especially young people. While no vaccine or drug is without its side effects, the vast majority of studies have reaffirmed the overall safety of these vaccines, and that their overall benefits outweigh the risks.

Later, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) asked Kennedy if he was lying when he told Senators before his confirmation as health secretary that he wasn't “anti-vax.”

“When were you lying, sir?” Smith said. “When you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?”

“Both things are true,” Kennedy responded.

After recently being spotted testing a way to share longer text, Threads, Meta's X competitor, is now officially rolling out the feature that allows users to attach up to 10,000 characters of text to their post. The addition has been designed with the needs of creators in mind, as it supports linking out to content outside of Threads, like newsletters, blogs, podcasts, and more.

Before this update, Threads supported 500 characters — which is already far more than the 280 characters offered to X's unverified users. However, X in 2023 introduced a way for its paid subscribers to post up to 25,000 characters, in the hopes of encouraging creators to publish their content directly on its platform.

Meta, meanwhile, isn't going quite that far. Instead, the company says that the 10,000 characters give people more room to express themselves, but also allows them to promote their work and drive others to “wherever it lives,” even if not on Threads itself.

Ahead of the launch, Meta noticed that people were using screenshots to share longer content from books, articles, newsletters, podcast transcripts, and more, which inspired the feature's addition and design. 

The company saw that its users often wanted to point people to the original work or place to purchase their own work, after starting a conversation about the subject on Threads. For instance, authors may want to share text from an upcoming book to drive preorders, whereas journalists may want to promote one of their longer features.

On X, users have long worked around character count limitations by threading and numbering a series of linked posts to share longer thoughts, or by uploading screenshots from an app like Apple's Notes. Seeing this trend, X tried to capitalize on the demand for a longer character count by making it a paid feature.

Threads, however, is making its additional characters available for free. 

The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it doesn't have plans to monetize posts with text attachments at this time. Plus, Meta noted that text in the posts can be formatted with highlighting, bold or underlined text, strikethroughs, and italics. You can even add emojis.

The company says it's exploring additional enhancements based on community feedback, as well.

Notably, Meta says if creators link out to content outside of Threads, that link will be displayed “prominently” in the attachment for the audience to click. This is also a shot at X, which changed its user interface to downplay links' visibility, and often blocks links to outside services at owner Elon Musk's whim. 

There are some drawbacks to using Threads' longer text, though. 

The content in the text attachments won't be indexed by search engines like Google, and it won't be federated. The latter refers to how Threads supports the publication of its posts to the wider open social web, including decentralized services like Mastodon. This support allows Threads users to search for and follow users from other servers besides Threads, see who follows you and who liked your post from those servers, as well as see and like posts on Threads posted by users on other servers.

Meta says it's exploring how to federate the longer text attachments for future iterations.

Robot vacuums that can climb stairs are now officially a thing if IFA 2025 is any indication. At the Berlin tech show, Eufy announced the MarsWalker, a dang stair-climbing mech suit that your robot vacuum can wear. And Eufy plans to release it in the spring of next year, with pricing to be announced later.

Robot vacuum owners have been waiting years for a couple of things: a robot that actually does what you want with no compromises (we're not there yet) and the ability for them to actually get up and down your stairs without you (we're close!). A few companies have shown off stair-climbing robots before; consider the Migo Robotics Ascender, an ambitious project that can climb and clean your stairs, but that one hasn't made it to the world yet. The closest thing to it on the market right now is the , which, admittedly, can only handle tiny steps.

Eufy's new idea is one of the wilder—and somehow the most realistic—yet. Here's how it worked when I saw it at IFA: a compatible Eufy robot vac (in this case, the Eufy Omni S2) and the MarsWalker each leave their respective docks, then have a robotic meet-cute where the Eufy robot slips inside the MarsWalker and they start rolling towards the stairs. As they approach the stairs they're planning to ascend, robotic arms extend from the MarsWalker's front and the back, and reach for the first step. On contact, the front arms raise the MarsWalker and the treads drive it forward until they touch with the step, then it just cruises on up.

I watched the MarsWalker do this over and over again on a small set of wooden stairs that only went up in one direction. But Eufy says it works fine with stairs that reach a landing and turn, either at a right angle or back in the other direction. I asked a member of Eufy's research and development team who was on site, and he tells me the MarsWalker can potentially handle spiral staircases too, but they'd have to have a wide curve. If I get a chance to review it, I'll try it on the spiral stairs in my own home.

I asked Eufy's representative about the MarsWalker's future compatibility, and he said the company plans to make other robot vacs that work with it. The device won't be backward compatible. The rep said the company is attempting to make the Eufy Omni S1 Pro work with it as well, but it sounds like that's far from a given.

The MarsWalker has a way to go before it can truly conquer stairs—it doesn't clean the stairs themselves, after all. But if it works as Eufy hopes it will, this little robot can get from one floor to the next all by its onesie, saving you from having to carry your robot vacuum upstairs (which, if you're me, you just don't do) or buy separate vacuums for each floor. And really, it's probably a good thing for Eufy to try to master getting up and down the stairs first before moving onto the next thing. Baby steps.<

Eufy's robot vacuums, like many on the market today, can save multiple maps of your house so you can move them around, but with this new approach, it creates a full map of all of your floors without you having to initiate separate map-making runs for each floor.

The Omni S2 is a new robot, and a follow-up to its Omni S1 Pro self-cleaning robot vacuum with a great big tower of a cleaning base. Eufy says the Omni S2 is aimed at solving a number of issues that robot vacuums have, not just their inability to climb stairs. Those include the robots' inability to adapt to different floor surfaces, terrible carpet performance, tendency to get their filters clogged with dust and pet hair, and the fact that even the best mop-bots can't actually disinfect your floors.

The Omni S2, which Eufy expects to sell for $1,599 in the U.S. in January, will have 30,000Pa suction (that's higher than the Omni E28's 20,000Pa and way higher than the S1 Pro's 8,000Pa), a self-cleaning mop, and can rid floors of “99.999%” of bacteria and pathogens. As it cleans, it farts out pretty smells, with the company's presentation showing it diffusing scents like “Citrus and Basil,” “Bamboo and Sage,” and “Bergamot and Lychee.”

Also, those 3D maps I mentioned earlier? Eufy says the Omni S2, even without the MarsWalker, uses those to avoid obstacles and messes, adapting to your home as it cleans. Without the MarsWalker, the S2 can climb up to 5cm transitions to different floors. Like the S1's dock, Eufy says the S2's UniClean Station 2.0 can empty, wash, dry, and refill the S2 with cleaning solution for the next run.

While Interview With the Vampire fans will have to wait until 2026 to pick back up with that series—retitled The Vampire Lestat for its rock n' roll-infused third season—Anne Rice's world expands in just a few weeks with Talamasca: The Secret Order. AMC has just shared a full trailer after that teaser in July, and it teases supernatural secrets, psychic menace, and danger-filled dark rooms.

Talamasca runs just six episodes, but AMC is calling it a “first season,” so make of that what you will. And it won't just be focusing on vampires; the Talamasca keeps tabs on them, of course, but also witches and “other creatures” worldwide.

In addition to Justin Kirk and Eric Bogosian, who cross over as their Interview With the Vampire characters, Talamasca has a juicy guest star in Jason Schwartzman. The rest of the cast includes Nicholas Denton, Elizabeth McGovern, William Fichtner (merrily devouring the scenery in the above trailer), Maisie Richardson-Sellers, and Celine Buckens.

Here's AMC's full description of the series: “Denton stars as Guy Anatole; on the cusp of graduating law school, he is approached by a representative of the Talamasca, a secretive agency that monitors and protects us from the supernatural world. When Guy learns that the Talamasca has been tracking him since his childhood, he falls headlong into a world of secret agents and immortal beings who, up to now, have maintained a fragile balance with the mortal world.

McGovern portrays Helen, a seasoned veteran of the Talamasca, and the leader of its New York Motherhouse; Fichtner plays Jasper, a mysterious American who has quietly assumed control and influence over the Talamasca's London Motherhouse; Richardson-Sellers plays Olive, a beguiling and ambitious agent of the Talamasca; Buckens stars as Doris, strong-willed and with an old soul, she lives with a coven of witches on a houseboat; while Schwartzman portrays Burton, a charming, rakish vampire, leading a cloistered life in a luxurious Upper West Side penthouse, Bogosian plays Daniel Molloy, and Kirk is Talamasca agent Raglan James.”

Daniel Molloy's book gets a mention in the trailer, but since it doesn't make an appearance, here's a first-look photo of the author and his creation that AMC also released today:

Anne Rice's Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres October 26 on AMC and AMC+.

After six years of waiting, Team Cherry's long awaited Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, launched globally today at 10 am EDT. Unfortunately, fans may have to wait a little longer to play the action-adventure game. Online retailers such as the Xbox and PlayStation stores, Steam, and Nintendo eShop are rife with loading screens and error messages as people rush to buy it.

On Steam, players trying to add the game to their cart or complete their purchase are being met with the same message: an image of a frustrated blob with the caption “Something went wrong.” Switch players on Bluesky say the eShop hangs on loading screens or error messages. On the PlayStation store, the game appears to have disappeared entirely for some players, while it's not available to purchase for others. According to Verge reporter Tom Warren, fans trying to buy the game on Xbox Game Pass should remote-install it via the console's website.

In lieu of playing the game, many fans are turning to social media to vent their frustrations.

“STEAM, LET ME PLAY SILKSONG,” posted one Bluesky user. “First boss of #Silksong is really tough,” wrote another with a picture of Steam's error message. Twitch streamers trying to play the game for their viewers are running into similar problems. On X, user @HaydenSchiff posted a screenshot of many streamers encountering the same Steam error message.

Players who've successfully managed to buy the game, meanwhile, are gloating about their success. “God's favorite,” wrote one with a picture of Silksong on their Switch 2.

Silksong, announced in 2019, is the followup to Team Cherry's debut title, Hollow Knight. A winning combination of Dark Souls-like difficulty and cartoonish charm, Hollow Knight became an award-winning indie darling that sold over 15 million copies—an impressive feat for its tiny, Australia-based developer. While the team initially planned to release Silksong as downloadable content, the project eventually ballooned into a full-fledged title that took seven years to finish.

Despite years of few updates and little news, the Silksong fanbase has remained active. Some fan communities have even turned waiting into a game, while others dedicated their time to (mostly non-existent) daily news updates.

The weeks leading up to Silksong, available today for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, have been chaotic for both game makers and fans. After developers made a surprise announcement in August that the game would launch in two weeks, at least half a dozen fellow indie developers delayed their own games to make way. “Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks notice makes everyone freak out,” wrote Demonschool developer Necrosoft on Bluesky after announcing its own delay.

The game's popularity is undeniable. As of writing, Silksong is Steam's top-selling game; it already has more than 100,000 concurrent players on that platform alone. For those still trying to buy a copy, it turns out years of waiting may have been good practice for launch day.

U.S. health officials have issued several recalls of shrimp in recent weeks over concerns about radioactive material. And now a sitting U.S. Senator has taken the opportunity to warn people in the most dire terms possible. With help from a visual aide, of course.

Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, took to the Senate floor with a giant poster board featuring a screenshot from the classic 1979 film Alien on Wednesday. And he wants you to know that Americans are going to look like the chestburster from that movie if we're not careful.

Kennedy posted a video of his warning on his X account, though the senator's version of the video is just 3 minutes and 37 seconds long. The entire speech, which is available on the Forbes YouTube channel, is five and a half minutes.

“This is a photograph of the alien from the movie Alien,” Kennedy helpfully explained. “This is what you could end up looking like if you eat some of the raw frozen shrimp being sent to the United States by other countries.”

Kennedy went on to list some of the brands that have been recalled from places like Walmart. And he turned back to the posterboard and his dire warning. “If you eat it, how could you end up looking like alien in the Alien? Because the shrimp was radioactive. I kid you not.”

“It had a radioactive isotope in it called cesium-137. It'll kill you. Even if it doesn't turn you into the alien if you eat this stuff, I guarantee you'll grow an extra ear,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy's claim isn't really true, whether he's kidding or not. Obviously, nobody wants to be eating shrimp that could potentially contain radioactive substances. But it's not going to kill you without repeated exposure at a much higher dose.

The Cs-137 found by U.S. Customs and Border Protection near shrimp distributed by BMS Foods of Indonesia last month registered at 68 Bq/kg, well below the level for federal intervention, which is 1200 Bq/kg. The American Nuclear Society noted at the time that 68 Bq/kg is similar to the radiation levels found in bananas.

Cs-137 is not naturally occurring like the radiation in bananas. And nobody wants any level of radiation in their food. But there's no evidence that the radiation that could potentially be present in shrimp is going to kill you (at least not in the way that Kennedy suggests), and the FDA recall notices all mention that. It's not going to make you grow an extra ear. The concern around eating the recalled shrimp is purely long-term, involving repeated low-dose exposure, which can contribute to cancer.

Kennedy represents Louisiana, which is America's largest shrimp producer. So it makes sense that he would highlight the issue. But he clearly has an incentive to make foreign shrimp sound scary.

Kennedy's video clip on X didn't include almost two minutes of his remarks. The senator would go on to say that he wasn't picking on Indonesia, but then made another claim that seemed to suggest shrimp producers overseas were intentionally making the shrimp radioactive.

“This shrimp, and I'm not just picking on Indonesia, it's other countries,” Kennedy said. “This shrimp is grown in conditions that you can't possibly imagine. Dirty water. They shoot the shrimp full of antibiotics. I confess, I didn't know they were shooting them full of this radioactive isotope.”

There's no evidence that any shrimp producers are “shooting them full” of radiation. The most likely explanation is accidental contamination from some kind of industrial equipment. The average person would likely be surprised at how radioactive material is used in consumer products like smoke detectors. But we don't know how the shrimp may have been potentially contaminated at this point. There's just no logical reason to intentionally do it.

“Now, I'm biased,” Kennedy conceded in a portion of the remarks that he didn't tweet.

“I believe in homegrown Louisiana shrimp. Fresh, out of the Gulf, not radioactive. But I understand that some stores prefer to buy foreign shrimp because it's cheaper. Now we know why. The damn stuff's radioactive,” Kennedy continued.

“And NOAA needs to do a better job of inspecting the shrimp that is sold from other countries who don't abide by the same standards we do to the consumers in the United States and America.”

Should the company switch its trucks, cars, and vans to electric? It's a question that plenty of businesses operating fleets of vehicles—in industries like delivery, health care, cable companies, and utilities—are thinking through.

Eighty-seven percent of fleet operators polled by Cox Automotive last year said they were expecting to bring aboard some battery-powered vehicles in the next five years. Their top concerns weren't that different from everyday drivers': Businesses aren't sure how to keep EVs charged. When time spent charging up the battery—which can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours, depending on the vehicle and charger—is time not on the road making money, these decisions can be the difference between ending up in the red or the black.

For six months this year, Ford and an Atlanta-based utility called Southern Company experimented with custom software that could help alleviate these growing pains. The results suggested, the companies say, that just a bit of charging tech smarts could save businesses money by charging in exactly the moments when weather and other customers' electric grid usage conspires to make prices cheap and electricity most efficient.

Still, the experiment ended after May, and the Southern Company says it has no immediate plans to create a “managed charging” program for its own fleet of electric vehicles, or to offer one to commercial customers.

The experiment highlights the complexities of EV charging—and EV ownership—for businesses for whom time and reliability is money. Company EVs can cost less to own, operate, and maintain, especially as gas prices creep upwards. But the logistics of keeping them charged can seem daunting to managers used to dealing with gas, especially for fleets like Southern Company's that don't operate on strict schedules.

A Southern Company truck—this one for Georgia Power—juices up at a Ford Pro charger.

In the US, federal subsidies that offered tax breaks for businesses going electric made EVs a particularly appealing choice. But most of those incentive programs are being phased out by the middle of next year, after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill this summer. Fourteen percent of US fleets operated EVs last year, according to Cox Automotive.

The Southern Company didn't need this pilot to sell it on EVs. The firm—which operates Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, as well as other subsidiaries across six southern and midwestern states—has been using Ford electric vehicles since 2023. Its fleet now includes more than 200 F-150 Lightning trucks and 150 Ford Pro chargers. The company aims to electrify its entire fleet by 2030.

Now it wanted to see if it could use Ford Pro's charging software to ramp down its vehicles' and chargers' energy consumption during periods of high demand. (Ford Pro is the commercial fleet arm of the US automaker.) Such “managed charging” programs save fleet owners money by scheduling charging for times when utilities are charging less for electricity, and put less stress on the electric grid. Southern Company is particularly aware of that last point: With the AI boom, data centers are flooding into the US southeast.

“We're trying to figure out how we can save every kilowatt-hour that is out there to be saved, because we'll have a more constrained system in the future,” says Lea Clanton, who directs business development and innovation for Southern Company New Ventures.

The utility invested in over 200 F-150 Lightning trucks and 150 Ford Pro chargers for its fleet operations.

Ironically, the experiment's most exciting moments came when the two companies worked together to shut down all their chargers. By turning off the chargers for 30 minutes—something that might be suddenly necessary during very hot or cold days, or during an emergency—Southern Company and Ford say they were able to reduce the demand on the grid by 0.5 megawatts, immediately freeing up an amount of electricity equivalent to what's needed to power between 200 and 450 homes for a year.

One day, EV fleets like those operated by the Southern Company might use this sort of software to save money and electricity. But Clanton says the utility firm needs more information before it's ready to hook its EVs up to smarter chargers. It needs to guarantee that its drivers—especially those responding to electricity emergencies—always have charge when the unexpected happens.

“If we were to adopt something more permanent, we would need to take some time to better understand where our drivers need to be, how often they charge, and make sure that it's not going to impact our delivery of clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy to customers at all, 24 hours a day,” says Clanton.

Lines get blurred in tech all the time, and IFA 2025 has been no exception. You've got a projector that's also a party speaker, a party speaker that's also an amp, a washer and dryer that's also a dock for robo vacuums, and now… light bulbs that are also tiny motion-sensing surveillance machines.

Philips Hue took the wraps off a bunch of new products this week, and while there's a lot to sort through, one thing that jumped out to me is an update to its Hue Bridge—the $99 Hue Bridge Pro. According to Philips, with an update to its Hue smart home hub, almost all of your existing Hue smart lights can now be set up to detect motion and trigger your lights automatically. The company says the feature, called MotionAware, uses three to four lights in the same room to create an area that detects your movement. What's even more impressive is that it doesn't require a new bulb. Instead, the feature (as long as you buy the Hue Bridge Pro, which is capable of running the right algorithms) can be used retroactively with almost every Hue bulb, thanks to their use of radio frequencies, which double as motion sensors in this case.

It's an objectively clever use of preexisting hardware that Philips says will apply to all bulbs dating back to the second-gen Hue lights from 2014, and the capabilities apparently don't stop at turning your lights on and off. According to Philips, MotionAware also extends to its array of home security products (cameras and sensors) sold under the Hue Secure umbrella. As noted by a deeper dive from The Verge, when motion is detected, lights can be configured to flash red, and can also trigger Hue's new security bell and even send alerts to your phone with an additional option to call the police. Yep, that's right. It's 2025, and your lightbulbs are your new guard dog.

The Verge also notes that while MotionAware costs $1 per month (to cover cloud costs allegedly), you'll need to pay $40 per year to use security alerts, which is the cost of a Hue Secure subscription. Whether you want to turn your bulbs into a security narc or just program them to turn on when you walk into the room, the idea is pretty cool, and Philips says all of the motion data is kept locally on its Hue Bridge Pro, which is good because I'm not sure I want any company to know which room of my apartment I'm in and when. Even if none of that motion-sensing appeals to you, it may be worth buying a Bridge Pro since it supports 3x the amount of lights over the last generation and also works via Wi-Fi as opposed to having to connect to your router via Ethernet. If any of those capabilities sound attractive to you, you can buy the Huge Bridge Pro starting today.

Orchard Robotics, an agtech startup using artificial intelligence to deliver precise data on farm operations, has raised $22 million from investors. 

The company was founded by Seattle-based CEO Charlie Wu, a Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Cornell University to launch his business in 2022.

“Solving farming is a data problem, and data is the bedrock of every farming decision. But the lack of precise, actionable data is the bottleneck,” Wu said in a statement. “Orchard Robotics exists to help our farmers become more profitable and efficient, and this new funding accelerates our ability to deliver a sustainable future for agriculture.”

The startup has developed a system with cameras that are mounted on tractors and other equipment to gather images as they traverse a farm. The collected images are then analyzed by Orchard Robotics' AI to generate data on vines, trees and crops, which is then processed to track the growth, yield and health of crops. 

The technology was initially deployed on apple and grape farms, and has expanded into operations growing blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus and strawberries. 

Orchard Robotics is based in San Francisco and its team is largely split between Washington and California, according to LinkedIn data.

The Series A round was led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, with continued participation from General Catalyst, Contrary, Mythos, Valyrian and Ravelin. Other investors include Formula One driver Nico Rosberg and Yext & Roam Founder Howard Lerman. The startup has raised more than $25 million in total.

Washington is home to a wide variety of agtech startups. That includes other companies that collect and/or analyze data, such Loftus Labs, innov8.ag and FruitScout, as well as IUNU and Koidra, which are focused on greenhouse crops. 

Other agtech business in the Pacific Northwest are tackling field operations such as weed destroyers Carbon Robotics and Aigen; rock removing TerraClear; and irrigation startups FarmHQ and Verdi.

JetBlue plans to become the first airline to sign on with Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband service, promising faster and more reliable inflight Wi-Fi.

The airline announced Thursday that the technology will be introduced to a portion of its fleet starting in 2027, providing a boost to Fly-Fi, JetBlue's free, high-speed Wi-Fi program.

The news comes on the heels of a boast this week by Amazon executives, who showed the satellite constellation is capable of transmitting data at speeds in excess of a gigabit per second.

Project Kuiper is built around a constellation of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit — connected to each other by high-speed optical links that will create a mesh network in space — and linked to a global network of antennas, fiber, and internet connection points on the ground. 

Amazon has launched 102 Project Kuiper satellites so far, with another 27 due to go up as early as this month. The current schedule calls for half of the planned 3,232-satellite constellation to be deployed within the next year.

The tech giant said it intends to begin delivering satellite broadband services to customers by the end of this year. Eventually, it aims to offer high-speed internet access to millions of people around the globe.

JetBlue called the agreement with Project Kuiper “an exciting leap forward” in onboard connectivity.

“With Project Kuiper, we're working to ensure customers can enjoy fast, reliable internet wherever they are — at home or 35,000 feet in the air — and we're pumped to bring that to life with JetBlue,” Panos Panay, senior vice president of Amazon Devices & Services, said in a statement.

Project Kuiper will have to catch up to SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently dominates the market for broadband access via satellites, including on airlines. Seattle-based Alaska Airlines announced last month that it planned to launch an upgrade to its inflight Wi-Fi experience with Starlink.

In other sky-high Wi-Fi news, Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless carrier T-Mobile and Southwest Airlines announced a new partnership delivering free unlimited Wi-Fi for all Rapid Rewards members beginning Oct. 24.

Southwest said that with more than 800 aircraft, it will be the largest domestic airline to implement free Wi-Fi on every flight this year.

Many major airlines are beefing up their in-flight internet offerings by tapping SpaceX's Starlink satellites, but JetBlue is going in a different direction. Amazon and JetBlue announced Thursday a partnership under which the airline will instead use Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites to provide free in-flight connectivity starting in 2027.

The Kuiper terminals on JetBlue's planes will be capable of download speeds of up to 1Gbps from Amazon's low-Earth orbit satellites. That's more bandwidth than Starlink's current max of 250 Mbps, although Amazon is only planning to build a network of 3,226 satellites, while SpaceX has launched more than 8,000. While Amazon has previously claimed it is more focused on “unserved and underserved communities around the world,” that language has been removed from its website.

When the service goes live, JetBlue will be the first airline to use Kuiper satellites, which Amazon started launching to space in April. Amazon also announced earlier this year that it was integrating its satellite internet tech with Airbus planes.

Those contracts are big steps for Kuiper, which has been in the works for years. The project has been bogged down by production problems, although Amazon has said it will be able to hit the mid-2026 deadline imposed by the Federal Communications Commission to launch the first half of its network into orbit.

The price could be between $20,000 and $25,000

The Nvidia B30A, which the company is developing as its next-generation replacement for the China-market H20 AI chip, is expected to cost double the price of the earlier model. Reuters reports that the H20 currently sells between $10,000 and $12,000, meaning the B30A will likely be priced from $20,000 to $25,000. Despite this massive increase, many Chinese companies, like TikTok owner ByteDance, are keen on getting their hands on Nvidia's latest chips, with some sources saying that these chips are considered great deals.

It's estimated that the B30A will be six times more powerful than the H20, despite being a watered-down version of the full-fat B300 AI chip. Nvidia has reportedly already developed the B30A, but it's still waiting for approval from the U.S. government to proceed with the marketing and sale of the Blackwell-based GPU. In the meantime, many Chinese tech firms are still buying H20 chips despite Beijing's guidance to stop buying them.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously banned the sales of H20 chips, resulting in a $5.5-billion write-off for Nvidia. However, he reversed course in mid-July 2025, allowing the company to resume deliveries to Chinese customers. But instead of a blanket provision allowing it to sell the H20 to anyone, the U.S. instead started issuing export licenses to Nvidia, allowing it to ship its products.

Because of this, there's currently a massive license backlog at the U.S. Department of Commerce —the worst it has experienced in 30 years — turning the H20 taps into a trickle. The White House is also still ironing out the 15% deal that AMD and Nvidia signed, so that the companies can market their products to China. We've also seen reports that Nvidia is asking its suppliers to wind down H20-related production, with the company only telling Tom's Hardware, “We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.”

So, with all these delays, red tape, and rumors, many of Nvidia's Chinese customers are getting apprehensive and want assurance that their H20 orders are delivered. This shows that there is still massive demand for these powerful chips, thus turning it into a massive geopolitical tool to be wielded on the negotiating table by both the East and the West.

Lila Biologics, a startup that spun out of Nobel Laureate David Baker's lab at the University of Washington, announced a collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to develop therapies for treating solid tumors.

Lila has also launched two platforms powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning for creating new therapeutic proteins. One is focused on targeted radiotherapy, generating proteins that precisely bind to tumors and carry radioactive isotopes that zap cancerous cells. The other platform is used to build long-acting injectable drugs that gradually release medicine over weeks or months.

The 7-person startup is using its targeted radiotherapy tool in the partnership with Eli Lilly. It hopes to hand off a candidate protein within three to six months so the pharmaceutical company can take the drug through clinical trials.

The Eli Lilly collaboration “really proves we're ready for prime time,” CEO Jake Kraft told GeekWire. “We have something unique out there and we're ready to develop medicines.”

Kraft and Chief Scientist Anindya Roy co-founded Lila in 2023. The two worked as postdoctoral fellows in the UW's Institute for Protein Design, which is directed by Baker.

“With a world-class team and holistic approach to ML-driven protein design in place, Lila Biologics is uniquely suited to advance a new class of tumor-targeted radiotherapies and [long-acting injectable] medicines toward the clinic,” Baker said in a statement.

Baker, who won his Nobel last year in chemistry and is a Lila co-founder, helped create a technology that allows researchers to use AI and ML algorithms to engineer never-before-seen proteins designed to perform specific functions, such as drug delivery or destroying environmental pollutants.

The AI tools from the institute are increasingly successful at creating proteins that function as planned when tested in the lab, saving time and money. Researchers with the Institute for Protein Design in recent months have published papers in top scientific journals demonstrating the technology's capabilities. That includes creating de novo proteins that bind precise disease markers and others that grab hold of difficult-to-capture, shapeshifting molecules.

The institute has made its foundational AI technology free and publicly available to users worldwide.

In 2023, Lila raised a $10 million seed round led by WRF Capital, SilverArc Capital Management, and Sahsen Ventures, with participation from Boom Capital, Alexandria Venture Investments, Cooley, Pack Ventures, and other private investors, the company told GeekWire.

For the project with Eli Lilly, Lila scientists are going after harder-to-hit tumor targets than most other organizations have pursued.

The team is additionally working on its own pipeline of therapies, including a long-acting injectable to treat pulmonary disease. Lila scientists have candidate-stage drugs and are preparing for investigational new drug studies, which lead to human clinical trials.

“We want to bring medicines to patients,” Kraft said. “We don't want to just say we've designed a protein, but we actually want to be able to say we've saved lives.”

American buyers should be prioritized ahead of all others, according to U.S. legislators

Update 9/4/2025 05:28 am PT: An Nvidia spokesperson has reached out and provided this comment.

"The AI Diffusion Rule was a self-defeating policy, based on doomer science fiction, and should not be revived. Our sales to customers worldwide do not deprive U.S. customers of anything — and in fact expand the market for many U.S. businesses and industries. The pundits feeding fake news to Congress about chip supply are attempting to overturn President Trump's AI Action Plan and surrender America's chance to lead in AI and computing worldwide."

Original Article

The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unveiled a preliminary version of the annual defense policy package that includes a requirement for American developers of AI processors to prioritize domestic orders for high-performance AI processors before supplying them to overseas buyers and explicitly calls to deny exports of highest-end AI GPUs. The legislators call their initiative the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (GAIN AI Act) and their goal is to ensure that American 'small businesses, start-ups, and universities' can lay their hands on the latest AI GPUs from AMD, Nvidia, etc before clients in other countries. However, if the bill becomes a law, it will hit American companies hard.

Breaking: The Senate's latest NDAA text, which dropped today, includes the GAIN AI Act - requiring US AI chip firms sell to American companies first.Huge win if this is included in the NDAA. Here's the text from the manager's amendment.ARI statement:https://t.co/j5UP0NYbJL pic.twitter.com/kyYMWJU2ScSeptember 2, 2025

"Advanced AI chips are the jet engine that is going to enable the U.S. AI industry to lead for the next decade," said Brad Carson, president of Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI). "Globally, these chips are currently supply-constrained, which means that every advanced chip sold abroad is a chip the U.S. cannot use to accelerate American R&D and economic growth. As we compete to lead on this dual-use technology, including the GAIN AI Act in the NDAA would be a major win for U.S. economic competitiveness and national security."

This GAIN AI Act demands developers of AI processors, such as AMD or Nvidia, to give U.S. buyers first opportunity to purchase advanced AI hardware before selling to foreign nations, including allied nations like European countries or the U.K. and adversaries like China. To do so, the Act proposes to establish export controls on all 'advanced' GPUs (more on this later) to be shipped outside of the U.S. and deny export licenses on the 'most powerful chips.'

To get the export license, the exporter must confirm to certain conditions:

If one of the certifications is missing, the export request must be denied, according to the proposal.

What is perhaps no less important about the act is that it sets precise criteria of what U.S. legislators consider 'advanced integrated circuit,' or advanced AI GPU. To qualify as 'advanced', a processor has meet any one of the following criteria:

Essentially, the legislators plan to export control all fairly sophisticated processors, including Nvidia's HGX H20 (because of high memory bandwidth) or L2 PCIe (because of high performance density) that are now about two years old. As a result, if the proposed bill passes as a law and is signed by the President, then it will again restrict sales of AMD's Instinct MI308 or Nvidia's HGX H20 both to all customers outside of the U.S. Furthermore, GPUs with a TPP of 4800 or higher will be prohibited for exports, so Nvidia will be unable to sell its H100 and more advaced GPUs outside of the U.S. as even H100 has a TPP score of 16,000 (B300 has a TPP score of 60,000).

Coincidentally, Nvidia on Wednesday issued a statement claiming that shipments of its H20 to customers in China does not affect its ability to serve clients in the U.S.

"The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false — selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products," the statement reads.

The IronWolf Pro 30TB pushes the popular NAS hard drive series up to a new high capacity using laser-powered recording tech, so now you can have your favorite NAS drive with up to a whopping 30TB of storage without giving anything up. Seagate employs its new laser-powered heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology with this drive, a first for a mass-market hard drive.

The Mozaic 3+ technology platform enables an unprecedented amount of storage density by using a laser to heat a small area of the disk to 450°C (842°F) before recording data to it, thus allowing bits to be packed into a smaller area. For end users, there is no difference in use, performance, or reliability.

We would understand if the IronWolf Pro name is more recognizable and catchy to you than Exos, which is the enterprise counterpart for the Pro model. The former instills a certain sense of reliability, and this is backed by Seagate's health monitoring and complimentary data recovery services. The IronWolf Pro also often comes in at a lower price, which only sweetens the deal.

HAMR enables reaching a higher capacity ceiling without significantly increasing power consumption or heat production. That's a great selling point as the IronWolf Pro is best used with two or more drives in a NAS system. If your drives are idle a lot, you're also in good shape, as Seagate has specifically optimized for that condition. Performance also remains as expected, although Seagate has tuned the drive for mixed workloads and higher queue depths. What's not to love?

Well, for one, the drive's performance is not really breaking any new ground. This is expected, so it's not really worthy of a demerit. However, we can't shake the feeling that this drive is made for more serious workloads, which makes it less attractive to everyday users. Also expected, given the drive's high base price. Dropping over $1,000 for two of these even at 28TB is not something you would do lightly. The relative cost – $ per terabyte – isn't too bad, but many people could be better off going with older drives in the ~20TB range. This means this drive is meant for scenarios where data density is the number one priority.

The new Seagate IronWolf Pro adds 28TB and 30TB to its capacity offerings, both with the performant conventional magnetic recording (CMR) technology that doesn't involve performance tradeoffs like we see with cheaper shingled magnetic recording (SMR) hard drives. Seagate uses this same tech in its enterprise-focused Exos 30TB drive, though things diverge a bit as the Exos M has a 32TB CMR planned with SMR options up to at least 36TB. Still, these are very similar drives with almost identical specifications. The IronWolf Pro can hit up to 275 MB/s with sustained transfers, and it has 512MB of DRAM cache.

Currently, the 30TB IronWolf Pro is priced at $549.99 on Seagate's website, and the 28TB model is $529.99 on Amazon, although both prices are discounted. This makes it less expensive than the Exos M, which makes it not a bad deal at all.

As with the Exos M, the IronWolf Pro is warrantied for five years with a 550TB per year workload rate limit (WRL). In addition, the IronWolf Pro comes with three years of Rescue Data Recovery Services, which makes it more consumer-friendly versus the enterprise-focused Exos M. The drive is otherwise optimized for use in NAS.

Seagate has the same downloads for the IronWolf Pro that it does for the Exos M: SeaTools and DiscWizard. SeaTools is for diagnostics and drive monitoring and works in both Windows and Linux with graphical and command-line interfaces. DiscWizard is for formatting, partitioning, and preparing drives for use. The IronWolf Pro then diverges from the Exos M by having IronWolf Health Management (IHM) which is active protection for the drive to assist with maintaining the drive and its data in NAS use. This further emphasizes that the IronWolf Pro is intended for different environments than the Exos M.

The IronWolf Pro PCB looks very similar to the Exos M, the primary difference being that the DRAM is made by Nanya instead of Winbond. It is otherwise comparable. This is not unexpected, and we regularly see different brands of DRAM used on SSDs for metadata caching. The other main memory here is ICs of NAND and NOR flash memory for use by the drive controller.

The IronWolf Pro uses the same controllers as the Exos M, too. The SMOOTH Thor by STMicroelectronics is designed for power management and motor control, while Seagate's 12nm ASIC serves as the primary controller for drive and media operations. From the hardware side of things, the two drive lines are identical, although there are firmware and feature differences. The drive has also been certified compatible with certain NAS systems, such as QNAP, with a focus on AI use cases.

Privacy-focused consumer tech company DuckDuckGo launched a subscription plan last year that bundled a VPN service, personal information removal, and identity theft restoration. The company said Thursday that the subscription now gives users access to the latest AI models through Duck.ai without paying extra.

The Duck.ai chatbot is free to use, and users get access to models like Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku, Meta's Llama 4 Scout, Mistral AI's Mistral Small 3 24B, and OpenAI's GPT-4o mini.

With DuckDuckGo's $9.99 per month plan, users will be able to access newer models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, and Meta's Llama Maverick.

“These bigger models are better at following detailed instructions, maintaining context through extended chats, and delivering deeper, more nuanced responses. The DuckDuckGo subscription offers a way to use some of these models, but with more privacy,” the company said in a post.

This is a good opportunity for those who want to access the latest models without sticking to a single provider. Alternatively, Quora's Poe also offers access to a bouquet of models. You can buy Poe's subscription starting at $5 per month.

DuckDuckGo says that it will continue to add costlier plans to its paid product that offer “larger and more highly advanced models.” It didn't specify whether the current plan has any usage limits.

At Computex earlier this year, Noctua showed off its first-ever AIO (all-in-one) liquid cooler intended for the mainstream market. Originally, the show floor specs stated the cooler would launch in the first quarter of 2026, but an updated roadmap on Noctua's website now tells us that release is planned for Q2 2026.

The yet-to-be-named liquid cooler from Noctua is based on Asetek's flagship G8 V2 pump instead of an in-house solution. In lieu of that, the company has decided to focus on maximizing the performance possible from Asetek's design by developing its own 3-layer sound dampening system. According to Noctua, there's a "tuned-mass damper effect" to keep the whole operation quiet.

Moreover, Noctua is using its SecuFirm+ mounting system for the cooler so it's compatible with exisitng brackets while promising future socket support. If you already own one of their air coolers, it will make the installation that much easier. The AIO will be offered in three sizes: 240 mm, 360 mm, and 420 mm, covering all bases and ensuring everyone can throw a bit of beige in their systems.

Speaking of which, to match the cooler will be NF-A14x25 G2 (140mm) or NF-A12x25 G2 (120mm) fans that offer class-leading performance while keeping the decibels low. There's also an option for an extra 80 mm auxilary fan that can cool surrounding components like motherboard VRMs, M.2 SSDs, and RAM sticks.

 




Alongside the liquid cooler, the updated roadmap also sheds light on other Noctua products — all of which seem to be pushed back a bit. More importantly, Noctua's collaborations with other companies like Antec (case), Seasonic (power supply), and Pulsar (mouse) also get revised dates, so you can look forward to more brown and beige across your entire setup.

Pricing hasn't been revealed but there were murmurs of $300 USD at Computex which would put the AIO squarely in the premium category. Instead of fancy screens or a value-oriented package, Noctua will be competing purely on the basis of its cooling prowess while sticking to its nailing-the-basics formula. Only time will tell if it will be enough to cut through the market and carve out a space for itself.

The uncanny valley is narrowing. Are we ready for what comes next?

Earlier this summer, I walked through the glassy lobby of a fancy office in London, into an elevator, and then along a corridor into a clean, carpeted room. Natural light flooded in through its windows, and a large pair of umbrella-like lighting rigs made the room even brighter. I tried not to squint as I took my place in front of a tripod equipped with a large camera and a laptop displaying an autocue. I took a deep breath and started to read out the script.

I'm not a newsreader or an actor auditioning for a movie—I was visiting the AI company Synthesia to give it what it needed to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company's avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me. 

When Synthesia launched in 2017, its primary purpose was to match AI versions of real human faces—for example, the former footballer David Beckham—with dubbed voices speaking in different languages. A few years later, in 2020, it started giving the companies that signed up for its services the opportunity to make professional-level presentation videos starring either AI versions of staff members or consenting actors. But the technology wasn't perfect. The avatars' body movements could be jerky and unnatural, their accents sometimes slipped, and the emotions indicated by their voices didn't always match their facial expressions.

Now Synthesia's avatars have been updated with more natural mannerisms and movements, as well as expressive voices that better preserve the speaker's accent—making them appear more humanlike than ever before. For Synthesia's corporate clients, these avatars will make for slicker presenters of financial results, internal communications, or staff training videos.

I found the video demonstrating my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It's slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn't know me, you'd probably think that's exactly what it was. This demonstration shows how much harder it's becoming to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us?  

When my former colleague Melissa visited Synthesia's London studio to create an avatar of herself last year, she had to go through a long process of calibrating the system, reading out a script in different emotional states, and mouthing the sounds needed to help her avatar form vowels and consonants. As I stand in the brightly lit room 15 months later, I'm relieved to hear that the creation process has been significantly streamlined. Josh Baker-Mendoza, Synthesia's technical supervisor, encourages me to gesture and move my hands as I would during natural conversation, while simultaneously warning me not to move too much. I duly repeat an overly glowing script that's designed to encourage me to speak emotively and enthusiastically. The result is a bit as if if Steve Jobs had been resurrected as a blond British woman with a low, monotonous voice. 

It also has the unfortunate effect of making me sound like an employee of Synthesia.“I am so thrilled to be with you today to show off what we've been working on. We are on the edge of innovation, and the possibilities are endless,” I parrot eagerly, trying to sound lively rather than manic. “So get ready to be part of something that will make you go, ‘Wow!' This opportunity isn't just big—it's monumental.”

Just an hour later, the team has all the footage it needs. A couple of weeks later I receive two avatars of myself: one powered by the previous Express-1 model and the other made with the latest Express-2 technology. The latter, Synthesia claims, makes its synthetic humans more lifelike and true to the people they're modeled on, complete with more expressive hand gestures, facial movements, and speech. You can see the results for yourself below. 

Last year, Melissa found that her Express-1-powered avatar failed to match her transatlantic accent. Its range of emotions was also limited—when she asked her avatar to read a script angrily, it sounded more whiny than furious. In the months since, Synthesia has improved Express-1, but the version of my avatar made with the same technology blinks furiously and still struggles to synchronize body movements with speech.

By way of contrast, I'm struck by just how much my new Express-2 avatar looks like me: Its facial features mirror my own perfectly. Its voice is spookily accurate too, and although it gesticulates more than I do, its hand movements generally marry up with what I'm saying. 

But the tiny telltale signs of AI generation are still there if you know where to look. The palms of my hands are bright pink and as smooth as putty. Strands of hair hang stiffly around my shoulders instead of moving with me. Its eyes stare glassily ahead, rarely blinking. And although the voice is unmistakably mine, there's something slightly off about my digital clone's intonations and speech patterns. “This is great!” my avatar randomly declares, before slipping back into a saner register.

Synthesia's new technology is impressive but raises big questions about a world where we increasingly can't tell what's real.

Anna Eiserbeck, a postdoctoral psychology researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin who has studied how humans react to perceived deepfake faces, says she isn't sure she'd have been able to identify my avatar as a deepfake at first glance.

But she would eventually have noticed something amiss. It's not just the small details that give it away—my oddly static earring, the way my body sometimes moves in small, abrupt jerks. It's something that runs much deeper, she explains.

“Something seemed a bit empty. I know there's no actual emotion behind it— it's not a conscious being. It does not feel anything,” she says. Watching the video gave her “this kind of uncanny feeling.” 

My digital clone, and Eiserbeck's reaction to it, make me wonder how realistic these avatars really need to be. 

I realize that part of the reason I feel disconcerted by my avatar is that it behaves in a way I rarely have to. Its oddly upbeat register is completely at odds with how I normally speak; I'm a die-hard cynical Brit who finds it difficult to inject enthusiasm into my voice even when I'm genuinely thrilled or excited. It's just the way I am. Plus, watching the videos on a loop makes me question if I really do wave my hands about that way, or move my mouth in such a weird manner. If you thought being confronted with your own face on a Zoom call was humbling, wait until you're staring at a whole avatar of yourself. 

When Facebook was first taking off in the UK almost 20 years ago, my friends and I thought illicitly logging into each other's accounts and posting the most outrageous or rage-inducing status updates imaginable was the height of comedy. I wonder if the equivalent will soon be getting someone else's avatar to say something truly embarrassing: expressing support for a disgraced politician or (in my case) admitting to liking Ed Sheeran's music. 

Express-2 remodels every person it's presented with into a polished professional speaker with the body language of a hyperactive hype man. And while this makes perfect sense for a company focused on making glossy business videos, watching my avatar doesn't feel like watching me at all. It feels like something else entirely.

The real technical challenge these days has less to do with creating avatars that match our appearance than with getting them to replicate our behavior, says Björn Schuller, a professor of artificial intelligence at Imperial College London. “There's a lot to consider to get right; you have to have the right micro gesture, the right intonation, the sound of voice and the right word,” he says. “I don't want an AI [avatar] to frown at the wrong moment—that could send an entirely different message.”

To achieve an improved level of realism, Synthesia developed a number of new audio and video AI models. The team created a voice cloning model to preserve the human speaker's accent, intonation, and expressiveness—unlike other voice models, which can flatten speakers' distinctive accents into generically American-sounding voices.

To some people, digital clones are the future of influence and productivity—faces, voices, and personalities at infinite scale. My clone was underwhelming.

When a user uploads a script to Express-1, its system analyzes the words to infer the correct tone to use. That information is then fed into a diffusion model, which renders the avatar's facial expressions and movements to match the speech. 

Alongside the voice model, Express-2 uses three other models to create and animate the avatars. The first generates an avatar's gestures to accompany the speech fed into it by the Express-Voice model. A second evaluates how closely the input audio aligns with the multiple versions of the corresponding generated motion before selecting the best one. Then a final model renders the avatar with that chosen motion. 

This third rendering model is significantly more powerful than its Express-1 predecessor. Whereas the previous model had a few hundred million parameters, Express-2's rendering model's parameters number in the billions. This means it takes less time to create the avatar, says Youssef Alami Mejjati, Synthesia's head of research and development:

“With Express-1, it needed to first see someone expressing emotions to be able to render them. Now, because we've trained it on much more diverse data and much larger data sets, with much more compute, it just learns these associations automatically without needing to see them.” 



Although humanlike AI-generated avatars have been around for years, the recent boom in generative AI is making it increasingly easier and more affordable to create lifelike synthetic humans—and they're already being put to work. Synthesia isn't alone: AI avatar companies like Yuzu Labs, Creatify, Arcdads, and Vidyard give businesses the tools to quickly generate and edit videos starring either AI actors or artificial versions of members of staff, promising cost-effective ways to make compelling ads that audiences connect with. Similarly, AI-generated clones of livestreamers have exploded in popularity across China in recent years, partly because they can sell products 24/7 without getting tired or needing to be paid. 

For now at least, Synthesia is “laser focused” on the corporate sphere. But it's not ruling out expanding into new sectors such as entertainment or education, says Peter Hill, the company's chief technical officer. In an apparent step toward this, Synthesia recently partnered with Google to integrate Google's powerful new generative video model Veo 3 into its platform, allowing users to directly generate and embed clips into Synthesia's videos. It suggests that in the future, these hyperrealistic artificial humans could take up starring roles in detailed universes with ever-changeable backdrops. 

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

At present this could, for example, involve using Veo 3 to generate a video of meat-processing machinery, with a Synthesia avatar next to the machines talking about how to use them safely. But future versions of Synthesia's technology could result in educational videos customizable to an individual's level of knowledge, says Alex Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at Synthesia. For example, a video about the evolution of life on Earth could be tweaked for someone with a biology degree or someone with high-school-level knowledge. “It's going to be such a much more engaging and personalized way of delivering content that I'm really excited about,” he says. 

The next frontier, according to Synthesia, will be avatars that can talk back, “understanding” conversations with users and responding in real time Think ChatGPT, but with a lifelike digital human attached. 

Synthesia has already added an interactive element by letting users click through on-screen questions during quizzes presented by its avatars. But it's also exploring making them truly interactive: Future users could ask their avatar to pause and expand on a point, or ask it a question. “We really want to make the best learning experience, and that means through video that's entertaining but also personalized and interactive,” says Alami Mejjati. “This, for me, is the missing part in online learning experiences today. And I know we're very close to solving that.”

We already know that humans can—and do—form deep emotional bonds with AI systems, even with basic text-based chatbots. Combining agentic technology—which is already capable of navigating the web, coding, and playing video games unsupervised—with a realistic human face could usher in a whole new kind of AI addiction, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab.  

“If you make the system too realistic, people might start forming certain kinds of relationships with these characters,” he says. “We've seen many cases where AI companions have influenced dangerous behavior even when they are basically texting. If an avatar had a talking head, it would be even more addictive.”

Schuller agrees that avatars in the near future will be perfectly optimized to adjust their projected levels of emotion and charisma so that their human audiences will stay engaged for as long as possible. “It will be very hard [for humans] to compete with charismatic AI of the future; it's always present, always has an ear for you, and is always understanding,” he says. “Al will change that human-to-human connection.”

As I pause and replay my Express-2 avatar, I imagine holding conversations with it—this uncanny, permanently upbeat, perpetually available product of pixels and algorithms that looks like me and sounds like me, but fundamentally isn't me. Virtual Rhiannon has never laughed until she's cried, or fallen in love, or run a marathon, or watched the sun set in another country. 

But, I concede, she could deliver a damned good presentation about why Ed Sheeran is the greatest musician ever to come out of the UK. And only my closest friends and family would know that it's not the real me. 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

On a spring day in 1954, Bell Labs researchers showed off the first practical solar panels at a press conference in Murray Hill, New Jersey, using sunlight to spin a toy Ferris wheel before a stunned crowd.

The solar future looked bright. But in the race to commercialize the technology it invented, the US would lose resoundingly. Last year, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels and modules, while America shipped just $69 million, according to the New York Times. It was a stunning forfeit of a huge technological lead. 

And now the US seems determined to repeat the mistake. In its quest to prop up aging fossil-fuel industries, the Trump administration has slashed federal support for the emerging cleantech sector, handing his nation's chief economic rival the most generous of gifts: an unobstructed path to locking in its control of emerging energy technologies, and a leg up in inventing the industries of the future.

China's dominance of solar was no accident. In the late 2000s, the government simply determined that the sector was a national priority. Then it leveraged deep subsidies, targeted policies, and price wars to scale up production, drive product improvements, and slash costs. It's made similar moves in batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. 

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has set to work unraveling hard-won clean-energy achievements in the US, snuffing out the gathering momentum to rebuild the nation's energy sector in cleaner, more sustainable ways.

The tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law in early July wound down the subsidies for solar and wind power contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation also cut off federal support for cleantech projects that rely too heavily on Chinese materials—a hamfisted bid to punish Chinese industries that will instead make many US projects financially unworkable.

From generous government subsidies to support for lithium batteries, here are the keys to understanding how China managed to build a world-leading industry in electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, the administration has slashed federal funding for science and attacked the financial foundations of premier research universities, pulling up the roots of future energy innovations and industries.

A driving motivation for many of these policies is the quest to protect the legacy energy industry based on coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which the US is geologically blessed with. But this strategy amounts to the innovator's dilemma playing out at a national scale—a country clinging to its declining industries rather than investing in the ones that will define the future.

It does not particularly matter whether Trump believes in or cares about climate change. The economic and international security imperatives to invest in modern, sustainable industries are every bit as indisputable as the chemistry of greenhouse gases.

Without sustained industrial policies that reward innovation, American entrepreneurs and investors won't risk money and time creating new businesses, developing new products, or building first-of-a-kind projects here. Indeed, venture capitalists have told me that numerous US climate-tech companies are already looking overseas, seeking markets where they can count on government support. Some fear that many other companies will fail in the coming months as subsidies disappear, developments stall, and funding flags. 

All of which will help China extend an already massive lead.

The nation has installed nearly three times as many wind turbines as the US, and it generates more than twice as much solar power. It boasts five of the 10 largest EV companies in the world, and the three largest wind turbine manufacturers. China absolutely dominates the battery market, producing the vast majority of the anodes, cathodes, and battery cells that increasingly power the world's vehicles, grids, and gadgets.

China harnessed the clean-energy transition to clean up its skies, upgrade its domestic industries, create jobs for its citizens, strengthen trade ties, and build new markets in emerging economies. In turn, it's using those business links to accrue soft power and extend its influence—all while the US turns it back on global institutions.

These widening relationships increasingly insulate China from external pressures, including those threatened by Trump's go-to tactic: igniting or inflaming trade wars. 

But stiff tariffs and tough talk aren't what built the world's largest economy and established the US as the global force in technology for more than a century. What did was deep, sustained federal investment into education, science, and research and development—the very budget items that Trump and his party have been so eager to eliminate. 

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to revoke the Obama-era “endangerment finding,” the legal foundation for regulating the nation's greenhouse-gas pollution. 

The agency's argument leans heavily on a report that rehashes decades-old climate-denial talking points to assert that rising emissions haven't produced the harms that scientists expected. It's a wild, Orwellian plea for you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears in a summer that saw record heat waves in the Midwest and East and is now blanketing the West in wildfire smoke.

Over the weekend, more than 85 scientists sent a point-by-point, 459-page rebuttal to the federal government, highlighting myriad ways in which the report “is biased, full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making,” as Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers, put it on Bluesky.

“The authors reached these flawed conclusions through selective filtering of evidence (‘cherry picking'), overemphasis of uncertainties, misquoting peer-reviewed research, and a general dismissal of the vast majority of decades of peer-reviewed research,” the dozens of reviewers found.The Trump administration handpicked researchers who would write the report it wanted to support its quarrel with thermometers and justify its preordained decision to rescind the endangerment finding. But it's legally bound to hear from others as well, notes Karen McKinnon, a climate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Luckily, there is time to take action,” McKinnon said in a statement. “Comment on the report, and contact your representatives to let them know we need to take action to bring back the tolerable summers of years past.”

Vouched, the Seattle startup that uses AI to help companies verify identity, raised $17 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Spring Rock Ventures.

Vouched's software has traditionally worked by analyzing images of photo identity documents such as driver's licenses. The technology compares a user's selfie to confirm identity, while also looking for signs of tampering, examining addresses and checking everything against databases. The idea is to provide fraud detection of a person in real-time.

But CEO Peter Horadan said investor interest was driven by a “new future of identity” that he says is coming and will drive profound changes in the way that we all do business together.

The first is mobile driver's licenses — currently available in about 15 states (but not Washington). These licenses live on a person's smartphone and cryptographic material tied to the license is only given up by a person's biometrics, such as thumbprint or facial ID.

“For example, we could be online, and I could say, ‘Show me your ID.' The phone will ask for your biometric, and then it'll provide that ID,” Horadan said. “So now I have absolutely foolproof proof that this person is, in fact, who they say they are, and that they're here live right now.”

The second big identity verification need coming is because of AI agents. The personal digital assistants can make a reservation, do your banking, log into your work systems, and more.

“The problem is, you have to give it your username and password, which is a giant security risk,” Horadan said. “And so for the new agentic future, we've released our ‘Know Your Agent' platform, and it allows people to know what are good agents and what are bad agents, and which agents can [they] trust with that information.” 

Earlier this year, Vouched launched KnowThat.ai, an agent reputation directory, as part of the Know Your Agent (KYA) suite. Powered by AI to safeguard against AI, it's all designed to provide continuous monitoring of agent behavior and proactively detect anomalous or potentially malicious activity.

“We're seeing very strong growth and very strong demand for what we're doing,” Horadan said, adding that the company is above $10 million in annual recurring revenue.

Customers are across industries including healthcare and telemedicine, fintech, and auto. 

Founded in 2018, Vouched was spun out of Madrona Venture Labs, the onetime accelerator that was absorbed back into the Madrona venture firm in Seattle.

The startup raised $6.3 million in February 2023 and has raised $22 million to date. Vouched employs 40 people.

Horadan joined Vouched as CEO last year. He's a seasoned tech executive who spent two years at The Sage Group, which acquired Lockstep, an accounting software startup he co-founded in 2022. He was previously executive vice president of engineering and CTO at tax software giant Avalara, and also led teams at Microsoft and Concur. 

“What other people think of as boring, back-end business processes, they actually have tremendous value, because every business has to do them. And when you automate it, there's a real ROI that's created,” Horadan said. “It's interesting that Seattle is such a hub for these kind of plays.”

HBM may soon be edged out in some use cases

Memory startup d-Matrix is claiming its 3D stacked memory will be up to 10x faster and run at up to 10x greater speeds than HBM. d-Matrix's 3D digital in-memory compute (3DIMC) technology is the company's solution for a memory type purpose-built for AI inference.High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, has become an essential part of AI and high-performance computing. HBM memory stacks memory modules on top of each other to more efficiently connect memory dies and access higher memory performance. However, while its popularity and use continue to expand, HBM may not be the best solution for all computational tasks; where it is key for AI training, it can be outmatched in AI inference.To this end, d-Matrix has just brought its d-Matrix Pavehawk 3DIMC silicon online in the lab. Digital in-memory compute hardware currently looks like LPDDR5 memory dies with DIMC chiplets stacked on top, attached via an interposer. This setup allows the DIMC hardware to perform computations within the memory itself. The DIMC logic dies are tuned for matrix-vector multiplication, a common calculation used by transformer-based AI models in operation. "We believe the future of AI inference depends on rethinking not just compute, but memory itself," said Sid Sheth, founder and CEO of d-Matrix, in a recent LinkedIn post. "AI inference is bottlenecked by memory, not just FLOPs. Models are growing fast, and traditional HBM memory systems are getting very costly, power hungry, and bandwidth limited. 3DIMC changes the game. By stacking memory in three dimensions and bringing it into tighter integration with compute, we dramatically reduce latency, improve bandwidth, and unlock new efficiency gains."With Pavehawk currently running in d-Matrix's labs, the firm is already looking ahead to its next generation, Raptor. In a company blog post as well as Sheth's LinkedIn announcement, the firm claims that this next-gen, also built on a chiplet model, will be the one to outpace HBM by 10x in inference tasks while using 90% less power. The d-Matrix DIMC project follows a pattern we've seen in recent startups and from tech theorists: positing that specific computational tasks, such as AI training vs. inference, should have hardware specifically designed to efficiently handle just that task. d-Matrix holds that AI inference, which now makes up 50% of some hyperscalers' AI workloads, is a different-enough task than training that it deserves a memory type built for it.A replacement for HBM is also attractive from a financial standpoint. HBM is only produced by a handful of global companies, including SK hynix, Samsung, and Micron, and its prices are anything but cheap. SK hynix recently estimated that the HBM market will grow by 30% every year until 2030, with price tags rising to follow demand. An alternative to this giant may be attractive to thrifty AI buyers — though a memory made exclusively for certain workflows and calculations may also seem a bit too myopic for bubble-fearing potential clients.

Google may have given up on making Android tablets, but Samsung is putting along. Last week, Samsung announced a budget slate—the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite—but now it's time for flagship tablets. At IFA 2025, the tech exhibition in Berlin, the company announced the next-gen Galaxy Tab S11 series, comprising the Tab S11 and the Tab S11 Ultra. Also in tow is the Galaxy S25 FE (Fan Edition), a midrange Android phone that marks the fifth entry in the Galaxy S25 series.

The Galaxy Tab S11 costs $800, while the Tab S11 Ultra is $1,200, and the Galaxy S25 FE starts at $650. All of these devices are available for purchase today. Here's what you need to know.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra are the iPad Pro of the Android world, boasting flagship specs across the board. They can even match Apple's latest slate in one key metric: thickness. Apple highlighted the remarkable thinness of the M4-powered iPad Pro when it launched in 2024, and now the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra matches it—both Apple's and Samsung's top-tier tablets are a mere 0.20 inches thick (5.1 mm). The cheaper Tab S11 is 0.22 inches, which is a hair thicker than the 11-inch iPad Pro. Samsung's tablets are slightly heavier, though.

Unlike the prior generation Tab S10 series, there's no middle “Plus” model anymore. You have the 11-inch Tab S11 and the gargantuan 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra. Both run Android 16 out of the box, have 120-Hz AMOLED displays, and can hit a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. Samsung's S Pen stylus is bundled as usual, but it has been redesigned for the first time in years, with a hexagonal design for better grip and a cone-shaped tip for increased tilt angles and finer control. It magnetically sticks to the top edge of the slate for storage and charging.

Once again, Samsung employs a MediaTek processor, the Dimensity 9400+, which is competitive with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. They start with 12 GB of RAM, but the Ultra's 1-terabyte model bumps that up to 16 GB. (Storage is expandable via microSD.) The tablets are IP68-rated, have in-display fingerprint sensors, and support 45-watt charging speeds to fill the 8,400- and 11,600-mAh batteries, respectively.

Samsung is playing up the AI features on these tablets, which support Google's Gemini Live multimodal capabilities, so you can chat in real time with the assistant and even show it what you're seeing with the tablet's cameras. Then there's Galaxy AI features from Samsung's phones, like Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into AI-generated art, and Writing Assist, which can rephrase your words into a different tone.

None of this is new, but there are some upgrades to Samsung's DeX platform, which converts the tablet OS into a traditional desktop-like user interface, with windowed apps and a dock. A new Extended Mode lets you convert the Tab S11 tablets into an external monitor, running DeX across the tablet and a paired display for dual-screen multitasking. You can even drag and drop apps and content between the two screens. DeX also now supports up to four workspaces, so you can create four desktops catered to specific tasks and cycle between them. These tablets support Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard Slim, a keyboard cover that brings them closer in design to a 2-in-1 detachable laptop.

Outside of the screen and battery sizes, the Tab S11 Ultra has a few extra perks over the Tab S11. It has Wi-Fi 7 support versus Wi-Fi 6E, making it a little more future-proof (you need a Wi-Fi 7 router to take advantage). It has an extra 8-MP ultrawide camera on the rear, and the base model starts with 256 GB instead of 128.

The Ultra is a rare beast—one of the only Android tablets you can find at this size. But once you add the Book Cover Keyboard Slim, you're looking at a $1,410 package. You can buy a MacBook Air for under $1,000 these days, and prior experience with older Tab Ultra models has proven that it's difficult to wield as a tablet due to its massive size.

It's a good thing these slates will be supported for seven years; they'll continue getting new features and security patches over that time, giving you more bang for your buck.

The year began with the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphones—Samsung's flagship trio. Then in the spring, Samsung debuted the first-ever Galaxy S25 Edge, an ultra-thin and lightweight version of the Galaxy S25 phones, with a mix of features between the S25+ and S25 Ultra (plus lackluster battery life). Now, the final device to round out the series is the Galaxy S25 FE, which stands for Fan Edition. It's what the company typically uses to denote midrange or budget versions of its products.

The Galaxy S25 FE offers a very similar experience to the Galaxy S25+ but with lesser specs. It retains the 6.7-inch screen size, for example, but with an adaptive refresh rate that switches from 60 to 120 Hz depending on what's on the screen. (The S25+ can drop as low as 1 Hz for more battery savings.) The screen also doesn't get as bright.

It's powered by Samsung's Exynos 2400 chipset, the same chipset inside the Galaxy Z Fold7 FE, with 8 GB of RAM. This is a nearly identical chipset used in last year's Galaxy S24 FE, but with slightly faster clock speeds, so you can expect a marginal performance boost. You get 128 GB of storage, with the option to upgrade to 256 GB. (No microSD card slot here.)

Compared to the S24 FE, Samsung says it has upped the size of the vapor chamber cooling system by 10 percent. Better cooling means better sustained performance during intensive tasks, like gaming. It manages this despite being 8 percent slimmer, measuring just 7.4 mm.

It boasts the same 4,900-mAh battery capacity, and the FE supports 45-watt fast-charging. If you use the right charging adapter, that'll net you up to 65 percent in 30 minutes. There's wireless charging too, and it's the Qi2 Ready flavor like the rest of the Galaxy S25 series. That means, unlike the latest Google Pixel 10 phones, there are no native magnets inside; you'll have to use a magnetic Qi2 case to achieve Qi2 wireless charging speeds and efficiency.

You still get a triple-camera system, with a 50-MP main sensor, 8-MP telephoto (3X zoom), and 12-MP ultrawide, plus a 12-MP selfie camera. Many of the same AI features from the flagships are available here, like Instant Slow-Mo, which lets you add slow-motion to existing videoclips, and Audio Eraser, which can cut specific sounds from your footage, like wind noise, crowd, or music.

The newly announced Galaxy S25 FE and Galaxy Tab S11 series are available today, but it's also the launch day for the previously announced Galaxy Tab S10 Lite ($350) and Galaxy Buds3 FE earbuds ($150). Stay tuned for our reviews.

Year after year, humans pump more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere than nature can remove, fueling global warming. As the need to mitigate climate change becomes increasingly urgent, scientists are developing ways to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere in addition to cutting emissions.

One of the biggest hurdles to scaling current carbon capture technologies is the vast amount of energy they consume, but what if there was an alternative that uses an abundant, cheap power source? A team of researchers at Harvard University recently took a major step toward that goal. Their technique, outlined in a Nature Chemistry study published August 13, harnesses sunlight to efficiently trap CO2.

They're not talking about slapping solar panels on direct air capture systems that run on heat and electricity. This approach is based on specially designed molecules that use light to change their chemical state and reversibly trap CO2.

The methodology the researchers developed is a significant departure from leading direct air capture technologies. These systems tend to rely on chemical solvents or porous sorbents that readily bond to CO2, pulling it out of the air. But the ability to reuse those materials—and harness the carbon for practical use—requires a huge input of energy (usually heat) to release the trapped carbon into a container.

“If you want a practical way to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and then release it into a tank where you can use it, you need the solution—or whatever medium you're going to use—to be able to both capture and release. That's the key,” co-author Richard Liu, an assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard, told Gizmodo.

“Our innovation here is that we began thinking about whether you could use light directly to do that,” he explained.

To that end, Liu's team synthesized organic molecules called “fluorenyl photobases” that do exactly that. When exposed to sunlight, they rapidly release hydroxide ions that capture CO2 from ambient air by chemically binding to it. In the absence of light, the reaction reverses, releasing the trapped CO2 and reverting the photobase back to its original state.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers determined that the most effective fluorenyl photobase for CO2 capture was PBMeOH. This molecule showed no CO2 capture in the dark but the highest capture rate when exposed to light. What's more, testing showed that a PBMeOH-based carbon capture system is stable and can complete many cycles with minimal loss of efficiency.

“They only fade about 1% per cycle, so you could imagine only replenishing every 100 cycles,” Liu explained.

This work demonstrates a reversible system for carbon capture that relies solely on sunlight as the direct energy input, highlighting photobases as a promising alternative to traditional sorbents.

The results are encouraging, but Liu and his colleagues will need to clear several hurdles before they can turn their framework into real-world technologies. They're already working to address several challenges, such as the engineering aspects of how the system will expose these compounds to light and dark.

While the “best” approach is still unknown, photochemical systems present some key advantages over existing technologies, Liu said. Exploring new ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is more urgent than ever before. “Because we can't get rid of every source in the short term, carbon capture from the atmosphere—and from point sources, especially—is going to be an important part of the solution.”

Salesforce is laying off 93 workers in Washington, according to a notification filed Wednesday with the state's Employment Security Department. 

The San Francisco-based company has offices in Seattle and Bellevue. A Salesforce spokesperson did not provide details about which roles were impacted.

“We continuously assess our structure and rebalance as needed to best serve our customers and fuel growth areas,” a spokesperson said by email.  

Salesforce has more than 3,000 employees in the Seattle area, according to LinkedIn data. The company provides cloud-based software that includes customer relationship management tools.

In 2019, Salesforce acquired Seattle-based Tableau for $15.7 billion. It has significantly reduced Tableau's footprint in the city, exiting office space in the Fremont neighborhood. The company laid off roughly 10% of its workforce in the region in January 2023. 

In an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company had cut 4,000 of its customer support roles from a previous headcount of 9,000 thanks to new efficiencies gained through AI. 

It's not clear if the layoffs in Seattle and Bellevue are related to the customer support cutbacks.

Earlier this summer, Benioff announced that up to half of the company's work is now being done with AI tools. 

Benioff this year has also taken shots at Microsoft, the company's Seattle-area rival, criticizing the artificial intelligence initiatives offered by the competition while rolling out its own Agentforce platform.

Salesforce reported revenue growth of 10%, to $10.2 billion, in its fiscal second quarter earnings released Wednesday. The company's stock fell 5% in after-hours trading on weak revenue guidance.

Other tech companies including Oracle, Rec Room, F5, Microsoft, and T-Mobile have laid off staff this summer in the Seattle region.

Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his NBA team, the Los Angeles Clippers, are disputing a report alleging the team funneled $28 million to star player Kawhi Leonard through an endorsement deal designed to circumvent NBA salary cap rules.

A new investigation from former ESPN reporter Pablo Torre focuses on a $28 million endorsement deal in 2022 between Leonard, one of the NBA's biggest stars, and Aspiration, a sustainability company that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Torre, who interviewed former Aspiration employees, reported that the deal helped the Clippers evade the NBA's salary cap. 

The arrangement between Leonard and Aspiration was allegedly a “no-show job” contract, Torre reported.

One month after the Clippers signed Leonard to a $176.3 million extension in August 2021, Ballmer personally invested $50 million into Aspiration, according to Torre. That same September, Aspiration also announced a $300 million sponsorship deal with the team.

The NBA said it is investigating the matter.  

In a statement to GeekWire, the Clippers and Steve Ballmer denied the allegations. Here's the statement in full:

“Neither the Clippers nor Steve Ballmer circumvented the salary cap. The notion that Steve invested in Aspiration in order to funnel money to Kawhi Leonard is absurd. Steve invested because Aspiration's co-founders presented themselves as committed to doing right by their customers while protecting the environment. 

After a long campaign of market manipulation, which defrauded not only Steve but numerous other investors and sports teams, Aspiration filed for bankruptcy. Its co-founder, Joseph Sanberg, recently pleaded guilty to a $243 million fraud. Neither Steve nor the Clippers had knowledge of any improper activity by Aspiration or its co-founder until after the government initiated its investigation. Aspiration was a team sponsor for the 2021- 2022 and 2022- 2023 seasons before defaulting on its contract.  

There is nothing unusual or untoward about team sponsors doing endorsement deals with players on the same team. Neither Steve nor the Clippers organization had any oversight of Kawhi's independent endorsement agreement with Aspiration. To say otherwise is flat-out wrong.

The Clippers take NBA compliance extremely seriously, fully respect the league's rules, and welcome its investigation related to Aspiration. The Clippers will also continue to cooperate with law enforcement in its investigation into Aspiration's blatantly fraudulent activity.”

Aspiration, which offered banking and other services for sustainability-related initiatives, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. The company's co-founder, Joseph Sanberg, was charged last month and agreed to plead guilty to defrauding investors and lenders.

Potential penalties for skirting NBA salary cap rules can involve fines, loss of future draft picks, or even voiding contracts, as seen in the league's 2000 punishment of the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The NBA previously investigated complaints involving Leonard and improper benefits.

Ballmer, who led Microsoft as CEO from 2000 to 2014, bought the Clippers in 2014 for $2 billion, which was a record at the time. The team is now worth $5.4 billion, the eighth-most valuable NBA franchise, according to CNBC. Ballmer's net worth is more than $174 billion, according to Bloomberg.

— Elizabeth “Liz” Hamren is now CEO of AllTrails, a company that connects people with outdoor experiences through trail and national park information.

“Throughout my career, I've been inspired by the power of technology to make people's lives better. The benefits of time outside are universal, and AllTrails is unique in its ability to connect the two, helping people find joy and fulfillment by exploring the outdoors,” Hamren said on LinkedIn. 

Seattle-based Hamren joins AllTrails from Ring, the home security company that was acquired by Amazon in 2018 for a reported $1 billion. Hamren was CEO of the company for two years, taking the helm from Ring founder Jamie Siminoff.

Earlier in her career, Hamren was at Microsoft for nearly a decade, split between two stints. During her second tenure, she served as a leader of Xbox product and engineering. Hamren was also chief operating officer for Discord before going to Ring. 

— Adam Selipsky, former CEO of Amazon Web Services, is joining the investment firm KKR as a senior technology and AI strategy advisor. 

Selipsky said he'll work closely with KKR leadership “on strategy, capital allocation, and governance, with a focus on the convergence of compute, data centers, fiber, and energy required to scale AI globally” while also supporting portfolio companies.

KKR reports that it has $42 billion of equity in digital infrastructure through 23 investments, plus an additional $20 billion backing ventures in power and renewables.

Selipsky joined AWS in 2005 and departed 11 years later to become CEO of Seattle-based Tableau Software. He led Tableau for more than five years, then returned to AWS as CEO of the Amazon cloud unit. Selipsky left AWS again last year.

In July, he was appointed to the board of directors for Circle Internet Group, an international financial technology company.

— Florin Rotar is now executive vice president and group chief technology officer for Atos, a France-based cloud and information technology company.

“I sought a challenge defined by profound impact and the opportunity to drive significant change” alongside talented colleagues and “world-class leaders,” Rotar said on LinkedIn. “I believe I have found that mission at Atos.”

In June, Rotar left Avanade after a 25-year career at the Seattle-area IT services and consulting firm. Rotar joined Avanade as its first employee in Europe and held roles including chief AI officer and chief technologist. Avanade provides various digital, cloud and AI-related services across the Microsoft ecosystem.

— Harshitha Amit is now director of engineering for AI and machine learning infrastructure at the cloud company CoreWeave.

“After a decade building AI/ML infrastructure at leading companies, I'm now at the heart of AI innovation — where the infrastructure itself is the product,” Amit said on LinkedIn. 

This spring, Seattle-based Amit launched HA Arts, which blends AI and human artistry to produce commissioned artwork. She was previously head of engineering for the digital payment platform Stripe, and earlier spent 12 years at Microsoft where she worked on machine learning efforts within Azure.

Last week, CoreWeave's Chetan Kapoor shared that he was stepping down as CoreWeave's chief product officer.

— University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design has appointed two leaders: 

— Amy Harder, a former vice president of Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy and executive editor of Cipher, is now the national energy correspondent for Axios. Harder led Cipher for nearly four years, until the climate change publication funded by Breakthrough Energy wound down operations in July.

Seattle-based Harder previously worked for Axios in Washington, D.C., and reported on energy for the Wall Street Journal.

— Mary Agnes “Maggie” Wilderotter resigned from the board of directors for Sana Biotechnology, a Seattle-based cell and gene therapy company. Wilderotter's career includes CEO roles at Grand Reserve Inn, Wink Communications and Frontier Communications, as well as a senior vice president of global strategy at Microsoft in the early 2000s.

Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. People just adore their reMarkable devices. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display.

See reMarkable Paper Pro at Amazon

Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately.

It's a handsome device that works exactly like a smaller version of the Paper Pro. About the only thing that I find a turnoff is the thick, inch-ish tall bezel on the bottom of the 1,696 x 954 color E Ink display. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. On the plus side, the density of the pixels is higher compared to the Paper Pro—264 PPI versus 229 PPI—which means content does appear just a smidge sharper. reMarkable says the Paper Pro Move can render the same 20,000 colors as the Paper Pro.

I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital.

The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. The handwriting-to-text recognition is also hit or miss—even AI can't perfectly convert the worst chicken scratch. Sorry, doctors, your unreadable handwriting is probably still unreadable to artificial intelligence.

 

The Paper Pro Move comes with 64GB of storage, which is good for up to 810 digital notebooks, and is the same amount you get in the Paper Pro. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.”

Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. It's not going to be for everyone—get an iPad if you want a multipurpose tablet that does messaging, videos, games, music, and more—but it's definitely for somebody who wants a focused device for jotting stuff down and will pay for it. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. The Paper Pro Move with Marker costs $449, but there's also a bundle that includes the Marker Plus, which comes with an eraser on the end, for $499. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

Nearly six decades after its invention, the design of the computer mouse has remained largely unchanged - with serious consequences for users.

A new study led by Jose Berengueres, Associate Professor at the School of Engineering and Digital Sciences of Nazarbayev University (NU), Kazakhstan, together with Tony Yu from the University of Melbourne, emphasizes the urgent need for ergonomic redesigns that better fit the human hand and prevent long-term injury.

Key findings: nearly 20% of users suffer from chronic disorders related to mouse use. Tests with students at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) revealed high levels of discomfort, especially among gamers under 30.

Professor Berengueres tested two prototypes:

Fleximouse - a squeezable mesh-body device that encouraged a natural palmar grasp.

A-frame hinge mouse - developed with Tony Yu, University of Melbourne, offering vertical orientation, fewer moving parts, and lower production cost.

A critical insight emerged: fit matters. Even a 1 cm difference in hand size strongly affected comfort and usability.

With new tools such as 3D printing, flexible electronics, and advanced materials, researchers see an opportunity to finally re-engineer one of the most widely used digital tools.

The mouse is long overdue for reinvention. Done right, it could make computing healthier and more comfortable for millions."

Repetitive strain injuries are a growing concern worldwide, especially for young people who spend long hours at computers or gaming. Healthier device design could improve wellbeing, reduce medical costs, and boost productivity across industries.

With 3D printing, flexible electronics, and advanced materials, researchers see an opportunity to create customizable mice that adapt to hand size and movement.

"The mouse is long overdue for reinvention," says Prof. Berengueres. "Done right, it could make computing healthier and more comfortable for millions."

The research group led by Drs. Mitsuru Arase, Mari Murakami, and Prof. Kiyoshi Takeda (Graduate School of Medicine/ Immunology Frontier Research Center at The University of Osaka) revealed that transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40 play crucial roles in inducing T cells involved in Crohn's disease.

Crohn's disease is an intractable disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which persist in long-term in the intestinal mucosa, have been implicated in disease pathogenesis, but it has not been clear how these cells are induced.In this study, though comprehensive single-cell analysis of gut T cells from Crohn's disease patients, the research group identified the accumulation of TRM with high expression of transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40. RUNX2 is known as a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation and maturation; however, a different RUNX2 variant was expressed in Crohn's disease TRM, distinct from that found in bone.Overexpression of RUNX2 and BHLHE40 in blood-derived T cells from healthy individuals enhanced the production of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (GZMB), and promoted tissue-retentive properties. Conversely, repression of these factors in patient-derived gut T cells reduced their inflammatory and tissue-retaining characteristics.These findings indicate that RUNX2 and BHLHE40 drive pathogenic TRM differentiation and may represent novel therapeutic targets for chronic inflammation and relapse in Crohn's disease.

In this research, we successfully identified a factor that induces T cells involved in the symptoms of Crohn's disease. We sincerely hope that the results of this study will contribute to the development of new diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for Crohn's disease. We extend our deepest gratitude to all collaborators and to the patients who generously provided samples for this study."

Is it possible to treat obesity without reducing food intake? A new study co-led by Dr. Antonio Zorzano and Dr. Manuela Sánchez-Feutrie at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) suggests that this might be a possibility, at least in animal models. Published in Nature Communications, the research identifies a key role for Neuritin 1, a protein previously linked to the nervous system, which is also produced in brown adipose tissue, where it acts as a powerful driver of energy expenditure and metabolic health.

Unlike current anti-obesity and antidiabetic drugs, such as Ozempic or tirzepatide, which work by suppressing appetite, Neuritin 1 boosts energy burning without affecting food intake.

By increasing the levels of Neuritin 1 specifically in brown fat, we observed that the animals burned more energy, which helped prevent fat accumulation."

Dr. Antonio Zorzano, professor at the University of Barcelona and researcher at CIBERDEM

This metabolic boost led to significant improvements in several health indicators, including reduced weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower liver inflammation, even in animals fed high-calorie diets.

Previously described for its role in neuronal plasticity, Neuritin 1 is now shown to have a metabolic function in brown fat, a type of fat specialised in generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. This process involves burning energy to maintain body temperature, particularly in response to cold. In this context, Neuritin 1 stimulates mitochondrial activity and promotes the expression of thermogenic genes.

To trigger its expression, the researchers used a viral vector that drives Neuritin 1 overexpression exclusively in thermogenic fat cells. The result was a sustained increase in metabolic activity, without affecting food consumption or physical activity in the animals.

"These findings point to Neuritin 1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating obesity and its associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, through a mechanism that differs from current approaches," highlights Dr. Sánchez-Feutrie.

Beyond the animal model results, genetic data in humans also show a correlation between Neuritin 1 and susceptibility to obesity, reinforcing the potential relevance of the discovery. The team is currently exploring ways to translate these findings into a future therapeutic strategy.

The study was made possible thanks to the contributions of several IRB Barcelona core facilities, including Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Functional Genomics, Protein Expression, and Histopathology. It also involved collaborators from international institutions such as the CNRS (France), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), and the University of Houston (USA).

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer offers an accurate, non-invasive way to assess microbiome function through breath analysis.

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer is a handheld sensor system designed for at-home collection and analysis of hydrogen and methane gases produced by the fermentation of undigested sugars by the gut microbiome. This portable device provides accurate, on-demand breath testing, making it a practical tool for both clinical trials and research applications.

Paired with a user-friendly smartphone app, the Breath Analyzer allows individuals to log food intake and symptoms alongside their breath readings. This integrated data can then be accessed by researchers for longitudinal monitoring of gut microbiome responses across a range of clinical study designs.

To ensure accuracy comparable to in-clinic hydrogen methane breath tests (HMBT), the OMED Health team conducted extensive validation. This included building an in-house synthetic breath rig and benchmarking the device against a clinically established HMBT system.

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer leverages MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) sensor technology to measure hydrogen and methane levels in exhaled breath. To ensure accuracy, a diffusion membrane filters the breath sample, minimizing the influence of interfering compounds on sensor performance. Additionally, a protective mesh prevents moisture condensation on the sensors, helping to maintain a stable baseline.

Their streamlined workflows enable customized antigen delivery within weeks, accelerating the industry-standard timelines which traditionally have taken years. This significantly reduces timelines across discovery, design review, validation, and product development pipelines.

The launch of our sister company addresses today's and tomorrow's global challenges in the supply of critical raw materials. Hannah and the team at Logical Antigen are amongst the very best in the world at what they do, providing deep expertise in protein purification, as well as serum and plasma engineering. This launch strengthens our ‘One Logical' offering and demonstrates our ambition to be the partner of choice, delivering at scale for diagnostics leaders.”

Stephane Argivier, Chief Executive, Logical Biological

Hannah McIntosh, Managing Director of Logical Antigen, commented: “Logical Antigen was born from the urgent need for faster and more flexible development of antigens and biologicals. We've assembled a brilliant team with complementary expertise, working from state-of-the-art facilities at Discovery Park. By combining our specialist protein purification knowledge with Logical Biological's industry-leading expertise, we are entering a new era of protein engineering, supporting faster and more accurate detection of diseases.”

Based alongside Logical Biological at Discovery Park in Kent, UK, Logical Antigen is now operating out of a new, purpose built laboratory space. Structured as ‘One Logical' family of companies, Logical Antigen's commercial and business support functions will be delivered by the existing team at Logical Biological.

Logical Antigen's customization capabilities are based on refined extraction, isolation, and purification techniques, from native biological sources, to preserve structural conformation, post-translational modifications, and biological activity. The expert team will also offer recombinant antigen development services to support diverse project requirements and achieve superior performance through novel downstream purification protocols. The team is able to rapidly scale up production to meet growing demand without compromizing on quality or delivery timelines.

Alongside their antigen focus, Logical Antigen will also support Logical Biological by increasing customization options, including delivering processed biospecimen, bulk serum and plasma. Logical Antigen's scientific expertise, combined with Logical Biological's in-depth knowledge of IVD applications, will enable the development of products precisely aligned to customer needs.

The launch marks the latest phase in Logical Biological's strategic expansion, supported by strong financial performance with EBITDA figures up nearly 30% on FY24. Building on initial capabilities in biospecimens and bulk disease state plasma, the company continues to invest into customization capabilities to deliver critical components for IVD controls and calibrators, with further capability expansion planned for the future.

New research reveals that even highly trained esports athletes can't escape wrist fatigue during marathon sessions, with short breaks offering no relief and game genre shaping the strain.

Study: Wrist extensor fatigue and game-genre-specific kinematic changes in esports athletes: a quasi-experimental study. Image credit: Prostock-studio/Shutterstock.com

Electronic sports (esports) or competitive gaming for long periods can cause long-term musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Muscular fatigue reduces performance, endangers safety, and is a health hazard in sports and daily activities. A recent paper published in BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation explores this aspect relative to wrist movement across various video games.

Esports are watched by millions and played by thousands worldwide, especially young people. Esports athletes train 4-10 hours/day to perform at the highest levels to compete in regulated tournaments. The duration of practice varies with the skill level and the game genre.

Esports combine musculoskeletal loading of certain muscle groups, high cognitive-process demands, and long sitting times, which are linked to poor health outcomes. Thus, these demands are comparable to those in computer work, piano playing, and air traffic control, where MSD risks are elevated. High-performing esports players use repetitive movements (mouse clicks and keystrokes) with high frequencies of actions per minute, over 500 in some game genres. Without proper breaks, this can cause muscular fatigue, potentially leading to overuse injuries or MSD.

Muscular fatigue is “a reduction in maximal force or power production in response to contractile activity”. It can be peripheral or central, depending on whether it affects the neuromuscular junction or the brain, respectively.

Not much research has been conducted on these aspects of esports, though mobile phone gaming may cause more muscular fatigue in non-professional gamers. Compared to amateurs, professionals have smoother, more accurate, and faster movements related to their games.

The game genre also modifies the player's kinematics. First-person shooters (FPS) and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) players have faster hand acceleration, more repetitive movements, and a longer cumulative hand movement distance than those who play adventure video games.

The current study aimed to cover research gaps in this field, such as how esports affect muscular fatigue and wrist kinematics.

The study included 32 healthy male esports athletes, with a mean age of 24. They had an average body mass index (BMI) of 24.8 kg/m2. Physical activity was, on average, ~308 minutes a week. The mean game experience was 12 years, with gaming occupying a mean of 3.6 hours a day.

Nearly 70% were MOBA players, likelier to play at highly competitive levels than FPS players. They participated in two competitive video gaming sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The sessions were separated by a 10-minute passive sitting break during which the participants sat and rested.

Muscle activity and wrist kinematics were recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) of the upper trapezius and wrist extensors. These showed increasing muscle fatigue over time, signaled by a reduction in the frequency spectrum of the EMG.

This was demonstrated by the significantly lower median frequency (MDF) of both left and right wrist extensors (by about 3%-4%) with time. Only the right side showed a decrease for the upper trapezius, but this was not confirmed in post-hoc analysis. No significant change occurred in the trapezius, perhaps because the hands are more involved in such sports, or because of greater inter-individual variability in trapezius measures.

Unexpectedly, the root mean square (RMS) also decreased over time. This finding may be explained by the behavior of motor units during low-intensity intermittent motor tasks like competitive gaming. It could also be due to the unpredictable duration of individual gaming sessions, which allows partial muscle recovery and reduces the continuity of neuromuscular loading. This might account for the atypical EMG fatigue patterns compared to conventional constant-load tasks. This offers a field for further study.

Over 95% of the time, the wrist joint position was in the neutral zone, though this was less for FPS players than for MOBA players. The video game genre was associated with differences in the wrist kinematics, but these parameters did not significantly change over time. While FPS players' cumulative distances decreased across sessions and MOBA players showed a decrease followed by an increase, the study emphasized that these were not statistically significant effects.

The area of displacement increased, while zero-crossings decreased over time for both FPS and MOBA players. However, zero-crossings increased at the fourth measurement for both, reaching or crossing the baseline.

These group differences could be due to the greater precision required for FPS games, which involve more upper extremity use and strategically lowered mouse sensitivity settings. The game genre and mouse settings contribute to greater hand movement to increase performance levels.

Finally, there was no reduction in the physical load after the 10-minute passive break. Preventive interventions should include more physically active breaks between games to reduce muscle fatigue and improve cognitive function. Moreover, regular exercise should be incorporated into the daily routine to improve muscle health and prevent premature muscle fatigue and MSD. The authors also note that short in-game pauses, such as respawns or matchmaking, may allow partial recovery, potentially influencing fatigue patterns.

The study indicates that wrist extensor fatigue increases over 3-4 hours of esports, across all video game genres. In contrast, the effect on wrist kinematics depends on the type of game (FPS > MOBA) but does not significantly change over time.

Cumulative muscular fatigue is likely with such games since the break did not bring about any observable neuromuscular recovery. This indicates that a higher MSD risk is possible with repetitive loading.

“Implementing preventive training strategies and regular active breaks may help mitigate these effects in esports athletes.”

The authors also caution that the study was limited to male players, had more MOBA than FPS participants, and lacked a control group, factors that may affect generalizability.

Scientists have found that the diabetes/weight loss drug Semaglutide, sold commercially under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, significantly reduces cocaine-seeking behaviour in rats. This work needs to be confirmed in humans, but it suggests that Semaglutide is a candidate to be developed as a treatment for cocaine dependency; at the moment there is no effective pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependency. The work is published in the September edition of the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology.

Cocaine is the second most popular illegal drug used in Europe. The European Drug Agency reports that around 2.7 million young adults (between the age of 15-34) use cocaine regularly, representing around 2.5% of the population in that age group. Cocaine use in the UK is the second highest in the world, with around 2.7% of adults using the drug (see notes). There is, to date, no effective pharmacological treatment for problematic cocaine use.

Scientists from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and the University of Pennsylvania, led by Professor Elisabet Jerlhag (University of Gothenburg), gave male rats access to directly-injected cocaine, which they could dispense by pressing a lever in the cage. Then an experimental group of 10 of these animals were treated with semaglutide before being given access to the cocaine dispenser.

Elisabet Jerlhag said:

"We found that in comparison to the control animals, self-administration of cocaine use dropped by 26% in those animals which had been given semaglutide. Previous results, both from our group and from other groups, have found that semaglutide can reduce alcohol consumption and craving in both humans and animals, and this work on cocaine seems to reflect these previous findings on alcohol use. This is the first trial showing Semaglutide's potential as a drug for cocaine dependence. 

Importantly, we also found that after a period of abstinence, there was a 62% drop in cocaine seeking in those animals which had taken semaglutide and the motivation (work undertaken to attain the drug) was lowered by 52%. 

This is animal work, so at the moment, we can't say that we have anywhere near a viable treatment for human cocaine dependency. We need a bigger study to confirm these results, and then we need to see if the findings also apply to humans. However, these results are very promising, underlining the need for human studies, especially since there are no existing pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependency".

Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 inhibitors. These drugs (along with the similar drug Mounjaro) have revolutionised the treatment of excess weight, and are now showing promise in the treatment of mental health problems.

Commenting, Professor Christian Hendershot (of the Institute for Addiction at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles) said:

"This is a carefully conducted study that provides additional evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists can reduce cocaine reinforcement. These findings have clinical implications given the challenges identifying medications for stimulant use disorder, and the increasing clinical use of semaglutide in many areas of the world. These findings should encourage clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists for stimulant use disorder".

Professor Hendershot was not involved in this research; this is an independent comment. Professor Hendershot was lead researcher on the first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of semaglutide's effects on alcohol craving in adults.

Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a Danaher company and global leader in laboratory automation and innovation, is redefining nucleic acid quantification through a strategic collaboration with Hombrechtikon Systems Engineering•AG (HSE•AG), a Swiss provider of customized automation and engineering solutions for the life sciences and diagnostics sectors.



This partnership updates and miniaturizes traditional nucleic acid quantification, powered by an automation-first approach that integrates high-throughput liquid handling directly into molecular biology workflows. By streamlining critical processes—from normalization to yield characterization—it bridges existing workflow gaps and empowers real-time, data-driven decision-making within a unified platform. Automated pipetting is seamlessly embedded as a functional extension of the system's ecosystem, driving efficiency and precision at scale.

Integrating the HSE eviDense UV Photometer directly onto the deck of Biomek i-Series automated workstations from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences enables real-time absorbance measurements seamlessly within the liquid handling process to deliver faster, more efficient results while eliminating manual intervention. This technique precisely measures nucleic acid concentration and purity at 260/280 and 260/230 nanometer ratios. The non-destructive analysis allows valuable sample volume to be immediately recovered or advanced through the workflow based on user needs. Designed as a drop-in replacement, the instrument integrates effortlessly into established workflows and protocols, using proven methods to automate and close existing process gaps.

Time is the most critical facet in the laboratory today, and we're always examining workflows to see how we can help laboratories achieve results faster with greater accuracy,

This collaboration is a major step forward in advancing nucleic acid quantification. By enabling this workflow to be executed through a liquid handler, we're uniquely able to help laboratories maximize walk-away time for both extraction and NGS library preparation, empowering researchers to get the answers they seek faster.”

Ewan Grant, Senior Director of the Biotech Business Unit, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences

The partnership also simplifies fluorometric analysis of nucleic acid quantification, delivering results in as little as 20 minutes for 96 samples. By integrating the HSE eviFluor Duo microcuvette-based fluorometer on the deck of a Biomek i-Series Automated Workstation from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, laboratories gain access to a fully automated, end-to-end sample preparation solution. This system enables real-time data generation for immediate, decision-based pipetting—dramatically increasing speed and precision while eliminating manual, error-prone and time-consuming steps.

“The collaboration between Beckman Coulter Life Sciences and HSE marks a significant advancement in lab automation,” said Konstantin Lutze, Chief Technology Officer at HSE. “With the integration of the eviDense UV Photometer and the eviFluor Duo Fluorometer into the Biomek i5 and i7 workstations, both absorbance and fluorescence measurements are performed fully automatically within the liquid handling workflow. This enables highly efficient nucleic acid quantification while enhancing data integrity and measurement consistency. By eliminating manual interactions, the risk of user-induced errors is minimized. Together, we support laboratories in achieving greater efficiency, reliability, and scalability through fully integrated, automated workflows.”

These two innovations empower research laboratories to accelerate drug discovery, reduce manual workload, and improve data reliability across genomic workflows, bringing researchers one step closer to the answers that matter most.

A protein particle hidden within the SARS-CoV-2 virus could lead to longer-lasting, more protective vaccines for COVID-19. 

Scientists from La Trobe University and Kumamoto University in Japan have discovered that the body's immune system strongly reacts to an internal protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which mutates less frequently than the surface-spike protein currently targeted by vaccines.

New research published in Nature Communications shows that these protein particles, known as peptides, appear on the surface of infected cells via an immune molecule called HLA-C, which killer T cells then use to identify and eliminate infection. 

La Trobe University lead researcher Distinguished Professor Stephanie Gras, Deputy Director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS), said the discovery could open the way for the development of new vaccines and treatments that offered protection across multiple strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Currently, vaccines target the spike proteins that decorate the surface of the virus – but they mutate frequently as they are constantly under pressure by our immune cells, which means we might need a new vaccine for each new variant.

We found that the killer T cells, which also fight infection, can be activated by a protein that forms a part of the shell that protects the virus's genetic material, like the yolk of an egg. 

Because this protein is inside the virus, it mutates much less frequently – knowledge which could guide the development of vaccines and therapeutics that are still effective as the virus evolves." 

Stephanie Gras, Deputy Director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS)

Professor Gras said the development of a longer-lasting vaccine could mean that people would need fewer booster vaccines to fight COVID, and help protect against the development of Long COVID.

"The more people get vaccinated, the more we're protecting the population, which helps to reduce the virus's death toll and the impact of the infection itself," Professor Gras said. 

"But there is more than just COVID – we now know that about 10 per cent of the population is impacted by Long COVID and the more you catch the virus, the more likely you can develop Long COVID."

Professor Gras, Dr Demetra Chatzileontiadou, Dr Janesha Maddumage, and PhD candidate You Min Ahn led the research team at LIMS and La Trobe University's School of Biomedicine, Agriculture and Environment (SABE).

It was funded through Professor Gras's National Health and Medical Research Centre (NHMRC) Leadership Investigator Grant (L2) and her Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant to investigate COVID. 

The research was done in collaboration with Associate Professor Chihiro Motozono and Yoshihiko Goto from the Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection at Kumamoto University in Japan, with data collection by the Australian Synchrotron. 

Professor Gras will also lead a new research centre at La Trobe University which aims to uncover the cause of Long COVID and other life-limiting post-viral infections such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). 

The Post-Acute Viral Infection diseases Group (PAVING) Centre of Research Excellence has received $3 million in Federal funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Researchers at McMaster University have discovered that a rare but dangerous reaction to a widely used blood thinner is caused by a single antibody – overturning decades of medical misunderstanding and opening the door to more precise ways of diagnosing and treating this medical complication.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 3, 2025, focused on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious immune complication that affects approximately one per cent of hospitalized patients treated with the blood thinner heparin. Nearly half of those who develop HIT experience life-threatening blood clots, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, amputations, and even death, making early detection and treatment critically important.

Until now, scientists believed that the immune response causing HIT involved many different types of antibodies working together. But this research has revealed something surprising: in every patient studied, only one antibody was causing the disease, while the rest created what the researchers describe as a kind of "smokescreen," making it harder to identify the true culprit. This discovery helps pinpoint the exact source of the problem, opening the door to more accurate diagnosis and better-targeted treatments.

This study not only challenges our existing understanding of HIT but also revolutionizes how we think about the immune response overall."

Ishac Nazy, senior author of the study and scientific director of the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory and co-director of the Michael G. DeGroote Center for Transfusion Research (MCTR)

"This work corrects decades of misunderstanding in HIT. This status quo was a key reason behind the high rate of false-positive test results and frequent misdiagnoses in HIT, which can lead to severe consequences for patients, including unnecessary treatment or avoidable complications. Our findings lay the groundwork for more accurate diagnostics and targeted treatments," said Nazy, a professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster.

The research team was comprised of scientists from the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory (MPIL) within MCTR as well as collaborators from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

They analyzed blood samples from nine patients diagnosed with HIT. In each case, they found that the antibodies targeting platelet factor 4 (PF4) – a protein involved in blood clotting – were monoclonal. This suggests that HIT may be driven by a highly specific immune reaction, rather than a generalized one.

"This discovery could reshape how we diagnose HIT and eventually how we treat it," said Jared Treverton, first author of the study and a PhD candidate at McMaster. "Knowing that HIT is caused by a monoclonal antibody will allow us to develop improved tests specific to patients with this disorder and design better targeted therapies. This is a major step towards making diagnostics more accurate and treatments much safer."

The findings are expected to have immediate relevance for hematologists, laboratory specialists, and researchers in immunology, as well as for patients receiving heparin in hospitals across Canada and around the world.

"This is a major step forward in understanding a condition that can have devastating consequences for patients. It also highlights the importance of basic science in driving clinical innovation," said co-author Donald Arnold, co-director of the MCTR and professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.

The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Institutes of Health and the Marta & Owen Boris Foundation.

"This discovery is a testament to the power of scientific curiosity and collaboration. We are profoundly grateful to the Marta and Owen Boris Foundation and our funding partners for their support, which made this breakthrough possible. Their generosity is helping us change the way we understand and treat serious medical conditions like HIT," said co-author John Kelton, co-medical director of the MPIL and executive director of the Marnix E. Heersink School of Biomedical Innovation & Entrepreneurship at McMaster.

A new UCLA Health study found that taking an 8-strain probiotic daily may reduce the risk of pouchitis, a common inflammatory condition that occurs after colon removal surgery for ulcerative colitis, but the treatment may not be worth the cost depending on a patient's likelihood of flare-ups.

The study, published in the journal Gastro Hep Advances, is the first to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the probiotic treatment, which was shown in previous studies to be effective at preventing the initial onset of and the reoccurrence of pouchitis. The UCLA study affirmed that the probiotic formulation was effective at preventing pouchitis compared to patients taking no probiotics but found that the cost to third-party payers may outweigh those benefits in most cases unless the cost of the probiotic formulation is lowered.

Our findings highlight that while probiotic treatments can reduce the risk of this complication, their high costs limit their overall value for most patients. Our analysis can help guide shared decision-making between patients, clinicians and payers to ensure resources are used where they can provide the most benefit."

Dr. Gaurav Syal, study lead author and inflammatory bowel disease gastroenterologist at UCLA

Pouchitis is a common complication experienced by patients who have had their colon and rectum removed due to ulcerative colitis. Surgeons replace the rectum with a pouch made of the patient's small intestine. The procedure allows patients to go to the bathroom in a mostly normal way rather than having to connect their small intestine to an external bag to excrete waste.

Pouchitis can develop if this internal pouch becomes inflamed, leading to several uncomfortable symptoms such as frequent and urgent bowel movements, bloody stools and abdominal pain among others. This condition is typically treated with a short course of antibiotics. Some patients can experience recurring pouchitis.

The UCLA study sought to determine whether a daily probiotic treatment using 8-strains of bacteria to prevent the development of pouchitis is worth the cost to third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.

Using a computer model that assessed the risk of initial development and reoccurrence of pouchitis over a two-year period, the study found that the daily probiotic treatment was only cost-effective for patients who have frequent relapses of pouchitis (two or more incidents per year) but was not cost effective for patients with infrequent relapse or for preventing the first onset of this complication compared to patients who do not undergo the probiotic treatment.

Over the two-year period, the model found:

Dr. Syal said the findings can help clinicians determine treatment options with patients as well as inform policymakers and third-party payers to determine how best to allocate healthcare funding.

Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that a single injection of the antibiotic benzathine penicillin G (BPG) successfully treated early syphilis just as well as the three-injection regimen used by many clinicians in the United States and elsewhere. These findings from a late-stage clinical trial suggest the second and third doses of conventional BPG therapy do not provide a health benefit. The results were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective against syphilis, but the three-dose regimen can be burdensome and deter people from attending follow-up visits with their healthcare providers. The new findings offer welcome evidence for potentially simplifying treatment with an equally effective one-dose regimen, particularly while syphilis rates remain alarmingly high."

Carolyn Deal, Ph.D., chief of the enteric and sexually transmitted infections branch of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)

Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The United States reported 209,253 total syphilis cases and 3,882 congenital syphilis cases in 2023, representing 61% and 108% increases over 2019 numbers, respectively. Without treatment, syphilis can result in neurological and organ damage as well as severe pregnancy complications and congenital abnormalities. Syphilis can also increase a person's likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

BPG is one of the few antibiotics known to effectively treat syphilis, and stockouts are common worldwide. The antibiotic is currently being imported to the United States to resolve a nationwide shortage.

The study was conducted at ten U.S. sites and enrolled 249 participants with early syphilis, which encompasses the primary, secondary, and early latent stages of disease. Sixty-one percent of participants were living with HIV and 97% were men. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular (IM) injection of BPG 2.4 million units (MU) or a series of three IM injections of BPG 2.4 MU at weekly intervals. All participants were monitored for safety. Biological markers of successful treatment in the blood-known as the serologic response to therapy-were examined at six months following treatment.

Seventy-six percent of participants in the single-dose group had a serologic response to treatment compared to 70% of participants in the three-dose group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant, even when participants were stratified by HIV status. One participant developed signs of neurosyphilis three days after starting BPG therapy and was excluded from the analysis. Three serious adverse events were reported but were not related to BPG.

"Syphilis has been studied and treated for more than a century, and BPG has been in use for more than 50 years, yet we are still acquiring knowledge to help us optimize treatment," said Principal Investigator Edward W. Hook III, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "We hope these promising results will be complemented by scientific advances in syphilis prevention and diagnosis."

According to the study authors, the results from this trial provide substantial evidence that single-dose BPG 2.4 MU is as effective as three doses in treating early syphilis. More research is needed to understand the full potential of this abbreviated treatment strategy and to evaluate therapeutic approaches for all stages of syphilis, including late syphilis, latent syphilis of unknown duration, and clinical neurosyphilis.

The study was conducted through the NIAID-funded Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinical Trials Group.

UCLA Health has received a $7.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to expand research into a newer form of psychotherapy that has been shown to more significantly alleviate chronic pain among older adults compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. 

The planned five-year clinical trial will work with nearly 700 war veterans at seven U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs centers throughout the country to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy, known as emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET). Developed in the 2010s, EAET aims to show patients that the brain's perception of pain is strongly influenced by stress-related emotions. Patients are helped to emotionally process stressful interactions, from anything as mundane as being cut off by a driver to severe traumas such as sexual assault, with the goal of changing brain circuits dealing with both pain and emotion to reduce or eliminate chronic pain. 

The trial will be led by Dr. Brandon Yarns, assistant professor at UCLA Health's Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. 

Previous research by Yarns found that nearly four times as many veterans experienced significant pain relief with EAET compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (63% vs 17%). 

That study, including 126 patients, was the first full-scale clinical trial of EAET among older adults, older men and veterans, with past studies being largely made up of younger, female participants, Yarns said. 

The new five-year trial will be a pragmatic trial to test the therapy's effectiveness in real-world clinical sites for potential widespread adoption. The trial will scale up the treatment to 672 older veterans across seven Veterans Affairs locations throughout the U.S. The first year will be used prepare the sites, train clinicians and interview veterans who will be participating, with treatment occurring in the following four years.

Deep in the Bolivian Amazon exists a forager-horticultural community called the Tsimane. Researchers look to them for insights on how the human body functioned prior to modern technologies, as their lifestyles remain the closest to that of our ancestors. Oftentimes researchers find how we have navigated away from our evolutionary path, such as the Tsimane having the lowest rates of dementia, the healthiest hearts, and low late-age inflammation than those living in industrialized nations. But, new research from Arizona State University, has discovered a universal experience – post-menopausal women experiencing increased blood lipid levels, such as cholesterol. 

Published today in the Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health, "Higher blood lipid levels after transition to menopause in two forager-horticulturalist populations," looked at several blood lipids, like cholesterol, that are major contributing factors to heart disease. In industrialized nations, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, women notably experience an increased risk of heart disease post-menopause, including an increase in those blood lipids. 

While we have good data from industrialized populations, to our knowledge, nobody had looked at this relationship in a non-industrial, highly active population like the Tsimane before."

Madeleine Getz, PhD student studying global health in ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, and lead author on the study

The results of the study found that for the Tsimane, five of the six factors – including triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – were higher after menopause.

"While the difference varied by marker, they were between 1.5 to 11% higher after menopause. To see these risk factors increase after menopause in this population, despite their incredibly low levels of heart disease, was unexpected," Getz said, who is also an affiliated graduate student with ASU's Center for Evolution and Medicine and the Institute of Human Origins. 

Despite this increase being two to seven times lower than those documented in populations in the U.S and the U.K., the marked increase in post-menopausal lipid biomarkers for the Tsimane makes for a similar pattern despite vastly different lifestyles and diets. 

"This suggests that these increases in cholesterol around menopause may be a human universal, no matter how or where we live," Getz said.

Living a traditional hunter-farmer lifestyle, the Tsimane follow a diet free of processed foods and maintain high levels of physical activity, averaging around 15-20,000 steps per day. Their way of life closely mirrors that of early human societies, providing valuable insights into how modern environments influence disease and aging. 

Benjamin Trumble, senior author on the study and professor in ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, serves as the co-director of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project. The group has a longstanding relationship with the Tsimane to collect demographic and biomedical data, as well as helps to provide medical care for the community – a relationship that has been in effect for more than 20 years. 

"Working with populations like the Tsimane allows us to global variation in both menopause, as well as human health and disease" said Trumble. "The findings here suggest that menopause is associated with increased risk factors for heart disease, even in the population with the healthiest hearts in the world. That suggests that post-menopausal increases in heart disease may be a human universal, and part of our underlying physiology regardless of lifestyle choices."

Colombia is set to take on Bolivia in this 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday at Roberto Melendez Metropolitan Stadium.

Colombia head into this crucial qualifying match sitting comfortably in sixth place with 22 points, secure in direct qualification territory yet still needing every point to solidify their standing. Manager Néstor Lorenzo has named a surprising inclusion in the squad: 39-year-old Dayro Moreno, the veteran striker, joins a forward line featuring Luis Díaz, Luis Suárez, Jhon Córdoba, Jaminton Campaz, and Marino Hinestroza. This blend of experience and flair highlights Colombia's intention to lean on both creativity and hunger up front to close out the campaign.

Bolivia enters the fixture with just 17 points and a mountain to climb if they're to reach the playoff spot. Despite a tough road ahead, they'll still back themselves to cause trouble, especially in the final stretch. Colombia has had the upper hand in recent meetings, winning three of the last five and keeping three clean sheets. The spotlight will be on Luis Díaz, who is Colombia's leading scorer in qualifying, and Bolivia's Miguel Terceros, their top goal threat. Expect Colombia to dominate possession and look to secure a controlled, professional victory at home.

This is a great World Cup 2026 qualifying match that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

by Dante Gonzalez September 04, 2025

In recent months, several players have voiced frustration over the congested schedule created by international federations and the number of matches crammed into each season. But ahead of France's upcoming UEFA World Cup qualifiers, star forward Kylian Mbappe made a surprising statement on the matter: “We aren't playing too much.”

The 2024-25 campaign was marked by the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, held in June and July—right in the middle of what should have been players' offseason break. For 2025-26, the calendar ends with the 2026 World Cup, raising concerns that many Europe-based stars will be running on fumes by the time the tournament kicks off.

Ahead of France's clash with Ukraine for the World Cup qualifiers, Mbappe was asked if he had learned to prepare differently for such a long season after last year's grind. His response was candid: “I don't know if you can ever really be ready to play a 60-game season. From my experience, from what I've seen, I can't remember a player performing at a high level across 60 matches. Physically, yes, you can be ready—but in terms of performance level, it's just not possible. There will be times when you're not at your best.”

The Real Madrid forward then delivered the line that caught everyone's attention. “Are we playing too much? No. I used to think so, but not necessarily anymore. What we really need is just a bit more rest during vacation, to allow the body to recover and try to come back fresh,” he said, shifting the debate from the number of games to the lack of recovery time players are given.

“The counterargument is always: ‘You earn a lot of money, so play.' If we stop there, the debate will never end. When I saw teams playing friendlies before the season had even ended, that wasn't normal. I don't want players to get to a point where they're thinking they don't want to play certain matches,” Mbappe added, highlighting how the calendar has become overwhelming.

With competitions like the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup adding even more fixtures to the calendar, the conversation has long focused on match volume. But Mbappé's stance reframes the issue—arguing that recovery time, not the number of games, is the key factor in maintaining peak performance.

Last season was a landmark one for Mbappe, his first at Real Madrid following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain. He featured in seven different competitions—La Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey, Club World Cup, Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Intercontinental Cup.

Across those tournaments, Mbappe played 59 matches, scored 44 goals, and added five assists, missing only nine games. That included three Club World Cup fixtures he sat out with acute gastroenteritis, while the others were due to minor muscle strains or coach's decisions to rest him between matches.

On top of his club duties, he also featured in six matches for France, including the Nations League Final Four, while missing four others during his public dispute with coach Didier Deschamps. In total, Mbappe played 65 matches in the 2024-25 season—a staggering workload that makes his refusal to complain about the number of games all the more striking.

Argentina return to action at River Plate's Estadio Mâs Monumental, hosting Venezuela in their final home game of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

La Albiceleste secured their place in next summer's World Cup already and are looking ahead to defend their crown. However, the game against Venezuela will be a momentous occasion regardless.

Lionel Messi will likely play his final official home game with La Albiceleste against La Vinotinto, as Messi himself admitted. The iconic Monumental will be rocking as thousands upon thousands of Argentina fans cram the stadium to celebrate their hero.

For Venezuela, though, this game is of massive importance. La Vinotinto currently holds the final spot for an intercontinental playoff berth. Fernando Batista's side have a one point lead over Bolivia and the next two games will determine if they get a chance to play for their first-ever World Cup appearance.

Here's how you can watch Argentina's clash vs. Venezuela.

Netherlands host Poland in a FIFA World Cup 2026 European Qualifiers Group G clash, both on six points but the Dutch ahead with a game in hand and +10 goal difference

Koeman's side beat Finland and Malta; Poland beat Lithuania and Malta but lost to Finland

Netherlands reached three World Cup finals; Poland's best is third place in 1974 and 1982

The Netherlands welcome Poland to the iconic De Kuip, Rotterdam, for their Group G clash in the FIFA World Cup 2026 European Qualifiers on Thursday (September 4, 2025). Watch the Netherlands vs Poland football match live tonight.

Both teams are level on six points, but the Dutch sit second with a game in hand and also enjoy a superior goal difference, +10. Poland are a string below after three matches. They have a goal difference of +2.

Both sides have six points each, but the Netherlands hold the edge -- second in the group standings with a game in hand and a commanding +10 goal difference. Poland trail just behind, having played one match more and a modest +2 goal difference.

Heading into this match, Finland lead Group G with seven points from four games, followed by the Netherlands with six from two, and Poland also on six but from three matches. Lithuania and Malta trail behind with two and one point, respectively.

Ronald Koeman's Oranje are on a strong run, winning both of their qualifiers so far, and handsomely: 2-0 against Finland and 8-0 against Malta. And mercurial Robert Lewandowski is back to lead the Dutch attack following the departure of Michal Probierz.

Jan Urban's Poland started with wins over lowly Lithuania and Malta but lost 1-2 to Finland in their last qualifying outing, and tonight the Eagles face their biggest test yet.

The Netherlands have qualified eleven times for the World Cup Finals and reached the final three times (1974, 1978, 2010), but never lifted the trophy. In the 2022 edition, they lost to eventual champions Argentina in the quarter-finals, on penalties. Poland have qualified nine times, finishing third in 1974 and 1982. They also reached the Round of 16 in 2022.

This marks their 21st meeting, and the Netherlands lead Poland 10-3 in the all-time head-to-head record. Seven matches have ended in draws. Poland's last win dates back to May 1979.

In their most recent meeting, the Netherlands overturned an early setback as Adam Buksa's 16th-minute header gave Poland the lead during their UEFA European Championship 2024 group match. But Cody Gakpo's deflected equalizer and sub Wout Weghorst's late strike sealed a 2-1 comeback victory for the Dutch in Hamburg, Germany.

The Netherlands vs Poland, FIFA World Cup 2026 European Qualifiers will be played on Friday, 5 September at 12:15 am IST.

The Netherlands vs Poland FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier will be broadcast live on the Sony Sports Network in India, with live streaming available on the Sony LIV app and website.

Angel City forward and U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson is set to join Chelsea FC at the transfer deadline. A verbal agreement is in place for a fee under the £1 million mark. according to The Athletic. Sources stateside have confirmed to CBS Sports that Thompson's move is imminent, though the transfer fee number is not yet finalized. 

The current reported fee would equate to $1.3 million, making Thompson one of the most expensive transfers in women's football history. Reigning NWSL Champions Orlando Pride recently set a new record of $1.5 million with the new acquisition of Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle from Liga MX Femenil's Tigres Femenil. 

The 20-year-old USWNT international signed a contract with Angel City earlier this year, a new deal through 2028, alongside her sister, defender Gisele Thompson. Once official, a five-year contract with Chelsea is in place for the rising star, who first cracked a major USWNT roster during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The winger has already completed a medical and is set to join the WSL-winning Chelsea for the upcoming season. 

The attention around the transfer is significant for the global market, as rising fees and valuations increase. The move also highlights the growing financial power of top NWSL and European clubs and their ability to attract top talent across leagues. Thompson's arrival at Chelsea will place her among an already strong offensive side. 

Though the Blues striker Mayra Ramirez is rehabbing from hamstring surgery, Sam Kerr is back at full fitness following an ACL injury, and Lauren James, Guro Reiten, Aggie Beaver Jones and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd are among Chelsea's attackers. The move will also reunite Thompson with USWNT teammates Catarina Macario and Naomi Girma.

While Thompson's departure is a blow to Angel City's playoff hopes, a potential substantial fee can provide resources for future high-profile moves.

World Cup

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are not yet on general sale, but soon, the yearslong wait will end.

After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The opening of a presale application window on Sept. 10 will mark the start of a multi-phase process that is now more defined, but still requires lots of explanation.

So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

The “Visa Presale Draw” opens at 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 10, but you do not need to rush to your computer or smartphone that day. You can enter anytime between then and Sept. 19. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The first official purchases of tickets, by the successful applicants, will then happen in October.

For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December.

Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup.

Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing).

To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.”

You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform.

And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible.

Yes. (Visa is a FIFA sponsor, hence the scheme.)

A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access.

But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods.

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person.

If you'd like to go to a game with a larger group, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs.

You'll have three options, per FIFA:

You won't have to choose between these options until October. When you apply, you're merely applying for a place in line — for a time slot. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says.

The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. Most tickets, though, will be more expensive, and probably much more expensive. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices.

And all of those prices could change. FIFA will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer.

The highest price for the 2026 World Cup final will start at $6,730, FIFA said Wednesday. That's more than four times the price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2022 World Cup final, which cost $1,605.

In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69.

The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section.

For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

A Category 1 ticket, for example, might be in the 20th row of the lower bowl in a sideline section level with the penalty box; or it might be on the second deck closer to midfield.

Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. “Fans value the front-row seat much higher,” an official said, “than the seats that have a technical view of the pitch.” So, rather than sideline vs. endline, the delineation will generally be lower level (Category 1), second deck (Category 2) and upper deck (Category 3 and 4).

FIFA will release maps of each stadium showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022.

In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app.

Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. The main difference there is that the transfer of tickets into your account and app depends on the seller, and isn't always immediate. (More on that below.)

For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market.

“You will get your ticket in the app at a later stage, not at the moment of the purchase,” Jean-Marie Tardy, a FIFA ticketing manager, said of the system generally on a TicketCo podcast in 2023. “And once the ticket is loaded into your app … you've got all the information about all your tickets — the seat category, the stadium, the match, even the seat details — but you don't get anything that can get scanned at that moment.”

FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. And many sites are already doing that. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches.

FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA can.

FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.”

Those sites don't require a seller to upload the digital ticket to list it.

They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have.

So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. And there are four main theories about what, exactly, those “tickets” are:

That remains up in the air. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

The Visa presale draw opens Sept. 10. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

World Cup

FIFA said Wednesday that ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup will start at $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats and range to $6,730 for the most expensive tickets to the final – but all of that is subject to change once sales begin in October.

A FIFA official, speaking to reporters on a Zoom call Tuesday, confirmed that organizers will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets.

This means that prices may – and probably will – change before and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when group-stage matchups, dates and locations will be set.

“We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” the FIFA official said.

An initial ticket phase, featuring a lottery, will open Sept. 10. Fans will apply for the chance to purchase tickets (using a Visa card); and if randomly selected, they'll get the opportunity to buy up to 40 — up to four per match, for up to 10 matches — in a specific time slot in October.

A similar second phase, which will not include the Visa card requirement, will run from late October through early December. There will then be another lottery phase, followed by a first-come-first-served phase, after the World Cup draw.

FIFA officials said they had not yet determined all of the initial prices. They will divide tickets into four categories — with Category 1 being the most expensive and Category 4 the least expensive — but when asked about the prices for Category 1, 2 and 3 tickets to group-stage matches, one official said that those numbers weren't set.

He also would not say how many of the $60 tickets will be available, nor what percentage of a given stadium will be considered “Category 4” seats, though he did say that percentage will “not be insignificant.”

In general, the lower bowl of stadiums will be Category 1; the second deck will be Category 2; and the upper deck will be Category 3 and 4. In most of the sales phases, fans will purchase tickets in these categories without knowing what section or row they'll be assigned; they will not be able to choose specific seats.

The initial $6,730 maximum price for the final is not a hospitality ticket — those are already on sale, and range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person across the tournament.

The regular-ticket maximum is more than four times the price of Category 1 tickets to the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, which cost $1,605. (Category 2 was $1,002, and Category 3 was $604.)

The FIFA official said Tuesday that organizers had “committed to the $60” as a starting point, but that “we will apply variable pricing from Day 1 of the process.” That means prices could rise or fall during the presale phase, which will run through Oct. 21. (Sept. 19 is the deadline to apply.)

Although dynamic pricing is typically associated with price increases, the opposite happened ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. Months after FIFA overestimated demand with its initial prices, the cost of tickets plummeted as FIFA scrambled to fill otherwise-empty seats.

The expectation, though, is that demand for the 2026 World Cup, which will feature 104 matches in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be much higher, and prices could rise.

“We do not intend at all to change prices every five minutes,” the official clarified, but he acknowledged that part of the process would involve automation.

To justify the “variable pricing” approach, he and another World Cup official said that it would allow FIFA to maximize revenues and attendance. Soccer's global governing body, which runs the World Cup, expects to make over $3 billion from hospitality and ticket sales. It also expects to smash the previous World Cup attendance record, which is still held by the 1994 edition, a 24-team tournament in the U.S.

The FIFA official also cited local customs. “What FIFA is doing is adapting to the domestic market,” he said. “And it's a reality in the U.S. and Canada that events are being priced as per the demand that is coming in for that event.”

FIFA will also adapt its resale strategy to North America. When ticket sales begin, it will launch its own resale platform. In the past, it has capped prices on these secondary sales, to prevent fans and scalpers from reselling for profit. But in 2026, for ticket buyers in the U.S. and Canada, there will be no cap, according to World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi.

The reason, Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

The exception is for Mexico, where resale laws are stricter. After extensive discussions with the Mexican government, FIFA agreed to create a separate, dedicated resale platform for Mexicans fans, who will only be allowed to post their tickets for resale at face value. It will function more like a ticket exchange than a resale market.

When asked what fees or cut of resales FIFA would take on its official platform, a spokesman said that would be finalized at a later date.

FIFA officials said that around 1 million tickets would likely be available in the first Visa presale phase — out of roughly 6 million in total for the tournament.

One official mentioned that 8.5 million people had officially “registered their interest” in tickets since FIFA began asking fans to do so.

The World Cup is slated to begin June 11 in Mexico City and conclude with the final July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

For event organizers like FIFA, dynamic pricing comes with dual benefits.

It allows them to raise prices if and when they sense they can make more money on tickets.

It also allows them to set high initial prices, knowing they can eventually lower those prices if sales are slow. (This is precisely what happened with the Club World Cup.)

The argument against dynamic pricing, of course, is that a lower fixed price would allow fans with less money to experience the World Cup.

The argument for dynamic pricing, essentially, is that a lower fixed price also incentivizes scalping. The scalpers then resell for profits, and the outcome for most consumers is the same — prices on the secondary market end up just as high as, if not higher than, the dynamic prices FIFA could charge. The only difference is that the money ends up in the hands of the scalpers — some of them Average Joes, some of them slimy profiteers — rather than FIFA.

Some would argue that's a good thing. FIFA would argue that the money should go into its coffers and then out into the world to fund football development.

And because FIFA controls the World Cup, FIFA's argument wins.

...

Gianluigi Donnarumma is entering a new phase of his career as the Italy goalkeeper prepares for 2026 World Cup qualifiers under new coach Gennaro Gattuso before taking his place at Manchester City.

The giant goalkeeper will move to England after Italy's Group I clashes with Estonia and Israel after he was abruptly frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain by coach Luis Henrique.

"I really felt at home during my four years in Paris, I'll never forget them," Donnarumma told journalists.

Donnarumma insists he holds no ill will about the way he was dumped down the pecking order at PSG in favour of French youngster Lucas Chevalier so soon after his performances helped win the capital club's first Champions League.

"I've always had an excellent relationship with the coach. I appreciated his directness with me, right from the first day of training," he said.

"I don't know what the reason was (for being replaced), I don't even want to know. I always try to do what my coach asks me to do, to help my team.

"You can always improve, but I've accomplished great things since I made my Serie A debut at 16 years old."

Just as he did when he moved to PSG, Donnarumma signed his City contract at Italy's Coverciano training camp during an international break.

"It brought me some luck," said Donnarumma, who was also key to Italy being crowned European champions in 2021, just before he signed for PSG.

"When a club like City wants you it means that you're doing a good job. Being wanted by one of the best coaches in the world like Pep Guardiola is a indescribable feeling."

- Italy struggles -

But before joining Guardiola in Manchester Donnarumma has a big task on his hands with Italy, who are at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup.

Donnarumma has maintained the captain's armband under Gattuso, who replaced Luciano Spalletti in June after a troubled start to Italy's qualifying campaign which included a 3-0 thumping at the hands of group leaders Norway.

The 26-year-old played under Gattuso, who won the World Cup as a player with Italy in 2006, at AC Milan when still a teenager.

"I know the man, I know what he can bring," said Donnarumma.

"He's started strongly. He'll give everything and we'll give everything to take Italy back to the top. But we have to take things step by step."

Donnarumma said that he wants to "take Italy back to where we belong" which is not small feat given where they find themselves after two qualifying matches.

Italy are nine points behind Norway, albeit having played two games fewer, and have a slim chance of taking the spot which offers the only direct place in next year's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

As well as the significant points gap Italy have a goal difference which is 12 worse than Norway, meaning that the play-offs, from which they failed to reach the last two tournaments, are the more realistic route for qualification.

How would you describe it when a soccer team is clicking? Do you refer to it as "camaraderie" or "a good locker room"? 

Perhaps it's, as you hear players and coaches call it, a "tight-knit group." Or maybe it's what the younger folk today may refer to as "vibes." 

Whatever the term, some think it isn't nearly as important as just assembling a team with the players possible. The cream, they argue, will inevitably rise to the top. For the most part, they aren't wrong. Only eight countries have ever won a men's FIFA World Cup. The last four winners of the UEFA Champions League — Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea — are among the wealthiest, most valuable brands in all of global sports. 

But when players bond and sacrifice for a common goal, they become greater than the sum of their parts. That's how Leicester City overcame 5000-1 odds to win the Premier League in 2016, or how Greece stunned host Portugal to win the 2004 European Championship. 

How crucial is that sense of togetherness? Take it from the most capped player in U.S. men's national team history.

"It's probably the most important thing," said three-time World Cup veteran and first-ballot National Soccer Hall of Famer Cobi Jones.

I caught up with Jones, who'll debut his Cobi Club podcast in 2026, to break down the notion and importance of vibes – especially ahead of next year's World Cup. 

U.S. great Cobi Jones, right, hopes that Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino can get back on the same wavelength ahead of the World Cup. 

USMNT supporters on both sides of the vibes debate have been going back and forth on the topic since the spring. In March, a full-strength American side featuring Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson lost a competitive match to Panama for the second time in a year, snapping its four-year dominance of the Concacaf Nations League.

Four months later, with several of those first-choice players missing, a skeleton squad rounded out primarily by inexperienced MLSers exceeded expectations by reaching the Gold Cup final. That team lost, though, to blood rival Mexico in a match in which El Tri was clearly superior.

The vibes discussion has picked up again, when U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino called Pulisic back, but left out McKennie and several other mainstays to his 23-man roster for the upcoming matches against Korea Republic and Japan.

Jones knows why teams succeed, and why they fail. He was perhaps the best player on the 1998 U.S. team that finished dead last at that World Cup in part because of the poisonous environment that had taken root under then-coach Steve Sampson. The Americans, fielding many of the same players, reached the quarterfinals at the 2002 World Cup under Bruce Arena, who was renowned for his team-building skills. Fifteen years later, Arena was unable to fix the broken culture he inherited from Jürgen Klinsmann. The Americans finished behind Honduras and Panama in 2018 World Cup qualifying and missed the main event for the first time in 32 years. 

"You can have world-class talent and do terrible, because the vibe isn't there. People really have to understand: you're going into camp like a month before the World Cup even starts," Jones told me. "That means you're living together, day in and day out for an extended period. You've got to have a good vibe or there's going to be some issues."

The last of Jones' 164 international appearances came more than two decades ago now. It's a USMNT record — he has seven on Landon Donovan and 13 more than Michael Bradley that might never be broken. Now 55, the Detroit-born, Southern California-raised former winger spent 12 seasons with his hometown LA Galaxy after stints in the Premier League and in Brazil. He did a ton of winning along the way, including two MLS Cups, two U.S. Open Cups and a Concacaf title with the Galaxy, the 2002 Gold Cup with the U.S. and an NCAA crown after walking on at UCLA.

Cobi Jones was part of the 1994 World Cup squad that exceeded expectations and the 1998 team that largely faltered.  

Pochettino surely knows that he'll need all of his best players if the Americans are to make a historic run at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Successful teams need talent and vibes. Having one will never be enough.

"We always say this team is the most talented U.S. team. And I think they are," Jones said. "You look at where these young men are playing, at the opportunities they had when they were kids to be trained at the highest levels. The ability is there. It's about, can they come together as a unit?"

Jones — for whom the Galaxy will unveil a statue next spring at their stadium in Carson, Caifornia — will have a front-row seat. Two of the USMNT's three World Cup group stage contests are at SoFi Stadium at nearby Inglewood. For U.S. backers worried about how the national team will fare next June and July, Jones has another message.

"To do something special, timing is everything. A lot of things that have to gel," he added. "I always look at the 1998 World Cup, which France won. They didn't score a goal four years later. Were they not good? Of course they were. Their players were still amazing. That proves that a lot of things have to come together to have a good performance as a team.

"I think these guys, they'll find a way."

Bulgaria is set to take on Spain in this World Cup 2026 qualifier match on Thursday at Vasil Levski National Stadium.

Spain, fresh off their Euro 2024 triumph, launches their World Cup qualifying campaign in Sofia against Bulgaria, aiming to set a strong tone as reigning European champions with a squad brimming with depth and experience. Key figures Rodri and Dani Carvajal have returned from injuries to bolster the midfield and defense, while emerging talents like Lamine Yamal, Álvaro Morata, and Nico Williams promise to pace the attack. Despite some absences in midfield, Spain remains the overwhelming favorite.

Bulgaria, coached by Ilian Iliev, enters under fire after disappointing results in the Nations League and heavy losses in friendlies. They're expected to set up compactly with a five-man defense led by goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov, hoping to frustrate La Roja and perhaps strike on the counter, most likely through captain Kiril Despodov. Still, Spain's technical superiority and unblemished road record in qualifying make a comfortable victory the most likely outcome.

This is a great World Cup 2026 qualifying match that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

U.S. men's national team boss Mauricio Pochettino revealed he once had the opportunity to manage Real Madrid, but Spurs ex-chairman Daniel Levy blocked the potential move.

Pochettino is back in the spotlight as the USMNT gears up for two international friendlies during the September international break. The pressure is on the 53-year-old to get the Stars and Stripes as prepared as possible for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a different challenge to those he faced as a manager at various clubs across Europe. 

While he led the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, Pochettino never managed a top club in Spain before he made the switch to international football. Real Madrid were apparently eyeing the Argentine, though, as Zinedine Zidane's successor back in 2018, but Levy prevented the move.

“Zidane leaves Madrid and naturally the possibility arises,” Pochettino said on El Chiringuito TV. “I had given my word to Levy that I would stay [at Tottenham] until the [new] stadium was finished. 

“At that moment, I said I would go to Madrid if Levy gave the green light. I don't know what happened afterwards, but surely he didn't give the OK,” Pochettino revealed.

After Zidane led Los Blancos to a historic Champions League threepeat, the Frenchman left the club along with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of the 2018–2019 season. At the time, Pochettino was still under contract with Tottenham and in no position to facilitate a grand move to the Spanish capital without Levy's support.

“I don't know how Florentino Pérez took it, but it wasn't my fault. I wasn't a free agent. Football is like that, sometimes opportunities slip away,” Pochettino said. 

Real Madrid ultimately appointed Julen Lopetegui, who only lasted three months into their 2018–2019 campaign. Santiago Solari then took over until March before Zidane came back. All the while, Pochettino remained in north London. 

Fast forward six years and now the former Spurs boss is hoping to elevate the USMNT. Pochettino's early tenure in charge of the Stars and Stripes has not gone to plan; the team failed to defend their Concacaf Nations League title and then finished as the runners-up in the Gold Cup.

With most of his superstars, including Christian Pulisic, back available to play in September, Pochettino will be eager to turn the page on a tumultuous summer.

Paraguay host Ecuador in a CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying match with both teams eying to solidify their place in the 2026 World Cup in North America. 

Just one point separates the two sides entering their matchup on Thursday night and a win could be the difference in qualification.

Ecuador sit second (25 points) behind only Argentina, and Paraguay are fifth (24 points). 

Ecuador's stout defense have helped 'La Tri' to a nine match undefeated streak including eight clean sheets dating back to this time last year.

Paraguay lost to Brazil in their last match 1-0, and played Ecuador to a 0-0 draw in their previous meeting on October 10, 2024 in World Cup Qualifying.

Paraguay vs. Ecuador will be streamed for free on bet365 for customers with a funded account. 

Other streaming options include Fanatiz and Fubo. 

Paraguay vs. Ecuador will be played at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco in Paraguay and kick-off is scheduled for 7:30 PM ET for fans in the U.S. on Thursday, September 4.

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams returns to Harrison, N.J. for the first time he left the New York Red Bulls in 2019, and he had something to say about the venue at which he forged a reputation.

The USA will host the Korea Republic at Sports Illustrated Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 6 at 5 p.m.

Listen to what he had to say about the venue and his comedic exchange with USMNT teammate and friend Tim Weah.

“A lot of people coming into the game this weekend,” said Adams, who hails from Wappingers Falls, N.Y. “It's always nice to play at the old stomping grounds. I'm always going to call it Red Bull Arena. So never, never Sports Illustrated, whatever it is. But yeah, it's gonna be fun to play there, because it's the first time since I left.”

Then Weah, who grew up in Queens, N.Y. and played for B.W. Gottschee in the Cosmopolitan Junior Soccer League when it competed in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, weighed in on the Red Bulls and started that exchange.

Weah: “A lot of people don't know Tyler is the one that brought me to the Red Bulls.”

Adams: “I'm a scout. Yeah, Tyler.”

Weah: “Tyler, well, I was playing at Gottschee at the time.”

Adams: “And smacked them.”

Weah: “No, no, no, no.”

Adams: “Come to the good team.”

Weah: “We used to kill Red Bulls. And Tyler one day, I don't even remember, after a game. I think it was at Aviator [Field in Brooklyn], and Tyler was just like, come over to Red Bulls. And Red Bulls, at that time, [were] building a really good team … Omir Fernandez. Kyle [Duncan], my cousin who currently plays there now. So yeah, the rebel days were fun. So, it's a squad I've always dreamed of playing in Red Bull Arena. So it's finally, it's finally happening, so I'm happy.”

In 2013, Weah joined the Red Bulls Academy.

Argentina have already booked their place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup and currently leads the way in CONMEBOL qualifying.

Lionel Scaloni's side will finish top of the pile, and it remains to be seen what kind of team the reigning holders will field against Venezuela in their first of two qualifying matches in September.

Venezuela still have an outside chance of booking their place in next year's tournament, and they could climb into the top six places should they win both of their upcoming games. Toppling Argentina may be tough, given their last win over La Albiceleste was back in March 2019.

Below are all the details you need on live streams and broadcast options to watch Argentina vs Venezuela online, on TV, and from anywhere.

Kick-off is at 7:30pm ET.

For Argentina, the job is done and the 2022 World Cup winners can almost coast through these final two games in September, safe in the knowledge their place at the 2026 edition is already confirmed.

Their 31-man squad for the matches includes young talents like Real Madrid's starboy Franco Mastantuono and Manchester City's Claudio Echeverri, as well as Bournemouth defender Julio Soler.

Chelsea forward Alejandro Garnacho misses out, given he has not played any football this season, following his recent move from Manchester United to Stamford Bridge.

FEATURE: Who are the biggest clubs in South America

Venezuela have a tough job on their hands and require two vital wins to help them in their quest for qualification. With table-toppers Argentina to come first, the task at hand looks difficult.

Top scorer Salomon Rondon has five goals to his name in qualifying and the Real Oviedo man will be hoping to play a huge part in this contest. Austin FC midfielder Dani Pereira is also one to watch given his strong showings in the MLS so far this season.

Argentina 2-0 Venezuela

FourFourTwo can't see anything but a routine win for Scaloni's side in Buenos Aires, especially given the talent at their disposal. Stars such as Lionel Messi and Lautauro Martinez are expected to shine and we can see another comfortable win.

Mauricio Pochettino's surprising United States men's national team roster gets to test itself agains two terrific Asian foes starting with South Korea on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey.

Pochettino opted against calling in a number of big-name players, as Weston McKennie again misses out and is joining in exclusion by recently-transferred USMNT stars Giovanni Reyna, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso. Just-healthy Antonee Robinson and Ricardo Pepi are also given breaks, and that gives big chances to some lesser-known names against these strong visitors.

MORE — How will USMNT line up versus South Korea?

South Korea have lost just once in the last 19 months, and it was last time out against Japan — a solid team and the Yanks' next opponent. The Taegeuk Warriors boast an 11W-5D-1L record in that period, and national team legend Myung-bo Hong is at the wheel.

Led by Heung-min Son, South Korea (or Korea Republic) are ranked 23rd by FIFA and 34th by Elo Ratings. The Americans are 15th and 44th by the same metrics, and this match as well as the next versus Japan (17th and t-13th) are their first chances to show out against top non-CONCACAF opponents since dispiriting friendly losses to Turkiye and Switzerland in June.

And that matters. Players like Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman were very good at the Gold Cup, much better than their displays against Turkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino knows this group can do great in CONCACAF, but the World Cup's raised stakes will be closer to the level of South Korea (and Japan) more often than not.

The names on Pochettino's 24-man roster are anything but predictable, but there's a big-time in-form player in Josh Sargent and a number of North America-based players with huge opportunities to impress the boss.

How much will we see of Nathan Harriel, Tristan Blackmon, Sean Zawadzki, and Alex Zendejas? And is there any chance we see Roman Celentano or Jonathan Klinsmann, or is this Matt Freese's 18-yard box for the duration of the international break?

The team's strength is showcased by the stiff test they'll present despite players excluded from the squad, Wolves' Hee-chan Hwang, and Feyenoord's In-beom Hwang perhaps chief among them.

LAFC's Heung-min Son and PSG's Kang-in Lee will get a lot of the focus, but the Taegeuk Warriors are deep and dangerous. Bayern Munich center back Min-jae Kim is a handful for attackers and Mainz midfielder Jae-sung Lee is one to watch.

South Korea are more familiar and complete at this point, but home soil and the fitness of Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun, and Timothy Weah should be enough to produce a number of chances for the USMNT. Can they convert enough? USMNT 1-1 South Korea.

...

Mauricio Pochettino has precious few chances to ready his United States men's national team for next summer's World Cup and Saturday's meeting with South Korea in New Jersey sees some big opportunities for the player pool.

The 24-man roster has more than a few surprises, as Pochettino has called upon a number of lesser-known domestic players over more familiar names like Weston McKennie, Giovanni Reyna, and Haji Wright.

Several others were left off after summer transfers, as Yunus Musah, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso remain with their clubs while Ricardo Pepi and Antonee Robinson are still rebuilding his fitness and form after a long-term injury and Patrick Agyemang is current out of action.

Got all that? Phew.

So how will Pochettino use his players against South Korea and Japan as two very difficult visitors this week on American soil?

This one's straight-forward, as Matt Freese seems likely to get every chance to improve his standing atop the goalkeeper list following a terrific summer. FC Cincinnati backstop Roman Celentano and Serie B goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena) are also in camp.

The simple solution here is to play Tim Ream and Chris Richards at center back, though 18-year-old Augsburg back Noahkai Banks would love a look (and USMNT fans would love to see him).

Sergino Dest is back and we know he can play left back in addition to right back, so it's not as simple as assuming it'll be Max Arfsten on the left and Dest on the right. Alex Freeman also drew solid reviews this summer.

Tyler Adams should be nailed-on at the No. 6 spot, but will Pochettino opt for Sebastian Berhalter or Luca de la Torre next to him. Cristian Roldan is a late addition to the roster, while Sean Zawadzki is also an option.

Christian Pulisic will be on one wing and Diego Luna seems likely to get a run on either the other wing or in the middle of the three players underneath the center forward. Probably the former.

Timothy Weah will get the other wing, while Alex Zendejas, Jack McGlynn, and others wait for their turn.

There are three center forwards in camp, only one of whom was with Pochettino in recent windows. Oddly enough, Damion Downs is the least likely to start in our opinion. Josh Sargent is in great form for Norwich City but finally-healthy Folarin Balogun was a high-profile recruit aimed at the 2026 World Cup.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino shares an update on Christian Pulisic's return to the squad ahead of upcoming friendlies. (1:04)

Mauricio Pochettino and Christian Pulisic are back together, with head coach and player taking part in the U.S. men's national team training camp ahead of this month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan.

Just how "together" they are will be revealed over the next week and beyond, but make no mistake: they need to be on the same page if the U.S. is to reach its stated aim of making a deep run at next summer's World Cup.

This isn't to say that the two have had a falling out, nor do they need to be best friends and have regular dinners together. But there has been a disconnect.

- USMNT transfer grades: Analyzing every American move in the summer window
- USMNT players on risks, rewards of World Cup year transfers
- USMNT roster omissions might hamper World Cup preparations

Pulisic waved off an attempt by Pochettino to sub him out of the third-place game at the Concacaf Nations League last March. He missed out on the recent Gold Cup two months later, and while USSF sporting director Matt Crocker said at the time, "We made the collective decision that this is the right moment for [Pulisic] to get the rest he needs," the public backlash was intense, with former USMNT players, among them Landon Donovan, questioning the player's commitment.

Pulisic's response, in part, was to state in an interview with CBS Sports that he had offered to play in two pre-Gold Cup friendlies, but that Pochettino had turned him down. Pulisic later said in the interview that he didn't understand the decision even as the manager explained he wanted just one roster for the entire Gold Cup program.

While Pulisic's impulse to defend himself is understandable, divulging some of the deliberations about his Gold Cup participation was a mistake and only served to annoy Pochettino. The U.S. manager responded, stating that he is "not a mannequin" and that he alone would decide who plays for the USMNT and when.

When the roster for the upcoming friendlies was announced last week, Pochettino said he hadn't spoken with Pulisic since the Gold Cup, adding, "I think everything is behind us, all that happened in summer, and I think now we need to look forward."

Left unsaid is how effective that approach will be if there hasn't been any communication.

To be clear, success at the World Cup doesn't rest solely on Pulisic, as numerous moving parts need to align for a deep run to occur. The U.S. needs to sort out its goalkeeping situation. Right back Sergiño Dest has to be healthy, the better to augment the attack with his ability to deliver the unexpected. The same is true for Antonee Robinson on the opposite flank. Holding midfielder Tyler Adams needs to be at his ball-hawking best. One of the available strikers -- be it Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, etc. -- needs to hit top form ahead of the tournament.

But Pulisic's combination of talent, creativity and experience remains a critical piece of the attack. When Pulisic plays well and is in full flow, the team usually follows suit. Scoring goals is the most difficult part of the game, and Pulisic remains a vital contributor to that aspect of the cause. Pochettino and Pulisic need each other for the team to succeed.

Part of what's at issue between Pulisic and Pochettino is that the U.S. manager is in the middle of attempting a cultural reset. That goes for everyone, from the biggest stars down to uncapped players who get called in. Pochettino is demanding total commitment, at least as he defines it. As fatigued as Pulisic was after playing over 50 games a season at AC Milan the last two years, his decision to sit out the Gold Cup, while offering to play in the two friendlies before the tournament, sent Pochettino a different kind of message.

"If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" Pochettino said last May. "No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day."

The adjustment from the players -- including Pulisic -- to Pochettino's approach has taken some time. Defender Tim Ream admitted after the Gold Cup that it had taken too long. At Tuesday's media availability, Ream said that with players just arriving, there hadn't been a team-wide meeting yet to discuss expectations, though coaches had been pulling players in for individual meetings.

"We'll sit down I'm sure [Tuesday] and have a discussion," he said.

"But for us, it is just the guys who were here during the Gold Cup ... We kind of know what the standard needs to be and what it is going forward and just making sure that everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, helping each other, and making sure that we all know that we're on the same page, we're on the same team."

Pochettino was a top-flight manager for 15 years -- with stops at Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea -- before taking up with the USMNT. If there is to be movement in any direction, that will fall on Pulisic, because Pochettino won't be changing his ways. The U.S. manager has made it clear that no one's spot is secure. Weston McKennie was left off the current roster, and while Pochettino blamed his absence on a lack of rest due to participation in the Club World Cup, Tim Weah had a similar workload, yet was included in this camp.

Relationships between players and coaches can be fluid, going through difficulties. Pulisic's rapport with former U.S. manager Gregg Berhalter experienced some rough patches before the two found alignment ahead of the 2022 World Cup, in which Pulisic played a critical role in the U.S. reaching the round of 16.

That could very well be the case with Pochettino and Pulisic. However, Pulisic and the rest of the team will need to adapt to Pochettino's ways.

Upper Deck is adding another legendary athlete to its roster, signing former U.S. Alex Morgan to an exclusive memorabilia and trading card deal, it was announced on Thursday.



CARLSBAD, Calif. – Upper Deck is adding another legendary athlete to its roster, signing former U.S. Alex Morgan to an exclusive memorabilia and trading card deal, it was announced on Thursday.

Morgan's addition expands the company's growing list of ambassadors who are icons in their respective sports.

“Alex is a pioneer and a leader on and off the field. She has paved the way for generations to follow, and continues to push women's sports forward,” Upper Deck president Jason Masherah said in a statement. “As a Southern California company, Alex's commitment to San Diego makes this collaboration particularly special for us. Her commitment to helping the next generation and efforts throughout the community are inspiring and we at Upper Deck are honored to support those efforts.”

Morgan was the first overall pick in the 2011 Women's Professional Soccer draft out of the University of California, Berkeley, helping the Western New York Flash win a championship that same year.

In 2013, Morgan helped the Portland Thorns to a title in the inaugural NWSL season. She also was a three-time Olympian, helping the U.S. secure gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. She was a part of the U.S. women's national team to a pair of Women's World Cup titles. Morgan ranks in the top 10 all-time in national team appearances, goals and assists. In September 2024, Morgan retired from professional soccer as a member of San Diego Wave FC and had her jersey retired the next year. Morgan was also inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 2025.

“The landscape of women's sports has changed so much since I started my career, so I'm proud to have been a part of that growth and now work with Upper Deck to help fans take part in that journey,” Morgan said in a statement. “There's no better way to stay connected with my fans than to team up with a brand that shares the same passion. Their commitment to supporting the Alex Morgan Foundation is further proof this collaboration is the perfect fit.”

At one point not long ago, the world governing body at least tried to look like it cared about growing the game worldwide. Not any more

If there's the tiniest sliver of an upside to the latest news about ticketing for the 2026 World Cup, it's that we can finally dispense with the pretense that Fifa is interested in growing the game any more.

Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time, use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. While tickets will initially range from $60 for the cheap seats in some group-stage matches to $6,730 for the best vantage point at the final, those prices will then be algorithmically handed over to the market to respond to demand, which will probably cause them to skyrocket. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply.

Effectively, Fifa has absorbed the secondary market of ticket sales – the bit of the ticket hustle that arbitrages the market – in the name of protecting the fans, while subjecting fans to the exact same extortion. But rather than being a lone tout loitering outside a stadium, hoping to scalp a few tickets for a profit, it's Fifa itself making the deals.

Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world's most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you're-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa.

The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport's expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. It went to South Africa in 2010 and Brazil in 2014 not because they were the most moneyed markets, but to spread the sport around the globe. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup.

This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. And Fifa will help itself to as much of it as it can.

“It's key to highlight Fifa's mission and Fifa's objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it's always a balance between different factors.”

It claims to do so out of a kind of fiduciary duty to its member federations, but to further constrain attendance at the sport's signature event to the lucky few who can afford it gives the lie to serving the best interests of the sport writ large.

Fifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky – a YouGov poll shows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it's worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events.

After widespread anger erupted at the dynamic pricing that more than doubled the cost of some Oasis reunion tour tickets in the United Kingdom, the band ditched the model for its US dates. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. “She didn't want to do that to her fans,” an AEG executive explained in an interview. Even Wendy's faced ferocious backlash when it announced that it would introduce dynamic pricing in its fast-food restaurants, before it backed down.

The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it's also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-final tumbled from almost $500 to just $13 in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue.

Fifa is doing nothing illegal. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn't violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislators have taken an interest and Australia has moved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure.

It is also legal to use the data you have on your customers – a browsing history suggesting, for instance, a desperation to snag tickets to a particular game – to set prices, which is known as “surveillance pricing”. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquiry was swiftly abandoned by the Trump administration.

Fifa, then, isn't breaking any rules. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.

Lionel Messi is expected to play in what could be his last match in his home country with the Argentine national team on Thursday, Sept. 4.

Argentina will host Venezuela in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match, which is the defending World Cup champions' last scheduled home match in the foreseeable future.

Messi, 38, acknowledged the significance of the occasion in a recent postgame interview with Inter Miami last week.

“It's going to be a very special game for me because it's the last one in the qualifying round I don't know if there will be friendlies or more games after that,” Messi said during a postgame interview with Apple TV after Inter Miami's win against Orlando City in the Leagues Cup semifinals on Aug. 27.

“It's a very special game, which is why my family will be there with me – my wife, my children, my parents, my siblings, and everyone else that can, including my wife's whole family. And that's how we're going to experience it.”

“After that, as I said, I don't know what will happen, but that's our intention,” Messi added.

Argentina has already qualified for the 2026 World Cup to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, but Messi has yet to officially declare he will play in the tournament for the sixth time in his career.

Messi is under contract with Inter Miami through the end of the 2025 MLS season, with reported ongoing negotiations to sign an extension with the club.

Argentine national team coach Lionel Scaloni acknowledged the occasion during a press conference Wednesday, while adding the club would look to plan another match for Messi in Argentina when the time is right.

"[Thursday] will be a beautiful, exciting game. Surely, it won't be his last game in Argentina, and I saw that from the point of view that, if he decides it will be his last, we'll make sure he gets to play another one," Scaloni said regarding Messi. "We'll find the right moment, because he deserves it."

The match begins at 7:30 p.m. ET (8:30 p.m. in Argentina) at Mâs Monumental in Buenos Aires.

The match will be broadcast on Universo and can be streamed on Fubo.

For the reasons listed above, it appears very likely Messi will play with Argentina against Venezuela.

Argentina will visit Ecuador on Sept. 9 to conclude Conmebol World Cup qualifying, but it's possible Messi will return to South Florida as Inter Miami prepares for the last stretch of the 2025 MLS season.

Messi could potentially participate in four more Argentina friendly matches later this year.

Argentina is planning to play two friendly matches in the United States between October 6-14 with locations and opponents to be determined. These friendlies would coincide with Inter Miami's MLS season, potentially creating a scheduling conflict for Messi.

Argentina will also play two friendly matches between Nov. 10-18 in in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India with opponents to be determined. These friendlies would fall under a FIFA international window.

The Futbol W crew discuss how important this season could be for Naomi Girma at Chelsea. (2:20)

LONDON -- Plenty runs through the minds of players when they uproot their lives and move thousands of miles away; a new country brings new teammates, a new culture and countless small adjustments. Yet for Chelsea defender Naomi Girma, one challenge when she landed in London from NWSL side San Diego Wave in a world-record $1.1 million transfer in January wasn't about football at all; it was about using roundabouts.

A staple of British roads but a rarity across the United States, the circular junctions became an unexpected hurdle when the 24-year-old USWNT international was learning to get around her new country, and she enlisted the help of teammate Catarina Macario.

"She taught me how to drive through roundabouts, when to exit," she told ESPN, breaking into a fit of giggles as she sat next to her compatriot while recalling the whirlwind of her first six months in England. "Cat's been so helpful. And yeah, I think now I've come back I feel really settled, found my footing and have a place, have a car, know where I'm going. That's been really nice to come back and feel like I'm settled."

The memory sparked a wave of laughter between the pair. "I definitely told her just to follow the flow of traffic. [It's] not that hard to follow the flow, which is true," Macario said. "See where the cars are going, let's follow them ... I guess you weren't prepared for the roundabouts, my bad."

Having been in London since signing for Chelsea from Lyon in 2023, Macario offered Girma lots of advice when she first touched down, but it wasn't the usual clichés of "don't forget your boots" or recommendations to try a Greggs steak bake; this was far more practical. "I just hit her with a Uniqlo [clothing store] link-up; this is what need from Uniqlo to survive the winter," Macario explained with a grin. "That was very important."

Those early weeks of mastering British traffic -- the roundabouts, narrow country lanes and confusing motorway exits -- became their own crash course in adaptation. But of course, no matter how settled London life might feel now, there are some creature comforts that England simply can't deliver.

"A really good, iced-vanilla latte," Girma and Macario blurted out in perfect unison, when asked what they missed most about America, before bursting into laughter again. The speed of the reply made it clear this wasn't a new complaint, more of a running theme.

Girma admitted she has aired her frustrations plenty of times that the iced coffees back in California are leagues ahead of the questionable versions she has been handed in England. And then there's the hot sauce situation. Unwilling to compromise, Girma enlisted her brother as a personal supplier, bringing over bottles of her favorite brand from America. One such bottle now lives in the Chelsea canteen, shared generously with teammates; the other is kept at home, very much off-limits to anyone but her.

With no international tournament on the schedule this summer, the USWNT's stars were able to enjoy a rare stretch of extended downtime, with manager Emma Hayes granting many of her European-based players additional leave between training camps. And, although friendly games filled the calendar for some, Girma and Macario were among those given the chance to properly recharge.

For Macario, the break was a chance to reconnect with home. After trips to Spain and France -- where she celebrated the wedding of teammate Ellie Carpenter to former Lyon teammate Daniëlle van de Donk, now of London City -- she returned to San Diego to spend time with family and friends.

Girma followed a similar path, crisscrossing the country before a few stops abroad. She began in San Jose, California, her hometown, before heading to New York to see family, then returning west to Los Angeles and San Diego. The 24-year-old even carved out time for a getaway in Cabo, Mexico, a welcome slice of sunshine before the grind of preseason resumed.

"We had two camps, so I guess we weren't fully off," she said. "But it was nice to just get to travel, see family, see friends, create your own schedule, train when you want, and I think it's just made me more excited to be back."

Emily Keogh believes Emily Fox is "getting better" as Arsenal prepare for the new WSL season vs. London City Lionesses.

USWNT and Arsenal defender Emily Fox, meanwhile, embraced her downtime in a slightly different way. A self-proclaimed bookworm, she admitted to going "rogue" this summer, swapping her usual diet of sprawling sci-fi and fantasy sagas for standalones and historical fiction.

"I think there's been a lot of talk over the last few years of player welfare, being able to have a little bit of off-time amid the crazy seasons," she told ESPN at Arsenal's training center. "Being able to represent club and country, you do kind of find yourself just playing all year round, which is great, but I definitely think player welfare, mental well-being, and then physical recovery is so important.

Disney+ will be the only place football fans can watch all 75 matches live each season. Visit the Disney+ website to get access.

"It was great to be able to have that this year and get that break, even just be home, be with your family, go on a vacation, little things like that. So it was really great to be able to recharge. Then we've had a very gradual, pretty long preseason, so that's also been nice and rare. I feel like I've been trying to kind of soak it up and use it to my advantage."

Fox's summer family time came early, as her parents made the journey from America to Lisbon to cheer her on in the UEFA Women's Champions League final against Barcelona -- which turned out to be a successful trip as Arsenal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.

The Virginia native, who started playing soccer when she was 5 before becoming the first pick in the 2021 NWSL draft after starring for the University of North Carolina, felt it could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her parents to experience the atmosphere of the biggest game in club soccer.

"Coming from the U.S. and growing up, soccer wasn't everything for my family, in the sense that my parents didn't play," she said. "So I think now I feel like they've really invested and just love watching games.

"[It was] such an amazing experience [for them], both obviously coming to watch us and then just exploring a new city and getting to be with the families, getting to celebrate with us afterwards. The stadium was amazing. A lot of it was Barcelona fans and had that away-crowd feeling. But [it was incredible to have my family] able to come on the pitch with us after."

Although the comforts of familiar surroundings were grounding for the USWNT trio over the summer, they ultimately reignited a hunger for the season ahead.

The Futbol W crew discuss how Catarina Macario's form last season will play a huge part in nailing down a starting place in Chelsea's midfield.

Preseason training camps are one of the few chances players get to enjoy the lighter moments with teammates before the chaos of competition begins, and everyone makes the most of them in their own way. But neither Girma nor Macario was prepared for what manager Sonia Bompastor had in store for them when they returned.

Forget the well-worn classics of trust falls, beach volleyball or a trip to "Go Ape." The French coach instead took the team to the Dutch countryside for something truly unique: sheepherding. The task? Work together to maneuver a herd of sheep across a field, a scene that prompted as many raised eyebrows as it did bursts of laughter.

"Sonia did say that it was going to be something that no one had ever done before," Macario recalled, still incredulous. "I think someone gave her a mix of options in terms of team-bonding exercises, and sure enough she was like: 'Yeah, herd some sheep.'"

Clips from the outing quickly made their way online, revealing a string of hilarious moments: players darting after runaway sheep, huddling in tight circles to draw up game plans, and even pausing for exaggerated deep-breathing exercises as if preparing for a final.

Girma couldn't keep a straight face -- when asked if she was doing all right, she burst into laughter before shouting "slowly!" in a desperate attempt to keep her composure while guiding the flock. Chelsea captain Millie Bright leaned into the chaos with a memorable mantra: "Think like a sheep, act like a sheep." Erin Cuthbert, ever the realist, summed up the spectacle perfectly: "The plan ... there is no plan."

As bizarre as it sounds, the session worked, and what began as a slightly surreal outing turned into the kind of memory that can weld a squad together amid laughter, confusion and wool. Chelsea's U.S. contingent can certainly add another string to their bow in terms of adaptation to the British way of life, but it remains to be seen how it will help them on their path toward a seventh successive WSL title.

In a rematch of last year's US Open final, Aryna Sabalenka -- who advanced via walkover on Tuesday -- takes on Jessica Pegula in the semifinals. Which star player has the edge? We break it down.

NEW YORK -- Just a few hours before she was to meet World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a US Open quarterfinal match, Marketa Vondrousova withdrew with a knee injury.

That sent Sabalenka into a Thursday semifinal against No. 4-seeded Jessica Pegula, who earlier defeated Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-3.

It's a rematch of last year's US Open final, won by Sabalenka in straight sets. We make the case for each player left in the draw's top half.

Head-to-head: 7-2, Sabalenka, including the last three in a row -- all on North American hard courts.

In the dizzying daily flood of numbers-crunching statistics, this one stands out:

Sabalenka is only the fifth woman in 35 years to reach all four Grand Slam semifinals in a single year. The others are named Graf, Seles, Hingis and Serena, a Who's Who of tennis greatness.

The catch is that Sabalenka has yet to win one in 2025 -- thanks to three Americans -- a development that suggests she wants to defend her title here very, very badly.

It was Madison Keys who beat her in the Australian Open final, Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros championship match and Amanda Anisimova in a stunning upset in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Going in, with the exception of Roland Garros, Sabalenka went in as the favorite.

She'll be the favorite here, based on that decisive head-to-head advantage.

After she got word that Vondrousova was granting her the walkover, Sabalenka immediately headed for the practice court. She'll be exceedingly fresh for Thursday's match with an extra day off, and after winning her first four matches in straight sets.

You can be sure that Sabalenka, who was stung by those missed opportunities in Melbourne, Paris and London, will throw everything into this one.

Last year was a watershed year for Pegula: She turned 30, shook up her coaching staff and advanced to her first major final.

And now Pegula has the opportunity to beat the very player that denied her the title. On a court that's become her favorite in all the world. Pegula, an American in the only American Grand Slam, is now 15-4 in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Thursday's crowd will be almost completely behind her.

“It would be cool to be able to get revenge, obviously,” Pegula told reporters. “It's going to be a tough challenge. But at the end of a Slam, you expect that to happen, and you expect people to be playing their best tennis and to be playing the best players, because those are the players that are playing the best.”

After a disappointing summer, Pegula has caught fire at just the right time. And while none of her five victories have come against seeded players, she's been exceedingly sharp. She converted five of nine break-point opportunities against Krejcikova and was broken only twice herself.

Pegula knows just how close she was, losing that US Open final 7-5, 7-5.

"I was like, 'Wow, I was right there,'" Pegula marveled. "This year I've come back with a different perspective, knowing that I wasn't playing well, to really enjoy the fact that this is pretty cool.

"I would probably have that mentality, instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly ... and enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final and I'm playing the best player in the world."

When JJ Tracy was going through the process of figuring out which university he would attend, the product of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Hilton Head, South Carolina visited Ohio State University. His host on the trip was Robert Cash, whom he had crossed paths with in the juniors but never played against or with.

“Usually because I wouldn't make it that far in the tournaments,” Tracy said.

“No, he's not giving himself credit,” Cash, from New Albany, Ohio, quickly added.

Both Americans laughed. Today, they are close friends and doubles partners on the ATP Tour who are into the semi-finals of the US Open, trying to become the only All-American men's doubles team to claim the title this century besides twins Bob and Mike Bryan.

But the former Buckeyes' bond truly began to form on that visit before they were teammates.

“I just realised how down to earth JJ was. It's kind of rare in tennis,” Cash said. “I felt like we had a connection off the rip. We were very similar in a lot of ways. He was very cool, very funny, meshed with the team extremely well on his visit and then when he started school, he worked harder than everybody else and that's what I really admired about him. 

“He tried so hard on the court and was an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable friend. I just think that we get along so well off court and on court, and it helps us both ways.”

Cash's longtime dream has been to go to medical school and eventually become a surgeon and his partner, Tracy, studied finance at Ohio State. 

“Never really got to get a big head about any special finance major because we had a couple doctors on the team,” Tracy joked. 

The pair's professional journey nearly was over before it began. In the 2024 NCAA Doubles Championship, Cash and Tracy faced two match points in the semi-finals. Had they let slip one of those points, Cash would have fully focused on medical school applications and Cash would have put his energy into singles.

Instead, they won the tournament and earned a US Open wild card. They also were awarded a wild card into the Hall of Fame Open, reaching their first ATP Tour final there. The Americans made enough progress on the ATP Challenger Tour at the end of the season that they decided to forge forward together and Cash put his dream of becoming a surgeon on pause.

This year they won their first tour-level title in Los Cabos and with their semi-final run in New York are 11th in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

“It's unbelievable. I was playing singles back then, but never in a million years would I go play a 15K or a Challenger in singles and trade it for this. I mean, this is unbelievable,” Tracy said. “It's been super special to see us climb the ranks, from winning our first Challenger tournament to stringing a few of them together, making our first ATP appearance and Los Cabos, getting our first title. 

“We were getting interviewed some in Los Cabos and I kept saying that our goal is to win one of every level of tournament. We've knocked out everything except 500, 1,000 and this, so this would be a good one to knock off.”



A clear reason behind the Americans' success is how well they get along and work together. They don't just merge together well in terms of their games, but also their personalities.

“He's just really easy to be around. He's always got a good attitude, great energy,” Cash said. “People feed off of him, and nothing really brings him down, so he's always got a smile on his face, bringing people, putting smiles on people's faces around him, and such an easy guy to be around.” 

Tracy said: “[He is a] very good leader off the court, on the court. There's been times in my life I was down, there are times I'm down, he's always knocking on my door saying, ‘What's the deal, dude? What's good?' He's always trying to pick me back up. He led all through college as a teammate, as a friend.” 

When Cash and Tracy advanced to the last four on Wednesday evening, countryman Ben Shelton posted his congratulations on Instagram Stories: “Hype for these boys”. They were all in college at the same time.

“I thought it was very nice of him, the college crew kind of sticks together. That guy absolutely is crushing it. He hit the ground running. He's a super, super nice guy off court. Very humble, very grounded, and he's been nothing but supportive and nice to JJ and I off the court,” Cash said. “He didn't have to do that. He's Top 10 in the world in singles. He doesn't have to give us the time of day, but he's such a nice guy off the court, and we're really appreciative of that.” 

The former college standouts know their job is not yet done. Cash and Tracy return to the court Thursday to face this year's Roland Garros champions Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos for a place in the final.

“Our coach has been on us all the time about it off the court. He tells us to stay in the dirt. Stay in the dirt, just don't go too far in the clouds, look too far in advance,” Cash said. “We've got to take it one step at a time. There's still matches to be played, matches to be won. The job's not finished, so we need to be happy, celebrate the win tonight. But we've got to focus and put all our energy and effort towards the match tomorrow.”

Amanda Anisimova, into the US Open semifinals, called her win over six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek the most meaningful of her life. Anisimova won 6-4, 6-3 on Wednesday night, and she'll play Naomi Osaka for a spot in the final.

NEW YORK -- Amanda Anisimova has won 199 matches over the course of her nine-year career on the Hologic WTA Tour, and she can safely say that this one rises above the rest.

"Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I've had in my life," the 24-year-old said on Wednesday night.

She was, of course, referring to her 6-4, 6-3 upset of World No. 2 Iga Swiatek in a packed and raucous Arthur Ashe Stadium to reach her first-ever US Open semifinal.

The win was meaningful for so many reasons, not the least of which was getting revenge -- and peace of mind -- after Swiatek drubbed her 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon final earlier this summer.

But it was extra special on this court, at this tournament, in front of these fans.

Ahead of this match, the world No. 9 focused on staying mindful and playing without fear She also worked to stay positive, something she felt was missing in the championship match at Wimbledon.

"I think that was the most important part of today, is really lifting myself up and trying to pump myself up with positive affirmations," the New Jersey native said after the match. "I think that was something I was really lacking in the Wimbledon final. I wasn't really showing much, or my attitude and my presence wasn't really there. So I think that's also something that I learned that I need to do better of.

"...I feel like I was really supporting myself, which in turn also helped me play better."

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

The night before the match, Anisimova actually watched the Wimbledon final to get a better sense of what went wrong in that first meeting. She then followed that up with some highlights of successes (again, positive affirmations). In rewatching it, she noticed that "I was slow as hell." She certainly wasn't slow as hell on this day, and dictated play with her power -- 23 winners to Swiatek's 13 -- and strong return game (four of nine break points converted). 

She admitted she felt some stress out of the gate, after getting broken in the first game -- "OK, here we go" --  but promptly broke back and felt the stress melt away as she got into a groove. 

And as the match continued, she kept her foot on the gas, never letting up and never giving the six-time Grand Slam champion an inch.

"I think when I started the tournament, I was kind of going into the matches with a little bit of fear and maybe holding back a bit," she said. "As I've been progressing and playing more and more, I told myself you can't go into the match with any fear, especially if I'm playing against top players.

"It's just not a negotiable for me, because if I want to win the match, I'm going to have to play really brave and strong tennis. Today I really came out there with not an ounce of fear."

Anisimova will play Naomi Osaka, who defeated Karolina Muchova on Wednesday evening, on Thursday for a spot in the final. The American has won each of her two meetings against Osaka, though they haven't played since the 2022 French Open.

The bad news is: He has failed to win a set in any of those matches. At the Australian Open and Wimbledon, he picked up injuries along the way, and could only offer token resistance in the semis.

Will the fourth time be a charm?There are a couple of reasons for Djokovic and his fans to believe this one will be different.First and most important, he appears to be healthy. He has called the trainer out on a couple of occasions at this Open, but the problems proved to be passing. He did just survive a tough four-setter against Taylor Fritz that didn't end until late Tuesday night, and at times during that match he did look weary. But he wasn't pushed to the brink. A recovery in two days seems plausible.“I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court,” Djokovic says. “The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed.”The second positive is that instead of Sinner, he'll face Carlos Alcaraz. That might sound like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but it's a fire that Djokovic has endured recently. He has a 5-3 record against Alcaraz, and he's 3-0 on hard courts. He also won their only meeting of 2025, in four sets, in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

A recovery in two days seems plausible.“I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court,” Djokovic says. “The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed.”The second positive is that instead of Sinner, he'll face Carlos Alcaraz. That might sound like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but it's a fire that Djokovic has endured recently. He has a 5-3 record against Alcaraz, and he's 3-0 on hard courts. He also won their only meeting of 2025, in four sets, in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

Djokovic has been at his savviest against Alcaraz, surprising the Spaniard with his early aggressiveness, and holding up better in the clutch. He has had more success imposing his game on him than he has on Sinner.“Would love to be fit enough to play and to play, you know, potentially five sets with Carlos,” Djokovic says. “I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion.”Does Djokovic sound a little pessimistic for a guy with winning record against his opponent? Looking at Alcaraz's form since the spring, he has a right to be. He has won five titles on three surfaces, and hasn't dropped a set so far in New York.“I think today I just played a really—or almost perfect match, I would say,” Alcaraz said after seeing off Jiri Lehecka on Tuesday. “So playing a quarterfinal of a Grand Slam, I'm feeling that way. It seems like, OK, just two more steps to do, and let's see what happens.”

Lehecka is one thing, obviously, Djokovic quite another. Up until now, Alcaraz hasn't been able to shed his sense of awe at the Serb, a mindset that may have contributed to his recent defeats. We'll see if that's still the case, or if his excellent run of play this spring and summer—he has won 43 of his last 45 matches—will finally take him to a place where Djokovic can no longer keep up.“We all know Novak's game,” Alcaraz says. “It doesn't matter that he has been out of the tour since Wimbledon. Playing great matches here. I know he's hungry. I know his ambition for more, so let's see.”Let's see, indeed: This is a tough pick. Djokovic may still have the mental and tactical edge over his younger opponent. But will Alcaraz's youth, athleticism, shot-making, and self-assurance render that moot?

I'm going to take my cue from Djokovic, who, like I mentioned above, sounded surprisingly skeptical about his chances on Tuesday night.“It's just that I'm not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days,” the 38-year-old said. “But I'm going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that.“There's going to be a lot of running involved, that's for sure.”In other words, the road ahead isn't going to get easier. Winner: Alcaraz

Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Wednesday night to advance to the US Open semifinals for the first time since becoming a mother.

Since returning to tennis, Naomi Osaka has often faced stacked Grand Slam draws as an unseeded player -- a recurring challenge that's left her frustrated.

But after reaching the final in Montreal in late July, Osaka arrived in New York seeded at a major for the first time since her comeback. 

Now, she's back in a Grand Slam semifinal.

The two-time US Open champion defeated No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3), Wednesday night to advance to her third semifinal in New York and fifth overall at a major.

This one, though, carries added significance: It's her first Grand Slam semifinal since becoming a mother.

“I'm really inspired by all the moms on tour,” Osaka said after the match. “But I also have this feeling like I'm not doing good enough or that I'm being left behind. And I think when all the moms came back and they did well off the bat, I sort of felt like something was wrong with me. I know that Belinda [Bencic] made the semis of Wimbledon, so I just really felt like I was losing a race in some sort of weird way.

“So yeah, that was on my mind, but now I'm here and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.”

Watching her fire winner after winner in front of a roaring Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd, it was clear that Osaka had something to prove -- and she delivered.

The opening set was tightly contested; with both players holding serve through the first nine games. The only break point in that span came in the very first game, when Muchova threatened early. Osaka erased it with a forehand winner -- one of many she unleashed throughout the night.

Then, almost out of nowhere, Osaka broke Muchova in the final game of the set, forcing the Czech -- who had reached the US Open semifinals each of the past two years -- into a trio of uncharacteristic errors.

After the match, Osaka likened the play as you get deeper into a Grand Slam to boxing -- “but with a tennis ball, obviously.”

To understand what she meant, all you had to do was watch the second set.

Following an off-court visit with the physio between sets, Muchova returned with renewed energy and broke Osaka to begin the second set. It snapped a streak of 18 consecutive service holds for Osaka.

But Osaka, showing the grit of a four-time Grand Slam champion and the resilience of a mother, broke right back.

And when Muchova broke again at 4-all, setting herself up to serve for the second set, Osaka responded with a forehand smash winner to break at love.

Locked into the moment, Osaka said she couldn't recall what was going through her mind at that stage of the match.

“I honestly don't even remember it,” Osaka said. “But she's one of the toughest players that I'm able to play and I've played her so many times. She's beaten me a couple of times and she beat me here last year, so I knew it was going to be a really tough match.”

After saving two break points, Osaka and Muchova traded holds to send the second set to a tiebreak. Before you could blink, Osaka raced out to a 6-2 lead. Two match points later, she sealed her place in the semifinals.

Back like she never left! 😤@naomiosaka | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/NtCD88AwH7

Among players who began their careers in the Open era, Osaka is the third woman to win each of her first five Grand Slam quarterfinals, joining Chris Evert and Aryna Sabalenka.

Speaking of Sabalenka, she'll face Jessica Pegula in the first semifinal Thursday night. Meanwhile, Osaka will meet Amanda Anisimova with a spot in the US Open final on the line.

Anisimova holds a 2-0 record against Osaka at the WTA level, having won both of their previous meetings at Grand Slams in 2022 -- first at the Australian Open, then again at Roland Garros.

Osaka anticipates a challenge as she looks for her first win against the American.

“It's definitely going to be really tough,” Osaka said. “I've played her twice and I've lost both times. She's so talented and she's able to hit a winner from anywhere. So, I know it's going to be tough, and I really like her as a person too, so I'm cheering for her.”

She smiled and clarified: “I'm not cheering for her against me, but yeah, it's going to be fun. Plus, she's American, and you know, this tournament means a lot to her as well.”

Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Wednesday night to advance to the US Open semifinals for the first time since becoming a mother.

That includes the past two Australian Open titles along with his triumph in New York a year ago.He needed just 2 hours Wednesday—the first set took only 27 minutes—fighting off all seven break points he faced. He has dropped just 38 games in his five matches, the second-fewest by a man to reach the US Open semifinals since 2020.Musetti was trying to reach his first US Open semifinal after getting that far at the French Open this year and Wimbledon in 2024.

The former No. 1 wore her Nike day outfit for her evening quarterfinal on Wednesday.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 04, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—Everything is coming up roses for Naomi Osaka at the 2025 US Open except, oddly enough, her rose-themed Nike dress, which the two-time champion has kept in her closet since her first-round win.Typically debuting different outfits depending on whether she is scheduled to play during the day or at night, Osaka has won her last four matches in a glittering purple ensemble—a streak that continued into Wednesday evening, when she avenged a 2024 US Open loss to Karolina Muchova in the quarterfinals.When I asked Osaka where the ruby-rose outfit had gone, the former world No. 1 sheepishly told me she preferred to keep the same kit after a series of strong wins in Flushing Meadows.

“I'm sadly a little superstitious, which is weird, because I did win in the red,” she said in her post-match press conference.“But I feel like the purple looks better on my skin tone too. I took a poll, and apparently some people like the red roses more.”Osaka will be back under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights on Thursday to face Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova, but was unsure if the roses would return.“I would say I want to bring it back, but I can't promise you.”The four-time Grand Slam champion has turned heads with increasingly audacious fashions since returning to action from maternity leave in 2024, wearing (among others) a harajuku/Sailor Moon themed outfit at last year's US Open and floral space buns at Roland Garros in the spring.Her 2025 fashion campaign has been highlighted by, in addition to the varied florals, a growing army of Labubus named in tribute to tennis trailblazers like Althea Gibson, Billie Jean King, and Arthur Ashe.

“I didn't know that,” she said when told she was a fashion icon in press. “Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that if you look good, you can feel good, but I'm also the type of person that thinks wearing different clothes kind of changes you into different characters kind of.“Sometimes I feel like a different person if I wear something. Yeah, for me I just feel like it's really fun. I tell literally everyone this, but I grew up in the, like, Serena, Venus, Sharapova, grand reveal era, and it's just fun to continue that.”The US Open crowd has certainly given Osaka her flowers through five impressive wins, but can she grab the whole bouquet by winning a fifth major title on Saturday?

Rajeev Ram is taking the high road after fellow American Mardy Fish took shots at him on social media during the build-up to the US Open.It all started two weeks ago, when Jannik Sinner retired mid-match from the Cincinnati Open final due to illness, and then withdrew from US Open mixed doubles with Katerina Siniakova—leaving a spot open in the new 16-team draw.Read More: US Open forges new world with revamped mixed doubles tournamentTennis Channel's Jon Wertheim suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that 41-year-old Ram should replace him as a wild card, but many were surprised to see a sharp rebuke from Fish, 43:“How bout another actual tennis player?” Fish wrote.The comment sparked backlash, with many questioning the animosity and pointing out the irony given Fish's 2021 Netflix documentary Breaking Point, in which he opened up about his own mental health struggles in sports.

How bout another actual tennis player

Speaking on an episode of The Changeover Podcast, Ram admitted he was “shocked” by the comments and called out what he saw as hypocrisy.“It is really strange… I mean, the guy that positioned himself as the mental health advocate, and rightfully so, is taking shots at another player—as you said, a compatriot—from behind a keyboard,” Ram said.“No matter what I might think about somebody personally, I could never see myself doing that in a million years.”Ram also expressed concern for Fish's wellbeing: “I mean, I hope he's okay. I don't think he's okay, if he's doing that kind of thing, but I hope he finds a way to get better from that.”He reflected on their strained relationship, but stopped short of revealing details.“He's actually somebody I looked up to for a really long time,” Ram said. “He's a couple years older than me… He had a great career, was a Top 10 player, was our Davis Cup captain for a while.“We haven't spoken to each other in three years, since… summer or fall of 2022.”

It was in the fall 2022 when Fish, as Davis Cup captain, controversially left Ram—then the world No. 1 in doubles—off the U.S. team. Fish instead selected Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul, along with Jack Sock as the doubles specialist. The decision backfired when the U.S. crashed out in the quarterfinals—losing the deciding doubles rubber against Italy.Moments after the loss, which came on Thanksgiving Day, Ram seemed to add salt to the wound with an X post: “How's everyone's Thanksgiving going?”Read More: Happy Thanksgiving... or not?

Fish, who reached three Grand Slam quarterfinals and peaked at No. 7 in the world in the early 2000s, retired in 2015 after a years-long battle with anxiety and depression. He served as U.S. Davis Cup captain for three years before stepping down in January 2023.Ram is a six-time Grand Slam champion, winning four titles in men's doubles with Joe Salisbury—including three straight at the US Open (2021-2023), along with two mixed doubles titles with Barbora Krejcikova.On Wednesday, Ram and Nikola Mektic, the No. 11 seeds, were eliminated from the US Open men's doubles after falling to No. 14 seeds Michael Venus and Yuki Bhambri, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3.

The former world No. 1 has won her last two meetings with Muchova after a second-round defeat in 2024.ByDavid KanePublished Sep 04, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—Revenge is not only sweet, it also means a US Open semifinal for Naomi Osaka, the two-time champion avenging a 2024 defeat to Karolina Muchova, 6-4, 7-6 (3) for her best Grand Slam finish in nearly five years.A former world No. 1, Osaka lost to Muchova in the second round of this very tournament 12 months ago. After winning their initial rematch at the Australian Open in January, the No. 23 seed scored her biggest major win since the 2021 Australian Open in one hour and 49 minutes over the No. 11 seed on Arthur Ashe Stadium Wednesday evening."I learned I loved tennis way more than I thought I did," Osaka said after the match, "and I learned that, you know, I actually really love challenges. You know, it's like a video game. You pick it up, and even if you lose a level, you kind of just restart and keep going until you eventually win. I think it's a little tough at some times, but I wouldn't trade it for the world."Osaka improved to 13-0 past the quarterfinal stage at major tournaments and will face Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova—who avenged her SW19 loss to No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek—for her fifth career Grand Slam final on Thursday.

The four-time Grand Slam champion has been in the midst of a summer renaissance since hiring coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, reaching her first WTA 1000 final since 2022 at the Omnium Banque Nationale and clinching her first Grand Slam seed since becoming a mother in 2023.The 27-year-old Osaka lost just one set through the first week and kicked off the second with a statement victory over No. 3 seed Coco Gauff to book the Muchova rematch in the last eight.Muchova came to Flushing Meadows in hot pursuit of a third straight US Open semifinal, having navigated injuries to once again play her best tennis at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.Where Osaka—flanked by a growing army of Labubus—cruised, Muchova battled. The Czech veteran needed to win four three-set matches—including one over a 45-year-old Venus Williams in the first round—to book a sixth career major quarterfinal.

With their five-year rivalry split at two wins apiece, Osaka began the match in confident fashion, serving her way to a 5-4 lead and clinching the first break of the match to claim the opening set in just over 40 minutes.Muchova left the court for a medical timeout but nonetheless gained momentum by breaking serve to open the second set. Osaka responded with aplomb, hitting through the Czech's famed cat-and-mouse craft to break straight back and hold serve with her 16th winner of the match.Muchova dug out of a 15-30 deficit in the eighth game and found an opening of her own, increasingly matching Osaka's weight of shot. Osaka saved one break point with a forehand winner but narrowly missed a backhand on the second, giving Muchova the chance to serve out the set.Osaka dialed back in on the brink of a decider, claiming a love-break for 5-5 as the match ticked towards the 90-minute mark. The two-time US Open champ saved two more break points and continued hitting through Muchova to edge into a 6-5 advantage, one game from the semifinals.

Muchova employed every bit of her all-court game to force a tiebreaker, but Osaka nabbed the first mini-break of the ensuing Sudden Death and led 4-2 at the first change of ends.Osaka forced another error from Muchova to earn a second mini-break and put the match on her racquet. The Japanese star let out a loud "Come on!" as Muchova netted a forehand for four match points. A hushed silence fell over Ashe as Muchova saved one match point but Osaka converted the second, outrallying her rival to clinch her spot in the semifinals.Osaka will next look to score her first career victory over Anisimova, having lost back-to-back Grand Slam matches to the No. 8 seed at the 2022 Australian Open and Roland Garros.

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

While Ferrari has yet to win a race this season, the loyal Tifosi will be hoping drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton can use the positive energy around Monza to come out on top

Monza's Temple of Speed, nestled in the dense woodland of a royal park, is the home of Italian motorsport and a place where Ferrari's faithful – the Tifosi – come to pay homage to the racing team whom they worship.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton knows what this place means to Italy, having made 18 Grand Prix appearances here, but he's about to experience it in a very different way at the 19th time of asking.

This time, he'll be dressed in red, Ferrari red, and he will be one of two drivers who Italy will want to win. The Briton knows a little of what it feels like already, having received the adoration of the Ferrari fans at Imola earlier this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but Monza is another level.

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

The first non-alcoholic brand backed by Moët Hennessy becomes the first ever official alcohol-free sparkling wine partner of Formula 1.

Formula 1 has announced French Bloom its first ever official alcohol-free sparkling wine partner.

The collaboration ushers in a new era of inviting celebration rooted in performance, precision, and purpose and marks the latest initiative in the partnership between Formula 1 and LVMH.

French Bloom is the first non-alcoholic brand backed by Moët Hennessy, the Wines and Spirits division of LVMH which acquired a minority stake in the Maison in late 2024.

French Bloom's award-winning alcohol-free sparkling wines bring a new dimension to Grand Prix weekends in 2025. Served across all F1 operated Paddock Clubs and the F1 Garage, and planned in other hospitality spaces, French Bloom offers an inclusive and elevated way to toast every moment.

Founded by Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger and Constance Jablonski, French Bloom was born from the belief that no one should be left out of the toast. Joy, excellence, and sophistication should never be compromised, not for alcohol, and not for conformity.

Crafted in France from organic Chardonnay wines, and made entirely alcohol-free through an innovative dealcoholisation process, French Bloom's sparkling wines offer a radically refined alternative for a new generation of consumers – one that's driving the future with clarity, intention, and celebration on their own terms.

As F1 expands its global reach, the partnership arrives at a cultural inflection point. Millennials, Gen Z and a growing female fanbase are increasingly driving demand for luxury experiences that offer flexibility, moderation and align with their evolving values.

French Bloom is built for that moment – for those who choose differently, embrace versatility, and are shaping the future on their own terms.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “We are delighted to add French Bloom to our ever-expanding list of Moët Hennessy brands partnering with the sport. The addition of French Bloom brings further variety to our hospitality beverages portfolio allowing us to cater for all guests and offer them an elevated real sense of luxury when they attend a Grand Prix.”

Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger, Co-Founder of French Bloom, added: “We are thrilled to partner with Formula 1 to usher in a new era of celebration, one that looks boldly to the future and is defined by excellence in every detail. Our sparkling cuvées unite centuries of French winemaking savoir-faire with cutting-edge innovation, offering a sophisticated alcohol-free sparkling for those who lead with intention and set the pace for what's next.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was half a second away from scoring a point at the Dutch Grand Prix, following criticism earlier in the weekend by the team's Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore.

Franco Colapinto has earned praise from Flavio Briatore after narrowly missing out on a points finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Alpine chief calling it “probably his strongest” performance of the season so far.

Going into the weekend, Briatore made headlines by declaring that he was “not happy” with Colapinto's results since the Argentinian took over from Jack Doohan at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix – having so far failed to score.

However, Zandvoort brought more encouraging signs from the F2 race winner, who made his F1 debut as a Williams substitute driver last season before being released to join Alpine over the winter, initially as a test and reserve driver.

Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out.

In an encounter full of incidents and Safety Cars, and amid battling displays from both drivers, Alpine split their approach for the final restart by giving Colapinto fresh tyres and leaving Gasly out on old rubber.

Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position.

“Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”.

Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. It was a race where we had to be alert and ready to capture any opportunity. I felt I drove well and, at the flag, [scored] my best finish of the season.

“As a team there are some parts of the race we will assess to see what we could have done better. We made a call at the end to pit for softs during the final Safety Car to try and attack cars ahead towards the points. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end.

“There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Nick Gehlfuss is a Dick Wolf universe OG again. The Chicago Med alum and and Michael Michele, who recurred on another Wolf series, New York Undercover, are set as leads alongside Tom Ellis on CBS' upcoming crime drama series CIA.


	The FBI offshoot centers on two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law. When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA's New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength.

	Wolf and Leight executive produce CIA alongside Nicole Perlman, David Chasteen, and Peter Jankowski. Eriq La Salle remains attached to direct and executive produce the pilot episode. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, produces in association with Wolf Entertainment and CBS Studios.

	











	Gehlfuss was an original cast members on Wolf Entertainment's NBC drama Chicago Med and played fan-favorite character Dr. Will Halstead for eight season. He is reprising his role in a guest starring appearance on the medical drama's upcoming 11th season. 


	Recently, Gehlfuss finished a run with Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater in its production of Fool For Love, directed by Jeremy Herrin. His other TV credits include recurring roles on Showtime's Shameless, HBO's Newsroom and Starz's Power, among others. He's repped by Gersh, MJ Management and Jackoway Austen Tyerman et al.


	Michele is coming off a recurring role opposite Queen Latifah on another CBS/Universal TV drime drama, The Equalizer.

Michele, who also recurred on Queen Sugar, is repped by Untitled Entertainment, Innovative Artists and Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham.

A 71-minute wisp of a film that moves and sounds like a cartoon wind curlicue, Pete Ohs' “Erupcja” — the Polish word for “eruption” — was (clearly) shot with half an outline and scripted on the fly, to the point that all four of its main actors are credited as co-writers as well. Here, that approach proves a bit more pointed than it did in the director's previous “Jethica” and “The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick,” as its elevated mumblecore energy suits the unformed and searching nature of a wherever you go, there you are story about the ways that people try to make sense of the world around them in real-time.

People like Bethany (Charli xcx, a sly and natural screen presence), a British girl who's convinced that a volcano explodes whenever she blows up her life for a biannual fling with flower shop owner Nel (Lena Góra) in Warsaw. Her puppy dog-like boyfriend Rob (Will Madden) wanted to propose to her in Paris, but when Bethany suggested they go to Poland instead — and not even Kraków, with all of its historic charm — some part of her was expecting the planet to crack open when they got there, as if the Earth itself were responding to her fears of heteronormative complacency. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Sure enough, Mount Etna erupts soon after the couple settles into their rental flat, and Bethany takes it as a sign to slip away from her almost-fiancé at a party one night (what else could it possibly be?), ghosting Rob and his well-planned itinerary in favor of another fiery tryst with Nel. Goodbye sleepy conversations at guidebook-recommended restaurants, hello all-night drug sprees followed by pre-dawn poetry recitations (sex is implied, I suppose, but Ohs' movie is too airy and ethereal to show anything as physical as a kiss). 

Is it “brat” to disappear from your dutiful boyfriend in the middle of the trip he planned for you, knowing full well that you've abandoned him to miserably scour the city for any trace of his would-be future wife? I'm not really sure, to be honest, but sometimes a girl just has to listen to the universe, even if it's really more of a self-absorbed echo chamber. Besides, it's probably never a great idea to marry someone who's saved in your contacts next to the emoji of a guy raising his hand — nobody wants to marry the emoji of a guy raising his hand.

Ohs, who recently moved to Poland himself, is fascinated by the transformative power of being in a foreign space, and by the process through which people — be they transplants or just tourists — try to reconcile who they are to the new reality around them, and “Erupcja” drifts along with the detachedness of an out-of-body experience. Claude (Jeremy O. Harris as an extroverted American painter who meets Bethany and Rob by chance at a sushi restaurant) is probably the closest thing the director has to a surrogate in this story, and at one point the camera finds him pontificating about how “Being immersed in a culture so different from my own helps me turn my brain off so I can enter a dream state more naturally.” 

 










Slight as it is, “Erupcja” crystallizes that condition to a tee. And while Ohs might point to “Celine and Julie Go Boating” and “Alice in the Cities” as his main sources of inspiration for this project, there's something very “‘Lost in Translation' by way of Hong Sang-soo” about how Bethany — subsumed into a waking dreamstate that still feels like real life to all of the people buzzing around her — starts to understand herself more legibly now that she's in another country where she's forced read the subtitles (figuratively for her, literally for us). To that end, Charli xcx's casting adds a metatextual richness to the movie and vice-versa, as the friction between her pop star persona and Bethany's somnambulant everywoman deepens the sense of a woman divided between the superreal and the literal, the spectacular and the mundane. 

“Erupcja” sustains that tension by adhering to a kind of semi-heightened non-logic, as in the very Rivette-like sequence where Bethany invisibly stalks Nel halfway across the city without being noticed. The film's non-judgmental narration — read by Jacek Zubiel — comments on the characters' innermost thoughts along the way, adding to the general patina of narcissism without pointing fingers or placing blame. 

 










It's a (potentially liberating) narcissism that Bethany may never have allowed herself while stuck in the gauziness of her day-to-day existence. Does Bethany not hear the cautionary self-absorption that's baked into the Lord Byron poem she recites directly to camera on the floor of Nel's apartment, or is that the only place where she might have ever related to “Darkness”? Did she have to come to Poland to have an easily interpretable relationship dream about being stuck aboard a speeding train, or did she just have to come to Poland in order to remember it when she woke up? And is Nel capable of sharing in Bethany's selfish dislocation, or is the reality of being in her own home — where she's regularly visited by the semi-jilted girl she's dating (“Ida” star Agata Trzebuchowska) — too grounding to buy into the myth that she and Bethany have been telling each other for the last 10 years or so? 

“Erupcja” is too breezy a film to conclusively answer such questions, but it lingers in spite of its lightness because it understands how the self-centeredness of travel can cut both ways. And, for that matter, how a little bout of main character syndrome might give someone the perspective they need to save them from becoming a subplot in their own life. 

 










“Erupcja” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

In this week's The Contenders, Sabrina Carpenter's new album should launch another big single near the top of the Hot 100 — and return its first one around there.

The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Sept. 13, we look at Sabrina Carpenter's first two singles from her just-released Man's Best Friend set, and which may have the stronger performance on next week's chart.

Sabrina Carpenter, “Tears” & “Manchild” (Island/Republic): Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is all but guaranteed to have the top spot on next week's Billboard 200 albums chart with her new set Man's Best Friend. The follow-up to last year's four-week Billboard 200 No. 1 Short n' Sweet, Carpenter's latest arrives on the back of a good deal of discourse around its provocative title and cover — which the singer-songwriter has largely shrugged off — as well as her second No. 1 on the Hot 100 with lead single “Manchild,” which became her first song to debut atop the chart upon its June release.  

	











	Next week, Carpenter will look to make it two No. 1 debuts in a row with winking, discofied second single “Tears” — which, as “Manchild” did, arrives along with a big new music video. Directed by Bardia Zeinali (who also helmed the Barry Keoghan-co-starring clip for Carpenter's first Hot 100 No. 1, “Please Please Please”), the clip features a Rocky Horror Picture Show-inspired narrative, starring Emmy-winning actor Colman Domingo in drag, as well as elaborate staging and choreography. She has also maintained interest in the new video over the week by premiering multiple differing endings for the video — which originally closed with her killing her boyfriend, out of obligation to her personal brand — over the course of the album's release week.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Tears” is off to a very good start at DSPs, hitting No. 1 on both the Spotify Daily Top Songs USA chart and the Apple Music real-time chart, and maintaining in the top two on both throughout the week. On radio, it's still only getting started, but is also set to make a fairly strong debut, possibly entering the top 25 on Pop Airplay, and earning 7.4 million in all-format audience over the first four days of the tracking week (Aug. 29-Sept. 1), according to Luminate. The one area where it's clearly lagging behind where “Manchild” began is in sales, as “Tears” has had a good-not-great showing on iTunes, currently landing outside the top 25 on that real-time chart. (“Manchild” also had a sizeable first week in vinyl single sales; “Tears” is available for purchase only as a download.)


	“Tears” will also face continued competition from “Manchild” on the chart next week, as that song had slipped out of the top 10 on the Hot 100, but rebounds 14-7 this week with notable gains in both streaming and radio. Those streams should continue to rise for next week with the release of the full Man's Best Friend (which “Manchild” leads off), and the song is also continuing to grow on radio, most likely tracking for a second week atop the Pop Airplay chart, and up another 5% in all-format audience over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period.  


	Whether “Tears” can outpace “Manchild” and put up a real challenge for the No. 1 spot may be determined by its final few days of tracking — as the song returned to the top of the Spotify daily listing after Labor Day Weekend, and may continue to swell from there as more and more listeners catch onto its charms.  

	











HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): The biggest challenge for “Tears” on the Hot 100 will of course be getting past HUNTR/X's “Golden,” which holds at No. 1 this week for a third week, and which hasn't stopped growing yet in either streams or sales. It's taken back the top spot on the Apple Music real-time listing from “Tears” — and has traded off the Spotify daily No. 1 with Carpenter over the course of the week — and it continues to be one of the week's best-sellers, currently ranking at No. 2 on the real-time iTunes chart.  


	And on radio, it's officially taken off. The song is up 10% over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period, trending towards both the top 10 on the Pop Airplay chart and the top 25 on the overall Radio Songs listing. It's crazy to say about a song by a fictional girl group from a K-pop movie musical — versus one of the most consistent radio hitmakers of the last two years — but radio may be the thing that keeps “Golden” out of range for Sabrina Carpenter's latest to pass next week on the Hot 100.

It's been said that several filmmakers at Venice are showing up with their “state of the world” movies. Whether that's Luca Guadagnino with his take on cancel culture, Yorgos Lanthimos satirizing alt-right-style radicalization, or Kathryn Bigelow depicting our mutually-assured madness in nightmarish fashion, many of our most famed directors seem to be looking at a world in flux and asking: “How did we get here?”

Hosoda, a former Studio Ghibli animator who went freelance and has since become one of Japan's most successful auteurs, is no different. His last film, 2021's “Belle”, was a sci-fi adaptation of “Beauty and the Beast.” For his latest act, Hosoda hasn't traveled too far from that baroque fantasy setting, which was already more idealized than the relative normality of his mainstream breakthrough hit (and Oscar nominee) “Mirai.” “Scarlet” is a loose but clearly intended rendering of Hamlet, with all of its castles and knights, ghosts and traitorous uncles — and lots that isn't in Shakespeare's play, too.

One of the first lines of dialogue is Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) plotting the murder of his brother; “I have long dreamed of pouring poison into his ears”, he says, but the King is too popular and Claudius must instead frame him for plotting with a neighboring country, thus enabling his execution. Scarlet (Mana Ashida), a young princess, watches on distraught as her father's ruthless executioners seem to relish in their task. After Claudius poisons her, Scarlet begins her exile into the “Otherlands,” a sort of purgatory, where she plots her revenge alongside a horde of people who feel similarly wronged by their too-short lives.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






But this is a Hosoda movie, so things will become considerably more complicated from there. Much like Mirai's acceptance that he's no longer the man of the house, Scarlet's most important journey is one of self-discovery — a quest far from the violent quest for justice undertaken by the original Prince of Denmark. But there is some of that, too. The Otherlands is a community of struggling people from all places and time periods, who can nevertheless understand each other despite their differences. Scarlet's journey through them will lead her to cross paths with a variety of characters, starting with Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a nurse from modern-day Japan who refuses to convince that he should have died. Soon thereafter, Scarlet encounters a little girl who says that if she were a princess, she would spend her life making sure the world was livable for little girls like her. It's enough for Scarlet to realize that vengeance might be a bit self-centered; there are bigger fish to fry.

The politics of the lost masses without food or a home is not far from James Gunn's “Superman”, another well-intended but fairly vague expression of struggling peoples and the evil rulers depriving them of life and dignity. Scarlet's venture is even more consciously informed by “Dune”, whose heir to the throne is radicalized to embrace the cause of his former antagonists. Hosoda's film poses a similar question to Scarlet as Frank Herbert's saga did to Paul Atreides: How much is this story all about her? Hijiri is a paragon of selflessness who teaches Scarlet that living for others is the only fulfilling way. Hijiri even questions her ruthless approach to warriors sent by her uncle to finish her off, telling Scarlet: “The ultimate warrior fires invisible arrows from an invisible bow.” That isn't really Scarlet's style, and it's probably too much to ask to put the weapons down while she's actively being hunted. But Scarlet does realize she has the power to improve the lives of all the people in the Otherlands — and perhaps even stop some of them ending up there.

 










Unfortunately, Hosoda's ideas in “Scarlet” never get more incisive or interesting than that. There's an over-sweet centre at the middle of it. Its ending is a feast of sincerity that, not just tedious in its own right, feels unrepresentative of the irreverent character with whom we've just spent two long hours. Despite bloody violence throughout, “Scarlet” lacks the edge that would make this culture clash of seminal western tale and Japanese art form as memorable or significant as it ought to be. The first few minutes of the film are a breathless, almost wordless introduction to the Otherlands, with Scarlet trapped under rotting hands clamoring to keep her there. But Hosoda's expressionism virtually disappears thereafter, and a dry sense of order exerts itself once the story is spirited back towards Elsinore.

To that end, “Scarlet” amounts to a frustrating waste of animating and directorial skill for the price of an excessively ordinary story. The sheer scale of Hosoda's success may have softened his storytelling instincts, even if the aesthetics are occasionally remarkable. Having written his past four movies alone, it may be time for Hosoda to consider collaborating once again. And maybe not with Shakespeare.

“Scarlet” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Sony will release the film in U.S. theaters on Friday, December 12.

EXCLUSIVE: In a multi-studio bidding war, Columbia Pictures has paid mid six-figures for the rights to Jonathan Marty's short story The Earthling. Final Destination: Bloodlines helmers Zach Lipovsky & Adam Stein are attached to direct. Eric Heisserer's Chronology and Scott Glassgold's 1201 Films are producing.


	Directing duo's Final Destination: Bloodlines not only ruined the appeal of landscaping with a self-propelled mower, it turned in a $300 million worldwide gross for New Line. Stein & Lipovksy are circling a handful of high-profile projects, so add The Earthling to the pile. The duo is set to be exec producers on The Earthling, as well. Carmen Lewis will also produce on behalf of Chronology.

	Marty's short story attracted a handful of A-list packages around town. The survival sci-fi story has shades of The Martian and Edge of Tomorrow. Heisserer brought The Earthling into Sony through his first look deal there, and has some elevated sci-fi in his background, adapting the Ted Chiang short story, Stories of Your Life into the Denis Villenueve-directed Arrival.

	Marty has made a name for himself in the television space having sold a handful of shows including Splash Damage to Warner Bros. and the one-hour drama AI to the CW.


	The deal marks the seventh short story sale of the year for Glassgold and Verve, who in May sold Drift to Skydance, the Dwayne Johnson-attached Ripped to 20th Century, The Caretaker at Universal with Sydney Sweeney, The Dwelling at Amazon MGM with Michael B Jordan and Occupant at New Line with Zach Cregger producing.

	











	Verve repped Lipovksy & Stein, Marty and 1201 Films; Lipovsky & Stein are also represented by Ground Control and Jamie Feldman. Marty and 1201 are also represented by Jeff Frankel. Chronology is represented by CAA.

You realize ChatGPT can create mini treatments and short story ideas. Just use that and then hire who you want.

AI CANNOT write a second act above 2nd grade level. And still a long way from it. 

But always here for the lazy take of jealous screenwriters.

And the short story (treatment) sales that never get turned into movies grift continues….

How do these high paid execs at multi billion dollars tech companies fall for this? 

With the amount of money they waste on this crap, they could literally finance like 10 more movies a year. Insane. 

I hate to say that the industry contraction is of their own doing.

Pink never looked cooler than when Jason Momoa stepped onto the Venice red carpet. The “Aquaman” star, 46, stole the spotlight at the Venice Film Festival on Wednesday, September 3, when he arrived for the premiere of “In the Hand of Dante”. 

Momoa stepped out in a blush pink suit that wowed onlookers and stole the spotlight.

Known for his bold fashion choices, the actor hit the red carpet with effortless confidence. 

Wearing his long curls loose and accessorizing with sleek black sunglasses, Momoa struck a balance of playful charm and refined style at the star-studded premiere.

It was the details that made the look stand out. Momoa paired his suit with light pink fuzzy Birkenstock Arizona sandals from the brand's 2023 collaboration with Concepts and painted his toenails to match.

He even leaned toward the cameras at one point, striking playful poses to show off the coordinated look.

This isn't the first time Momoa has turned pink on the red carpet. At the 2019 Oscars, he wore a velvet Fendi tuxedo with a matching pink scrunchie on his wrist. He later told InStyle in 2020, “Pink is just a beautiful color. And I'm pretty secure in my masculinity. I don't really give a s—t what anyone thinks.”

Momoa has also shown affection for Birkenstocks over the years. In March, he sported another pink pair while promoting A Minecraft Movie in Mexico.

The Venice appearance comes during a busy chapter for Momoa. In July, he made headlines after shaving off his signature facial hair for “Dune: Part Three”, joking on Instagram: “Haven't shaved in six years, and here we are again. Goddamn it, I hate it!”

Off-screen, the Hawaiian-born star has also been making waves in his personal life. He is currently dating actress Adria Arjona, 33, with the pair making their red-carpet debut earlier this year at the SNL 50 concert in New York City, following his divorce from Lisa Bonet.

From scrunchies to sandals, Momoa continues to prove that true style is about owning every detail — right down to the color of your toenails.

The macabre, medieval-set feature, now shooting in Prague, follows a knight who marries his devoted love after murdering her father — only to betray her for a wealthier bride.


							By 

	Lily Ford



The Hollywood Reporter can unveil a first-look image of Anna Biller's The Face of Horror, set in the plague-haunted medieval era.


Jonah Hauer-King (The Little Mermaid, I Know What You Did Last Summer), Kristine Froseth (The Buccaneers), Ellie Bamber (William Tell), Bella Heathcote (Pieces of Her, Relic), Leo Suter (Vikings: Valhalla, Lynley) and Ben Radcliffe (Masters of the Air) star in Biller's new film, now shooting in Prague. The American filmmaker is best known for 2007's Viva and 2016's The Love Witch.




The Face of Horror is based on the most famous Japanese ghost story of all time, Yotsuya Kaidan. It follows knight Edward Carnifex (Hauer-King), who marries his devoted love Eleanor (Froseth) after murdering her father — only to betray her for a wealthier bride (Heathcote). And it is only a matter of time before Eleanor will be forced to take a bloody revenge…

	Bamber plays Eleanor's sister Beatrice and Suter stars as Edward's squire and Beatrice's suitor, Richard. Radcliffe is Roger, the ill-fated tailor drawn into Edward's web of deception. Embankment Films released a still from the movie on Thursday, showing Hauer-King as Edward stood behind Froseth's Eleanor.


	The film is produced by Biller, with Mike Goodridge and James Bowsher for Good Chaos. The company's upcoming slate includes Edward Berger's Ballad for a Small Player (coming to Netflix later this year) and László Nemes's Orphan, in competition at Venice.


	Jared Sanford is executive producing and Sirena Films is servicing the production in the Czech Republic. Other executive producers are Phil Hunt for Head Gear Films and Compton Ross for Metrol Technology.

	











	“The Love Witch established Anna as a singular voice in genre cinema — a cult classic that resonated with cinephiles and horror fans worldwide, which has had a long life on multiple platforms,” said Goodridge. “She has followed this up with a bigger, bolder, even more ferociously entertaining film designed for the big screen: laced with sly humour, unapologetically bloody, and rendered in her signature technicolour style. A medieval nightmare with bite — this is the kind of fresh storytelling that current audiences demand.”


	Embankment handles worldwide sales and co-represents U.S. rights with WME Independent.

EXCLUSIVE: Harriet Slater (Outlander: Blood of My Blood), Arsema Thomas (Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story) and Tom Brittney (Grantchester) are leading cast in anticipated survival thriller Fall 2, which wrapped principal photography earlier this year in Thailand.


Jigsaw and Predestination helmers Michael and Peter Spierig directed the second installment in the breakout franchise, and original Fall writer-director Scott Mann co-wrote the script with Jonathan Frank.


	We can reveal the official synopsis: “Overwhelmed by her sister Hunter's death, Jax (Slater) connects with Luce (Thomas), Hunter's fearless friend. To heal, they attempt the infamous plank walk of Mount Kwan in Thailand. After a sudden rockslide leaves them stranded on a fragile plank 3000 feet in the air, Jax must confront her deepest fears and fight for survival to find closure.”

	The film is scheduled to release in early 2026 through Lionsgate. Capstone will continue sales at this week's TIFF market.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The sequel reunites producers Mark Lane and James Harris of Tea Shop Productions (47 Meters Down), Capstone's Christian Mercuri, David Haring, and Mann via the Flawless banner. 


	Dan Asma, John Long, and Roman Viaris also return as executive producers alongside Capstone's Ruzanna Kegeyan. Wych Kaos' Kaos Entertainment served as production service partners in Thailand, with Kaos also joining as executive producer. Capstone Studios greenlit both Fall 2 and Fall 3 under the franchise, and Mann will return to write and direct the third installment.

	











	Low-budget thriller Fall was a breakout hit at the box office and on Netflix. The movie drew more than $20M in box office from its original $3M budget. The film used Flawless technology to assist with dubs and ore family friendly versions of the film. Expletives spoken in the film by star Virginia Gardner, for example, were changed to family-friendly language, which was important in broadening the film's success. 


	“We are delighted to be working with the extremely talented Spierig Brothers and this incredibly dynamic cast to introduce the next chapter in the Fall franchise,” said Tea Shop's James Harris. “With Michael and Peter's vision we hope to bring a bigger and even more vertigo inducing experience to audiences.”


	“We were huge fans of the first film and couldn't wait to continue the journey. Our aim was to capture the same intensity that Scott Mann and his team established in the original, while adding new, layered characters who will connect with audiences as they endure extreme and terrifying heights,” added The Spierig Brothers.


	Slater is repped by The Artists Partnership and Untitled Entertainment; Thomas is repped by Accelerate, M88 and WMG in South Africa; Brittney is repped by United Agents, Gersh Agency, Authentic Talent and Literary Management, and Hansen, Jacobson.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed today that mRNA vaccines kill people during a tense Senate hearing. The most common Covid-19 jabs, such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna, are mRNA vaccines.


	Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) asked Kennedy, Donald Trump's top health regulator, about his firing of every member of the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with his own picks. 


	“Are you aware that … one of these new members, Dr. [Retsef] Levy, wrote that ‘evidence is mounting and indisputable that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death, especially among young people,'” Bennet said. “Yes or no, are you aware that he said that?”


	“I wasn't aware. I agree with it,” responded Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaxxer.


	Levi is a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former intelligence official for the Israeli military. He does not have a medical background, and there is a petition calling for his firing.  

	











	In January 2023, Levi posted on X that mRNA vaccines cause harm: “The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!”


	Kennedy's speech was raspy and labored throughout the Senate Finance Committee hearing, with viewers noting that heavy breathing, which almost sounded like snoring, could be heard over the microphone. 

	











RFK Jr. frequently sparred with Democratic senators, and he was also testy with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician who cast a key vote to confirm him to lead the Health and Human Services Department (HHS). 


	“You just told Sen. Bennet that the Covid vaccine killed more people than Covid,” Cassidy said.


	“I did not say that,” Kennedy insisted.


	Cassidy noted that patients are having trouble getting Covid vaccines, now that the Food and Drug Administration — which is part of HHS — has limited access to annual booster shots to people over the age of 65 or those with certain medical conditions.

	“I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines,” Cassidy said. 


	“You're wrong,” Kennedy responded.


	Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) asked if Kennedy accepted the statistic that a million Americans have died from Covid. The United States reached that mark in May 2022, according to data from John Hopkins University.


	“I don't know how many died,” Kennedy said, before attempting to blame the CDC. “It was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC.”


	Merkley seemed stunned. He asked Kennedy if he believes “the vaccine did anything to prevent additional deaths.”

	“I would like to see the data and talk about the data,” Kennedy replied.


	“The secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from Covid, know if the vaccine helped prevent any deaths, and you are sitting as secretary of Health and Human Services?” Merkley said, before pleading: “How can you be that ignorant?”

When the Academy Museum first opened in September 2021, one of its most popular (and largest) artifacts was the sole surviving full scale model of the shark from Steven Spielberg‘s “Jaws,” lovingly restored by special effects master Greg Nicotero. Four years later, the museum is coming full circle with “Jaws: The Exhibition,” a massive undertaking that opens to the public on September 14 and provides an unprecedented opportunity for a deep dive into every aspect of the creation, reception, and legacy of Spielberg's masterpiece.

“Our goal in the exhibition space is to parallel the sense of joy, revelation, and discovery that is spurred by the cinema space,” senior exhibitions curator Jenny He told IndieWire. “Whether you've seen ‘Jaws' more times than you can count, or if you've never watched the film, this exhibition aims to recollect the movie experience. Visitors can find their favorite ‘Jaws' moments or discover this classic film for the first time.” The exhibition marks the first time the museum's largest space has ever been devoted to a single movie, though it's indicative of the film's expansiveness and importance that He still felt the biggest challenge was figuring out what was essential and what could be omitted.

“Since exhibitions are a form of spatial storytelling, the challenge in any exhibition is space limitations,” He said, “but it is even more pronounced with ‘Jaws.' Every frame of this near-perfect film can be analyzed and explored.” The intention behind the exhibit is to take viewers through “Jaws” scene-by-scene through original production artworks and objects, interactive moments, and immersive re-creations, all utilizing many works that have never been made available for public viewing.

 










Among these are original concept illustrations by production designer Joe Alves, the Panavision underwater camera used for the film, behind-the-scenes photographs captured by boom operator Frank Meadows, and Quint's sport-fishing fighting chair from the Orca boat. Most importantly, the museum had access to Spielberg's personal collection, which “led to insightful confirmations of his imprint on every aspect of the film's production,” according to He. Spielberg's sketches and notes will be on display alongside objects sourced from private collectors, many of which give a sense of the marketing blitz that accompanied “Jaws” upon its release and afterwards.

“We will have on view a large display of vintage merchandise, which assistant curator Emily Rauber Rodriguez has meticulously sourced from two in-depth collections of ‘Jaws' memorabilia,” He said, noting that other artifacts required a bit of detective work. “Through a persistent search, curatorial assistant Alexandra James Salichs has located film editor Verna Fields's Academy Award for ‘Jaws,' which had several owners after Fields's passing.”

One of the most innovative aspects of “Jaws: The Exhibition” is its immersive quality, as the Academy Museum has found ways of placing visitors in the shoes of the film's characters and filmmakers. “Visitors can create their own dolly zoom shot, a cinematography technique conceived by director Alfred Hitchcock and executed by second-unit cameraman Irmin Roberts for Vertigo (1958),” He said. “Steven Spielberg and director of photography Bill Butler adapted the dolly zoom for ‘Jaws' to perfectly telegraph police chief Martin Brody's dread.” 

 










Another activation enables visitors to play composer John Williams's famous two-note theme that signals the shark's approach. “We will also have a scale replica of the mechanical shark, built by KNB EFX co-founders Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger,” He said. “Visitors can become a part of the ‘Jaws' special effects team and move the shark themselves!” In another instance, the museum spotlights a story about an unplanned sinking of the Orca, when a production boat that was pulling the onscreen boat went too fast and yanked out the Orca's planking. 

As He explains, “Steven Spielberg recalled, ‘I have this image to this day of [production sound mixer] John [Carter] sinking holding his recorder. Months later, he was holding an Oscar in those hands!' This story will be told via a re-creation of the Orca out on an ‘open sea' immersive environment.” Another famous tale from “Jaws” relating to a reshoot in Verna Fields' pool that yielded the film's biggest jump scare is related to exhibit visitors in a “pool” environment, with the idea being, as He puts it, to “make the production history tangible.”

Film excerpts from “Jaws” will be shown throughout the exhibition, in creative viewing spaces are motivated by the film's production design. “Visitors can step inside a cabana to watch a beach scene. and sit inside the Orca's cabin for Quint's USS Indianapolis monologue,” He said, noting that curating the exhibition has deepened her admiration for a movie, and a filmmaker, she already loved. 

 










“I've always been an incredible fan of ‘Jaws' and the work of Steven Spielberg,” He said. “As the first modern summer blockbuster, ‘Jaws' changed not only the film industry's release strategies, it also altered the expectations of audiences. The summer became the time to see the films that everyone is going to be talking about, capturing the attention of film enthusiasts and casual moviegoers alike. 50 years later, this template remains in place.”

Given the movie's 50th anniversary this year, honoring it at the Academy Museum was a no-brainer for He and her colleagues. “Its significance has stood the test of time,” He said. “I've attended numerous ‘Jaws' screenings over the years, including several anniversary screenings this year. The theaters were always packed and sold out.” Now, He hopes the museum's exhibition will encourage both a deeper and broader understanding of a movie that nearly everyone who loves movies adores. “We're excited to present ‘Jaws' like never before.”

“Jaws: The Exhibition” runs at the Academy Museum from September 14, 2025 to July 26, 2026.

	“I'm a student of hooks,” the exceedingly prolific Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard tells Rolling Stone. If you're familiar with GBV's 40-plus-album catalog, that's an understatement. “That perfect combination of a lyric and a chord pattern that gives you that chill up the back of your spine.”


	The band nails that combo with their new single “(You Can't Go Back to) Oxford Talawanda.” It's the first track off of Thick, Rich and Delicious, their second album of 2025. The LP arrives on Halloween, which is also Pollard's 68th birthday.

	According to Pollard, the new single includes a hook he's been singing his whole life, but had yet to find a home for. A straight-ahead rocker mysteriously named after an Ohio high school, the track is a worthy inclusion to the band's 30-plus-song set list: sing-along heavy and driving. It's part of a suite of new songs — as well as older tracks culled from previous sessions — that the band recorded at a Brooklyn studio in an effort to capture the feel of their live shows.

	











Thick, Rich and Delicious follows February's Universe Room, of which Pollard told Rolling Stone: “I wanted to create, hopefully, an experience, kind of a wild ride, where the listener would want to hear it multiple times in order to grasp all the sections and fields of sound to discover something new with each listen.” Both albums were produced by Travis Harrison.

The project comes just a couple of months after the pop star's first Swag.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It looks like Justin Bieber isn't turning his swag off just yet. 


	On Thursday (Sept. 4), the pop star announced that a sequel to his July Swag album is arriving at midnight Friday (Sept. 5), posting multiple photos to Instagram of new electronic billboards that have gone up in different cities. With pink backgrounds, the advertisements simply read, “Swag II.”


	In his captions, Bieber wrote, “SWAG II midnight tonight” and “Midnight tonight.”

	











	The news comes after Billboard previously reported that Bieber had more music in store for fans after Swag, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 after the Grammy winner dropped it earlier this summer. While Swag was distinctly R&B-focused — peaking at No. 1 on the Top R&B Albums chart — Swag II will be more pop-inspired, sources indicated at the time.




			Trending on Billboard		







	With the first Swag arriving a little over a month ahead of the 2026 Grammy eligibility window closing on Aug. 30, the runway is also clear for Swag II to score nods at the 2027 awards — meaning Bieber would avoid competing against himself in any categories next year.


	Bieber's sudden announcement marks the second time this year he's unveiled an album with hardly any warning. Fans also only knew that the first Swag was coming just a few hours ahead of time, with the star planting black-and-white billboards displaying album visuals and the tracklist in New York City just before the LP's release.


	In the months since, Bieber has stayed busy by releasing music videos for tracks on Swag, including Billboard Hot 100 hits “Daisies” and “First Place.” The latter showed the hitmaker working on music at Floki Studios in Iceland, where he recorded Swag (and possibly Swag II).

	











	He's also been sharing photos of himself in the studio in recent weeks, possibly hinting to fans that Swag wasn't the last they'd be hearing from him any time soon. Beliebers are sure to welcome the high volume of new music he's been creating, as they'd previously had to wait four years for a new album after 2021's Justice.

Fans learned which celebrities would be competing on season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars” on September 3. Naturally, the network also revealed which professional dancers they'd be dancing with. Now, host Alfonso Ribeiro says the DWTS pairings were different weeks before the announcement. 

Ribeiro spoke to US Weekly about how the pairings usually work. He said, “Typically, once we have a list of the pros that are gonna be on, we then, at some point, we'll get the opportunity to hear who's gonna be [on the show]. But it's never final, right?”

He went on, “It's ever-changing, and there were some pairings that were different three weeks ago.” Ribeiro continued, “Things continue to evolve as new people come in, and you realize, ‘Oh, actually, this is a better pairing than that pairing.' And they work on it right up until the final day until [the stars and pros] meet each other.”

He also stated that the show's executives “always get it right” regarding pairing celebrities with pros on “Dancing With the Stars.” According to him, “They figure it out. I don't know how they do it, but they always figure out how to put the right people together.” The beloved actor added, “They're magical.”

Elsewhere in the US Weekly interview, Ribeiro teased season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars.” He said, “I knew it was going to be a great season. I mean, it's really incredible, the amount of incredible personalities. We haven't seen this yet, but great dancing, great stories to tell [and] nostalgia. There's a lot of everything coming.”

Ribeiro continued, “You've got so many great people from different generations coming together, and … everyone's getting along, everyone's having a great time. I think it's gonna be an incredible season.” He also opened up about rehearsals. 

According to him, “They're just getting started. I've heard some things [and] there's gonna be some fun stuff.”

Fans don't have long to wait for the premiere of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34. According to ABC News, the show is set to premiere on September 16. It airs on ABC and is also available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu. 

This season of DWTS includes 14 celebrities. Some of them are Corey Feldman, Danielle Fishel, Dylan Efron, and Hilaria Baldwin. Julianne Hough also hosts the show in addition to Ribeiro.

Say what you will about Ryan Murphy's real-life murderer anthology, but at least he's settled on less cumbersome titles. Monster: The Ed Gein Story rolls off the tongue a lot easier than Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Yes, the series seems to have found its groove, so what better time to approach a figure Netflix describes as “history's most singular ghoul?” It's Charlie Hunnam's turn to be monstrous when the new season premieres October 3, and based on the trailer, he's up to the task.

“Serial killer. Grave robber. Psycho. In the frozen fields of 1950s rural Wisconsin, a friendly, mild-mannered recluse named Eddie Gein lived quietly on a decaying farm—hiding a house of horrors so gruesome it would redefine the American nightmare,” reads the synopsis for the series. “Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. From Psycho to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to The Silence of the Lambs, Gein's macabre legacy gave birth to fictional monsters born in his image and ignited a cultural obsession with the criminally deviant. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre—he became the blueprint for modern horror.”

﻿

Monster: The Ed Gein Story features a handful of Murphy alumni, as Murphy shows are wont to do; that includes Tom Hollander (Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans), Charlie Hall (Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story) and Lesley Manville (Grotesquerie). Some esteemed newcomers to Murphy's sandbox include Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf as Ed's mother Augusta Gein and Vicky Krieps as Ilse Koch. But once you're in the Murphy cinematic universe, you're in for life (well, except maybe Patti Lupone). Krieps has signed on to appear in the next season of Monster about Lizzie Borden, and it was reported this week Hunnam is in talks to play Borden's father. From killer to victim in just two seasons—now that's range.

Late one night, Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) is out with his friends, laughing. There's an anxious tremor echoing through the car — Cliff (Raúl Castillo), sitting shotgun, can't hide his nerves — but it only elicits more chuckles from the driver, who's all but perfected the practice of self-serenity. His chosen music carries a soothing pulse and leisurely lyrics, and when Peach Boy (Owen Teague) questions the vibe, Robbie calmly explains, “Transportative [sic], isn't it? Takes you away from your reality, puts you in another.”

Robbie invites Peach Boy to close his eyes and imagine white sandy beaches, a big blue ocean, and beautiful women asking to dance with him. As Peach Boy sways sensually in the backseat, Robbie reaches his point: “Everyone's fucking happy as shit on that beach,” he says. “You don't got a care in the world.” Then, as Peach Boy's dreamy dancing gets a little more graphic, the men laugh and ride deeper into the night.

Circumstances aside, it's easy to believe everyone in that car, at that moment, is happy as shit, too; that these are the good times they should be savoring, rather than the reality they feel the need to escape. But the conditions eliciting stress aren't so easily tossed out, nor could they be for this specific crew on this specific evening. Robbie and the boys are on their way to a trap house, which they plan to loot, quickly and cleanly, as they have a half-dozen times before. The stolen cash won't go toward buying their own island, like Robbie and Cliff joked about earlier — there isn't enough for that. Instead, the blood money will be repurposed toward something if not good, then necessary: their families, their futures, their personal slice of paradise. 

 










“Task,” from “Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby, is “transportative,” too. Robbie's practical version of that blissful beach is a remote quarry near his rural home. But over the years, his halcyon memories of swimming there with family and friends have darkened to a cold, isolated present. “Task” is so ingrained in the arduous lives of its dueling leads — Robbie and Tom (Mark Ruffalo), the FBI agent assigned to catch him — that it's able to simultaneously sweep us away to another place and level us with its wrenching reality. Casually shedding the clichés it's built upon, HBO‘s crime saga mounts a potent blend of cat-and-mouse chase, bleak family drama, and a character study of quite a few characters under extreme emotional duress. The laughs may be hard to come by, but the emphasis on caring — not as a burden to escape, but a responsibility to embrace — more than makes up for the hardships along the way.

That's life, isn't it? A good one can find compassion even where it appears there's none to be found.

When the seven-part series starts, Tom is reeling from the recent death of his wife, Susan (Mireille Enos) and the ongoing incarceration of his son, Ethan (Andrew Russel). Mourning the woman who lured him out of the priesthood and torn over what to do for his youngest child as he awaits sentencing, Tom can't even find solace in God. He prays most mornings — before dunking his head in an ice bath to shock himself back to an agonizing existence — but there's no response. “I'm lost,” he bluntly, honestly, tells his teenage daughter, Emily (Silvia Dionicio), as Ruffalo's soulful eyes convey his heartbroken truth.

 










Tom's self-aware suffering is one of many subtle ways “Task” defies convention. This isn't a man in denial. He doesn't need a gruff talking-to from his partner, nor is there a case he can crack to make everything at home OK again. His unimaginable situation leaves him with no obvious path forward — a purposeful choice by Ingelsby for a character who's literally trained in trauma recovery. (Tom got started with the FBI when they asked him to counsel victims at disaster sites.) Now, he's trying to use the tools that have always helped before, and they're not working. He's not only lost, but abandoned and hopeless.

Robbie isn't faring much better. His brother was killed a few months back, and while his wife didn't die, she's still gone —  having walked out on him and their two kids when times got hard. Now, Robbie is the only adult responsible for three minors, although his niece, Maeve (Emilia Jones), is handling most of the childcare. She cooks (enduring the complaints of her picky younger nephew), cleans (looking after the rural home, including a chicken coop out back), and works part-time at an arcade (with the one friend she has time to see).

Robbie tries to be appreciative of the young matriarch's sacrifices. His love for his kids comes through in the easy-breezy demeanor he brings home from his day shift picking up trash, buoyantly bouncing through a busy home to play with his son and charm his daughter. (The light Pelphrey infuses into Robbie is a brilliant, devastating choice, especially when cast so starkly against Ruffalo's hopelessness.) But his night job — stealing stacks of cash from drug dens — leaves a darker mark, no matter how well he composes himself before each raid, and his past damage paired with mounting responsibilities and a dangerous side-hustles leaves him just as wayward as Tom.

 










Maeve is practically a third lead (giving “CODA” star Jones her belated “Winter's Bone” moment), and her wise-beyond-her-years perspective doubles as a check on Robbie's recklessness and a reminder of how much familial responsibility is traditionally thrust upon women. Robbie can only chase down his own dreams (and demons) because Maeve's at home with the kids, doing the domestic and emotional labor by keeping him updated on their lives, maintaining relationships that don't even involve her. She's a hero in her own right, and “Task” rightly portrays her as such.

Similarly, Tom can only chase down Robbie and his team with the help of colleagues who are mostly women. In addition to his boss, Tom's task force consists of Grasso (Fabien Frankel), an affable bro and lapsed Catholic who still wears a cross around his neck; Lizzie (Alison Oliver), a green local cop who's easily startled; and Aleah (Thuso Mbedu), a smart, experienced, sharpshooter who's basically everything Lizzie is not. Yet it's the two women who form real bonds — with each other and the rest of the team — while Tom and Grasso tend to do their own thing (when they're not throwing shade at the religion that failed them). Oliver and Mbedu, both excellent in their own breakthrough roles (“Conversations with Friends” and “The Underground Railroad,” respectively), are impressive again here.

 










Enriched by regular moments of grace, “Task” still moves at an engrossing, steady pace. Ingelsby preserves the thrills of a relentless investigation while foregrounding his ensemble's relatable — often painfully so — experiences with guilt and forgiveness. Action is steadily interspersed throughout, including multiple tense chases scenes and a heart-in-your-throat shootout. Mysteries aren't the focus, but there are lingering questions that pop up and pay off in timely fashion. Each character's overall arc is satisfying, with a few minor hiccups (but with immense credit to casting director Avy Kaufman), and the story is balanced in a way that should reward weekly viewing.

Still, it's the way that Ingelsby interrogates the building blocks of a good life that hits the hardest. Tom and Robbie have been dealt bad hands. There's nothing they could have done to prevent their present circumstances (or, at least, nothing alluded to by the show), but what they do next not only drastically impacts their own quality of life but also their families'. What do we owe our loved ones? What do we owe the next generation? What do we owe ourselves? Ingelsby weighs these choices against each other without getting preachy or searching for answers that aren't there. Instead, he leads with compassion for all his characters (well, almost all of them), and that appreciation, under such dire constraints, leaves no excuse for forgetting to lead with empathy ourselves, amid comparably better days.

 










Watching “Task” may bring to mind Michael Mann's “Heat” and Ben Affleck's “The Town,” or Bruce Springsteen's “The River” and Ruffalo's last HBO series, “I Know This Much Is True” — movies, songs, and shows that run bone-deep in their recognition of the distinctions that make us unique, the commonalities that connect us to each other, and the hands of fate that too often make you wonder what could've been. Such comparisons aren't a slight, just as “Task” doesn't suffer for its similarities to other shows. (The DelCo accents are bound to get a ton of press, but I barely heard them by the finale.) Great stories can take us away from one reality and immerse us in another, or they can heighten reality to such a degree it's all you can see. What matters is that, either way, they resonate so strongly you can't help but give a shit. 

On this ride, the tears are just as valuable as the laughter.

“Task” premieres Sunday, September 7 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.

Mere months after sweeping the 97th Academy Awards with “Anora,” Sean Baker is making a tangential return to the Oscar race. The auteur co-wrote and edited “Left-Handed Girl,” the solo debut of his “Take Out” co-director Shih-Ching Tsou, which has been selected as Taiwan's official Oscar submission.

Like “Take Out,” “Left-Handed Girl” is set in the restaurant industry, following a mother-daughter-daughter relationship in Taipei as the family attempts to open a food business. An official synopsis for the film reads: “A single mother and her two daughters return to Taipei after several years of living in the countryside to open a stand at a buzzing night market. Each in their way will have to adapt to this new environment to make ends meet and maintain the family unity. But when their traditional grandfather forbids his youngest left-handed granddaughter from using her ‘devil hand,' generations of family secrets begin to unravel.”

“Left-Handed Girl” stars Janel Tsai, Nina Ye, Teng-Hui Huang, Shih-Yuan Ma. Tsou, Baker, Mike Goodridge, Jean Labadie, and Alice Labadie serve as executive producers.

The film premiered in the Critics' Week section of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, where many critics praised its realist storytelling. 

“Tsou applies the restless energy of her longtime collaborator's beloved social-realist works — portraits of men and women working against their class station to find a better living — to ‘Left-Handed Girl,' which rests on the skillfully directed performance of a five-year-old girl (Nina Ye, a small child who effervescently commands the camera) in the lead,” IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his Cannes review. “The movie, even when tracking the older daughter I-Ann (Shih-Yuan Ma) and mother Shu-Fen (Janel Tasi) who make up this heartwarming family trio, is always inside the tiny girls' eyes and ears, looking at the world from a place of wonderment and confusion as she tries to make sense of an adult world. The girl's grasp, though, on Mandarin and years spent living with adults and fewer children makes her already almost too mature for her own good.”“Left-Handed Girl” opens in select theaters on November 14 before streaming on Netflix on November 28.

Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Drake and Morgan Wallen are among the brightest summer stars.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Mariah Carey is Christmas royalty, per her performance on Billboard's holiday charts with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” But the bounds of her reach know no seasons.


	She's also among the top-charting acts in the history of Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart.


	As previously reported, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” reigns as the No. 1 hit on the season-ending 2025 Songs of the Summer survey. The running tally tracks the most popular titles based on cumulative performance on the weekly streaming-, airplay- and sales-based Billboard Hot 100 chart each year from Memorial Day through Labor Day.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Below “Ordinary,” Morgan Wallen boasts the Nos. 2, 3 and 4 songs for summer 2025: “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, “Just in Case” and “I'm the Problem,” respectively. He is the first artist with three top five entries on a season-closing Songs of the Summer chart.




	In Billboard's analysis of this year's tally, staff asked: “Is Wallen now the 2020s' unquestioned summertime king?” According to the numbers, and only halfway through the decade, he is clearly in the running to don the crown.


	But which artists have had the most success on Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart, dating to the Hot 100's launch in the summer of 1958?


	Below is a look at the acts with the most season-ending Songs of the Summer No. 1s and top 10s, as well as the one name with two summer coronations in the ‘20s and the artists with the most top 10 finishes so far this decade.


	Six elite artists, including Carey and Wallen, have each achieved No. 1 songs of the summer as many as two times. Here's a rundown:


Rihanna rules with 10 songs that have made the top 10 on season-ending Songs of the Summer charts.


	Her hottest summer hits: “Pon De Replay” (No. 4, 2005); “Unfaithful” (No. 8, 2006); “Umbrella,” featuring Jay-Z (No. 1, 2007); “Take a Bow” (No. 2, 2008); “Disturbia” (No. 8, 2008); Eminem's “Love the Way You Lie,” featuring Rihanna (No. 2, 2010); “Where Have You Been” (No. 6, 2012); Calvin Harris' “This Is What You Came For,” featuring Rihanna (No. 5, 2016); “Needed Me” (No. 7, 2016); and DJ Khaled's “Wild Thoughts,” featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller (No. 4, 2017).


	Here's a look at the acts with the most songs that finished in the top 10 on Songs of the Summer charts:

	











	As noted above, Wallen is the only artist with multiple season-ending Songs of the Summer No. 1s this decade, dominating with “Last Night” in 2023 and as featured on Post Malone's “I Had Some Help” in 2024.


	Wallen has also earned the most top 10s — five — on the Songs of the Summer chart this decade, thanks to his two No. 1s in 2023 and 2024 and his three top five hits this year.


	Harry Styles and SZA have each reached Labor Day with four entries in the Songs of the Summer top 10 in the ‘20s. Styles scored with “Watermelon Sugar” (No. 6) and “Adore You” (No. 10) in 2020 and “As It Was” (No. 1) and “Late Night Talking” (No. 9) in 2022. SZA placed in the top 10 as featured on Doja Cat's “Kiss Me More” (No. 4, 2021), with her own “Snooze” (No. 8) and “Kill Bill” (No. 9) in 2023 and with Kendrick Lamar on “Luther” (No. 5, 2025).


	Plus, Sabrina Carpenter has collected three Songs of the Summer top 10s this decade, all since last year: “Espresso” was No. 4 and “Please Please Please,” No. 6, in 2024 and “Manchild” rode to No. 9 this summer.

On the surface, yes, the idea of making a documentary on the life of John Candy seems like a pretty great idea — I mean, who doesn't love John Candy? — but as director Colin Hanks points out, well, wait, not so fast. 

Now, let's quickly note that Colin Hanks would know what he's talking about because he, in fact, did make a documentary about the life of John Candy. And the problem that presented itself was, yes, everyone does love John Candy. As much as this is a man whose life should be celebrated, watching his friends and family talk about how great he is doesn't necessarily make a riveting narrative for a film.

What Hanks deftly does with his “John Candy: I Like Me” is frame his film around Candy's anxiety about his own mortality. John Candy's father died from a heart attack when Candy was only five, so he lived with the notion and mindset that he was possibly living on borrowed time — something that, sadly, came to fruition in 1994. (It's frankly shocking to think John Candy has now been gone for over 30 years. Even more shocking, Candy's “Uncle Buck” costar Macaulay Culkin appears as a talking head in this film and reminds the viewer he is now older than Candy was when Candy passed.)

Ahead, Hanks takes us through the process of crafting a film based on a larger-than-life public figure who still means so much to so many people. And why he almost didn't make the film because of his own personal history with Candy, who he had met on the set of his father Tom Hanks' film, “Splash.” It was a history that was so special to Hanks that, maybe, it was best to just remember him as he already did. 

Obviously — and thankfully — Hanks decided otherwise, and his film will open this year's Toronto International Film Festival on Thursday night.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: I had never seen “Yellowbelly.” It's at least tied with the hardest I've laughed watching a movie this year.

Colin Hanks: Right? Conan O'Brien told me that story on the podcast, and I was like, “Oh, I'm going to have to check that out.” And then it wasn't until we spoke with him for the film that we were able to track the sketch down, and I laughed so hard. Conan says it, the fact that that's such an Oppenheimer moment for Conan, who is someone that I just admire so much. I'm so glad that a sketch from all the way back then that John was in is one of the hardest times you've laughed in a movie this year. That brings me so much joy.

 










This is your third documentary. How long have you wanted to make this one specifically?

After your first one, you have your list of the ones that you really hope one day that you're going to make, and then you find out you don't quite have the currency yet to make that one. The truth of the matter is everyone universally will say like, “insert person's name,” and they'll be like, “Oh, someone should make a documentary about him.” And I always go, “OK, but what is the film? What is the story that you're actually really trying to tell? What is it saying?” Because, otherwise, I don't want to just do a visual Wikipedia entry.

And you address it with Bill Murray at the beginning when he's struggling to say anything negative about John Candy.

Exactly. Eventually, I got an email saying, “Hey, Ryan Reynolds wants to get in touch with you.” And so, he and I hopped on the phone, and we started talking. I already knew that Ryan was a massive John Candy fan, and he was just like, “I think there should be a documentary. I think you should direct it.” And that was when I really started to do the due diligence, and when I talked with Ryan, he had mentioned that Chris and Jen Candy were involved. So, I got in touch with them — and I'd known them through social circles for quite some time.

 










Once I figured out that John passed from the very thing that his father had passed away from? I'm 47. My mom passed when she was 49. John's dad passed at 35. And John passed at 43. I started really taking a deep dive into my life in my late thirties, early forties. And really sifting through, like, childhood trauma, because everyone has it. That was the launching point for me. 

It was really a sort of stupid, basic approach, but when you think of overweight actors who died young, the ones you think of all died of drug overdoses. So, “Wait, John died of a heart attack? His dad died of a heart attack when he was five?” It just became so much more personal, just because I am coming to the age that my mom was when she passed away, and that really puts a lot into focus. And so, to find out, after much, much more digging, that John really had that sense that he was living on borrowed time, and that he wasn't sure if he was going to live past 35.

That's a really interesting point. John Belushi and Chris Farley both died of drug overdoses at 33 and there's this everlasting legend about them. John Candy doesn't have that, even though he also died young.

Well, welcome to the creative process that I was going through. That was part of the initial, “Well, why is that? What is that?” And one of the things that I landed on was that John is so beloved by so many people, because of his everyman qualities. Everyone looked at him, and just went, “That guy. I like that guy. I want to spend time with him.” And he had that very salt of the Earth, blue collar — you just wanted to be with him.

 










What was your first introduction to John Candy as a kid? And I know the obvious answer is probably “Splash,” but I don't want to assume.

Well, technically, “Splash,” yeah, but John was someone that my dad worked with. So, I didn't necessarily think of him as John Candy.

Oh, I see.

I just saw him as like, that's one of my dad's friends. They work together. But, look, I have very, very vivid memories of being on the set of “Splash.” And seeing John, and Eugene Levy, in fact, and them all working together. So, that was my initial introduction. And then, obviously, “Volunteers” was also part of John being around. I have some very fond memories of John, a couple of dinner parties, and being at my dad and Rita [Wilson]'s wedding. 

John left an impression on me even as a kid. Macaulay Culkin speaks to it in the movie when Mac says, “He made you feel important.” Even as a kid, he made you feel like your opinion mattered, and your emotions mattered. And that's 1,000 percent accurate, because that was definitely how John made me feel. And then eventually then it becomes, oh, yeah — seeing him in “Spaceballs,” or “The Great Outdoors.” Like, “Yeah. That's John. I know that guy.”

I feel like a really interesting perspective for you. A lot of filmmakers making this film can get the same interviews, can get the same footage, but you're in an interesting position where he was your dad's co-worker and met him. You have a memory of how he treated you.
 










Yeah. Very, very true. In fact, in a strange way, I think that was one of my initial reasons not to do it.

Why?

Just because, well, I met him, I have these memories of him, I don't know if I want to dig into that. I'd much rather just have those memories as opposed to spend however many months or years of my life now collecting other people's memories and going from there. But Chris and Jen [Candy] were so adamant. I don't want to put words in their mouth, but they let it be known that it was their opinion that they felt like I was one of the only guys that can do it. Then that just made me go like, OK, well, let's set myself aside here and do some digging.

You mentioned a film that I've seen a million times, “The Great Outdoors”…

Yes.

I think you did something really poignant when you put that scene of him on the boat, and he's giving his family ring to his son [Chris Young], who says, “Oh, like you spent with your dad out here, and he did this for you.” And the way John Candy reacts to that, “Yeah.” And I can now tell he's really sad.

But you know that he didn't do that with his dad.

Honestly, I even watched it three weeks ago, because it's on cable still nonstop. It hit me so hard.

Look, I felt like that was one of the things that we landed upon that ended up becoming, I think, a little bit of a responsibility. You don't want it to just be like, “And then he made this movie.”

 










Right.

And I know this, as an actor: If I'm going to spend time away from my own family, and if I'm going to spend time away from my life, and, basically, put my life on hold to go make this movie? And the way that movies are made, basically, you don't have a life. You wake up in the morning, you go straight to work and then you go home. And then you do the exact same thing the next day. You've got to find something in there to make that worth it. You know?

[Laughs] Sometimes you just need the money. But you want it to be worthwhile! And when Jen Candy was speaking to that idea, that he really did look for roles, and took roles that spoke to a specific slate that he wanted to sell people, a certain mentality, a certain way to be, that really made a whole lot more sense.

With “The Great Outdoors”…

What is ostensibly just a funny film, “The Great Outdoors”…

Right…

To be able to then find a moment where I'm watching a scene I've seen countless times, but I'm seeing it in a completely different way? That's the kind of stuff that we really wanted to highlight. And I think we were able to accomplish that with a handful of moments from his films. But that one lands for me a lot. I'm actually really, really happy that you mentioned that, that particular point. Because that always really resonates with me.

 










He's in a lot of movies. How did you pick the films to concentrate on? One I'm glad you did was “Summer Rental.” I'm a big fan. It's a Carl Reiner film. And It's his first starring role and I think it really shows what he can do.

Well, here's the weird thing, there are so many of John's films that I have not seen, because he was in a bunch.

True.

But “Summer Rental,” I've always thought of as one of the quintessential John Candy movies. And the fact that that was his first leading role, it felt like it was really important. And also it shows that in his first leading man role, he's tapped by Carl Reiner.

Right…

Who is a legend and says, “I want to work with this guy.” And loves it so much that then he tells his friend, Mel Brooks, another comedy legend, “Oh, you've got to work with this guy. You've got to meet this guy. Not only is he great, he's a great human being.”

You've made two prior documentaries. When you're trying to get people to talk to you for this one, does that help? Do people say, “I know who you are but have you made a movie?”

Well, if they do, they don't really tell me. But there are two bonuses here. I remember Marty Short, whom I've known for a very long time, he's one of the very first people I approached about, “Should I do this?” He was like, “No one is going to say no to you. They're all going to want to do it.” And so, that was helpful, but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone is available.

 










In the film you spent some time on his role in “National Lampoon's Vacation.” There's always that story out there where they did reshoots for the ending, which is true, but gave John one million dollars to come in for his role. Is this true? He didn't seem like a place in his career yet where that would happen.

I call this “the Bill Simmons conspiracy,” because that was how it first came to my attention, hearing Bill Simmons talking about it at some point. Not that he coined it. No, I don't believe that's true. In fact, I talked about it with Chris, and I don't think that's true. I think, logistically, that doesn't make much sense.

It doesn't.

If you're doing re-shoots on a movie, you're not spending a million dollars willy-nilly.

Right, his biggest movie at the time was “Stripes.” “Let's get the fourth lead from ‘Stripes' and just pay him whatever he wants.”

[Laughs] No.

Now, five years later, that makes perfect sense.

Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

Earlier you said, “You say someone's name, and, oh,  we should make a documentary about them.” Macaulay Culkin is amazing in this. As an interviewer, I'm just like, the stuff he's saying to you is incredible. I would watch a Macaulay Culkin documentary, because that guy has to have some stories.
 










Yeah, he does. His life is incredibly well-chronicled in that way. And it's interesting, Mac's interview was a good reminder to me of just try and grab as much as you possibly can. Because it was late in the process, we were getting close to the wire, and I was just like, look, at the end of the day, he was a little kid. How much is he going to be able to express to us that speaks to our important themes?

And, of course, he actually reminded me of what my experience was meeting him. It was a really, really great reminder to just … You never know. To take a shot. Find out. His insight was just, honestly, profound.

It was. I was riveted. The way he openly talks about his own father, but then how John Candy would come over and like, “Hey. Everything OK at home?” That just says so much about John Candy, that he could pick up on that, even on “Uncle Buck.”

Well, it also says a lot about Mac. You know what I mean?

I do.

The fact that he realizes that now. And, by the way, let's also talk about the two really big mind-blowing things that he reveals is that. A, he's now officially older than John was when he passed away

I was going to bring that up. And he's now eight years older than he was when John Candy was in “Uncle Buck.”

Wow. That's crazy. But then his insight into John Hughes and John Candy's relationship. And the fact that that's the connection you should actually really make. Everyone thinks it's Molly Ringwald, or him, but it really should be John.

 










But your instinct isn't wrong. I'm sure at some point he may make a documentary, but who knows. I'm always a big proponent of … and this is something that was very adamant early on, just from day one, of the Tower Records documentary, I'm not in the business of ruining anyone's life. Or trying to drag someone through parts of their life that they don't want to go through.

That's what I liked about you talking to Macaulay Culkin, because he, obviously, just wants to talk about this.

Yeah.

Some of the stuff I'm sure is probably hurtful to him, but it seemed like a positive experience? It didn't feel like you were going somewhere with him that he didn't want to go.

What's interesting was, with “All Things Must Pass,” I really wanted to make the movie. It was a passion for me, because it was my first one. With “Nos Amis, the Eagles of Death Metal” doc, I didn't want to make that documentary. The guys in the band didn't want to make the documentary, because they didn't want what was happening. But we knew each other, and we agreed, together, that we maybe don't want to do this, but that it is important, not just for our healing, but then for everyone else that was involved in that [Paris] incident.

With this one, again, it was, well, I don't know if I really want to do it. It's really about Chris and Jen and Rose. Do they want to do this? And they were so adamant. And they were so like, “We really want to do this, and we really want to celebrate…” They really wanted to celebrate their father, and really remind people of that. When you have those agreements with your subject, so that you're on the same page essentially, and there is no question as to what the motives are — that's really, really important.

 










“John Candy: I Like Me” will premiere at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival as the official Opening Night Gala. It will start streaming on Prime Video on Friday, October 10.

Normani is the star of the 2025 NFL Kickoff commercial. The singer put a spin on Quad City DJ's 1996 hit “C'mon N' Ride It (The Train),” this time branding it as “C'mon Ride the Float” to soundtrack the legions of football fans ready to cheer their favorite team to victory.


	A few fans and familiar faces, including social media stars Druski and the Rizzler, make appearances in the commercial. “I'm on a dolphin, not the float,” Druski semi-raps before yelling cut. “Guys, my legs are chaffing. I need some baby powder, seriously.” In a statement, he shared, “I've always been an NFL fan, so getting the chance to be part of this season's Kickoff campaign was a no-brainer.” 


	The Rizzler jumps in on behalf of the New York Giants, declaring, “Giant-sized hopes, you can't handle the rizz.” Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts makes a cameo, as well, but Normani is rooting for another Pennsylvania team. The singer sports a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey in the commercial. Earlier this year, she announced her engagement to their wide receiver DK Metcalf. 

	











	“Being part of the NFL Kickoff commercial is such a monumental and personal moment for me,” Normani shared in a statement. “I cannot remember a time when football was not a huge part of my household growing up, so now that I'm part of an NFL campaign, it means the world to my family.”

Tate McRae was born in the pop summer of 2003, the summer that climaxed in the legendary kiss between Britney and Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards. Tate could have been the baby born from that kiss, because she does their legacy proud. The Canadian star brought her Miss Possessive tour to New York's Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, for a manic pop-glitz spectacle. Everything about her show is louder-louder, faster-faster, more-more-more, especially Tate herself.


	We're living in a golden age for main pop girls, but Tate stands out by going for the classic Britney/Xtina vibe of the early 2000s, with power-disco energy and sex in the air. Not the dewy-eyed woe-is-me sensitive type, this one. She's trouble. She did not come here to read you her damn poetry. She radiates total “lock up your sons” energy onstage, even in her ballads, but any time she slows down to catch a feeling, you can count the seconds until she crushes it under her stiletto.


	So the Tate show is definitely not a place you go to feel your feelings and sing along and cry and hug it out and drunk-text your exes. It's where you go when your goal is feeling yourself a fraction as hard as Tate does — and that's a mighty high bar.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Last night she did most of her new album So Close To What, with a handful of earlier hits. But she kept grinding and writhing through it all, for a delightfully rowdy NYC crowd rocking enough leopardskin to populate a rainforest. “It's so crazy for me to be playing Madison Square Garden again!,” she told the audience. “It's one of those arenas that feels like a fever dream every time you play it. It's just fucking crazy.”

	











	Swedish opener Zara Larsson hyped up the room with an ace set of hits like “Crush,” from her upcoming Midnight Sun, honoring her roots with Britney's “Gimme More.” Opening-act innovation, Part 1: she had the video screens displaying her name at all times, in case she worried about anyone not knowing who she was. (It also displayed a QR code, which looked way too downmarket for this stage.) Opening-act innovation, Part 2: in her last song, “Symphony,” she slammed it home with, “We have one more chorus left! One more chorus! Sixty seconds to go!” More people should do that.

	Tate took the stage to “Miss Possessive,” after an overlong delay. (Basic pop-star rule: you do not want your crowd doing the wave to amuse themselves before your set.) But what an entrance. First, there was a clip of Tate backstage, watching video monitors of crowd footage, in her underwear. Then her posse of beefcake dancing studs strutted out, in their billowing button-free shirts, striking a classic sensitive boy-band pose — it was like a Dru Hill reunion gig in here. Their tops and Tate's hair fluttered in the breeze of a wind machine absurdly cranked up to Stage 4 hurricane levels. But if you bet the over/under on how long the boys' shirts would stay on, you probably lost, because they somehow survived all the way to the third song.


	Tate made her name as a dancer, competing on So You Think You Can Dance, and she's got that energy down to her bones. She kept busting her eroto-acrobatic moves all night. Her band consisted of a drummer and a guitarist, which looked weird considering the synth-disco sounds, but they bravely held their ground. For her excellent “Purple Lace Bra,” she sat alone in a chair, while everyone else onstage was half of a lap dance.


	“I can show you better than I can tell you,” her voice-over narration purred on the speakers, as Tate crawled her methodical way down the catwalk toward her rendezvous with destiny, which turned out to be a stripper pole. She worked it out for “Uh Oh,” “Dear God,” and her most underrated tune, “Siren Sounds.” At the end, her guitarist ventured down the catwalk to play an awesomely Eighties cheese-metal solo that was like Nuno Bettencourt's eyelashes making sweet love to Neal Schon's back hair.

	She did an interlude focusing on the Softer Side of Tate, changing into a sheer gown for ballads like “Greenlight” and “Nostalgia.” “I just turned 22 this year,” she explained. “I feel like I was just thinking so much about time. Nostalgia is such an interesting concept to me, so I wrote a song about it.” She also did a medley of early tunes from her teenage YouTuber days, playing a keyboard despite warning, “I'm not very great at piano.” She sang brief snippets of “That Way,” “Stupid,” and “Feel Like Shit,” just a verse and chorus each. 

	











	But she went all the way into the rager “You Broke Me First,” asking, “Who's going through a break-up right now?” She urged the crowd, “Everybody please give it up to my incredible band up there.” (Two guys!) Yet you could also see she's still learning to feel her way around an arena as a headliner. She even busted out the “which side of the room can scream louder” routine, which pop pros usually outgrow before the third album.


	The climax was a blitz of dance bangers, with her nastiest, zippiest tunes — “Exes,” “Bloodonmyhands,” “She's All I Wanna Be,” “It's OK I'm OK,” and “Revolving Door,” one of the few Boston songs that's actually about having a good time there. She signed off with “Greedy,” to cannon blasts of confetti. The smell of gunpowder was in the air, which felt appropriate for her.


	“So you came to my show to watch me,” the Tate Voice-Over Narrator mused mid-show. “But do you really see me? You show up to hear me sing, but are you listening?” That kind of uncertainty makes a cool dance-floor taunt, but at heart, it's not really her. One of the things that makes her Tate McRae is that even when she sings about self-doubt, as in “She's All I Wanna Be,” she sounds fearless and invincible without even worrying about it. You can't hear, see, or feel a single moment of vulnerability when she's onstage. And no doubt that's exactly how she likes it.


	Set List:


	“Miss Possessive”“No I'm Not in Love”“2 Hands”“Guilty Conscience”“Purple Lace Bra”“Like I Do”“Uh Oh”“Dear God”“Siren Sounds”“Greenlight”“Nostalgia”“This Way”“Stupid”“Feel Like Shit”“You Broke Me First”“Run for the Hills”“Exes”“Bloodonmyhands”“She's All I Wanna Be”“Revolving Door”“It's OK I'm OK”

After two decades in the industry, the Grammy Award winner is reinvigorating the genre with a singular approach.


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



“I f–king hate talking, bro,” Leon Thomas tells his audio engineer. The Grammy Award-winning songwriter and R&B singer is rehearsing for his July set at the Hollywood Bowl, where he's opening for SiR; just days earlier, he was on the other side of the Atlantic performing at London's Wireless Festival, where his longtime collaborator and friend Ty Dolla $ign crowned him “the king of this s–t.”

	











	Thomas' résumé includes Broadway stints and a childhood Nickelodeon breakthrough, and he moves through rehearsals with the methodical meticulousness of someone who has been performing his entire life. With his black and red ombré dreads pulled back in a black wrap to complement his plain white T-shirt and black sweatpants, he floats through the Burbank, Calif., rehearsal space with prodigious finesse and childlike wonder. In quick succession, he translates his drum solo to a new kit, perfects how the slack delays land during “Blue Hundreds” and adjusts reverb levels to differentiate between his R&B and rock tracks. Thomas hates talking because he would rather his multifaceted stage show, as well as his strikingly singular approach to contemporary R&B, speak for itself.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After several years when hip-hop threatened to cannibalize R&B's presence in the marketplace, Thomas, 32, has emerged as a leader of its next class of superstars — and recently landed his highest-peaking Billboard Hot 100 hit as a lead performer with the slick-talking smash “Mutt,” which reached No. 12 on the chart in June. He's recentering the genre's focus, at least for male performers, on live instrumentation and dizzying riffs, and away from falsetto and emulating MCs — so it's something of a surprise that he attacks the verses of “Mutt” with the nimble cadence of a melodic rapper. “We're veering away from the bad-boy types,” he says over a latte in West Hollywood, fresh off a flight from the United Kingdom. “But there's still that toxic energy, slowly but surely becoming a little bit more buttoned up.”

	











	Just as it took R&B some time to find its footing in the streaming era, it took nearly two decades for Thomas to break through as an artist in his own right. Having spent years working within the system of kids' entertainment monoliths, studying under several Grammy winners, crafting multiplatinum radio hits for R&B's and pop's brightest stars and learning the ins and outs of the indie scene, the present version of Thomas is the culmination of almost 20 years of relentless devotion to his biggest goals and dreams. And it's clear, as he leaves the rehearsal space to study a recording of the hourlong run-through, that discipline underscores his devotion.


	“Even though I really consider myself to be a talented all-around artist, I want to be seen at the level that I know I can be seen in music,” he says. “It's been cool to knock down certain pillars when a lot of people thought I was done for.”


For Leon Thomas, musicianship is intensely personal. He inherited a genre-agnostic approach to music and fashion from his parents: a singer mother and a stepfather who played guitar for B.B. King, who were both part of New York's Black Rock Coalition and frequented the East Village's storied CBGB club. Thomas' grandfather — the late opera singer and jazz devotee John Anthony, who starred in the original Broadway production of Porgy & Bess — laid the family's entire foundation.


	Born and raised in Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood, Thomas first fell in love with the drums. At just 3 years old, he developed such an affinity for the kit that his parents continued putting instruments in front of him. By age 9, a family friend noted Thomas had the same hairstyle as the actor playing young Simba in The Lion King and eventually convinced his parents to have him audition for the Broadway show. Thomas snagged the role (which he shared with two other young actors), leading to appearances in Broadway productions of The Color Purple and Caroline, or Change.


	Backstage during those shows, Thomas wrote his first songs on the guitar, which he frequently played for cast mates. The Color Purple's success, and that of 2007's August Rush, brought him to the West Coast, where at 13 he signed a development deal with Nickelodeon that came with a Columbia Records recording contract. While at the network, he provided the singing voice for Tyrone on The Backyardigans for a season-and-a-half before bringing the character André Harris, a high school music producer, to life on Victorious, even penning original songs for the show.

	











	Alongside star-in-the-making Keke Palmer, Thomas became the primary source of representation for young Black Nick viewers in the 2010s. Victorious, which aired in over 80 countries, also helped launch the career of Ariana Grande, who later brought Thomas on as producer/co-writer for her Yours Truly and Positions albums. But while plenty of other Disney and Nickelodeon alumni of the late '00s and early '10s had notably rocky transitions to adulthood in the limelight, Thomas consciously steered clear of any actions that might have alienated the Victorious audience who looked up to him.


	“I probably would have benefited from [a rebellious break], but I knew I had kids following me,” he explains. “I decided to stay behind the scenes. I wasn't trying to edit myself online, but I made sure I was paying homage to the role model I used to be. Nickelodeon can still collaborate with me and it's not awkward. I never took steps to separate myself in ways that were toxic.”


	After Victorious ended production in 2012, Thomas turned down the chance to attend Morehouse College, opting instead to hone his songwriting under Babyface's mentorship. That same year, he joined forces with Khris Riddick-Tynes to form The Rascals, a production duo that crafted cuts for the likes of Grande, Toni Braxton and Zendaya, as well as Thomas' own debut mixtape, Metro Hearts, released in August 2012. The Rascals' work eventually brought them to Grammy-winning producer Boi-1da, whom Riddick-Tynes ran into while on a double date at Nobu. Alongside Boi-1da, Thomas earned his first best rap song Grammy nod for his work on “Gold Roses,” a 2019 collaboration between Rick Ross and Drake that foreshadowed Thomas' contributions to the latter's Certified Lover Boy in 2021.


	“I spent my 20s becoming the best version of myself,” he says. “I studied under amazing artists and watched how they built their teams and communities around themselves. It was like a nine-to-five, just banging out songs every day and sharpening my pen. I learned that being truthful to myself was the risk — that's the cool factor.”

	











	In 2019, Thomas met his manager, Jonathan Azu, through veteran music industry executive Marc Byers, making him one of the first artists signed to Azu's newly launched artist management firm, Culture Collective. In the following years, Thomas continued writing and producing, starting his own Eclectic Collective publishing company and eventually striking Grammy gold with SZA's “Snooze,” which he co-produced alongside Babyface in 2021. That track later appeared on SOS, SZA's blockbuster 2022 album, and soared to No. 2 on the Hot 100. With a win for best R&B song, “Snooze” earned Thomas his first Grammy and helped his publishing company “get into the green.”


	Meanwhile, Azu had spent the pandemic helping Thomas track down the right partners who would ensure his “freedom and flexibility” to sign a new deal. And by 2023, Thomas found the perfect match in EZMNY, a Motown imprint Ty Dolla $ign had launched alongside veteran A&R executive Shawn Barron the previous year.


	“I really looked up to how pgLang was moving with Kendrick [Lamar] and Baby Keem,” Thomas explains. “I thought it was cool to have that big-brother moment in an industry that's a little bit ‘every man for himself.' I could ask Ty questions that most up-and-coming artists don't get to ask their executives.”


	That year, Thomas released his debut album, Electric Dusk, and scored a minor street hit with its song “Breaking Point.” When Barron heard an early version of Electric Dusk, it showed him that Thomas was “making musical decisions that nobody else was” — but the timing wasn't ideal. Electric Dusk arrived as Motown was reincorporated into Capitol Music Group, creating instability that somewhat stunted the record's potential. EZMNY and Culture Collective did “the bulk of the work” to promote the record, Barron says. “We didn't have the resources we needed to make Electric Dusk what it could have been.”

	











	A little under a year later, things were very different: Motown's personnel changes straightened out, and Thomas, having apprenticed for his debut, was ready to own his big moment — a campaign for Mutt that fired on all cylinders.


Thomas wrote “Mutt” on his living room floor while he microdosed psychedelics and watched his dog and cat tussle. A portrait of warring romantic intentions and their unintentional impact, its brooding funk and rock-infused R&B bleeds across his 2024 album of the same name, which Thomas created alongside close collaborators Freaky Rob and David Phelps.


	“Nobody knew they were going to like the single with live drums and a funk groove and a live bassline,” Thomas says. “I decided that if I'm going to lead with anything, I want to lead with myself.” And with “Mutt,” Thomas bet on his intuition: He chose it as the album's lead single over “Far Fetched,” a Ty Dolla $ign-assisted midtempo originally written for Drake.


	Released in August 2024, the song's ascent was a slow burn. “Mutt” had crept into the top 10 of Hot R&B Songs by the top of 2025, but it didn't enter the Hot 100 until Feb. 8, several months after Mutt's September 2024 release.


	An anomaly in a post-pandemic world, “Mutt” blew up through word-of-mouth, not off the back of an easily identifiable and reproducible trend or a specific viral moment. Buzzy shoutouts from the likes of his old Nick-mate Palmer, SZA and Tems brought the song to new audiences, but listeners gradually gravitated to “Mutt” on the merits of its craft and content. “There was never a clear trend with it,” Motown head of digital Dante Smith says. “We saw people living with the song in a lifestyle setting, using the lyrics to tell stories about their relationships and soundtracking their day-to-day.”


	Through many of those lifestyle videos, “Mutt” became a sonic signifier for an aesthetic and personal brand defined by the appreciation of excellence and virtuosity. If someone wanted to show their followers their good taste and ear for quality contemporary music, they more than likely selected “Mutt” for their TikTok or Instagram Reel.

	











	A pair of key promotional spots in early 2025 exposed Thomas to more mature audiences and further propelled “Mutt.” With his Late Show With Stephen Colbert debut landing just two weeks before his first NPR Tiny Desk concert on Feb. 20, Thomas' early-2025 performances also helped the “Mutt” radio campaign shift into a higher gear. The week his Tiny Desk set hit YouTube, the song was milling around outside the top 10 of Adult R&B Airplay, missing in action on Rhythmic and just sneaking into the top 30 of Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. (Thomas dropped his full Tiny Desk set as a live EP on Aug. 15.)


	“We went to R&B [radio] first [in October 2024], and it took us 27 weeks to get that No. 1,” Capitol executive vp of urban promotion Bill Evans says. “[The song] had a couple of hiccups where research was not working in our favor, and a lot of stations were on the fence. As a team, we believed the song could be a No. 1 record, so we kept working it and eventually research started turning around.”


	The radio success of “Mutt,” which now includes No. 1 stints across three separate radio charts and a No. 5 peak on the all-genre Radio Songs chart, also owes to Thomas' unwavering tenacity. In between promoting Mutt, opening for Blxst's I'll Always Come Find You Tour and playing his first set of Mutt tour dates in late 2024, he made sure to personally visit radio stations in each city and connect with DJs, a few of whom had grown up watching him on Victorious.


	“It's tough, sometimes, as an artist when you go to a meeting and all the ideas are TikToks,” Thomas says. “You have to build the machine around your music and make friends with the power players in traditional media. I still agree with this being a people's industry. Shaking hands is important; not being a d–k is important.”

	











	Now, according to Luminate, “Mutt” has earned 295.6 million official on-demand U.S. streams through July 24, spending 20 weeks atop Hot R&B Songs and reaching No. 28 on the Billboard Global 200.


	“I feel like [Thomas is] showing that the younger generation still cares,” Ty Dolla $ign says. “You can make a smash hit and really be good at music [again]. There was an era when you didn't have to know what you were doing; you could make a beat on FruityLoops with the most minimal sounds and as long as it banged, your song is a smash. That started to dumb people down… Leon brought us back to hits with real guitar, real bass, a string section, Rhodes piano, synthesizers and stacked vocals.”


On Dec. 4, 2024, just two weeks after a rousing hometown show at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg, Thomas took to Instagram to share that his grandfather had passed. Less than two months later — and immediately after filming his instantly viral Tiny Desk set — Thomas attended the funeral.


	“The juxtaposition of those highs and lows is really, really challenging, man,” he says, his eyes piercing through his orange-tinted sunglasses. “It's different now being in this chapter without his physical support, but the lessons that he taught me are lingering in my heart and mind. Last year, we spent a lot more time together than we had for the past decade. It was good to have those last couple lessons because there were things he noticed about the system I've built for myself that needed to be tightened up. I'm carrying him with me to this day… I pushed through a lot of grief to keep the train rolling this year.”


	Keeping that train hurtling forward, on June 9, Thomas enraptured the BET Awards audience with a scorching rendition of “Mutt” — complete with a melodic nod to English prog-rockers King Crimson — that cemented his star power. From his head-banging guitar solo to his crisp, impressively precise vocals, Thomas delivered male R&B showmanship reminiscent of Maxwell or D'Angelo. “I got tired of people trying to tell me who I was or what I needed to be successful,” Thomas says, straightening up in his chair. “My inner rock star started peeking its head.” Later that night, BET crowned him best new artist, a moment shared on live TV with his entire team and family. Well, almost: His mother was in the restroom when actors Deon Cole and Dominique Thorne called his name.


	“I always tell people I'm my mom's startup,” Thomas says with a toothy smile beaming with pride. “We started this journey when I was 10 and I'm 31 now. She understands how hard I've worked and how alone I felt sometimes. I'm thankful for whatever they want to call me. I want to make sure that people really understand that I'm a student of the game and I have what it takes to be remembered. I never really played sports, so these awards are the tangible assets I have to show for my hard work.”

	











	Two weeks later, Thomas found himself at a very different awards ceremony (and a homecoming of sorts) as he presented an orange blimp at the Kids' Choice Awards alongside “Ordinary” singer Alex Warren. He may be over a decade removed from his Nickelodeon days — and recently snagged more adult roles in Issa Rae's Emmy-winning HBO series Insecure and Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit — but Thomas still plans to collaborate with the network “in the next couple of years,” underscoring his desire to return to acting. “I want to bring back that rom-com, Love Jones, Love & Basketball feeling to the game,” he muses.


	But before returning to the small and silver screens — he's rumored to appear in the upcoming Owen Wilson-led comedy Rolling Loud — Thomas will have to wrap the Mutt cycle, which will likely last through the 2026 Grammys in February. Thanks to “Mutt” and its parent album, he's poised to dominate the R&B categories — and potentially break into the general field.


	“I hope he's the guy with the Lauryn Hill photo [holding multiple trophies],” Azu says. “Every year, there's somebody and I hope it's him. He is a man of his peers, and I think over the past year he has proven to them that he's here to stay.”

	











	As he keeps relentlessly working Mutt, Thomas has also flooded the marketplace with collaborations, maximizing his reach as his star grows. This year alone, he has linked up with peers such as Coco Jones, YG, Giveon, Sasha Keable, Odeal, Venna and Annie Tracy, cementing his status as a contemporary R&B touchstone. A deluxe edition of Mutt called Heel arrived on May 30 with collaborations from Halle, Big Sean and Kehlani. The expanded version of the album also launched his nascent radio hit, “Not Fair,” which he co-wrote with James Fauntleroy; it has already reached No. 11 on Hot R&B Songs while garnering over 13 million official on-demand U.S. streams.


	“Leon's disrupting this easy, poppy R&B that we had going on,” says fellow R&B star and longtime friend Kehlani. “Something like ‘Mutt' being so successful shows that you don't have to compromise. You really can stay true to the genre. It's made me proud to look at my friend, who I've seen play the back seat in so many sessions, be the star.”


	But as the Mutt campaign has unexpectedly stretched out, Thomas does admit that “in a perfect world, I would be in a different album cycle.” In October, he will release a seven-track EP — a notably funkier, and at times more psychedelic, collection of tracks that carries the torch that Parliament-Funkadelic pioneer George Clinton passed to him at Coachella in April. In a hot-boxed trailer before his own Coachella performance, Clinton gifted him an all-white hat decked out with rhinestones, a dog face and a fox tail. “You the kid with the dog song, right? I like that joint. I made you this hat,” Clinton told Thomas. “Before I come out and perform ‘Atomic Dog,' I'm going to give you the crown.”


	The new EP also comes as Thomas doubles down on recording and rides “the tail end of packing up” writing and producing for other people. Who's still on the list of artists he has “gotta cook up for”? “Me and [Justin] Bieber have been talking a lot,” Thomas reveals. “He's a cool guy; I like him a lot. He just seems so free now and that is a beautiful thing.”

	











	There's also “an iconic female artist” — one who may have recently wrapped a globe-trotting rodeo — whom Barron notes Thomas has been cutting some songs for. “I never know what the f–k is going on,” Thomas says, both earnestly and evasively. “You work for a long time and these projects are so secretive, you just never know what's happening. I obviously want to work with a certain lady from Houston, though. That would be amazing.”


	With his biggest headlining tour yet on the horizon — he's graduating to 2,500-capacity venues with nearly 50 dates across North America, Europe and Australia — Thomas is exiting 2025 very differently from how he entered it. Though legendary soul singer Sam Cooke was his inspiration for starting his own publishing company, his career blueprint may be more in line with that of rock stars. “I'm thinking Jack White and The White Stripes,” Azu says. “When I walk into his dressing room, he's playing Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne. Leon is a trend innovator.”


	As I watch Thomas whirl across the Hollywood Bowl stage just days after channeling Jimi Hendrix at his Billboard cover photo shoot, Azu's assessment reads accurately. When he picks up each instrument and intertwines its energy with his, the innate rebelliousness of the most iconic rockers flows out of him. Here's an artist who, across a two-decade period, has become intimately acquainted with the entertainment industry's countless mutations, finally abiding by his own rules. In his quest to challenge R&B's status quo of “safe lyrics, early-2000s melodies, simple chord progressions, hypnotic loops and no bridges,” Thomas has crafted a collection of soulful, rock'n'roll-steeped songs that have simultaneously invigorated multiple generations of R&B lovers and put the top 40 zeitgeist on notice.


	“I don't really mind being in this position where we push Mutt for so long because it deserves to be heard by the world,” he says, swirling around the last drops of his latte. “I'm excited to be one of the trailblazers who brings back those old feelings without having to steal their chords or melodies.”

We are honored to bring this extraordinary film to U.S. audiences and to support its journey through awards season and beyond. KimStim is fully committed to supporting the Manas team in their efforts to secure an Oscar nomination and win.”












	Brennand added: “Partnering with KimStim, a deeply curated arthouse distributor in the United States, marks a pivotal moment for Manas. After a global journey of 26 awards, with both audience and jury acclaim, and theatrical distribution in six countries, bringing the film into the North American market is an essential next step. The American film community has a unique power to shape conversations around cinema and social themes, and we believe this audience will connect deeply with the urgency and universality of the story Manas carries, creating awareness around the message it carries.”

Bruce Springsteen has announced a Nebraska expansion that includes the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions, released for the first time. Long sought-after by fans, Electric Nebraska is the informal title of the album that Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded, in 1982, from a suite of demos for his follow-up to The River. But the Boss, preferring his originals, scrapped the full-band versions and instead released a selection of his stripped-down demos as Nebraska. Not all of them, though: Some were held back for his next album, Born in the U.S.A. One was the title track, and below, you can hear the Electric Nebraska version that might have been.

Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition arrives October 17 as a 4xLP or 4xCD box set, which both come with a Blu-ray containing a Thom Zimny–directed video of the band performing Nebraska in full this year. (The audio is one of the four audio discs, too.) The other discs comprise a remaster of the original album and a collection of Nebraska home recordings, some unreleased, plus tracks from a 1982 solo studio session.

On the version of “Born in the U.S.A.” below, Max Weinberg and Garry Tallent back Springsteen. “We threw out the keyboards and played basically as a three-piece,” Springsteen said in a press release. “It was kinda like punk rockabilly. We were trying to bring Nebraska into the electric world.”

He added of the live Nebraska rendition, “I think in playing these songs again to be filmed, their weight impressed upon me. I've written a lot of other narrative records, but there's just something about that batch of songs on Nebraska that holds some sort of magic.”

Springsteen recently reissued a series of mythic shelved records in the box set Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His new biopic, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, got its first trailer in June. The movie, centering on the creation of Nebraska, arrives in theaters on October 25.

Bruce Springsteen originally intended the home-recorded, solo-acoustic performances that became Nebraska to be demos for the E Street Band, and at New York City's Power Station studio in 1982, he and the band laid down versions of most of its songs. The so-called Electric Nebraska tracks have never been heard, even on bootleg — but Springsteen is about to change that with a new box set, Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition, due Oct. 17, a week before the Springsteen biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere hits theaters.


	The Electric Nebraska disc includes seven E Street Band takes on the album's material, plus a wild card — a fierce, guitar-dominated electric version of “Born in the U.S.A.,” a song originally recorded acoustically as part of the Nebraska sessions. That track, which features Springsteen playing with only drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent, is available for streaming now. “We threw out the keyboards and played basically as a three-piece,” Springsteen said in a press release. “It was kinda like punk rockabilly. We were trying to bring ‘Nebraska' into the electric world.”

	











	Over four discs and a Blu-ray, the set, available to preorder now, also includes acoustic outtakes (among them “Child Bride,” which became “Working on the Highway”), and audio and video of a brand-new solo live performance of all of Nebraska, recorded at Red Bank, New Jersey's Count Basie Theater. The set also includes a new remaster of Nebraska itself. Also among the outtakes are the never-bootlegged songs “Gun in Every Home” and “On the Prowl” — Springsteen did play the latter song live at Jersey Shore club appearances circa '82.

	











	In a press release, Springsteen said his live performance of the album reminded him of its power. “I think in playing these songs again to be filmed, their weight impressed upon me,” he said. “I've written a lot of other narrative records, but there's just something about that batch of songs on ‘Nebraska' that holds some sort of magic.”

	Even the E Street Band themselves were anxious to hear their full-band takes on Nebraska. “I'm dying to hear the recordings from the studio,” keyboardist Roy Bittan told our Rolling Stone Music Now podcast last year. “It's eluded us. Maybe, Bruce, at some point, will get into that.”


	“I remember recording all of that [Nebraska] material, and it was very much in the E Street Band style and very similar to what we do now when we play those songs, and it was great,” Weinberg told the pod last year. “Jon Landau, during the writing, suggested that I listen to John Wesley Harding, the Bob Dylan record. And he said, Bruce seems to be going more in this kind of direction. And there were some takes like that, with brushes, just a bare minimum rhythmic approach. And there were also rock versions of [some of] the Nebraska material. ”

	Earlier this year, Springsteen told Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene in an interview that the Electric Nebraska sessions “didn't exist,” but a month later, texted him with a correction: “Just wanted to give you a heads up. I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record, though it does not have the full album of songs.” 


	Oct. 24's Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen and Jeremy Strong as his manager Jon Landau, is a cinematic version of the Nebraska story. Springsteen “was drawing inspiration from all these places, but he didn't really know what he was doing for a while with this record,” White recently told The Associated Press. “He didn't know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you're doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.”

Lil Jon may want to reconsider his diminutive stage name after his shocking finish in the annual  Muscle Beach championship in L.A.'s Venice Beach. The 53-year-old, Grammy-winning “Turn Down For What” MC took home the third place trophy in the annual Men's Physique Masters Over 45 category on Monday (Sept. 1).

	“It's been a lot physically, just in the gym, dedication, eating, focus. I'm winning just by being here and changing my lifestyle, mentally and physically,” Jon said in an interview with ABC 7 during the competition. “One of the things I hope is that I can be an inspiration to so many people who say, ‘Oh, I don't have time. I can't do it.' If I can do it, then you can do it too.”

	The annual Labor Day tradition in Venice Beach is billed as the greatest outdoor bodybuilding show on Earth and is open to amateurs only. Athletes from around the world descend on the famed stretch of beach every year to compete in categories including bodybuilding, physique, bikini and wellness.


	Jon has been chronicling his wellness journey over the past year, posting videos of fasting cardio, his impressive pull-up skills and ridiculously jacked triceps. In addition to his dedication to eating well and working out, Jon has been feeding his mind as well via two albums of guided meditations, 2024's Total Meditation and Manifest Abundance: Affirmation of Personal Growth and teaming up with Peloton last summer for a new Artist Series, bringing his catalog to six of the workout company's live classes, including cycling, tread, row, meditation and strength.

A Sundance hit so enticing that its star's stans got the film pulled from the festival's online platform after it was repeatedly pirated for clout on social media, Twinless does indeed offer a hilarious, affecting, range-proving dual performance from Dylan O'Brien that's worth the criminal hype. Befitting the dark small-scale comedy's title, O'Brien plays both gay hotshot Rocky and his straight dimwit brother Roman—that is, until Rocky gets annihilated early on by a passing truck. But this narrative rug-pull isn't the last or largest in James Sweeney's ridiculous film, which twists its initial coping comedy premise into catty erotica just clever enough to pull off its sillier ideas.

But Twinless isn't just a hyper-specific joke about “boyfriend twins” spinning out into madness. Rather, that's just one small punchline caught in the avalanche of its snowballing plot, which begins innocuously enough with Roman heading to a support group for those who've lost twins. It's there, at this meeting ripped from a night at the improv, where the stressed and unmoored lunk runs into Denis (Sweeney), who reminds him of his brother and offers him a surrogate second half. Denis reminds Roman of Rocky not because he's gay and bitchy (though he is both of those things), but because he's sharp, witty, and confident enough to go after what he wants in life. Without his other (and, he worries, better) half, Roman isn't just adrift, but totally lost.

It's through this stunted confusion that O'Brien becomes the selling point of this charming, low-key film. His understated turn as Roman balances out his scenery-gobbling costars and provides some gut laughs as his oblivious schlub hits rock bottom. Roman devolves into a prototypically basic man-child when detached from his late twin, all grey sweatpants and video games and takeout, which Denis sees as an opening to get in with the malapropistic, sometimes caveman-like bro. Like Roman's “any port in a storm” attitude, Denis' affection for his support group compatriot isn't entirely compromised by ulterior motives, but a complex internal debate rages beneath every calculated move made on his end of the relationship.

This is where Sweeney—who injects his sophomore directing effort with some amusing visual gags, charmingly coordinated costumes, and shot designs far more thoughtful than your run-of-the-mill comedy—struggles as a performer. While the multihyphenate can zip through a long, writerly monologue with the practiced nuance of the person who wrote said monologue, hitting all the beats and turns needed to steer listeners along the path he's carved, he can seem a bit lost when not delivering snippy zingers. The problem is he's written himself a plot juicy enough to ask a lot more than he's able to give. Surrounding himself with O'Brien and Aisling Franciosi (endearingly cheery as Roman's crush) only emphasizes the gulf between them during the film's more earnest moments.

That heart, though, is an essential counterweight to the zanier elements of the story, which verges on viral Cut article territory in terms of sheer messiness and confident stupidity. As its characters make bad choices, some foolish, some perverse, and some truly Machiavellian, Twinless sticks with the absurd emotional catastrophe that follows. That dedication to the mess it's made is often captivating, even when the film's intentional line-blurring between comedy, romance, and gaslighting thriller never reaches the heights of its twin-centric sources of inspiration, like Brian De Palma. But it's both impressive and enjoyable that in his second film, Sweeney displays enough depth beneath his jokes to provide his characters and tones with their own foils. Even the subgenres encased within Twinless seem to banter with each other in a winning double act.

That's why the prolific author wanted the film adaptation of 'The Long Walk' to be "pretty brutal."


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Stephen King had one condition for the film adaptation of his book, The Long Walk: He wanted a lot of brutal violence.


	During a recent interview with The Times U.K., the prolific author criticized the way violence is depicted in superhero movies, such as some in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Studios. Oftentimes, those films don't show the realistic, gory consequences of violence, despite there being a lot of destruction.




	“If you look at these superhero movies, you'll see…some supervillain who's destroying whole city blocks but you never see any blood,” King said. “And man, that's wrong. It's almost, like, pornographic.”

	He added of the way violence is presented in The Long Walk, “I said, if you're not going to show it, don't bother. And so they made a pretty brutal movie.”


The Long Walk, based on King's 1979 dystopian horror novel, follows a group of teenage boys who compete in an annual contest known as “The Long Walk,” where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get killed. The last remaining walker wins the contest. The movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, with a script penned by J.T. Mollner.


	Superhero movies will typically avoid graphic violence to appeal to a broader audience, including families and younger viewers. However, there have also been plenty of R-rated superhero pics released that don't hold back on bloody violence, such as 2024's Kraven the Hunter, the Deadpool films, 1998's Blade, 2021's The Suicide Squad and 2019's Hellboy, among others.

David Byrne swapped his big suit for an orange tracksuit on The Tonight Show during an intimate performance at Rough Trade NYC in Rockefeller Plaza.


	In the episode aired on Wednesday, the former Talking Heads frontman performed his new single “What Is The Reason For It?” from his upcoming album, Who Is the Sky?. As Byrne sang the chorus, “What is the reason for it? Why is it there? Is it my body or my brain?,” he danced alongside his backup singers and band in matching jackets and pants.


	The song is the fifth track on Who Is the Sky?, which is set for release on Friday, and features Paramore's Hayley Williams. The Kid Harpoon-produced album follows 2018's American Utopia, and also features contributions from St. Vincent (whom he collaborated with on 2012's Love This Giant), the Smile's Tom Skinner, and more. 


	In a previous statement, Byrne said that the record is “a chance to be the mythical creature we all harbor inside. A chance to step into another reality. A chance to transcend and escape from the prison of our ‘selves.'”

	When speaking to late-night host Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, Byrne said that although he cautioned Kid Harpoon (who has worked with Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus, and Maggie Rogers) that his songs were a “little bit left field” compared to music from his previous collaborators, the producer embraced Byrne's new project.


	Just a few weeks after revealing that he is engaged to Mala Gaonkar, Byrne announced that along with his album release, he would also be tying the knot this week, and shared a playlist of instrumental songs that will play at his wedding dinner. The playlist includes 42 songs, and a focus on Latin music, including songs such as “Pa Japón” by El Alfa, “Perfidia” by Café Tacvba, and “Luz de Luna” by marimba-punk group Son Rompe Pera.

South Park appears to be settling into a pattern as it continues its headline-generating 27th season: Pick a new aspect of Donald Trump's America to focus on every episode—this week, it was tariffs and Fox News, with a bit of Labubu mixed in for some of that wider cultural sauce—but above all else, keep hammering the man himself. So far, the series has managed to successfully play the trolling game with several members of the Trump entourage, luring in Kristi Noem and White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. But it's never actually cracked the head honcho. Will repeatedly airing the phrase “Donald Trump is fucking Satan,” while stating that the President has impregnated the Prince Of Darkness with a “butt baby,” finally earn them the coveted TruthSocial hate blast that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are so delightedly courting?

The overt topic of “Wok Is Dead” might have been the tariffs, for instance, which massively increase the price of Pop Mart's imported plush toys even as mania for them sweeps South Park Elementary. But the show was just as focused, if not more so, on underscoring the endlessly permissive morality of Fox News and its viewers when it comes to Trump's behavior. And most especially on poking the man itself, as faux Fox correspondents repeat the “fucking Satan” phrase multiple times, fawning over Trump for having landed the devil himself. (There was also some material with Jesus investigating the demonic Labubus, because you have to fit some plot into the thing somewhere, but as with a lot of South Park‘s output this season, the focus was clearly on provocation and jokes first.) The whole thing built—after in-depth discussions of what Trump fucking Satan might look and work like—to the reveal that the sitting president has, indeed, impregnated Old Scratch, and that Fox News thinks this is just marvelous.

If nothing else, the one-week-on, one-week-off structure of the season—besides doing its basic job of prolonging the news cycle around the series—is clearly giving Parker and Stone room to find new ways to thumb their eye at the White House. As we've noted before, none of the really grabbing material at play here is subtle, because “subtle” is not currently in South Park‘s own best interest. The show has taken firm grip of the idea that it's the one media project in all of America lobbing these kind of deliberately puerile, wildly popular spitballs at Trump on a national level, and it's clearly ready to ride that impulse through six more lightly serialized episodes, figuring out what the worst thing it can show the man saying and doing on cable TV every two weeks might be.

It's top marks for MI5's bottom tier.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Gary Oldman doesn't belong in Slough House, but here we are.


	On Wednesday, Apple TV+ released the trailer for season five of Slow Horses. In it, Jackson Lamb (Oldman), River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) and the rest of the MI5 rejects are on the case — and a bit on the defense. The fifth Slow Horses season, adapted from Mick Herron's Slough House book series, consists of six episodes and will premiere on Sept. 24. Episodes will roll out weekly until Oct. 29.




	“In season five of Slow Horses, everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occur across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected,” the logline reads. “After all, Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, the London Rules — cover your back — always apply.”

	Poor Roddy (Christopher Chung). A guy gets one pretty girlfriend and the only possible explanation to UK intelligence is that he must have participated in a terrorist attack.


	Watch the season five trailer:


Slow Horses is an espionage dramedy following Slough House, which is comprised of spies that blew it on the MI5 main roster. The series also stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Ruth Bradley, James Callis, Tom Brooke and Jonathan Pryce. Season five will feature guest star Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso).


	The series is produced by See-Saw Films; it was adapted for television by Will Smith — not that Will Smith, this one. Put some respect on Smith's name: he's won the sole Emmy for the series (for writing). Smith, Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Julian Stevens, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Douglas Urbanski, Gail Mutrux and Graham Yost executive produce the series. Saul Metzstein returns to direct season five.

Jack Osbourne is opening his heart about his life's greatest loss. Jack grew emotional as he recalled the heartbreaking moment he learned his father, Ozzy Osbourne, had passed away. In a YouTube video shared Wednesday, the 39-year-old reality star explained that a trusted family employee, who had been with them for three decades, arrived at his Los Angeles home at 3:45 a.m. to break the news. 

“When I looked through my window and I saw it was him, I knew something bad had happened,” Jack said quietly. “I was informed that my father had passed.”

Jack explained that the messenger had worked with the Osbourne family for three decades, making the sight of him at such an early hour even more unsettling. The moment marked the beginning of a painful but deeply reflective chapter for the family.

Jack said he cherished unexpected extra time with Ozzy after staying in the UK following Black Sabbath's final concert in Birmingham on July 5. 

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

He and his family had planned to vacation in Portugal, but canceled when his children came down with the stomach flu.

“I've never been more grateful for my kids to have the stomach flu than I am today,” Jack said, reflecting on those precious days.

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

While devastated by his father's death, Jack said he felt peace knowing Ozzy was no longer suffering.

A post shared by Kelly Osbourne (@kellyosbourne)

“I wish he was still here, I wish he was still with us all, but he was having a rough go,” Jack admitted. “But nobody expected it to happen as quickly as it did, and when it did. It was not anything that was on our radar.”

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

Ozzy died on July 22 of a heart attack at 76. He had also been living with coronary artery disease and Parkinson's disease.

A post shared by Samantha ✞ (@osbourne._.ozzy)

A source told Page Six that the rock legend was “re-energized” by his final Black Sabbath concert. “It filled him with life,” a close friend shared. “It's a beautiful ending.”

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

Jack grew emotional as he reflected on his father's personality.

A post shared by Jack Osbourne (@jackosbourne)

“He was deeply complicated,” he said. “He was funny, and weird and awkward and clumsy and just hilarious and so insightful.”

Jack added that, despite appearances, his father was always aware. “People may have thought he was checked out, but most of the time he wanted you to think he was checked out,” Jack explained. “But he was very aware, always.”

Ozzy, who had been looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and enjoying life in England, left behind a legacy as one of rock's most influential frontmen — and a father deeply loved by his family.

Jennifer Aniston's new relationship has an unexpected Bravo connection. The actress is dating hypnotherapist Jim Curtis, and according to Bethenny Frankel, she dated him “maybe 10 years ago.”

The revelation came during the Sept. 2 episode of Frankel's podcast “Just B with Bethenny Frankel.” The “Real Housewives of New York City” alum shared the surprising connection while discussing Aniston's new romance.

“I dated Jennifer Aniston's boyfriend and he was a nice guy,” Frankel said. The reality TV star explained that she would not go into details “out of respect” for Aniston and Curtis, but she confirmed their brief romance.

Frankel went on to praise Curtis while reflecting on their past relationship. “I'm happy for her, and I want to say this in the right way. His name is Jim Curtis, and he's getting a lot of attention because he's with her now and he's in like the wellness space,” she said.

Curtis has spent more than two decades working in health and wellness. According to his website, he is a hypnotherapist, life coach and author. Frankel noted that while wellness was part of Curtis' career path, it wasn't something they explored together during their time as a couple.

A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel)

“He was earlier in his journey. But with that and with the wellness aspect, there was an earthiness to it, and it does vibe with Jen Aniston,” Frankel said.

She added that she believes Aniston and Curtis are a good match. “I'm happy for Jennifer Aniston because I do believe she wants to find love. I do believe it's been difficult, as I understand as well as anybody can, and I do believe she's sort of got that earthy, mellow side to her.”

Frankel concluded her remarks on a hopeful note: “I think this is good. I like it, and I'm happy for her and for him, who, like I said, I thought was a lovely man.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

According to Cosmopolitan, Aniston, 56, and Curtis were first linked in May when eagle-eyed fans noticed Curtis liked one of Aniston's Instagram posts, which featured a copy of his book, Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide. People later confirmed the two were “casually dating and having fun.”

The pair have since been seen on multiple outings, including a dinner date at Nobu in Malibu. A source also told People that Aniston's inner circle already approves of Curtis.

“Jim's great. Her close friends love him. He's amazing to be around. He has this really calm and secure energy. Jen loves it,” the insider said.

With Frankel's candid comments and Aniston's new relationship continuing to capture attention, the couple's romance is already generating buzz in both Hollywood and Bravo circles. Whether the two keep things casual or take their relationship further, Aniston's fans — and Frankel's followers — will be watching closely.

Amazon MGM still hasn't stepped up and announced who the next James Bond will be—a question that's been raging across movie-dom since Daniel Craig started making noises about being tired of the role at least as far back as 2015. But it has announced a James Bond. Specifically, the studio (and video game creator IO Interactive) have officially announced that Patrick Gibson will be playing the part in the game studio's upcoming “young Bond” game, 007: First Light, one of the first Bond projects Amazon has rolled out since spending huge amounts of money to wrest control of the franchise for its own personal Blofeld. That's right: Baby Dexter himself, recently freed of his Paramount+ bonds (after the streamer killed off prequel series Dexter: Original Sin after a single season), has been revealed to be the voice and face behind the game's less-polished version of the world's greatest superspy.

﻿
This is not wholly surprising: IO rolled out an earlier trailer for the game back in June, and eagle-eared listeners were pretty sure they'd picked out Gibson's voice amidst the chaos. Still, he's now officially been announced in the gig, playing a younger version of Bond as he attempts to track down an apparently rogue 009 and “earn the number.” (You can see a decent chunk of the actual gameplay, which seems to blend some of the reactivity and physics of IO's well-loved Hitman games with a less freeform action experience akin to an Uncharted game, in the trailer above.)

This all puts Gibson in the weird position of being the only James Bond kicking around at the moment, at a time when huge amounts of both money and attention are being focused on the franchise. (By the way, if you want to see how the series is faring in our current tournament of the greatest action franchises of all time, check in over here.) The Irish actor—who previously starred in both The OA and Shadow And Bone—will now presumably get to spend the next year or so being hounded about whether he might someday reprise the role in a non-interactive capacity, at least until Amazon finally feels willing to pull the trigger on a cinematic casting. First Light, meanwhile, comes out in March of 2026.

Mother Monster also shared a deluxe edition of Mayhem featuring the new song and two bonus tracks.

Lady Gaga has been preaching about protecting the dolls for most of her career. Now, she's joining a different set of dolls for her eerie new music video. 


	On Wednesday (Sept. 3), the pop superstar dropped the music video for her new song, “The Dead Dance,” featured in the second season of Netflix's Wednesday. Directed by Tim Burton himself, the new video sees Gaga taking on the visage of a haunted porcelain doll, with cracks stretching across her face. As she comes to life and begins staggering around a graveyard of other spooky looking figurines, Gaga finds her rhythm and makes good on the song title's promise.

	











	“‘Cause when you killed me inside, that's when I came alive/ Yeah, the music's gonna bring mе back from death,” she sings, while surrounded by a group of dancing, zombified dolls around her. “I'm dancin' until I'm dead.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Along with dropping the new song and video, Gaga also shared a deluxe edition of her 2025 album Mayhem on Wednesday, adding “The Dead Dance” and two previously-released tracks — “Kill for Love” and “Can't Stop the High” — to the album on streaming services. Prior to the deluxe drop, the two bonus tracks were only previously available on specialty editions of album. 


	“The Dead Dance” was created for season two of Wednesday, the second half of which also debuted on Wednesday. In the new episodes, Gaga appears as Rosaline Rotwood, a deceased former instructor at Nevermore Academy who helps Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) in her quest to save her family and friends.

	











	In an interview with Billboard, the show's composer Chris Bacon praised Gaga's performance on the show and spoke about how he went about scoring her scenes. “It was naturally very exciting to see Lady Gaga pop up on screen, but it was also just treating her like she's any other character,” he explained. “She brings a certain mythology with her, and there's a certain mystery and maybe a hint of darkness to her, just like everybody in the Wednesday universe. So it was fun to get to play with that musically.”

Paramount has been in “big, impressive deals!” mode ever since it begged, bribed, and scraped its way into an acquisition by Skydance a few months back, tossing big chunks of money at things like luring away Netflix's dice-rolling golden geese, popping up flashy video game adaptations to try to lure in the youths, and signing deals with Donald Trump's favorite “guys hit each other in the head” sporting event. All of which, presumably, is meant to convey a new spirit of vitality and “we have cash and aren't picky about where it lands,” leading to news today that the studio has found a new up-and-comer to take a chance on: A scrappy young actor and producer by the name of Will Smith.

Variety reports that Paramount has just signed a new first-look deal with Smith's Westbrook, which will apparently be focusing on “global, four-quadrant theatrical movies,” with a strong focus on launching new franchises and working with established IP. (Dang, the rest of Hollywood is presumably asking itself: Why didn't we think of that?) Paramount also isn't keeping Smith's wife's name out of its contracts: Jada Pinkett Smith is co-owner of Westbrook, and will serve as producer on projects while Smith himself stars in them.

Smith's brand is, of course, Very Weird in 2025: He's released exactly two Hollywood films since climbing up on stage and slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars, Emancipation (already filmed pre-Slap) and then the moderately successful Bad Boys: Ride Or Die. Even before that, though, Smith was operating in choppy cinematic waters: Yes, he picked up an Oscar for King Richard shortly after slapping Rock (and shortly before picking up a decade-long ban from the Oscars ceremony), but his only major commercial success in years was Disney's Aladdin remake, which came with a host of nostalgic caveats. (Notably, Gemini Man, an expensive action thriller entirely predicated on the idea people might like a second Will Smith to go with the original flavor, was basically an outright bomb.) The era of Will Smith, Guaranteed Box Office Draw is now fully twenty years out of date, so it's not entirely clear why Paramount thinks it'll get its money's worth out of this new deal. (Admittedly, Smith has had a bit more successful as a producer, lending his name to Peacock's Bel-Air—until his name got to be too toxic to be an asset—and, most notably, Karate Kid sequel show Cobra Kai.)

Westbrook reportedly already has two projects in development at Paramount: Sugar Bandits, based on a novel by The Town author Chuck Hogan, and a project titled Rabbit Hole

(Gray News) – A cause of death has been revealed for Dan Rivera, the ghost hunter and paranormal investigator who died while on tour with the infamous Annabelle doll, which is believed to be possessed.

According to PEOPLE, the Adams County coroner said in a statement Thursday that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac related. His death was ruled as natural.

The coroner also said that Rivera had a known history of heart issues and that the Annabelle doll was not in the room with him when he died.

Officials said Rivera, 54, was found dead in July in his hotel room the day after an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that featured the iconic doll. 

The event was part of the “Devils on the Run” tour, which displays Annabelle, “for those brave enough” to come face-to-face with her.

The coroner noted that there was nothing unusual or suspicious about the death.

Decades ago, Annabelle, a Raggedy Ann doll, was given to a nursing student who brought it home, where she lived with a roommate.

According to the New England Society for Psychic Research, almost immediately, the roommates noticed “strange occurrences” with the doll.

“They were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the NESPR website states. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”

In 1968, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated the doll and determined that Annabelle was “demonically possessed.”

“They removed the doll from the house and encased it in a glass box to contain the evil-spirited entity,” according to the NESPR.

The possessed doll's story with the Warrens inspired the “Conjuring” and “Annabelle” horror film franchises.

Dan Rivera died on July 13, one day after an event featuring the infamous doll

 A cause of death has been determined for the paranormal investigator whose body was found in July after an event in Gettysburg, Pa., showcasing the infamous Annabelle doll. 


 Dan Rivera, an Army veteran and senior lead investigator for the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research, died on July 13, one day after an event with the purportedly haunted toy that has long been featured in horror tales.


 Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner, said in a statement on Thursday, Sept. 4, that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac-related and was ruled as natural.


 “Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings. It is also confirmed that Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of his passing,” Dutrow said.


 A July 13 report from the Pennsylvania State Police detailed the conditions in which Rivera, 54, was found.


 “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]. The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers," the report read. "Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene."

 Rivera had been with colleagues that morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room, Dutrow previously told PEOPLE, although it wasn't clear what Rivera may have been ill with.


 At the time of his death, Rivera was on tour in Gettysburg to show Annabelle, which the New England Society for Psychic Research has described as “demonically possessed.”

 According to the society, Annabelle's origin dates back to 1968, when she was presented to a student nurse as a gift. The nurse took the doll to her home where she lived with her roommate.


 “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the psychic research society has said. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”


 Husband and wife Ed and Lorraine Warren, who founded the society, later removed Annabelle from the home and stored it in a glass box “to contain the evil spirited entity,” where it remains today. 


 Annabelle and the Warrens inspired the horror film franchise The Conjuring.


 Harrison Jones, a journalist for the Hanover, Pa.-based Evening Sun, attended the tour just one day before Rivera's death, telling PEOPLE afterward that Rivera "definitely struck me as a kind and very welcoming person, and my heart breaks for his family and colleagues."


 Joining a tour group, Jones took photos and video footage as Rivera spoke with the visitors before he took them to see the doll.


 “Mr. Rivera, along with another of NESPR's investigators, Wade Kirby, spoke to the group about Annabelle's history and their experiences working with the doll,” Jones said. “Among those discussions, Mr. Rivera spoke about how he had built the case that Annabelle was in himself, and that he had designed many aspects from the perspective of his faith.”


 Jones said he didn't speak much with Rivera but that the paranormal investigator “did ask me if I got what I needed out of my visit and asked if I had gotten good images during the tour.”

 On July 14, while Jones was working on his story about the event, he heard the news that Rivera had died.


 “It was clear from the prior controversy surrounding the tour that his death was going to immediately cause intense controversy and become his own part of paranormal legend no matter what was said,” Jones told PEOPLE. “But in my own reporting I was mainly concerned with trying to focus on the human life lost at the center of this tragic news, Mr. Rivera, who had dedicated so much time and effort in sharing his love for the paranormal."


 In a previous statement shared with PEOPLE, the New England Society for Psychic Research remembered Rivera as not only a "vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend."


 “Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society said. “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him. Out of respect for his family, we kindly ask for privacy as they mourn this tremendous loss."

"The weirdest looking cloud I've ever seen."- Whitney Merritt

That may be the understatement of the year. Whitney, an Owensboro native who now lives in White House, Tennessee (just north of Nashville), walks at least 10,000 steps a day. That's a lot of steps and the aspiring singer-songwriter normally passes her time listening to podcasts. Her favorite? Am I The A**hole.

But, Whitney didn't need a podcast to keep her company on Monday. Instead, she got quite a surprise on Labor Day when she was walking in the new neighborhood across from her apartment. Let's just say that, for a few moments, she was convinced she was having one of those Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

When I saw the video footage of what Whitney saw in the sky, I immediately had flashbacks to my own childhood in the early 80s. That's when the TV miniseries V was released. If you're close to my age, you know exactly what I am talking about. If you don't, check this out!

Whitney admits that the neighborhood she was walking in was giving her "creepy suburbia vibes", but it was the briefly unidentified object in the sky that made her say, "What in the HECKKKKK?"

Whitney says, "I was already kinda creeped out, then I turned onto the street within the neighborhood and passed a house to my left." That's when she looked up and saw this.

Whitney says she immediately thought that what she was seeing was some sort of  UFO. It hovered there, in that formation, for at least ten minutes. Oddly, no one else- in the creepy neighborhood- seemed to even notice it. Whitney knew she had to document what she was seeing, so she grabbed her phone.

She captured the video and shared her footage on social media. While a couple of her friends immediately proclaimed, "UFO!", a couple of others correctly identified the object as a lenticular cloud.

And, yes!  Lenticular clouds do resemble our notions of what a UFO would look like. Now, however, Whitney says the cloud now reminds of her something else.

She says, "The more I looked at it, it reminded me of the melted clock in the Salvador Dali artwork. Kinda."

She's not wrong.

Dan Rivera, the paranormal investigator who was touring alongside the infamous and purportedly ‘haunted' Annabelle doll, was found dead in July shortly after attending an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Army Veteran served as the senior lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research. He died on July 13, with authorities now confirming the cause of his death.

The Adams County coroner, Francis Dutrow, released a statement on Thursday, September 4, 2025, that revealed that River's death was cardiac-related and has been ruled out as natural. Dutrow stated, “Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings. It is also confirmed that Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of his passing,” as reported by the PEOPLE.

A July 13 report from the Pennsylvania State Police outlined the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the 54-year-old.

The report read, “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]. The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers.” It added, "Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene."

The Adam County coroner previously told the news outlet that Rivera was with his colleagues in the morning but went to his room as he was feeling sick. It was not revealed what he was feeling ill with. At the time of his death, he was on tour with the doll was described as "demonically possessed” by the New England Society for Psychic Research.

The Annabelle doll's origin goes back to 1968, when she was gifted to a student nurse who allegedly brought the toy to her apartment, which she rented with her roommate. The society shared, “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle," as reported by PEOPLE.

They added, "The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”

The founders of the society and popular paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, removed the doll from the apartment and locked it inside a glass box “to contain the evil-spirited entity.” 

The Conjuring film franchise is inspired by the Warrens and the Annabelle doll.

Anne Rice's Immortal Universe expands on AMC this fall with the arrival of a third series. Today, we've got the first official trailer for Talamasca: The Secret Order.

The show follows a secret society that monitors, tracks, and contains witches, vampires, and other supernatural creatures scattered around the world. Check out the first in-depth look at the new show in the trailer below.

Nicholas Denton stars as Guy Anatole. On the cusp of graduating law school, Guy is approached by a representative of the Talamasca, a secretive agency that monitors and protects us from the supernatural world. When Guy learns that the Talamasca has been tracking him since his childhood, he falls headlong into a world of secret agents and immortal beings who, up to now, have maintained a fragile balance with the mortal world. 

The series also features Elizabeth McGovern as Helen, a seasoned veteran of the Talamasca, and the leader of its New York Motherhouse; William Fichtner as Jasper, a mysterious American who has quietly assumed control and influence over the Talamasca's London Motherhouse; Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Olive, a beguiling and ambitious agent of the Talamasca; Celine Buckens as Doris, strong-willed and with an old soul, she lives with a coven of witches on a houseboat; and Jason Schwartzman as Burton, a charming, rakish vampire, leading a cloistered life in a luxurious Upper West Side penthouse.

In addition to these new characters entering AMC's Anne Rice universe, Talamasca will also feature a few faces familiar to Interview with the Vampire viewers. Eric Bogosian will reprise his role as Daniel Molloy, and Justin Kirk returns as Talamasca agent Raglan James.

Anne Rice's Talamasca comes from co-showrunners and executive producers John Lee Hancock and Mark Lafferty. Hancock also directs.

The series marks the third entry into AMC's Anne Rice Immortal Universe, following Interview with the Vampire and Mayfair Witches.

Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres its six-episode first season on Sunday, October 26 at 9pm ET/PT on AMC and AMC+.  After that, new episodes will continue to air weekly on Sundays.

Until then, check back to THS for more updates.

Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is bringing the topic of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) into the limelight with an upcoming hearing. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which Luna chairs, aims to tackle the opacity shrouding UAPs, nudging the government towards greater transparency. This hearing, titled "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection," is scheduled for September 9, according to a release shared on the House Oversight Committee website.

Luna's statement resonates with a citizenry leaning forwards on the edge of their seats, hungry for truth and clarity. "The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety," she asserted on the House Oversight Committee website. Whistleblowers, armed with information on the intricate web of spending, classifications, and policies that bind UAP secrets, are encouraged to come forward, shielded from backlash.

Witness testimonies will be a focal point during the hearing, with individuals like Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a U.S. Air Force veteran, and Chief Alexandro Wiggins stepping into the public eye as UAP witnesses. They will be joined by George Knapp, a journalist with a focus on UAPs, and Dylan Borland, another witness with a background in the U.S. Air Force. Together, these voices seek to illuminate the DoD's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office's (AARO) performance, a body erected by congressional mandate for such enigmas.

Interested parties are invited to attend this public and press-inclusive event at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center, with the proceedings set to kick off at 10:00 AM EST. For those unable to make it in person, a livestream link has been provided, ensuring broad access to the discussion.

Expectations are on the rise as the date draws closer, with press RSVPs required by September 8. It remains to be seen whether the veil of secrecy will be lifted and if the federal government will succeed in "providing better answers on UAPs," as Luna put it on the House Oversight Committee website, repairing the fissures of trust that have long marred the public's view of UAP-related disclosure.

The Adams County coroner has released the cause of death for a notable paranormal researcher who died unexpectedly during a tour featuring the "haunted" doll known as Annabelle.

Video above: Top stories from WGAL.

Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow said Daniel Rivera died in Gettysburg, Pa., on July 13. 

"The cause of death has been determined to be cardiac-related and is ruled out as a natural death," a statement from the coroner's office says. "Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings."

The statement added that it was confirmed that the doll Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of Rivera's death.

The statement ended by saying the coroner's office extends its condolences to the Rivera family and loved ones during this difficult time. 

Known for her creepy presence and eerie backstory, Annabelle has captivated horror fans and paranormal enthusiasts across the country and around the world.

In July, the doll was put on display as part of the "Devils on the Run Tour" at the Soldier's Orphanage Homestead, a historic building that served as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg.

WGAL was able to get an up-close look at the doll. A sign posted beneath the doll said:

"Annabelle

"This Raggedy Ann doll was believed to be possessed by a young girl named Annabelle. After the owner experienced more sinister and dangerous activity, Ed Warren determined that the doll was possessed by the demonic. The doll was soon turned over to the Warrens for safekeeping and placed in the Warren's Occult Museum. Annabelle is responsible for scratching one of its victims with seven psychic scratches, and several motor vehicle accidents including the death of a motorcyclist who taunted Annabelle shortly before the crash."

Japanese fashion brand JennyFax has been getting a lot of attention for its newest line of hair accessories, made up of a pair of women's panties with a hair clip glued to them.

Most people would only wear underwear on their heads as a joke or a dare, but if unconventional fashion brand JennyFax has anything to say about it, wearing women's panties in one's hair will soon become a fashion statement. The Japanese brand took a pair of silky women's underwear, glued a metal hairclip to them, and created an original accessory that was sure to get people talking. Aptly called “panty ribbon bow,” the new hairclip comes in three colors -black, pink, and blue – and is priced at an eye-watering 17,600 yen ($119).

The brand's founder, Jen-Fang, has always been known for her non-conformist design choices, and the panty ribbon bow is definitely consistent with the brand tone.

Photos of the controversial accessory recently went viral on Chinese social media, sparking a heated online debate about the creative liberties of fashion brands. JennyFax is definitely not the first company to push the envelope in terms of design. Balenciaga regularly sparks controversy with its unconventional, sometimes shocking creations, as do other lesser-known brands, like ZNWR, or Felissimo.

Universal Pictures and Blumhouse just released a new trailer for the sequel to Ethan Hawke's terrifying horror film, Black Phone 2.

The short story that the original movie is based on, written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King), follows a masked serial killer who abducts children, locks them in his basement, and torments them. That is until one kid, Finney (Mason Thames), uses a black rotary phone to speak to the ghosts of The Grabber's victims and hatches a plan to escape, kill the Grabber, and reunite with his family. Unfortunately, Thames lives in a horror movie that made bank, so the Grabber is spinning the block on him.

The sequel film sees the Grabber (Hawke) make a surprising return, transforming him from a horrific kidnapper into what can best be described as a spiritual successor to Freddy Krueger. Evidently, the circumstances of his demise were greatly exaggerated. Much like how his victims were able to get the upper hand on the Grabber by tapping into the mystical through a payphone and communicating with one, the Grabber seems to be able to do the same this time around, and now he's haunting a teenage Finney and the kids at Colorado's Alpine Lake Youth Camp during the winter.

Black Phone 2‘s story follows Finney and his younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who, after receiving a call from a black pay phone, see disturbing visions of kids being stalked at camp. Together, they work to prevent her visions from coming to pass and confront an even more powerful supernatural version of the Grabber.

“The phone is ringing again. Are you going to answer?”

Speaking at CCXP Mexico earlier this June, director and co-writer Scott Derrickson explained the film's premise pretty vaguely without giving away how the Grabber made it back.

“The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is a typical ghost story,” Derrickson said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.”

Like many horror movies that catch fire, Black Phone made a lotta cash when it released back in 2022, earning $161 million from an $18 million budget, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Derrickson didn't have plans on making a sequel film until Hill hit him up a couple of months after the first film's release with the idea of having a sequel set with kids at a different stage in their lives, i.e., high schoolers, THR added.

“It is certainly more violent, scarier, more graphic,” Derrickson said, regarding the sequel being more horror in comparison to its predecessor being a supernatural thriller. “And part of that is because of the age of the kids.”

Fans can witness what horrors await Finney and Gwen when Black Phone 2 hits theaters on October 17.

Imagine a scenario that sounds like science fiction: Earth, a warming planet, sees its glaciers slowly melt, and life begins to adjust to new conditions. Until, suddenly, everything changes. This is because temperatures drop dramatically, about 10°C, and the planet enters “winter mode,” a period that lasts more than a thousand years. This event, known as the Younger Dryas, occurred about 12,800 years ago and remains a great mystery to this day. So much so that, for a long time, the explanation was simple: the melting glaciers dumped large volumes of freshwater into the oceans, weakening ocean currents and interrupting the transport of heat to the Northern Hemisphere.

Well, the answer to the Younger Dryas enigma may lie further away than we imagined… not just in the melting ice sheets, but in the stars. To understand the impact of this discovery, we need to go back in time and look at what was happening on Earth. After more than 7,000 years of continuous warming, the planet entered an extremely rapid cooling phase. What caused this abrupt change?

The most widely accepted theory until then suggested that melting glaciers had dumped large volumes of freshwater into the oceans, disrupting the ocean currents that transport heat northward. But what no one could explain was the speed of the cooling, about a year. How could something so drastic happen so quickly? It was then that scientists wondered: what if this cooling wasn't just a consequence of the melting ice, but had been caused by something external? By something coming from space?

It was then that a team of scientists decided to further investigate ocean sediments collected from Baffin Bay, near Greenland, and their findings were surprising. They identified small metallic particles, rich in elements such as platinum, iridium, nickel, and cobalt. These elements are rare on Earth but abundant in comets and meteorites. Even more impressive, they found impact microspheres, which are small mineral bubbles that form when materials melt under intense heat, something that can occur when a comet disintegrates upon impact with the atmosphere.

It's worth remembering that these particles block solar radiation, causing an “impact winter.” This is a temporary blockage of the sun that could have drastically reduced temperatures, so rapidly that Earth was plunged into a long period of cooling. In other words, this event would have destabilized the planet's conditions, impacting ecosystems and the civilizations that were just beginning to form (much like this vast anomaly affecting America).

And no, this discovery isn't just a curious detail from the past… Here are some of the lessons we can learn from this discovery:

Even though research into the Younger Dryas is far from complete, these discoveries indicate that the cause of one of the planet's greatest climate shifts may have come from space. The comet that exploded over Earth, releasing cosmic dust, may have been the catalyst for a centuries-long global cooling. That's why we need to remain vigilant, especially now with this 1.9-billion-year-old megablast hurtling toward Earth.

Long before the deranged ranting and raging began, Luke Filby knew his uncle simply as the man who could make life feel electric – renting Terminator 2, blasting Metallica and mucking around like a fun older brother while they played Super Mario Kart.

Now, those memories are tainted by another set: a Christmas lunch filled with rants about religion and the end of the world. Hours at a hospital deathbed drowned out by angry tirades from his uncle Dezi Freeman against police. A frightening descent into violence and conspiracy theories.

“I tuned it out in the end,” Filby recalls. “It didn't even make sense to me. It was just like gibberish.”

Somewhere along the way, the uncle who once listened to songs like Metallica's Enter Sandman began insisting the music was satanic. It was one of the first steps in a long, spiralling collapse that would plunge his entire family deep into his vortex of fixation and paranoia, culminating in the horrific events in Porepunkah.

Filby mourns the man he lost years ago – long before his uncle chose a new life and a new name, before the shootings and the headlines, before Dezi became a fugitive.

“He went through so many different groups in his life phases,” Filby says.

“It was like he always tried to find a place, a group, where he could fit.

“Everything that has unfolded has completely devastated us. It has broken our hearts for the innocent lives lost, and their families involved.”

The last time Freeman saw his extended family was Christmas 2018, and he spent the day erratically regurgitating his fanatical views to weary relatives on everything from religion and doomsday theories to the impending apocalypse.

During his sudden bursts of rage over lunch, he spewed out vitriol about his hatred of police, his disdain for authorities.

Only months before the family gathering, Freeman was ranting and raving about the government and bracing for the end of the world at his father's deathbed.

“He was just going on and on about authority and politics,” Filby recalls.

This particular Christmas was a final tipping point for many of the Filbys, splintering an already fractured family, who say they have been estranged from the alleged double murderer for years by both name and ideology.

Freeman, a self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen”, changed his surname from Filby and has been on the run for 10 days after allegedly blasting Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, with a home-made shotgun through the door of a bus that the weapons enthusiast was living in near the township of Porepunkah on August 26.

He is then alleged to have opened a window of the bus and shot Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, 35, who also died at the scene. Another detective seriously wounded in the attack is understood to have hidden under the bus for up to an hour until paramedics arrived.

Police say officers were at the property to execute a warrant related to historical child sexual abuse offences.

Freeman has not been sighted since, despite hundreds of specialist officers trawling the dense forests, snow-laden mountains and deep valleys of Victoria's High Country, about 210 kilometres north-east of Melbourne.

By all accounts from family, friends and acquaintances, Dezi Freeman has had many incarnations over his life.

In his 20s, he was a tree-hugging environmentalist. A heavy metal fan with unkempt long dark hair who loved to play Nintendo. A devout Christian. Luke Filby recalls his uncle obsessively going to church youth groups and then destroying all his Metallica cassette tapes in the 1990s as he plunged deeper into Christianity and suddenly began to describe the band as “satanic and evil”.

He recalls his uncle bizarrely using a magnet to erase the music from the cassettes in a process known as tape degaussing, which works by using a strong magnetic field to erase data.

Those who have known the 56-year-old for decades say he has always struggled to hold down a job, living off welfare payments and a disability pension for years, and exhibiting what they describe as “narcissistic, racist and misogynistic” traits.

Locals say he has also worked sporadically as a freelance photographer, a diver and an abseiling instructor at “The Gorge” near Bright.

He was also an avid churchgoer, going to mass weekly at the Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Church in Bright – attending for the last time just days before the double shooting.

“He always wanted something for nothing,” says one acquaintance, who knew Freeman for years.

“Huge ego. A real jealous streak. He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.”

Another family member says he was the type of person “upset with everybody else having something better than him”.

His relatives say he refused to pay parking and speeding fines, and was embroiled in road-rage incidents and countless disputes with neighbours as he became a radicalised, anti-authority conspiracy theorist who adhered to pseudo-legal beliefs in line with sovereign citizens, who believe they are not subject to the law.

His volatile and often violent temperament caused him to constantly fall out with his family. Filby claims members of the family fell out with Freeman after he had an altercation with his own brother.

Freeman disappeared to the Philippines soon after this altercation, and Filby says he remembers his uncle suddenly re-emerging in the early 2000s with his wife, Amalia, known as Mali.

He says it was Mali who helped him to temporarily reconnect with his frayed family before they became estranged again.

“She's such a wonderful, spirited person,” Filby says. “We are very worried about her and the kids. He's gone on the run from police and has basically thrown them under a bus.”

Filby still mourns the uncle who he says was like an older brother to him as a boy.

“He would rent Terminator 2 from the video store and play Super Mario Kart with me,” he says. “That's what I loved about him, and so it was just sad that he had this weird anger inside of him, almost like a mental illness. This kind of rage where he constantly threw tantrums.”

‘He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.'

But like much of Freeman's family, Filby had distanced himself from his uncle for years as his behaviour grew more erratic and terrifying.

“My grandparents, Dezi's mum and dad, were some of the loveliest, good Samaritan Christians ever,” he says. “They never swore or anything. Always tried to do the right thing. They would just be absolutely heartbroken by this.” 

As the years went on, Freeman's extremist views only hardened. Those who knew him say he became paranoid, setting up surveillance cameras wherever he was living and meticulously researching technology devices as he joined online forums for conspiracy theorists, including a Facebook group dedicated to preparing for the apocalypse.

One family member also recalled him increasingly watching online videos of police brutality, and grotesque terrorism and beheading footage from the Middle East.

Freeman refused to abide by the law, believing it did not apply to him. He frequently spent extended periods in the bush and was known to be an expert hunter. His fixation with firearms and making his own guns intensified, too.

Former landlord Jamie King told this masthead last week that Freeman had a long-running fascination with home-made arsenal dating back more than decade. King recalled his former tenant showing him sketches of guns that he had found on the internet.

“He looked at me, and he said, ‘How hard do you reckon it would be to make them?'” he says.

Freeman had told the farmer he wanted to make his own guns, but had also asked his wife, Mali, to get a firearm licence so he could buy more weapons.

“I said, ‘Why would Mali want a gun?' And he said, ‘Well, I've got assault charges.'”

His intense hatred for police is well-documented in online posts, video footage and court documents.

During a hearing last year appealing against his suspended driver's licence, Freeman told a court that “even the sight of a cop or a cop car … it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier”.

He came to public attention for his anti-government stunts during the pandemic, making headlines in 2021 when he helped lead an attempted private prosecution of then-premier Daniel Andrews for treason.

Freeman has for years displayed contempt for police and the justice system, and is known among anti-authority extremist groups for his public stunts.

He has described police as terrorist thugs and Nazis. In the days before the police killings, his wife confided in a neighbour, fearing for his mental health.

In 2023, he posted online “the only good cop is a dead cop”, and called for the “extermination” of politicians. These views appear to have only deepened when he was drawn to the so-called freedom movement during the coronavirus pandemic.

During the pandemic, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. He refused to wear face masks in shops, voiced his refusal to get vaccinated, and told people about his distaste for government restrictions and lockdowns.

“He was anti everything to do with it,” one local said. “He fell down a bit of a rabbit hole. It was all a bit unhinged.”

A friend of Freeman's wife, Mali, says Freeman began to change during the pandemic, believing the Victorian government had mishandled its COVID-19 response.

She says Freeman had begun to mobilise with a group of people in the community who were also opposed to lockdowns, restrictions and vaccines.

King says Freeman considered himself to be “a bit of a Geronimo” – a reference to the famed Native American leader who resisted both Mexican and American forces in the late 19th century.

“He's probably wanting to go down in a blaze of glory so he gets written into history,” he says.

King says his former neighbour owned a ghillie suit, an elaborate type of camouflage clothing, that he would wear in the remote bushland when he disappeared into the High Country for weeks on end.

“I reckon he actually thought he was Native American,” King said, adding that Freeman had a tipi, a conical tent of indigenous American tribes, on the property when he lived there.

King still vividly remembers when Freeman came to his house one afternoon holding sketches and drawings he got online about how to make home-made guns.

Looking back now, that moment is chilling.

“I never would have thought it would come to this,” he says.

But another of Freeman's former neighbours, Gary French, is not shocked by the alleged brutal double murder.

“He's always been dangerous,” French says. “Anywhere Dezi has lived, he has brought chaos. He's created a multitude of problems for a lot of people.”

French and his family found themselves embroiled in a bitter land dispute and then a drawn-out civil court case when the suspected gunman began hunting for deer and continually trespassing on their land.

French says Freeman used drones and surveillance technology to spy on, threaten and torment his family when they lived next door to him in Myrtleford between 2017 and 2019.

“We took a civil case against him … It was a two-year process,” French says. “He was defending himself in court. He attempted to arrest the magistrate involved. It was just an absolute circus.”

It cost the family $100,000 in legal fees. French says he often felt police were powerless to stop him.

“He lost his gun licence at that time,” French says. “So I was dumbfounded that he actually got a gun licence back.

“But he has also been convicted of firearm offences previously, so I just couldn't believe he even had a firearms licence to begin with.”

King says he always felt that Freeman was envious of him because he owned a sprawling block of land in the remote hamlet of Nug Nug, about 20 kilometres west of Porepunkah.

“He was a little bit jealous of me because I own property,” King says.

“He'd say, ‘It's not fair that you own all this', and I would say ‘Dezi, I've had a job since I was 14 years old'. I've never been on Centrelink. I purchased this property.”

He remembers Freeman as a person who was self-absorbed and arrogant. He says he once pretended to be a photographer employed by the Country Fire Authority, wearing a firefighter uniform with the word “media” sewn on it, so he could take photos at close range as bushfires tore through the High Country.

Early one summer's day, when the two were still neighbours, Freeman told King to come outside his house after midday.

When King went outside, he saw Freeman had climbed a nearby mountain and was standing on top of it holding a tiny mirror in his hand, illuminating the vast countryside below with sunlight.

“You could see this light reflecting from the mirror kilometres away,” he said. “It was incredible. He was just standing there on top of this mountain like he was the king of it.”

Their relationship soured in 2012 during a dispute, when King discovered a vast marijuana crop growing on the property and told Freeman to dig it up within 24 hours.

“He [Dezi] flipped out. I mean this guy went f---ing nuts … He was in my face screaming that he's going to shoot me dead,” King says, his eyes flashing wildly as he recounts the encounter.

“It was like a switch flipped. This went on for five or 10 minutes,” King told this masthead earlier this week.

“I have thought a lot about what has happened these last few days, and I didn't think he had it in him.

‘He's always been dangerous.'

“But is he a doomsday prepper? F---, yeah. I reckon he's built an underground bunker somewhere or hiding down a mineshaft.” 

Filby was outside his home in the regional city of Albury-Wodonga tending to his birds when his mother, Freeman's sister, called last Tuesday afternoon. While they were chatting about their day, another call came through from Filby's uncle, Freeman's brother, and his mother hung up abruptly. Minutes later, she called him back.

“She said, ‘Google Porepunkah shooting right now',” Filby says. “So I Googled it, and Mum said, ‘Who do you think that is?' And, I was like ‘Oh my god. It's Uncle Des'.”

“My mum has been crying her eyes out about it for days,” Filby says.

“We are absolutely heartbroken for the two police officers who have died, their families, and the third guy that was injured.”

Now, Filby is left haunted by two versions of the same man: the uncle who once felt like a brother, and the alleged murderous fugitive accused of killing two police officers.

“I always felt something like this was going to happen,” Filby says. “But I wasn't sure precisely what would be the thing to finally tip him over the edge.”

Jensen Ackles offers new insights into "Vought Rising" and reuniting with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki & Misha Collins for The Boys.



During a wide-ranging interview with Variety that went live on Wednesday night, Jensen Ackles covered a wide range of topics regarding his professional career, including deep dives into Prime Video's Countdown and CBS's Tracker. Of course, you can't cover all of the things that Ackles has going on and not touch on his run as Soldier Boy in the upcoming fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys and in Showrunner Paul Grellong's upcoming Ackles and Aya Cash (Clara Vought, aka Stormfront)-starring prequel series The Boys: Vought Rising. In the following highlights, Ackles discusses the similarities and differences between the versions of Soldier Boy he plays in both series, an interesting observation he and Cash made about working on "Vought Rising" after The Boys, and what it was like reuniting with Supernatural co-stars and friends Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins on the set of The Boys for the final run.

Ackles Compares Soldier Boy in "The Boys" and in "The Boys: Vought Rising": "Obviously, they're the same guy, but certainly there's a lot of life that Soldier Boy has lived when we see him in 'The Boys' and when we see him in Season 5 — how he's relating to people, the things that are important to him, the things that he's willing to just slough off, his idea of the life he wants to lead. And then going back 70-odd years to see him when he was really starting to get going, I'm able now to deal with the struggles that made him who he became, and you start to see him before he has necessarily the swagger and the gravitas and the life lived of 75 years of being the top dog.

["Vought Rising"] predates all that, so I think I'm trying to show a little bit more of an early version of it — not necessarily an innocence to it, but there's certainly scenes, relationships and character traits that predate how we see him in modern day, and that's fun to play with. Now, that's not to say he's going to be a completely different character and he's not going to be the tough guy that I think we know and love. That's there, and we'll get there quickly, but it is fun to show the origin of how this guy became who he is, and what were the little tricks and little ticks that crafted him into where we see him now."

Ackles & Cash: "The Boys: Vought Rising" Feeling "Familiar, But Feels Unfamiliar Too": "It's funny — Aya [Cash] and I were talking and working together the other day. It's weird coming into a show almost feeling like you're coming back to a show, because you're playing the same character, but it's a totally different show. There's all new actors that you're working with, all new characters, and all new relationships that you're developing as that character, and she was like, 'It's like coming home, and you've sold the house and there's a new family living there. This feels familiar, but feels very unfamiliar too.' So we're still trying to find our footing. I'm glad we have each other, and everybody that we're working with has been super great.

Ackles on His Dynamic with Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins While Filming "The Boys": "Look, we're going to have fun no matter what venue we're operating in. Obviously, we spent many, many, many years together in front of the camera. We've spent many years — and continue to — behind the camera and at events and convention centers, so there's a relatability between all of us that exists that's far greater than just our characters. So I feel like you can stick us in anywhere and we all get along and we all know how to operate, whether we're playing a new character, an old character, or ourselves. There's just a camaraderie there that you get when you've spent 20 years together."

Along with Ackles and Cash, the spinoff prequel also stars Will Hochman (Blue Bloods), Elizabeth Posey (Euphoria), Jorden Myrie (Bridgerton), Nicolò Pasetti (Industry), Ricky Staffieri (The Bear), Brian J. Smith (Sense8), Mason Dye (Stranger Things), and KiKi Layne (The Old Guard 2). Here's a look at a screencap of Grellong's Instagram Stories, followed by his IG post confirming the start of production on the prequel spinoff series:
