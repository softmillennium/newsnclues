            A man killed his sister and wounded seven others in a mass stabbing at an Indigenous community in central Canada, police said Thursday.
    


            The man, a 26-year-old from Hollow Water First Nation, an Anishinaabe community on the eastern shores of Lake Winnipeg, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle and died after crashing into a police cruiser that was responding to the attack, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Manitoba said. His sister, 18, died from injuries sustained in the stabbing.
    


            The son and daughter of one of the victims said their father was stabbed several times after someone broke into his home.  His lung was punctured by a stab wound in his back, but he remains conscious, they said, according to CBC.
    


            Meanwhile, a woman police officer who was seriously injured in the car collision is currently recovering in hospital.
    


            Most of the injured were taken to Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre by air and land, a spokesperson for the provincial health organization Shared Health said in a statement to CNN.
    


            The hospital temporarily declared a Code Orange Alert, which is normally issued during a mass casualty event. This has since been lifted.
    


            The motive behind the attack is not yet known.
    


            Hollow Water First Nation Chief Larry Barker said he's praying for all victims and has asked his community to do the same.
    


            RCMP officers along with other authorities have closed off a provincial road to investigate.
    


            “At this time, there is no risk to public safety,” the RCMP later said.

            New York Mayor Eric Adams met privately with Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this week to discuss potential opportunities to join the Trump administration, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.
    


            CNN previously reported that aides to President Donald Trump have floated the idea of offering Adams a job in the administration with the aim of blocking Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani from becoming the city's next mayor. Adams leaving the race could potentially allow former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to consolidate the opposition vote to Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June's Democratic primary but has elicited concerns from some top Democrats about his democratic socialist views.
    


            Witkoff is one of Trump's most trusted advisers. The source noted that nothing was offered to Adams, but that privately the president has indicated he would like to offer Adams a role in the administration. The source also said that the meeting was kept at a close hold even within the walls of the White House, and many aides only learned through news reports Wednesday about the initial outreach from Trump allies to Adams.
    


            The New York Times first reported Witkoff and Adams' meeting.
    


            Facing questions about the possibility he might drop out, Adams said Wednesday that he had no plans to exit the race.
    


            “I have a job. I'm running for my reelection. I am still doing that, and I'm looking forward to getting reelected,” Adams told reporters.
    


            Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for the Adams campaign, declined to confirm Adams and Witkoff had met during a trip the mayor took this week to Florida.
    


            “Mayor Adams was in Florida on a personal trip,” Shapiro said in a statement. “He did not carry out any campaigning or governmental related duties.”

Florida's efforts against illegal immigration scored a victory on Sept. 4 as an appeals court blocked a federal judge's order to dismantle the state's detention and deportation facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Letitia James seeks to reverse appeals court's decision to wipe away president's penalty in financial fraud case

New York's attorney general has requested the state's highest court reinstate Donald Trump's large civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion dollar penalty to nothing.

Attorney general Letitia James's office filed a notice of appeal with the state's court of appeals, seeking to reverse the mid-level appellate division's ruling last month that the penalty violated the US constitution's ban on excessive fines.

James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal.

Trump, the US president, declared “TOTAL VICTORY” after the appellate division wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.

Trump, a Republican, filed his own appeal last week, asking the court of appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, from holding corporate leadership positions in New York.

Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the appellate division judges said Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals.

James's appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida.

After a trial the judge, Arthur Engoron, ruled last year that James had proved Trump engaged in a years-long conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers.

Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m – payback of what the judge deemed “ill-gotten gains” from his puffed-up financial statements. That amount soared to more than $515m, including interest, by the time the appellate division ruled.

The five-judge appellate division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive”.

Disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo is “Donald Trump's choice” for mayor, Zohran Mamdani said at a press conference.

President Donald Trump is allegedly trying to push New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa out of the city's mayoral race in order to help Andrew Cuomo defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, according to The New York Times. 

The Times reports that Trump's advisers have discussed giving Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa positions in the president's administration in order “to give former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in November's general election.” 

Sliwa said in a statement that he had not been contacted by the Trump administration. A spokesperson for Adams, who was allegedly offered a position in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), told The Guardian that, “He has had no discussions with, nor has he met with, President Donald Trump regarding the mayoral race.”

Cuomo told reporters, “I don't want him [Trump] involved in anything with my race.”

In June, Queens Assemblymember Mamdani, a democratic socialist, trounced Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary, earning 56 percent of the ranked choice vote. Cuomo has not held elected office since he was forced to step down as New York governor in 2021 after several women accused him of sexual harassment. Last year, Cuomo joined the legal team for accused war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Despite Mamdani's decisive win in the June primary, Cuomo announced that he would stay in the race and run as an independent in November's general election. A Truthout investigation  published last month revealed that billionaires and their companies “have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates.”     

Mamdani is running on a platform that includes raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers, as well as a rent freeze, free city buses, and universal pre-K.

“Today, we have learned what New Yorkers have long suspected, that Andrew Cuomo is Donald Trump's choice to be the next mayor of this city,” Mamdani said at a press conference he called in response to the Times story. 

Mamdani noted the widespread suspicion that Trump's Department of Justice dropped corruption charges against Adams in exchange for his cooperation with the president's anti-immigrant agenda. Last year, Adams was charged with bribery and campaign finance violations. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years in prison. 

“We are talking about a mayor who was facing an indictment that was then dropped by this administration to ensure greater collaboration with the immigration directives of this administration now being considered for a job offer,” Mamdani said. 

“None of this has to do with New Yorkers,” he continued. “None of it has to do with the welfare of this city. It all has to do with power. It all has to do with the audacity that we have here to believe that we could pick our own mayor, that we have to believe that the most pressing issues are not how to ensure that Donald Trump continues to have an ambassador in City Hall, but that New Yorkers can actually afford the place that they call home.”

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who also ran for mayor and has been campaigning for Mamdani, posted the Times story and called the alleged collaboration between Adams, Trump, and Cuomo “bizarre.” 

“Donald Trump & Eric Adams' teams are reported to be conspiring in a bizarre, corrupt effort to elect Andrew Cuomo as mayor of NYC,” he wrote on X. “Seriously, that's what this story says. 62 days until we elect @ZohranKMamdani and put this absurd cabal behind us.”

            A federal appeals court has blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. A preliminary injunction is a temporary order put in place until a court can make a final decision in a case.
    


Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown



            “After careful consideration, we grant the defendants' motions and we stay the preliminary injunction and the underlying case itself pending appeal,” ruled the three appellate judges in the order.
    


            Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier called this a “victory against an activist judge” in a social media post.
    


            “The 11th Circuit not only blocked Judge (Kathleen) Williams' order to close Alligator Alcatraz, but they blocked her from proceeding with the case until the appeal is complete. A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!”
    


            CNN reached out to the Friends of the Everglades and other plaintiffs in the environmental lawsuit at the center of this appeal for comment. The organization says it is reviewing the order.
    


            It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July.
    


            Ever since then, the makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure.
    


            And the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – a Native American tribe whose reservation lies within miles of the facility – had raised concerns about the impact the facility will have on their land and the environmentally sensitive area, including the plants and animals that inhabit the Everglades.
    


            “The project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” US District Judge Kathleen Williams said in her order in late August.
    


            Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

The world must mount a campaign to end Israel's apartheid, as countries did for South Africa, he said.

Israel's apartheid across the occupied Palestinian territories is “far worse” than the apartheid perpetrated by white nationalists for decades in South Africa, Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, said in remarks on Wednesday.

“Many of us that have visited the occupied territories in Palestine have only come back with one conclusion: that the Palestinians are experiencing a far worse form of apartheid than we ever experienced,” said Mandela. “These last two years, what you have been witnessing, is a testament to that.”

Mandela was speaking to Reuters at the Johannesburg airport before taking off to Tunisia to join a Gaza aid flotilla mission on Wednesday evening.

He noted the importance of global pressure in ending Israel's siege of Gaza and apartheid regime.

“We believe that the global community has to continue supporting the Palestinians, just as they stood side-by-side with us,” Mandela said, noting the international campaign to end South Africa's apartheid. 

“They isolated apartheid South Africa and finally collapsed it. We believe that the time has come for that to be done for the Palestinians,” he went on.

Organizers, under the Global Sumud Flotilla, launched a fleet from Spain on Sunday, and are sailing to Tunisia to meet up with another convoy of boats to depart Thursday. From there, the group will set sail to Gaza, a journey expected to take a week or so, in hopes of breaking Israel's near-total blockade on humanitarian aid and other goods.

With over 50 ships, the convoy is the largest yet to attempt to sail to Gaza and deliver desperately needed aid. Israel has seized and attacked every flotilla mission thus far, and Israeli officials are already threatening to seize the Global Sumud Flotilla's boats and its activists.

At a rally in support of a part of the flotilla launching from Genoa, Italy, on Sunday, dockworkers said that they would work to block all shipments to Israel if Israel obstructs the flotilla once again.

“Around mid-September, these boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe,” a dockworker said at the rally, per footage that circulated online.

“From this region 13 to 14,000 containers leave every year for Israel, not a single nail will leave anymore,” he went on. 

Dockworkers in Genoa, one of Europe's largest ports, have been reportedly gathering aid to send to Gaza for weeks. Similar dockworker activism has taken place throughout Israel's genocide.

Dockworker activism also played a role in toppling South Africa's apartheid regime. In 1984, San Francisco dockworkers, many of them Black, launched a 10-day protest in which they refused to unload cargo sent from South Africa, protesting the reelection of pro-apartheid President Ronald Reagan. The dockworkers were members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which had a long history of supporting independence movements and figures like Nelson Mandela.

MINSK, September 4. /TASS/. The Belarusian State Security Committee detained a Polish spy who was gathering information about the upcoming Belarus-Russia Zapad 2025 military exercises, the Belarus 1 TV channel reported.

According to the channel, Polish citizen Grzegorz Gavel was detained in the city of Lepel in the Vitebsk Region. He was carrying an eight-page A4 printout that turned out to be a classified document on the Zapad 2025 drills.

It was ascertained that the man resides in Krakow, and was born in 1998. Gavel confessed that he had been instructed to "obtain information on the Zapad 2025 military exercises." Belarusian counterintelligence officers detained the foreigner as soon as he received the classified document. A criminal case has been opened. An investigation is underway.

The Pole had dollars, euros, Belarusian rubles, Bulgarian leva, and Polish zlotys with him. He also had a SIM card that someone else bought and gave to him. It was registered to another person.

According to the TV channel, there is irrefutable evidence of the Polish citizen's espionage activities. A few minutes before his arrest, he obtained a secret military document. Gavel had established contact with a Belarusian citizen through social networks and offered to cooperate with him in the interests of Polish special services. This cooperation consisted of covertly collecting and providing classified information about the command structure and military counterintelligence officers.

The man passed the information he obtained to the Polish security services. Specifically, Gavel collected classified information about Belarusian military facilities for the Polish Internal Security Agency. In exchange for the information he needed, Gavel promised to pay the Belarusian citizen money every month.

Trump had told Mike Johnson that he would not spend $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid

US politics live – latest updates

The Trump administration must release billions of dollars in foreign aid approved by Congress, including money that Donald Trump said last week he will not be spending, a federal judge has ordered.

US District Judge Amir Ali in Washington ruled on Wednesday that the move by the Republican administration was probably illegal and issued a preliminary injunction ordering the release of $11.5bn that is set to expire at the end of the month.

“To be clear, no one disputes that defendants have significant discretion in how to spend the funds at issue, and the court is not directing defendants to make payments to any particular recipients,” wrote Ali, who was nominated by Joe Biden. “But defendants do not have any discretion as to whether to spend the funds.”

Messages to the White House and state department were not immediately returned. The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.

Trump told Mike Johnson, the House speaker, in a letter on 28 August that he would not spend $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in effect cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what is known as a pocket rescission. That is when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend approved money. That late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in a required 45-day window and the money goes unspent as a result with the fiscal year drawing to a close at the end of September. It is the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used the tactic.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the administration to withhold the money.

The law is “explicit that it is congressional action – not the president's transmission of a special message – that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations”, he wrote.

The money at issue includes nearly $4bn for the US Agency for International Development to spend on global health programs and more than $6bn for HIV and Aids programs. Trump has portrayed the money as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals, and in January, issued an executive order directing the state department and the USAID to freeze spending on foreign aid.

A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled last month that the administration could suspend the money. The judges later revised that opinion, reviving the lawsuit before Ali.

In his ruling, Ali said he understood that his decision would not be the final word in the case, adding that “definitive higher court guidance now will be instructive”.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

“We have entered a stage of chronic trauma fatigue, where people live in a state of emotional numbness,” a doctor warns.

Recently, I was running down the street, carrying food for my friend in northern Gaza, with a tank speeding behind me like a predatory beast. The ground trembled under the weight of its treads, and my breath quickened in a race I could never win. My legs began to give out, the terror heavier than my ability to keep going. I felt myself surrendering to what I thought was my inevitable fate … until I woke up. 

It was 8:00 in the morning. My body was shaking, my heart racing. It had only been a nightmare — but a nightmare rooted in the reality of war, in the deep psychological harm that has marked us and continues to haunt us every day.

A door slamming shut is enough to make our bodies jolt involuntarily, convinced We're hearing an explosion. And every time we try to heal, we realize that this fear has been growing inside us during months of death under Israeli siege.

“The psychological situation today [in Gaza] is more complex and more dangerous than at the beginning of the war,” said Dr. Mohammad, a mental health specialist working at a counseling center in Deir al-Balah who asked to keep his last name private. He told me:

At first, the psychological reactions were acute but predictable — fear, panic, anxiety. Today, we have entered a stage of chronic trauma fatigue, where people live in a state of emotional numbness, loss of meaning, and internal fragmentation. People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it. There is no expression of emotion. People unconsciously use defense mechanisms such as repression and isolation. They speak and act as if death were just another story to tell.

In speaking with him, I realized I am not alone — all of us across Gaza are facing this trauma. He said the symptoms he sees repeatedly include nightmares, panic attacks, inability to concentrate, survivor's guilt, insomnia, disorientation, dissociative symptoms, denial, and unfocused anger. He has also observed a rise in self-harm attempts, especially among teenagers, alongside severe and almost constant depressive symptoms.

“People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it.”

Dr. Mohammad explained that the psychological toll varies across age groups. Children often show behavioral symptoms such as bedwetting, excessive clinginess to their mothers, sleep disturbances, stuttering, or aggression. Through their play, they may reenact scenes of bombardment. He has seen 5-year-olds speak of “martyrdom” and “occupation” as part of their daily awareness. Teenagers tend to either rebel or withdraw, often struggling with identity crises and profound hopelessness. Adults live with the constant push-and-pull of survival, guilt, and responsibility. The elderly may face trauma in silence, rarely seeking help despite their deep suffering.

“The collective trauma in Gaza is not a single moment, but a continuous accumulation over years,” Dr. Mohammad told me. “We are talking about a generation born and raised in an environment of fear, loss, and destruction. Everyone is affected to some degree. It is not an individual trauma, but a structural one that wounds the very social fabric and reshapes collective consciousness.”

Children — those who grew up under the sounds of missiles, loss, and hardship in an environment that denies them a healthy childhood — bear the heaviest scars. Among them is my 4-year-old cousin Jinan. When Israeli warplanes bombed their home, Jinan survived and was pulled from the rubble by civil defense workers, but her father, mother, and all her siblings were killed. Her life was turned upside down in a single moment. Today, when she cries, she tells her grandmother, “I want to go to the rubble of our house. I want to talk to Mama.”

I asked Dr. Mohammad about the long-term impact of the lack of consistent psychological support for these children. “The ongoing absence of mental health care puts them at risk of developing chronic disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, and even personality disorders in the future. It also affects their cognitive development, their ability to form healthy relationships, and their safe integration into society,” he said, adding that children are among the groups that feel most forgotten by the international community. The questions he hears them ask most often are: “Why is no one protecting us?” and “Why is the world silent?”

When I asked him how he personally copes, both as a psychologist and as a human being, with the sheer amount of pain he witnesses every day, he replied: “Honestly? Sometimes I don't cope. I allow myself to cry, to be tired, to feel hopeless. But what keeps me standing are the children who still smile despite everything, my colleagues who keep working despite their grief, and the people who continue to seek help. This shared resilience is my real therapy.”

On the possibility of healing under the current conditions, Dr. Mohammad said, “Hope exists, but it is fragile and conditional. You cannot speak of psychological recovery while war, killing, destruction, hunger, and both physical and spiritual bleeding continue. Some cases are simply beyond our capacity right now — children who have lost their entire families, people who witnessed massacres firsthand without access to a safe environment or consistent support. Those with prior mental health histories have also seen their conditions worsen dramatically.”

“Do not let the next generations grow up from the ashes of war without healing.”

He stressed that the psychological and human dimension of Gaza is largely absent from international reports, which tend to focus on numbers and material losses. “The human spirit cannot easily be translated into metrics — yet it is the core,” he told me. “Covering trauma requires time, effort, and a high level of professionalism, which fast-paced media coverage often lacks.”

Currently only a handful of mental health counseling centers operate within Gaza, and facilities like Dr. Mohammad's remain limited in number and capacity. When asked about the urgent needs for mental health support in Gaza, he said, “We need flexible, community-based emergency interventions; trained staff; medications; psychosocial support tools; safe spaces for children; and group therapy programs. We also need long-term plans that go beyond ‘temporary relief' and build a vision for community recovery.”

Dr. Mohammad ended our conversation with a message to the international community and global mental health organizations: “You are required now to do more than condemn. Gaza is not only a humanitarian issue — it is a moral, psychological, and cultural one. We ask for real support, urgent trauma response, and genuine investment in building a sustainable mental health system. Do not let the next generations grow up from the ashes of war without healing.”

They face deportation to a Venezuela in crisis amid widespread poverty along with Trump's tariffs and threats of force.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

As tensions between the US and Venezuela were inflamed Wednesday by the Trump administration's deadly attack on a boat off the coast of the South American country, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was ending legal protections for more than a quarter of a million Venezuelans who President Donald Trump had previously shielded from deportation.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) declared that allowing Venezuelan nationals to remain in the US with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was “not in America's best interests,” but the move was swiftly denounced as both cruel and misguided by critics.

The administration had weighed “public safety, national security, migration factors, immigration policy, economic considerations, and foreign policy,” spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said, and urged Venezuelan migrants to “self-deport.” USCIS also said that “conditions in Venezuela no longer meet the TPS statutory requirements.”

More than 250,000 Venezuelans who were granted TPS in 2021 have faced a September 10 expiration date on their status, but the Trump administration had the option to renew their status.

The migrants are not part of a separate group of 350,000 Venezuelans whose TPS status the Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump to revoke in May; those migrants were granted the protections by the Biden administration in 2023.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro declared an “economic emergency” in April, attributing the country's financial struggles to Trump's tariffs. The country has also faced years of economic mismanagement and US sanctions, exacerbating the crisis, and Maduro's government has repressed protests against his controversial reelection in 2024. The UN special rapporteur on the right to food said after a visit to the country earlier this year that nearly 82% of people in Venezuela were living in poverty and more than half had insufficient income to purchase a basic food basket.

Critics on Wednesday noted that the US State Department continues to advise Americans not to travel to Venezuela, saying there is a “high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.”

While Venezuelans “are going hungry and without food and medicine,” said US Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-Fla.), “the Trump Admin. is stripping TPS for Venezuelans in the US and is claiming that conditions in Venezuela are not that bad.”

Andrea Flores, vice president of immigration policy and campaigns at FWD.us, said USCIS did not make clear “how ending TPS for Venezuelans is in the best interest of the United States.”

“Not only is this a mass de-legalization effort, it pushes hundreds of thousands of people out of the workforce,” said Flores. “The economic consequences of the shrinking workforce impacts all of us.”

Ending #TPS for Venezuelans is cruel & undermines our values and economic interests. Venezuela is in a humanitarian crisis. That has not changed. We should be keeping protections in place & build additional legal pathways—not push people further into the shadows. https://t.co/Y4oPd3z4cI

Since taking office, Trump has designated the Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization and has claimed it coordinates with the Maduro government — an assessment rejected by US intelligence agencies. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested about 8,000 Venezuelans in the first half of 2025, and the administration has used the Alien Enemies Act — previously only used in wartime — to expel hundreds of Venezuelans from the US. On Wednesday, a federal court ruled that Trump had illegally invoked the law.

The administration has claimed it is rounding up criminals, but an analysis in June by the libertarian Cato Institute found that 65% of people arrested by ICE had no criminal conviction, and 93% were not convicted for violent crimes.

The administration has also deployed several warships off the coast of Venezuela as he's threatened military force against drug cartels in the country, despite the lack of evidence that cartel activity takes place there. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, just 2% of all cocaine seized by the agency is in Venezuela.

On Wednesday, the administration drew outrage from human rights advocates as it announced it had attacked a boat that it claimed was transporting cocaine and linked to Tren de Aragua, killing 11 people.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, emphasized that the TPS beneficiaries who are now being ordered to “self-deport” or face expulsion “were previously granted deportation protections by Trump himself.”

“Every person under this protection has been vetted at least twice,” he said. “Anyone with any serious offense on their record is ineligible for protections. For the last four years, they've been working legally and paying taxes like everyone else. Now Trump's going to kick them all out.”

“This is a quarter million people whose lives are about to be completely upended,” he added, “for nothing but politics.”

A Russian missile struck a Danish humanitarian demining group in Chernihiv Oblast on Sept. 4, killing two and injuring eight people, the Danish Refugee Council reported.

"It is with profound sadness that the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) confirms that one of our humanitarian demining sites in Ukraine was struck by a missile earlier today. The attack claimed the lives of two Ukrainian colleagues and left eight others injured," the Danish Refugee Council wrote on Facebook.

The nonprofit called the strike a serious violation of the international humanitarian law.

"At the time of the incident, DRC teams were conducting purely civilian humanitarian activities—working to clear landmines and explosive remnants of war in order to protect communities and enable safe access to essential infrastructure, farmland, and homes," the organization wrote.

Ukraine's northern Chernihiv Oblast borders both Russia and Belarus. Part of the region was occupied by Russian forces at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since its liberation in April 2022, Chernihiv Oblast has faced frequent attacks due to its proximity to Russia.

The strike took place in the Kyselivska community, according to Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast.

"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now, they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Chaus wrote on Telegram.

"Another act of senseless terror from the Russian Federation — an attack on those who help eliminate the consequences of the war," he added in another post.

The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, condemned the attack, saying that Russia is once again violating fundamental norms of international law.

"This is yet another cynical crime. Attacking people who are doing humanitarian work means deliberately undermining humanitarian activities. The world should react to this," he said.

As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spanned an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts.

The Danish Refugee Council said it "remains committed to its mission of protecting people affected by conflict and displacement in Ukraine."

"Despite the risks and challenges, our demining teams undertake this vital work to prevent further loss of life from landmines and unexploded ordnance," the nonprofit wrote.

"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the families, friends, and colleagues of those we lost today."

She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs.
Yuliia holds B.A. degree in English language and literature from Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University, she studied in Germany and Lithuania.

A Ukrainian citizen was among those killed in a funicular accident in Lisbon, Portugal, on Sept. 3, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to Hromadske.

"Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit.





"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast, wrote.

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

            Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced his resignation Thursday as the university faces an ongoing funding freeze by the Trump administration.
    


            His departure is the latest in a string of university leaders' resignations, following tenures marked by criticism and battles with the federal government.
    


            “As I reflect on the progress we have made and what lies ahead, I believe now is the right time for new leadership to guide Northwestern into its next chapter,” Schill said in a message to the campus community.



            “Therefore, I have decided, in consultation with the leadership of the Board of Trustees, that I will step down as President.”
    


            In his message, Schill wrote the university faced “serious and often painful challenges” since his tenure began in September 2022, and “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.”
    


            The university noted those challenges include the federal funding freeze, which began about four months ago when the Trump administration froze $790 million in federal funding.
    


            The freeze added to similar actions the administration has taken against other elite universities, either demanding changes to their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or in connection with their handling of protests against the war in Gaza.
    


            At the time, a White House official told CNN the freeze was connected to several Title VI investigations. The federal statute prohibits discrimination in programs and activities that receive federal funding.

            But the university said it had “fully cooperated with investigations by both the Department of Education and Congress.”
    


            White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Thursday, “The Trump Administration looks forward to working with the new leadership, and we hope they seize this opportunity to Make Northwestern Great Again.”
    


            House Republican Leadership Chairwoman Elise Stefanik said Schill's resignation was “long overdue.”
    


            “President Michael Schill finally resigned today after he failed (to) protect Jewish students, caved to the demands of the antisemitic, pro-Hamas mob on Northwestern's campus, and failed to hold students who perpetuate antisemitic attacks accountable at an Education and the Workforce Committee hearing,” she said in a post on X.
    


            The university said it has updated its policies to curb antisemitism on its campuses, resulting in a “dramatic decrease” in reported incidents, according to a news release Thursday.
    


            The revocation of funding has left universities desperate to keep much-needed funding.  It has also prompted lengthy legal battles between the Trump administration and universities, and led several university leaders to step down, including at the University of Virginia and Columbia University.
    


            Schill's resignation comes a day after a federal judge gave Harvard University a landmark victory in its fight against the Trump administration, siding with the Ivy League school in its effort to restore more than $2 billion in federal funding for research frozen by the White House.
    


            Northwestern had said the federal funds were used for “innovative and life-saving research,” including the development of the world's smallest pacemaker and research to fight against Alzheimer's disease.



            “This type of research is now at jeopardy,” the university said in an April statement.
    


            Schill had been leading “efforts to ensure the continuation of funding for critical research” during the funding freeze, the university said, and he will continue to work with its Board of Trustees to get them restored.
    


            “It is critical that we continue to protect the university's research mission and excellence while preserving academic freedom, integrity, and independence,” Schill said.
    


            An interim president for Northwestern has yet to be named and Schill will continue in his role until then, the university said. Following a sabbatical, Schill plans to return as a faculty member at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.

PARIS, September 4. /TASS/. A total of 26 countries in the so-called Coalition of the Willing have confirmed their readiness to send military contingents to Ukraine once a ceasefire or peace agreement is established, French President Emmanuel Macron said at a press conference following coalition talks in Paris.

"Today, 26 countries have officially committed to deploying troops to Ukraine in a support capacity or to ensuring their presence on land, at sea or in the air to provide this support on Ukrainian territory when a ceasefire or peace agreement is reached," Macron said. He added that "several other countries are still considering their position," noting that a total of 35 participants attended the meeting.

In response to a follow-up question, Macron declined to reveal even the approximate size of the international contingent that the coalition plans to deploy in Ukraine, saying he did not want to "reveal its cards" to Russia. He nevertheless assured that chiefs of staff already have concrete plans and are discussing them through confidential channels.

When asked whether Germany, Italy, and Poland were among the countries that had agreed to send troops, Macron replied only that they had "confirmed their contribution to the training of Ukrainian troops or their participation in operations on land, at sea, or in the air."

According to Macron, the formation of a military contingent on Ukrainian territory "is not intended to wage war against Russia;" rather, the forces must "guarantee peace and send a clear strategic message." He stressed that they would not be deployed on the front line, but in designated areas still under consideration. "Following this summit, we have decided to begin political and legal work on providing these security guarantees with the coalition countries and Ukraine," he added.

On August 30, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Coalition of the Willing is attempting to undermine progress made in the Ukrainian settlement following Russian-US talks. Earlier, in an interview with NBC News, Lavrov also said that providing security guarantees for Ukraine through "foreign military intervention in some part of Ukrainian territory" would be unacceptable for Russia.

Currently, all states require schoolchildren to receive vaccines against polio, measles, and other diseases.

This week, Florida's surgeon general announced that the state will drop all vaccine requirements, a catastrophic decision that could help usher in epidemics of diseases, like polio, that have been virtually eradicated by vaccines.

Currently, all states, including Florida, require children who attend public school to receive vaccines against measles, rubella, polio, whooping cough, and other diseases. 

“People have a right to make their own decisions,” Joseph Ladapo, the state's surgeon general, said on Wednesday. Ladapo is a virulent opponent of reproductive rights. Earlier this year, he threatened to file criminal charges against television stations if they ran an ad about abortion rights.

“Who am I, as a government or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body?” he continued. “Our body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”

Ladapo did not say when the requirement will be repealed. 

“I love our lawmakers. They're going to have to make decisions,” he said. “People are going to have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that the moral side is so simple.”

Critics charge that Ladapo's position is anything but moral. Dropping vaccine requirements may cause deadly outbreaks of diseases that are entirely preventable, like measles and polio. According to a 2024 study published in The Lancet, vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives since 1974, 95 percent of whom were children younger than five. Researchers found that in 2024, a child younger than 10 is 40 percent more likely to survive to their next birthday relative to a hypothetical scenario of no vaccination. 

Florida Democratic lawmakers condemned the plan. 

“Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child,” Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman said in a statement. “Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs.”

Public health experts also warned of the plan's potentially deadly consequences. 

“The AMA [American Medical Association] strongly opposes Florida's plan to end all vaccine mandates, including those required for school attendance… and urge[s] Florida to reconsider,” the group said in a statement. “This unprecedented rollback would undermine decades of public health progress and place children and communities at increased risk.”

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told The Guardian, “Florida's undertakers will now need to plan for the future by increasing their stocks of small coffins.”

Anti-vaccine activists have long been a loud and destructive minority, but under Trump, their lies have reached an unprecedented level of influence on public policy. Trump nominated, and Congress confirmed, prominent anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

Prior to Kennedy's confirmation, the Union of Concerned Scientists urged Congress to reject him, calling him a “dangerous and irresponsible pick for the federal agency charged with protecting the health of the American people,” and noting that he was “an environmental lawyer with no training in medicine or public health.”

Just a few months into his tenure, Kennedy has already sabotaged the availability and development of vaccines, and undermined the public's confidence in them. In June, he removed all members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory panel. He chose eight replacements, several of whom have spread misinformation about vaccines. 

Today, Kennedy is testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on the recent firing of CDC director, Susan Monarez, which prompted three agency officials to resign in protest. Monarez wrote in an OpEd published in The Wall Street Journal, that she was told to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed anti-vaccine rhetoric.”

In his opening remarks, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) urged Kennedy to resign, saying that Trump should fire him if he refuses.

Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a lawmaker who monitors human rights abuses abroad, said that the off-the-cuff exchange—and the casual way organ transplants came up—was unsettling.

“It shows how cruelty knows no bounds,” Smith told The Epoch Times.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, while walking together before a military parade on Sept. 3, discussed becoming younger with continued organ transplants. Xi suggested the possibility of living to 150 years old in this century.

The conversation signals a seeming abundance of organs for China's top political echelon, known for extravagant privileges inaccessible to the Chinese public. How and where to source the organs seemed an afterthought.

That Beijing has no desire for the publicity of the conversation was clear. Chinese media outlets have taken down videos containing the clip or covered the sound with music in replays.

But Putin confirmed the talk quickly later in the day.

“The modern means of health support, medicine, even some surgeries involving organ transplantation, allow humanity to hope that the active life span will not be like today,” he told reporters, adding that “it differs from country to country.”

What came across in these remarks seems to be, “I don't care,” according to Smith.

“My own argument has been that from Xi Jinping on down, anybody in the higher echelon, especially in the Chinese Communist Party, will look to steal somebody else's internal organs, through coercion, through death, to extend their life. I can't think of a more selfish and barbaric act to do that,” Smith said.

“They're so brazen about abusing other people for their own will and for their own longevity. ... They have secret police and the ability to jail anybody they want.”

Putin, the congressman said, “may or may not be in ill health, so he'll want to have any new organ that he thinks he requires.”

The organ transplant industry has since experienced a boom, paralleling the persecution of Falun Gong that began in 1999. Hospitals in China have advertised waiting times as short as days, a major draw for tourists from countries such as the United States with developed organ donation systems, where getting an organ could take much longer.

“[In China,] they go and they kill somebody who matches up with your antigens and everything else, so that there's no or less likely to be a rejection of the organ,” Smith said. “I've never seen anything like it, except in Nazi Germany, and I think that's what we're talking about here—it's Nazi like.”

The “most perverse thing,” he said, is that the persecutors will turn to the persecuted to help extend their lives. And Falun Gong practitioners' healthy lifestyle—meditating, not smoking or drinking, and adhering to their practice's moral tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance—makes them an ideal target for organ procurement.

“It's a genocide against the Falun Gong, like it's a genocide against the Uyghurs,” he said. “There are so many horrible human rights abuses in the world today. This is right at the top.”

In China, doctors could become an “oppressor,” stealing one's organs under state order, he said.

Smith, likewise, called for the Senate to “act fast” and move the bill up.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is facing a gas shortage, The Moscow Times reported on Sept. 4.

The statement comes after a months-long Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in an attempt to put economic pressure on Russia and undermine its ability to finance its war against Ukraine. 

Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sept. 4, Putin said that signs of gas shortages are already visible in the Russian Far East. He said that supplying new enterprises can be challenging, and demand for gas is expected to rise significantly in the Far Eastern Federal District in the coming years.

He didn't mention the reasons behind a potential shortage. 

Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.

According to the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Kremlin has 63.4 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves, enough for 100 years of production. In 2020, the Accounts Chamber of Russia estimated that the country's reserves made up 20% of the world's total but warned that they would only last 50 years.

Ukraine has targeted dozens of refineries, oil depots, and military-industrial sites with long-range drones since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 to disrupt Moscow's war effort. 

Kyiv has increased the attacks recently ahead of potential peace talks following U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15 and with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington on Aug. 18.

The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

One sheriff calls surprise use of deputy email list offering $50,000 hiring bonus ‘unprofessional and unethical'

The White House's aggressive push to hire federal immigration agents is causing friction with local sheriffs – even those who back Donald Trump's deportation agenda.

More than a dozen US sheriffs and law enforcement associations have complained that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tried to poach local deputies and officers as Ice rapidly expands.

“It is unprofessional and unethical,” Grady Judd, the sheriff in Polk county, Florida, told the Guardian last month after his deputies received recruitment emails from Ice.

Ice utilized an email list the sheriff had provided as part of his partnership supporting Trump's deportations; the messages noted recruits could receive a $50,000 hiring bonus.

“It's tantamount to us going to police departments and putting up a recruiting booth in their lobby,” said Judd, a Republican who has authorized his deputies to carry out immigration arrests.

Judd and other sheriffs have spoken out as the Trump administration has launched its massive recruitment effort to hire 10,000 new Ice officers and 3,000 border patrol agents, backed by an unprecedented $170bn in funding for immigration enforcement activities.

The anger from conservative sheriffs, generally Trump's close allies, underscores the challenges the White House is facing as it makes deportations and the expansion of Ice a top priority, sometimes at the expense of other law enforcement interests.

Federal agents who would normally handle child abuse, money laundering, fraud and other serious crimes have been diverted to immigration enforcement, targeting undocumented people with civil violations, Reuters reported in March.

Last month, the administration moved to temporarily reassign more than 100 FBI agents to conduct nighttime patrols in Washington DC, even though FBI officers generally have little experience or training in patrolling or immigration.

The backlash from Judd and other sheriffs in Florida was notable as the state has led the nation in 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement departments to directly assist Ice. Immigrant rights' groups have long criticized those partnerships as harmful to public safety, as they make immigrant communities less likely to report crimes or assist police in investigations.

Some of the most vocally Trump-supporting sheriffs have criticized Ice's recruitment. Wayne Ivey, the sheriff in Brevard county, Florida – who made headlines in June for threatening to hospitalize and “kill” anti-Ice protesters – told WESH 2 News last month that Ice's targeting of local deputies was “backhanded” and “frustrated every sheriff”.

Judd said his department was paying for deputies to be trained as immigration officers, allowing them to arrest and jail undocumented people for Ice. That arrangement gave Ice access to his deputies' contact information.

“You took government documents that we filled out to help you, to recruit our people that we trained on our dime to support you. That's low-rent,” he said. “I've never seen that before.”

Recruitment emails to sheriff's deputies were signed by Madison Sheahan, Ice's deputy director, who previously served as an aide to Kristi Noem, homeland security secretary, when Noem was South Dakota governor, ABC News reported. Sheahan, 28, has no prior immigration enforcement experience and has alienated career officials within Ice, according to a recent Atlantic story delving into internal conflicts at the agency.

“As someone who is currently supporting Ice through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law,” Sheahan's recruitment email said. “Ice is actively recruiting officers like you.”

Judd said Ice representatives in Florida weren't involved in the recruitment and had apologized. He blamed Sheahan, saying she and her DC colleagues did not acknowledge the misstep: “They doubled down. They didn't apologize. They didn't say it was bad form. That made me even more angry. It just shows her lack of maturity,” he said. “The illustration to me is they're probably sneaky and underhanded and not professional with the way they run the rest of the organization.”

Still, Judd said, “We're not going to back down on President Trump's mission. We'll continue to help Ice, because we are professional, unlike the Ice deputy.”

In the first five months of the year, Judd's office detained more than 200 undocumented people for Ice in the county's jails, according to the Ledger newspaper.

The National Sheriffs' Association, which represents sheriffs across the country, also raised concerns about Ice recruitment. The association's executive director said last month it would be hard for local departments to compete with the $50,000 bonus and other incentives, which could burden agencies already struggling with staffing.

Judd, however, said he wasn't concerned about his deputies joining Ice. He said he suspected ongoing anti-Ice protests were hampering recruitment: “It's a very difficult and dangerous job … and you've got to be comfortable and sure that the community supports you. When people see the way that Ice is being unfairly targeted, even if they want to be in law enforcement, they don't want to be in that branch.”

Scott Shuchart, a former senior Ice official under Biden, who has raised concerns about Trump recruitment spree, said it seemed “really disrespectful” to poach from sheriffs who have invested their own funding to support Ice through 287(g) agreements: “They're already taking sheriff's deputies who are supposed to be keeping the community safe and instead are helping out Ice. To now do the double whammy of stealing those resources to be fully Ice's seems like no way to treat a partner.”

On Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security announced a program to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for the salaries of trained 287(g) officers and said departments would be “eligible for monetary performance awards based on the successful location of illegal aliens”.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement that Ice was recruiting “local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience”. More than $500m from Trump's major budget bill would go toward expanding 287(g) partnerships, she added.

McLaughlin also said Sheahan, the Ice deputy director, had law enforcement experience from her previous job as secretary of the Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries, and had been “instrumental in leading negotiations” for more than 900 287(g) agreements: “These attacks on Madison Sheahan's leadership style have no basis in reality and are rooted in sexism. [She] is a work horse, strong executor, and accountable leader who along with [acting Ice director] Todd Lyons is leading the men and women of Ice law enforcement to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens.”

The effort to recruit sheriffs “shows how both cruel and reckless this administration is when it comes to law enforcement”, added Juan Cuba, executive director of Sheriff Accountability Action, a group that advocates for criminal justice reforms.

“It's a complete disregard for one of the biggest issues local law enforcement has, which is recruitment and retention. Those challenges are exacerbated by the administration's approach, but they don't care. What they care about is hitting these artificial quotas,” he said, noting Trump's demands for 3,000 immigration arrests a day. “It's less about public safety and more about just feeding this mass deportation machine.”

Some sheriffs do oppose efforts to have their deputies act as immigration officers, because they already feel stretched thin or are concerned about eroding public trust, Cuba noted. But publicly objecting can carry consequences, he said, noting that after Broward county's sheriff said he didn't want deputies arresting people for civil immigration violations, Florida's attorney general threatened to take steps to have him removed from office.

“We see silence from police chiefs and sheriffs because of political threats,” he said. “It is very alarming that public officials feel like they can't raise concerns.”

Former Senate leader likens administration's fixation with tariffs to isolationist policies of the US in the 1930s

US politics live – latest updates

The world during Donald Trump's second presidency has entered a period of danger with “certain similarities to the 30s”, according to Mitch McConnell, the veteran Republican former Senate leader.

McConnell made the comments primarily in reference to tariffs and foreign affairs, in a wide-ranging interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader published on Wednesday as he prepares to enter his final year in office.

Calling it “the most dangerous period since before world war two”, McConnell was openly critical of the Trump administration's fixation with trade tariffs, which he likened to the isolationist policies of the US in the 1930s that historians say hastened a global depression that paved the path to conflict.

But while decrying the lack of US preparedness to confront authoritarian regimes abroad, the 83-year-old McConnell – a senator since 1985 and leader of Republicans in the chamber for a record 18 years until he stood down earlier this year, then announced his upcoming retirement – did not discuss the Trump administration's own moves towards authoritarianism.

He also glossed over his own responsibility for handing Trump so much power. As majority leader, McConnell maneuvered to deny Barack Obama a rightful supreme court pick, and rushed to give Trump another in the final weeks of his first term in 2020. It made McConnell the architect of the current ultraconservative 6-3 majority on a panel that critics say has been overly loyal to Trump, not least last year's astonishing ruling giving him immunity for criminal acts.

In the interview, McConnell said he had been focusing on “defense and foreign policy” in the months since returning to the Senate's back benches, and had become worried about the direction he believed Trump's “make America great again” (Maga) trade policies were leading the world.

“I think this is the most dangerous period since before world war two. There's certain similarities right now to the 30s,” he said.

“[Then president] Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill in 1930, widely believed by historians and economists to have taken the depression worldwide. Those who were totally anxious to stay out of all of what was going on in Europe were called ‘America First'. Sound familiar?

“So what do we have today? North Korea, China, Russia, Iran and Iran's proxies. They're very different kinds of countries, but they have one thing in common: They hate us.”

The interview was conducted before this week's gathering in Beijing of world leaders largely hostile to the US, a meeting of authoritarians including Russia's Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong-un that some analysts see as an unprecedented redrawing of the global balance of power.

McConnell, however, believes the US should already have been readying itself to meet the challenges posed by the rise of autocrats in other nations, but had not done so. He cited, indirectly, Trump's failure to handle effectively Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war, now well into its fourth year, on Nato's border.

“When you talk about preparedness, we're not prepared like we should be,” he said.

“With regard to Ukraine, what we need to do is avoid the headline at the end of the war, ‘Russia wins, America loses.' It has huge worldwide implications.”

But he said he also saw financial benefits for the US in committing more than $130bn in support for Ukraine's military defense and humanitarian aid, while Trump has flip-flopped on the issue.

“For those who are concerned about the money, I think it's important to remember that about half of the money was spent in this country, including in Kentucky, [with] 38 states modernizing our own industrial bases,” McConnell said.

“We've sent older weapons to Ukraine.”

After leaving office in 2021, Trump told a donors' conference that McConnell was “a dumb son of a bitch”, and had previously nicknamed him “Old Crow”. In the Herald-Leader interview, McConnell rejected the opportunity to fire back.

“My own view about the leader job, whether you're the president or the leader of one of the parties, is the Ronald Reagan quote that I thought made the most sense. He had what he called the 11th commandment: ‘Do not speak ill of another Republican,'” he said.

Yet McConnell did appear sensitive to a suggestion he was standing down because he had grown unpopular in Kentucky, amplified by the hostility of Nate Morris, the Republican businessman and Trump ultra-loyalist tipped to succeed him as senator. “I'm a Trump guy, not a McConnell boy,” Morris has said.

McConnell said his record spoke for him. “These suggestions about who's popular and who isn't irritate the hell out of me, because when you get into the leadership position, you get beat up,” he said.

“How do you judge popularity? Seven victories in Kentucky, nine victories in the [Senate Republican] conference.”

Asked what he thought his legacy would be, McConnell said he was most proud of the 2004 Kentucky tobacco buyout, which paid the state's farmers to abandon their crops. “At the federal level it would be the courts,” he added.

He declined an invitation to say whether he thought the US was in a better position now than before the Trump era. “I'm not sure enough time has passed to start evaluating who made a difference and who didn't,” he said.

But he added he had “thought a good bit” about whether people would think he had. “I would like everybody to be able to say, you know, I actually had an impact in a positive way on the country.”

Italian man fell down vertical shaft in ice after body of another missing recovered near glacier on Monday

A researcher from Italy is missing after falling into a stream on Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier – after the body of another man, a hiker from Arizona, was found earlier this week off a trail near the glacier, authorities said.

According to the state department of public safety, Alaska wildlife troopers received a report on Tuesday that a man had gone missing after falling into a stream on the glacier and being pushed by the water into a small, vertical shaft in the ice known as a moulin. The man, whose name was not immediately released, was with two other people when he fell. He was conducting research on the glacier at the time, a department spokesperson, Tess Williams, said by email on Wednesday.

A local ice rescue team responded but found the roughly 2ft (0.6-meter) wide hole was filled with rushing water and determined that efforts to find the man would be too dangerous, the department of public safety said.

The glacier – part of the vast Juneau Icefield – is a popular destination for residents and cruise ship passengers, though many tourists view it from across Mendenhall Lake, within a more developed area of the Mendenhall Glacier recreation area that includes a visitor center. The glacier is about 13 miles from downtown Juneau.

Also this week, on Monday, searchers using cellphone location data found the body of Thomas Casey, 69, off a trail near the glacier, according to the department. Casey had last been seen on Saturday morning and was believed to have died from injuries from a fall. Juneau police had said that Casey was in the city for the summer.

In July, a Kentucky woman visiting Juneau on a cruise ship was found dead on the mountains near downtown after she failed to return from a hike.

A thousand years ago, a play of mine – a comedy – was being produced in a small university town in Illinois. We were working on a short scene where a long estranged Indigenous father is talking with his daughter about how the rules of family can sometimes not have happy endings. 

“I understand. It's not like the way it is in the movies, is it?” the daughter asks. 

“No,” he replies, “Graham Greene isn't here.”

As we worked on the scene, I heard the dramaturge say quietly to the director regarding the line, “What is it with Canadian Indigenous people and that British novelist?!”

Yes, there was a time not that long ago when Graham Greene wasn't as well-known as he is today. These days, in many corners of the world, he's much more familiar than that British guy who wrote Our Man in Havana and The Quiet American.

An Oneida of the Six Nations Reserve in Southern Ontario, Greene was an actor who spanned many mediums and genres of the storytelling venues. He was a movie star, a television performer and an accomplished theatre artist. Before all that, he sampled the world as a welder, draftsman, steelworker and an audio technician before being urged to try acting and finding his true home.

My life and his intertwined many times in the previous century. For a period in the 1980s, he was the executive director of the Association for the Native Development of the Performing and Visual Arts, a Toronto-based Indigenous arts support service. On occasion I would find myself sleeping on their boardroom floor when I was between apartments.

Another time I went out for a beer with him, and we found ourselves at a bar, sitting with the remaining original members of the Byrds, who were performing in a concert hall nearby. That could only happen with Greene. He could talk to a garden full of marble statues and get stories out of them. 

Another time, I was the writer-in-residence for a theatre company named Native Earth Performing Arts, I was attending the rehearsal of a little play called Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing written by Tomson Highway. It was there I saw Greene in his full glory, strutting the stage as Pierre St. Pierre, a role that many would argue put Greene on the map. 

He was also a mainstay on television, in shows such as Reservation Dogs, on which he played Maximus.Shane Brown/The Associated Press

The play is seldom produced these days for several reasons, but his portrayal of that lovable drunk and hockey referee told me what a true actor can achieve. He would disappear into the character, creating unique elements that helped construct the persona he morphed into.

And if I remember correctly, many of the actors had to take a few hours off rehearsal one afternoon, as there was a major film company in town holding auditions for a movie. It was some Kevin Costner film. A Western called Dances with Wolves. The rest, as they say, is history. 

With Greene's portrayal of Kicking Bird, and the subsequent Oscar nomination, his life changed. 

But Greene never gave up theatre, working in such groundbreaking Canadian plays as The Crackwalker and The History of the Village of the Small Huts. More recently, he strode the stage at Stratford, where he lived for the last few decades of his life. There, he is remembered for his outstanding performances in Of Mice and Men, and of course as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. 

But perhaps it was his work in film that cemented his popularity in the consciousness of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Movies including Clearcut, Twilight, Maverick, The Green Mile, Pow Wow Highway and Thunderheart showed fans the diversity and complexity of Greene's acting, and of Indigenous characters in general. All of this at a time when Indigenous people were not commonly seen on the big screen.

For the most part, westerns, the main films that depicted Indigenous characters, were dead and sometimes it seemed there were no Indigenous people in the modern world. Many credit Greene with opening doors for other Indigenous actors, writers and directors, showing them how to storm the world of settler cinema.

It's important to note it wasn't just Indigenous-themed movies that he excelled in. For many Indigenous actors, it's frequently a great delight to play non-Indigenous actors. Greene was no different. In fact, it could be said a good portion of society would more than likely recognize him from many of his more mainstream appearances, such as Die Hard with a Vengeance and Transamerica.

He was also a mainstay on television, playing such a broad spectrum of characters, in shows such as The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon, Northern Exposure, The Red Green Show, Longmire, The Last of Us and Reservation Dogs. In fact, I believe I first met him on the set of a 13-part children's series that was shot three hours north of Thunder Bay, called Spirit Bay. It was 1985, and I was a young production assistant immediately captivated by his amazing and constant sense of humour. 

An absurd joke of his or a simple wry comment was better than a strong cup of coffee to start the day. 

Once I ran into him in Toronto as we were walking into Harbourfront. Very casually, he reached into his pocket and pulled out three colourful marbles that he rolled around in his hand. Very dryly, he said, “Contrary to popular rumour, I still have them.” It took me a moment for it to sink in, then I laughed.

In 1991, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing was being remounted at the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and I flew out to see it. Greene was recreating his role of Pierre St. Pierre. I was backstage before the show, congratulating everyone when I heard Greene's voice calling out to me. I turned to see him in full costume, including a furry hat with ear flaps. “Drew! Drew! What do you think?” 

With that, he produced a look of shock and dismay, at the same time pulling a string in his pocket making the ears of the hat pop up like a curious dog. It was pure Graham. 

Whether the joke was cheap or sophisticated, Greene didn't care. It was the destination, not the journey.

Tom King, the renowned author and friend of Greene, perhaps put it best: “We were in Calgary filming Medicine River. There was a guy who had come from Toronto to interview Graham about the movie. He caught Graham after a long hard day of filming and began asking him a bunch of inane questions. Towards the end, he asked Graham what was his most embarrassing moment and Graham smiled and said it was talking to him. He didn't suffer fools. He ate them.”

An icon has passed. I know that's said frequently about a lot of people who have moved on but to us who have circled in his orbit, it's true. To many, he was the consummate actor. The good friend. The passable golfer. The owner (with his partner Hilary) of many cats. 

Thank you, Graham, for doing all that you did. And allowing us to join the ride.

Canada needs to unite its domestic and foreign policy focus and orient it toward amassing economic and political power.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jeff Mahon is director of geopolitical and international business advisory at consulting firm StrategyCorp.

Welcome to the age of perplexity. Canada's decision to unilaterally drop retaliatory tariffs against the United States has left Canadians confused as to what the strategy is for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and our place in the broader world.

The reality is Canada had few other options in dealing with a much more powerful country that throws its weight around to get what it wants. Our initial response to Mr. Trump's tariffs followed an outdated playbook. As his resolve hardened and extended beyond Canada, it became clear that his trade attacks on our country were only the beginning of a much larger project.

To advance its domestic and international agenda, the U.S. is pursuing a policy that maximizes power by exploiting its centrality in global economic and security affairs. 

Canada is in an unenviable position where trade dependence makes us susceptible to economic coercion. Removing our countertariffs is only the latest attempt to secure much needed market access through concessions. As part of economic and security negotiations with the U.S., Ottawa is systematically and quietly aligning its policy with Mr. Trump's agenda, including on matters of border security, digital governance and steel. 

Carney says he spoke with Trump, expects ‘small agreements' on tariff relief for some sectors

However, the extent and limits of this policy alignment have yet to be determined. Canada's de facto sovereignty is at risk – its ability to freely exercise foreign, security and economic policy.

The only antidote is to rapidly build Canada's own power through domestic economic development and a network of complementary relations with other countries. To get clarity on the opportunities and constraints, we must recognize that we've entered a new geopolitical era, that of the economic security regime. 

A new set of principles and norms are quickly superseding the neo-liberal, rules-based international order. Bilateral agreements are trumping multilateralism, as evidenced by governments around the world signing onto lopsided agreements with the U.S. These deals also undermine the old rationale where issues of economics, security and foreign policy are self-contained in separate technocratic tracks. Mr. Trump's deals eschew this maxim, as he uses U.S. power to force multidimensional concessions. 

The new economic security regime is not merely a product of Mr. Trump's rise. Rather, political actors surf the contingencies created by the tidal waves of history. The President capitalized on the discontent wrought by globalization, identified the tension between inert policies and the changing world they're meant to govern, and is now changing the course of not only the U.S., but the world at large. 

Geopolitical orders are essentially constructions shored up by the system's most powerful countries. Rival powers, such as China, can and do emerge by exploiting loopholes and attention or enforcement vacuums. Throughout history, there has been an interplay between hegemonic powers that employ what are essentially variants of liberal policies, and rivals that seek advantage through mercantilism. At some point, the leading power reckons that a liberal economic policy no longer suits its interests and then reneges.

Canada's tariff revenue surges – but nowhere close to Ottawa's projections

The U.S. under Mr. Trump has determined that the costs of both its open economic policy and international security blanket are no longer worth the benefits. It is shirking status quo commitments and redefining its terms of international engagement. The rest of the world is at the same time realizing the intrinsic risks of a system whose dense interconnectivity relies on Washington to keep its promises, rather than the illusion of the universality of neo-liberal principles. 

The world is now in a transitory period with no clear leader. There is a global struggle over the economic vectors of power: productive investment, technological innovation, jobs and market access. Many of Mr. Trump's policy actions, both domestic and international, seek to maximize U.S. power using these elements. This is where the Canadian government's policy priorities should also lie. 

Canada needs to unite its domestic and foreign policy focus and orient it toward amassing economic and political power. Some early indications from Prime Minister Mark Carney's government suggests he understands this. 

His “Building Canada Strong” agenda seeks to channel the nationalist momentum catalyzed by Mr. Trump and correct for past neglect with respect to Canada's economic power – particularly in those sectors positioned to lead diversification efforts. Trade-enabling infrastructure, energy and natural resources are poised to benefit from the government's push to advance projects of national interest as outlined by Bill C-5. 

It's important to create a single window system and to fast-track approvals, but it won't be enough to drive investment and job growth. Canada must rapidly improve the investment climate to incentivize the development of large and small projects. Mr. Carney has called on his administration to have a disciplined focus and be open to new approaches to governing. Ministers and departmental officials should respond by working with business and labour to forge a new industrial policy compact.

Opinion: Canada's trade strategy suffers from delusions of friendship

Internationally, the government must gear trade policy toward managing market access to maximize investment and jobs. This means shedding the dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism. Along this spectrum, a new dimension is unfolding where there is a mix of open, closed and restricted-access sectors. 

Take steel for example: In an attempt to secure U.S. access, the government is effectively committing to a common Canada-U.S. steel market. Such a doctrine could also apply to China, as reconciling that trade dispute will require granting more certainty to Chinese enterprises, regardless of whether it's welcome or under what conditions. This must be based on an honest assessment of where engagement with China either aids or undermines Canadian economic interests. 

Despite having a network of free-trade agreements spanning the globe, Canada's trade with key markets doesn't live up to its potential because many Canadian companies manufacture products geared toward the North American market. For example, exporting to the European Union may require companies to retool their operations to meet EU regulations and product standards. The government could consider a tax rebate for capital expenditures on products that meet EU standards, at once spurring business investment and trade diversification.

We also need to leverage existing strengths to find creative ways to amass power and influence abroad. While the government has come around to the idea of making Canada an energy superpower, we should recognize that we're already an agricultural superpower and integrate this into foreign policy. Agriculture can help build inroads into the Indo-Pacific – an aggressive push to secure sector-specific market agreements under the guise of food security would benefit both Canada and the region.

The new economic security regime has emerged from an old order that Canada helped build and used to benefit from. While the new world order isn't conducive to the world we want to live in – it is the one that Canada must come to terms with.

French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrive to chair the Coalition of the Willing Summit at Elysée presidential palace in Paris, on Thursday.LUDOVIC MARIN/Reuters

Twenty-six nations have pledged to provide postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, which will include an international force on land, sea and in the air, French President Emmanuel Macron said after a summit meeting of Kyiv's allies on Thursday.

Macron said he, fellow European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a call with U.S. President Donald Trump after their summit and U.S. contributions to the guarantees would be finalized in the coming days.

The meeting of 35 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” - of mainly European countries - was intended to finalize security guarantees and ask Trump for the backing that Europeans say is vital to make such guarantees viable.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who joined the meeting virtually, said Ottawa is willing to deploy “direct and scalable military assistance” in a post-ceasefire Ukraine, according to his office.

Security guarantees are intended to reassure Ukraine and deter Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, from attacking its neighbour again.

“The day the conflict stops, the security guarantees will be deployed,” Macron told a news conference at the Elysée Palace in Paris, standing alongside Zelensky.

European officials say peace looks a distant prospect for now but they want to be ready whenever the war ends. They also see the planning of security guarantees as a way to reassure Kyiv of their support and hope Trump will join their efforts.

Macron initially said the 26 nations - which he did not name - would deploy to Ukraine. But he later said some countries would provide guarantees while remaining outside Ukraine, for example by helping to train and equip Kyiv's forces.

He did not say how many troops would be involved in the guarantees.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that 26 of Ukraine's allies have pledged to deploy troops as a “reassurance force” for the war-torn country once fighting ends in the conflict with Russia.

The Associated Press

Germany and other countries pledged they would be involved in that effort. But Berlin said it would decide on a military commitment only when conditions were clear, including the extent of U.S. involvement in security guarantees.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made clear she would not send troops to Ukraine but said Italy was open to monitoring a ceasefire and training Ukrainian troops outside the country.

France and Britain, which co-chair the coalition of the willing, have indicated they are open to deploying troops to Ukraine after the war ends.

“We are working out which countries will take part in which security component,” Zelensky said.

“Twenty-six countries agreed to provide security guarantees. Today, for the first time in a long time, this is the first such serious, very specific substance.”

On his call with the coalition leaders, Trump said Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that he said is helping Moscow fund its war against Ukraine, a White House official said.

“The president also emphasized that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia's war efforts,” the official said.

Macron said the coalition and the United States had agreed to work more closely on future sanctions, notably on Russia's oil and gas sector, and on China.

Bulgaria's Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov said his country has no plans to send troops to Ukraine, but that it is willing to contribute to the naval efforts in the Black Sea such as demining.

“We will stay within maritime domain,” Zhelyazkov said in Sofia after meeting Antonio Costa, the head of the European Council.

Bulgaria also wants to form a regional security alliance with neighbouring Romania and Turkey, he said.

European governments have said European forces in Ukraine would need their own U.S. security guarantees as a “backstop”. Trump has made no explicit commitment to go that far.

His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met French, British, German, Italian and Ukrainian senior diplomats ahead of the summit, before briefly attending the opening session.

European officials also wanted to highlight a lack of progress toward direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky since Trump hosted Putin in August, and to prod Trump to raise pressure on Moscow now.

Having rolled out the red carpet in Alaska, Trump on Wednesday accused Putin of conspiring with China and North Korea after the three countries' leaders staged a show of unity in Beijing at a lavish commemoration of the end of World War Two.

Putin told Kyiv on Wednesday there was a chance to end the war in Ukraine via negotiations “if common sense prevails”, an option he said he preferred, although he was ready to end it by force if that was the only way.

Putin also ruled out the deployment of troops from NATO nations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. But NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte dismissed his objections.

“Why are we interested in what Russia thinks about troops in Ukraine? It's a sovereign country,” he said at a conference in Prague before joining the Paris summit by video link.

“Russia has nothing to do with this,” he said. “I think we really have to stop making Putin too powerful.”

People look at the Elevador da Gloria streetcar which derailed and crashed in Lisbon, on Thursday.Armando Franca/The Associated Press

Two Canadians are believed to have been killed after a popular streetcar attraction crashed in Lisbon on Wednesday, killing 16 people, a Portuguese official says.

Luis Neves, Portugal's judicial police chief, said there was a “high degree of certainty” that there are two Canadians, one Ukrainian and one German among the dead, although the identities could not yet be officially confirmed.

A U.S. citizen was also killed in the crash, the State Department said in a statement.

Global Affairs Canada said Wednesday afternoon that it is aware of two missing Canadian citizens.

Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather more information, said spokesperson Thida Ith in an e-mailed statement Thursday.

She said no further information can be disclosed because of privacy considerations, including the name of the two missing Canadians.

One Canadian national was among the 21 injured, the head of Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency Margarida Castro Martins told reporters.

On Thursday, investigators sifted through the wreckage of the streetcar in downtown Lisbon, trying to determine why the popular tourist attraction derailed during the busy summer season.

Prime Minister Mark Carney posted on X about the incident Thursday morning, before the statement was released by Global Affairs.

“My thoughts are with the people of Lisbon following last night's tragic accident,” he said. “Canadians are wishing comfort and support to those grieving loved ones, and a swift recovery to everyone who was injured.”

Portugal's attorney-general's office said eight victims have been identified so far: five Portuguese, two South Koreans and a Swiss person.

The injured include men and women between the ages of 24 and 65, and a 3-year-old child, Castro Martins said. Among them are Portuguese people as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from France, Italy, Switzerland, Morocco, South Korea and Cape Verde, in addition to the Canadian, she said.

The nationalities appeared to confirm suspicions that the Elevador da Gloria was packed with tourists as well as locals when it came off its rails during the evening rush hour Wednesday. Lisbon hosted around 8.5 million tourists last year, and long lines of people typically form for the streetcar's short and picturesque trip a few hundred meters up and down a city street.

“This tragedy … goes beyond our borders,” Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said at his official residence, calling it “one of the biggest tragedies of our recent past.” Portugal observed a national day of mourning Thursday.

All 16 autopsies were concluded Thursday, but the identification of three victims requires access to dental records or family DNA that are held abroad, Francisco Corte-Real, the head of the National Forensic Medicine Institute, told a joint news conference.

The electric streetcar, also known as a funicular, is harnessed by steel cables and can carry more than 40 people. On Thursday, officials took photographs and pulled up cable from beneath the rails that climb one of the Portuguese capital's steep hills.

Officials declined to comment on whether a faulty brake or a snapped cable may have prompted the descending streetcar to careen into a building where the steep road bends.

“The city needs answers,” Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas said in a televised statement, adding that talk of possible causes is “mere speculation.”

Police, public prosecutors and government transport experts are investigating the crash, Montenegro told reporters. The government's Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations said it had concluded its analysis of the wreckage and would issue a preliminary report Friday. Chief police investigator Nelson Oliveira said a preliminary police report is expected within 45 days.

The company that operates Lisbon's streetcars and buses, Carris, said it has opened its own investigation.

The streetcar, which has been in service since 1914, underwent a scheduled full maintenance program last year and the company conducted a 30-minute visual inspection of it every day, Carris' CEO Pedro de Brito Bogas said during a news conference Thursday.

The streetcar was last inspected nine hours before the derailment, he said, but he didn't detail the visual inspection nor specify when questioned whether all the cables were tested.

The mayor said he would request an investigation from an outside independent body, but didn't elaborate.

Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency said earlier Thursday that the death toll had risen to 17. It later corrected that to 16, citing a duplication of available information.

All the people who died were adults, Castro Martins said. She didn't provide their identities, saying their families would be informed first.

The transport workers' trade union SITRA said that the streetcar's brakeman, André Marques, was among the dead.

Felicity Ferriter, a 70-year-old British tourist, had just arrived with her husband at a hotel near the crash site and was unpacking her suitcase when she heard “a horrendous crash.”

“We heard it, we heard the bang,” she told the Associated Press outside her hotel.

The couple had seen the streetcar when they arrived and intended to ride on it the next day.

“It was to be one of the highlights of our holiday,” she said, adding: “It could have been us.”

Witness Teresa d'Avó told Portuguese television channel SIC that it looked like the streetcar had no brakes.

“It hit the building with brutal force and fell apart like a cardboard box,” she said, describing how passersby scattered into the middle of the nearby Avenida da Liberdade, or Freedom Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare.

Francesca di Bello, a 23-year-old Italian tourist on a family vacation, had been on the Elevador da Gloria just hours before the derailment.

They walked by the crash site on Thursday, expressing shock at the wreckage. Asked if she would ride a funicular again in Portugal or elsewhere, Di Bello was emphatic: “Definitely not.”

The service, inaugurated in 1885, runs between Restauradores Square and the Bairro Alto neighbourhood renowned for its nightlife. The Elevador da Gloria is classified as a national monument.

Lisbon's City Council halted operations of three other famous funicular streetcars in the city while immediate inspections were carried out.

European Union flags at the European Parliament and European Commission in Brussels flew at half-staff. Multiple EU leaders expressed their condolences on social media.

People look at the Elevador da Gloria streetcar which derailed and crashed in Lisbon, on Thursday.Armando Franca/The Associated Press

Global Affairs Canada has confirmed it is aware of two missing Canadian citizens after a popular streetcar attraction crashed in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, killing 16 people.

Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather more information, said spokesperson Thida Ith in an e-mailed statement Thursday.

Due to privacy considerations, she added that no further information can be disclosed.

One Canadian national was among the 21 injured, the head of Lisbon's Civil Protection Agency Margarida Castro Martins told reporters.

On Thursday, investigators sifted through the wreckage of the streetcar in downtown Lisbon, trying to determine why the popular tourist attraction derailed during the busy summer season. 

Portugal's attorney-general's office said eight victims have been identified so far: five Portuguese, two South Koreans and a Swiss person.

There is “a high possibility,” based on recovered documents and other evidence, that the victims also include two Canadians, one American, one German and one Ukrainian, according to the head of the national investigative police, Luís Neves. Three remain to be identified.

Among the injured are Spaniards, Israelis, Portuguese, Brazilians, Italians and French people, the executive director of Portugal's National Health Service, Álvaro Santos Almeida, said.

The nationalities appeared to confirm suspicions that the Elevador da Gloria was packed with tourists as well as locals when it came off its rails during the evening rush hour Wednesday. Lisbon hosted around 8.5 million tourists last year, and long lines of people typically form for the streetcar's short and picturesque trip a few hundred meters up and down a city street.

“This tragedy … goes beyond our borders,” Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said at his official residence, calling it “one of the biggest tragedies of our recent past.” Portugal observed a national day of mourning Thursday.

All 16 autopsies were concluded Thursday, but the identification of three victims requires access to dental records or family DNA that are held abroad, Francisco Corte-Real, the head of the National Forensic Medicine Institute, told a joint news conference.

The electric streetcar, also known as a funicular, is harnessed by steel cables and can carry more than 40 people. On Thursday, officials took photographs and pulled up cable from beneath the rails that climb one of the Portuguese capital's steep hills.

Officials declined to comment on whether a faulty brake or a snapped cable may have prompted the descending streetcar to careen into a building where the steep road bends.

“The city needs answers,” Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas said in a televised statement, adding that talk of possible causes is “mere speculation.”

All the people who died were adults, Castro Martins said. She didn't provide their identities, saying their families would be informed first.

The transport workers' trade union SITRA said that the streetcar's brakeman, André Marques, was among the dead.

The injured include men and women between the ages of 24 and 65, and a 3-year-old child, Castro Martins said. Among them are Portuguese people, as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from France, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Morocco, South Korea and Cape Verde, she said.

Felicity Ferriter, a 70-year-old British tourist, had just arrived with her husband at a hotel near the crash site and was unpacking her suitcase when she heard “a horrendous crash.”

“We heard it, we heard the bang,” she told The Associated Press outside her hotel.

BEIJING, September 3. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are not plotting any conspiracy against the United States, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said, commenting on allegations from US President Donald Trump about the three leaders conspiring against Washington at Beijing's military parade.

"I'd like to say that nobody meant to conspire [against the United States] <…>. Moreover, I can say that everybody understands the role the United States, the Trump administration, and President Trump personally are playing in today's global narratives," Ushakov told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin.

Earlier, Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, addressing China's Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

The People's Liberation Army of China held a large-scale military parade on Tiananmen Square in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War on Wednesday.

Editor's note: This item has been updated with Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov's statement. 

Russia's economy slowed sharply from April-June of 2025 and has entered a phase of "technical stagnation," German Gref, the head of Russia's biggest bank, Sberbank, said on Sept. 3.

"The slowdown continues, as we can see from gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates. The second quarter can practically be considered technical stagnation," Gref said at an economic forum.

"July and August show pretty clear signs that we're getting close to zero (economic growth)."

The downturn underscores the limits of Russia's war-fueled expansion, driven by record defense spending but hampered by weak private consumption and shrinking civilian investment. 

Russia's GDP expanded 1.8% in the second quarter, up slightly from 1.4% in the first but far below the 2024 pace. The Central Bank expects growth to slow in the third quarter and approach zero in late 2025. 

The International Monetary Fund has already cut its 2025 growth forecast for Russia to 0.9%, down from 4.3% last year — the steepest downgrade among major economies.

Gref also noted the Central Bank's key interest rate, currently at 18% following two cuts in 2025, and said it would need to drop closer to 12% to create "hope for an economic recovery."

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level officials. 

Central Bank Chief Elvira Nabiullina said in June that Russia had reached "the edge of capacity," while Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said the country was "on the verge of a transition to recession."

Speaking on Sept. 4 to Kremlin-controlled state media channel Russia 1, Reshetnikov said Russia "pays" for inflation and high key interest rate with a "challenging economic situation."

"It is visible in the macroeconomic figures. According to our estimates, GDP growth in July year-on-year was 0.4%. In June, it was 1%," he said. "Moreover, we see that producer price inflation has stopped... which is not a very good sign. It indicates that demand is insufficient."

"Many engineering factories are now underutilized. Some are moving to a four-day workweek, others to a full week. Everywhere, they are trying to optimize costs, including labor costs. Clearly, we are not talking about layoffs, but this is a worrying sign for us."

Russia's authoritarian system permits senior technocrats some rhetorical flexibility, but only within the economic sphere, Russian political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann told the Kyiv Independent in June. 

"Our autocracy relies on the expertise of capable managers, particularly those concentrated in the financial and economic bloc of the government," Schulmann said.

A June poll by the independent Russian pollster Levada Center found 58% of Russians named rising prices as their top concern, while just 33% cited the war against Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sept. 3 that he initially thought ending Russia's war against Ukraine would be straightforward, but acknowledged it has proven more difficult than he expected. 

The president's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"Frankly, the Russia one, I thought, would have been on the easier side of the ones I've stopped, but it seems to be something that's a little bit more difficult than some of the others," Trump told CBS News.

Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has positioned himself as a global peacemaker, claiming he ended seven conflicts, though he did not provide evidence or specify which wars he was referring to.

His approach, he said, is to bring leaders together in one room and push them toward an agreement, though he conceded that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow require patience.

Following his Aug. 15 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Trump said he was preparing a direct meeting between Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin has denied that any such deal was reached. 

The Ukrainian president has repeatedly expressed willingness to meet with Putin directly, urging the U.S. to impose tougher measures if Russia continues to avoid such talks.

Putin told reporters on Sept.3 that he has never ruled out meeting with Zelensky and suggested it could happen if properly prepared. He said if Zelensky is ready, he could come to Moscow.

Trump has yet to impose sanctions on Russia for refusing to end the war, despite earlier threats of "severe" secondary tariffs. His administration has paused military aid to Ukraine multiple times and so far imposed only a 25% tariff on India over oil purchases from Moscow. 

An Aug. 8 deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed without consequences.

Zelensky, who traveled to Paris on Sept. 3 for a meeting of the "Coalition of the Willing," said he would soon speak with Trump about increasing sanctions pressure on Moscow.

"Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit.





"First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast, wrote.

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.

The captain of a Japan Airlines flight from Honolulu was removed from the flight's crew in late August a day after he drank a prohibited amount of alcohol, which led him to say he felt unwell, it has been learned.

The captain reportedly consumed more than double the company's stipulated limit for alcohol.

On Wednesday, the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry conducted an emergency inspection of Japan Airlines Co.'s Flight Operations division at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, based on the Civil Aeronautics Law.

JAL was given administrative guidance last December to improve its operations, after an incident involving excessive drinking by two pilots in Melbourne. As part of its efforts to prevent further incidents, the airline has implemented a “no alcohol” policy for pilots at their accommodations.

The ministry will confirm the situation and consider administrative sanctions against the captain and others.

According to JAL and other sources, the captain was scheduled to fly Flight 793, a Boeing 787-9, from Honolulu to Chubu Airport with 251 passengers and crew on board from 2:20 p.m. on Aug. 28. However, he said he felt unwell before the flight, prompting JAL to arrange his replacement and causing a delay of about two hours for the flight and delays of up to18 hours for two other flights.

An investigation by JAL found that the captain had consumed three tall cans, about half a liter each, of high-alcohol beer — just under 10% alcohol — in his hotel room on the afternoon of Aug. 27. JAL has internal regulations, approved by the government, limiting alcohol levels in the body 12 hours before duty. The limit is equivalent to drinking two tall cans of beer that are 5% alcohol. The captain's alcohol intake was more than twice this limit.

JAL was also given administrative guidance in May last year, when another captain caused a drunken disturbance at a lodging in Dallas. In the Melbourne incident, for which JAL received a business improvement order, the two pilots hid the fact that they had drunk above the limit and flew anyways. Spring Japan Co., JAL's group company, also received a stern warning in May this year after the captain of a cargo flight drank during the no-alcohol period before a flight.

Tokyo Skytree in Sumida Ward, Tokyo, is illuminated in “sunrise red” on Wednesday. The color of the lighting was inspired by the uniforms of the Japan team taking part in the World Athletics Championships, which kicks off in Tokyo on Sept. 13. Top athletes who competed at the 1991 event in Tokyo attended the lighting ceremony, including women's marathon silver medalist Sachiko Yamashita and Yuko Arimori, who placed fourth.

 Washington Should Draw New Delhi Closer, Not Push It Away

 Kurt M. Campbell and Jake Sullivan

Tariffs, Russian oil purchases, and renewed tensions regarding Pakistan have caused a rapid and regrettable downturn in the U.S.-Indian relationship, replete with public insults and recriminations. As Washington and New Delhi evaluate the state of things, it is prudent to remember why India has emerged over the last generation as one of the United States' most important global partners. It is also time to consider how to fortify a relationship that has been one of the brightest spots of bipartisan support in a divided Washington where concerted international purpose has been in short supply.

U.S. policymakers have long seen promise in India's status as the world's largest democracy as well as opportunity in its economic and technological dynamism and its growing global leadership role. More recently, India's desire to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific has led to a strategic alignment with the United States that has effectively disincentivized reckless Chinese adventurism.

This common purpose must not be taken for granted. Until this most recent dustup, multiple U.S. presidents have pushed forward specific initiatives to advance the relationship and convert a general sense of promise into something deeper and sustained, including President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's landmark U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement and President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cooperation in critical fields such as AI, biotechnology, and aerospace.

The relationship, however, has remained vulnerable to misunderstandings, missteps, and missed opportunities because of lingering distrust and misaligned expectations. This is partly because U.S.-Indian ties do not fit neatly into the boxes that the United States has historically used to define its most consequential bilateral relationships. In the Cold War and post–Cold War eras, U.S. foreign policy made a distinction between alliances and partnerships. Alliances involved formal treaty commitments built on the foundation of a mutual defense guarantee. Partnerships were for essentially all other countries that worked with Washington—and India fell into that category.

The end of the post–Cold War era has exposed the shortcomings of this approach, which overemphasized collective self-defense commitments and neglected the deeper economic, technological, and strategic ties that are increasingly salient in modern geopolitics. Indeed, despite fundamental areas of alignment between the two countries, the U.S.-Indian relationship received relatively little attention, because it was not centered on a security guarantee.

The current trajectory risks a split that would be difficult to mend, to the great detriment of both countries. As Modi's chummy appearance over the weekend with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear, the United States could end up driving India directly into its adversaries' arms. India, meanwhile, could end up squeezed on all sides with an unaccommodating power in China on its border and strained technology, education, and defense ties with the United States. Given this reality, Washington and New Delhi must strive to do more than simply restore the old, suboptimal status quo. They must create a firmer and more ambitious foundation: a strategic alliance between the United States and India based on a series of mutual commitments regarding technology, defense, supply chains, intelligence, and global problem solving. An alliance, in other words, not based on a traditional mutual defense pact.

At this moment of unprecedented discord, it may be hard to imagine reinventing and bolstering the relationship. But the United States and India can move forward by using the scaffolding already in place to build a stronger structure. Failing to do so risks squandering a major strategic opportunity and could encourage India to adopt a path less aligned with, or even hostile to, American strategic and economic interests.

A new strategic alliance between the United States and India would be established by a treaty subject to advice and consent by the U.S. Senate. It would be built on five core pillars, with the aim of enhancing the mutual security, prosperity, and values of both countries.

First, the countries would agree to a ten-year action plan in the technologies that will define the future: artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biotech, quantum, clean energy, telecommunications, and aerospace. The goal would be to build a common technology ecosystem, linked to other allies, to ensure the United States and fellow democracies do not cede the innovation edge to competitors such as China. This would mean working together on both the “promote” agenda of bold public investments, common R & D, and shared talent—as well as the “protect” agenda of aligning export controls and cybersecurity measures. The Trump administration's U.S.-India TRUST initiative, built on top of the Biden administration's U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, should be at the core of this effort, but it could and should evolve from primarily a convening forum to a more formal architecture. By the close of the Biden administration, for instance, early discussions had begun around a formal U.S.-Indian AI agreement, potentially the first of its kind. Such an agreement could anchor R & D partnerships and encourage private-sector investment. This type of agreement, replicated across an array of emerging technologies, should be a cornerstone of a new alliance.

The United States and India should also establish a strategic talent partnership that removes obstacles for their scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and technical experts to work together on priority areas. This would include streamlining visa processes on both sides, creating common pots of funding, and removing outdated export controls that stymie collaboration.

The second pillar would be enhanced economic cooperation, including a bilateral trade pact that reflects the structural realities of the modern global economy while accounting for the political realities in both Washington and New Delhi. The natural first step would be a supply chain and investment agreement that would reduce mutual vulnerabilities to coercion and enhance the two countries' respective techno-industrial bases. India and the United States have each acknowledged dependencies on China for vital supply chains, and in some instances, those dependencies are interconnected. For example, China supplies India with 70 to 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since 40 percent of generic drugs in the United States are manufactured in India, the United States is indirectly exposed to India's reliance on Chinese APIs. Similarly, both countries rely heavily on China for critical minerals.

A supply chain agreement would help accelerate diversification and resilience by creating a standing mechanism to identify and address risks to supply chains in areas critical for national security and economic competitiveness. This would involve both early warning of impending disruptions and longer-term strategies to make investments that build resilience. In addition, the United States and India should establish high-standard principles for cross-border data flows and data security. And both countries should pursue an investment pact that would reduce obstacles to foreign direct investment, especially in strategic sectors, by addressing nontariff barriers, removing outdated regulatory restrictions in areas like clean energy, and strengthening intellectual property protections. Much of this diplomatic work was underway before the recent bout of public acrimony.



The third pillar of the strategic alliance would involve defense cooperation—specifically codevelopment, coproduction, joint logistics, and interoperability. This need not require a traditional Article 5–like guarantee to trigger mutual defense. But if both sides committed to developing the necessary consultation mechanisms and technology and personnel platforms, a more durable capacity to train, exercise, and operate together is within reach. Among other things, this would mean further institutionalizing and capitalizing the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which was launched in 2023 as an innovation bridge that directly connects the full spectrum of the two countries' defense ecosystems, including government agencies, prime contractors, startups, investors, and research institutions.

The agreement that GE Aerospace would manufacture F-414 jet engines in India—an unprecedented technology transfer to a nontreaty partner—showed the promise of a more robust defense partnership. (Delays in executing the deal reflect the continuing bureaucratic inertia in both countries.) But the goal here cannot and should not be simply to facilitate the transfer of American defense capabilities and technologies to India. Instead, it should be to build and operate new capabilities and technologies together, in areas such as unmanned aerial systems and air defense that will shape future combat. The United States brings obvious defense production prowess to the table, while India offers a new and critical opportunity: the chance to leapfrog many of the legacy defense platforms by deploying new platforms at scale. The scope of cooperation should grow to include joint naval and air activities in the Indian Ocean involving more submarine cooperation, airborne reconnaissance operations, and joint contingency planning.

A fourth pillar of the new alliance would be intelligence cooperation, which accelerated during the first Trump and Biden administrations. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, for example, has allowed Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad—to address illegal fishing, trafficking, and unauthorized maritime activities. The next major step would be to build a common maritime intelligence picture for the Indian Ocean, as well as a formalized structure of intelligence sharing and joint analysis that can continually update that picture.

The fifth and final pillar of the new alliance would be a commitment to global problem solving. The unique strengths of the two countries present significant opportunities for dealing with the climate crisis, food security, and public health, as well as the effective use of emerging technologies to deliver global public goods. The United States can mobilize public- and private-sector resources and development know-how; India can leverage deep experience with this set of challenges as well as its trusted relationships across East Africa and in the Pacific. This could start with joint scalable pilot projects in third countries—such as in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, where the Indian government has demonstrated a new commitment to ambitious infrastructure and health and technology initiatives that align with long-standing U.S. approaches in the Pacific—and grow from there.

Some will argue that it will not be possible to reengineer momentum in the bilateral relationship after the recent downturn. On this point, those invested in the relationship on Capitol Hill and in the business and strategic community need to impress on their Indian interlocutors that U.S. President Donald Trump's theatrics are often the prelude to dealmaking. This is a deeply unpleasant reality to many, but to paraphrase the late U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, you must do diplomacy with the United States you have, not the one you might prefer. Of course, it may turn out that it will be difficult to elevate the relationship under the current administration, but proponents of a U.S.-Indian alliance must keep building the strategic case and the intellectual and practical framework for the long term.

Some will also credibly ask whether India's democratic backsliding would make such an alliance untenable. There are real challenges in India on pluralism, civil rights, and the rule of law, but the relationship should be mature enough to sustain an honest conversation with the government of India and Indian civil society about these trends. The United States should also be humble enough to acknowledge its own significant challenges when it comes to democracy and the rule of law. It is a very large glass house.

There is also the question of whether such an alliance can be built in the face of India's relationship with Russia, which was brought into sharp relief by the recent Modi-Putin meeting. India will need to make a long-term strategic choice to break its dependence on Russia for defense and energy. This is a choice that New Delhi can and should make for its own reasons, not out of deference to Washington. And there have been subtle signs in recent years that India has gradually repositioned itself more toward the United States and Europe.

Washington must also refrain from hyphenating its relations with India and Pakistan: there should be no “India-Pakistan” policy. U.S. diplomacy in recent years has been heavily weighted toward New Delhi for a reason. The United States has enduring interests in Pakistan in combating terrorism and limiting nuclear and missile proliferation, but these pale in significance to Washington's multifaceted and consequential interests regarding India's future.

On the Indian side, some will ask—particularly now with nationalist sensibilities running hot—whether a U.S.-Indian alliance will impinge on India's strategic autonomy. The very idea of an alliance will be strange and scary to the inheritors of the Non-Aligned Movement, which India helped spearhead during the Cold War. But a strategic alliance is not mutually exclusive with strategic autonomy. India and the United States are both proud and independent countries. Alliances are about alignment and common purpose—not about sacrificing sovereignty.

As always, there is the practical question of bureaucracy and capacity on both sides. Can they move the machinery of government to build an alliance? Doing so would require leadership from the top of both governments. And it would require a vision that inspires not only their governments but also their private sectors, technology communities, universities, and publics.

It is also worth remembering that many of Washington's most important alliances have seen setbacks and led to domestic discord. The U.S.-Japanese alliance, for example, had to weather the economic disputes and political pressures of the 1980s and hard questions about the continued necessity of an alliance with Washington in the post–Cold War environment in the 1990s. The NATO alliance has had to contend with persistent questions about burden sharing. The United States and South Korea previously butted heads over how to handle the threat from North Korea, and there have been periodic public upheavals in Korean public opinion over tragic incidents involving American troops stationed on the peninsula. The United States and its allies have gotten through tough moments before, and the United States and India can do so, too.

Whether that will happen with the current occupant of the Oval Office is unpredictable, but the strategic aim should be clear. The realities of the emerging era have elevated the value of new shared security arrangements. And India has emerged as one of the United States' most consequential partners. The only thing harder than building and formalizing a deeply significant relationship with India is not having one. So, with no illusions, the United States and India should get to work.

 How to Outcompete Chinese State Capitalism

 Sadek Wahba and Jonathan E. Hillman

Years from now, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as a turning point in U.S. industrial policy, with President Donald Trump's deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials marking the beginning of a new era of direct state investment in key industries. As the United States competes over the technologies and industries of tomorrow, Washington is now experimenting with state-centric investment strategies that resemble those of Beijing. But because the U.S. federal government is constrained by a debt-to-GDP ratio above 120 percent and a budget deficit exceeding seven percent, U.S. policymakers will have to channel more private capital toward strategically important sectors. Doing so will not be easy. To ensure a successful industrial strategy, the Trump administration must set clear criteria for what qualifies as a strategic industry, marshal the necessary public resources, and incentivize private investment in those industries.

The global battleground spans a wide variety of industries, including artificial intelligence and related digital infrastructure, critical minerals, and advanced manufacturing. Both China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in this strategic competition. In China, the government plays a central role as a source, allocator, and user of capital, directly resourcing strategic priorities but creating significant waste and inefficiency in the process. Chinese companies get much of their financing from state-owned banks, with capital markets providing only 14 percent of their financing. In the United States, by contrast, a market-led approach struggles to support less lucrative areas of strategic importance, such as basic infrastructure, but excels at directing capital toward areas with the highest perceived returns, such as artificial intelligence. And with integration across all 50 states, U.S. capital markets are the largest globally and provide nearly three-quarters of all equity and debt financing for U.S. companies outside the financial sector.

In both countries, investment outcomes depend heavily on national conditions, including the strength of capital markets, workforce, infrastructure, and the judiciousness of laws and regulations. When these conditions are strong, countries become magnets for foreign capital and talent. As U.S. policymakers work to scale investments for strategically important technologies and industries, they may improve underlying conditions over time, but they should not bet on overnight transformations.

The Chinese government has an extensive toolkit for supporting investments at home and for launching into global markets. State-owned banks provide most of the financing to companies in China, which is home to the world's four largest banks, all of which are state-owned. The government is also the dominant investor in venture capital and private equity, supplying six times more funding than private investors. Chinese companies can draw from a wide array of state-backed sources, including funds, banks, enterprises, and sovereign wealth vehicles. Beijing also shields firms from foreign competition, facilitates technology transfer, and supports them with cheap land, electricity, and credit. Abroad, Beijing extends financing and diplomatic backing to Chinese companies through the Belt and Road Initiative, helping them to secure mineral rights and logistics networks.

The rise of China's largest shipping company, COSCO, illustrates the power of this support. In 2009, COSCO operated three overseas terminals. Today it manages a dozen. In that same period, the company increased the amount of overseas cargo it handled tenfold. Many other Chinese firms have profited from COSCO's success, including manufacturers of tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers, financial-technology and mining companies, and entrepreneurs developing AI applications for maritime operations. This broader Chinese ecosystem of beneficiaries allows the state to rationalize its continued support for a national champion.

When all else fails, the Chinese government can move capital from profitable state-owned enterprises to keep their struggling counterparts afloat. The relative success of Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2015, is telling. Displaying a degree of focus that Washington has lacked, Beijing aimed to upgrade not just industry in general but ten specific sectors. Within those sectors, Beijing has achieved global leadership in five of 13 key technologies and is making headway in seven others.

Yet this approach carries costs. China's subsidies, which are far larger than those of other countries, have created overcapacity in automobiles, solar panels, and semiconductors. Correcting this will be difficult as growth slows, the Chinese population ages, and reliance on foreign energy rises. In addition to draining resources from competing sectors, Chinese subsidies have provoked other countries to respond with their own measures, as evidenced by Trump's tariff policy.

The heavy hand of the state is also driving investors away. Foreign capital, especially venture funding, has collapsed amid higher risks and lower returns. Beijing has tried to lure investors with regulatory flexibility and even a $138 billion public venture capital fund, but domestic private firms still prefer private sources, and government-owned investment firms perform worse than private ones. Still, when strategic priorities are at stake, Beijing values control over efficiency.

Trump's recent deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials may represent a significant escalation of a nearly decadelong shift toward experimenting with industrial policy. In his first term, Trump fired the opening salvo with his “America first” strategy based on a mix of tariffs, import substitution policies, and attempts to improve infrastructure. President Joe Biden increased some tariffs on China and worked with Congress on landmark programs to rebuild the United States' aging infrastructure, invest in clean energy, and develop semiconductors and related technologies.

In his second term, Trump has deployed a variety of tools to attract more capital to strategic areas. He has used executive orders to relax regulatory barriers, continued to provide financial incentives—such as tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees—for semiconductors through the CHIPS and Science Act, and blocked or raised the cost of foreign alternatives, including through aggressive import controls and tariffs. His administration has also taken dramatic steps to leverage the U.S. government's power as a customer and regulator to strike deals with private companies. Some of these measures are reminiscent of the New Deal, when the federal government actively invested in the economy.

In April, the leading AI-chip maker Nvidia announced that it would spend $500 billion to build AI supercomputers and infrastructure in the United States, including new manufacturing and testing facilities in Arizona and Texas. In return, Trump committed to speeding up permits for Nvidia's expansion. Then, in July, the Department of Defense launched a partnership with MP Materials, the rare-earth miner, to build a fully domestic rare-earth magnet supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical defense inputs. The deal includes a $400 million equity investment by Washington (making the Department of Defense the company's largest shareholder), a $150 million public loan to expand heavy rare-earth separation, and a ten-year price floor on a rare-earth compound that is a key ingredient for powerful magnets. This combination of incentives has already mobilized $1 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as a pledge from MP Materials to contribute $600 million to the project. The real test will be whether the partnership can meaningfully scale up production and create a self-sustaining market over the next decade.

The strategic case for more recent deals is less clear. In August, Washington announced that it would allow Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another leading semiconductor company, to export certain AI chips to China in exchange for 15 percent of top-line revenues generated from these sales. The Trump administration has not clarified how it plans to use these funds, which makes it impossible to weigh the revenue gained against the potential costs to national security. In an unprecedented move, the administration also recently announced that it would use $5.7 billion in previously awarded grants to the chipmaker Intel to purchase a ten-percent equity stake in the company. By converting a grant to an equity stake, taxpayers may benefit from future returns—but Intel may be at a disadvantage, since its competitors will likely continue receiving grants and other less demanding support.

These actions can be interpreted in two ways. First, they reflect Trump's transactional style of policymaking. Second, they could signal the start of a more sustained industrial policy focused on supporting strategic sectors, both at home and abroad. The first does not preclude the second. But an ad hoc approach risks failing to achieve the scale and consistency necessary for long-term success.

The long-term nature of industrial policy is perhaps the greatest challenge for the United States, where elections carry the risk of erasing a previous administration's policy initiatives. An effective industrial policy for strategic competition across multiple technologies and industries—including those that have yet to be discovered—may have to be extended for decades. Moreover, whatever policy takes shape over the coming years, U.S. public resources are limited and risk being spread too thin over too many priorities. It is critical that policymakers continue to identify strategic industries that require targeted state support and ensure that the United States has the capabilities, either domestically or through its network of partners and allies, to defend its vital interests under various scenarios.

To that end, policymakers should ask several essential questions before making investments. Does this industry require support that capital markets cannot provide? If so, what form of support should it take? If financial support is truly required, which tool will have the greatest likelihood of success at the most reasonable cost? Should the state intervene directly in private capital markets or merely provide incentives? The government has a number of incentives from which to choose—tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees, as well as its own purchasing power—and each comes with tradeoffs. These questions should be standardized and addressed systematically through an investment vehicle, such as a sovereign fund, with rules that insulate decisions from political interference.

A related challenge is identifying the critical ancillary requirements that strategic industries need. For example, AI requires massive data centers, which in turn depend on reliable power generation, water resources, and permits at both the local and federal levels. States cannot fund these requirements alone. The 2021 infrastructure bill, for example, was almost entirely funded by federal and state governments, with minimal incentives for the private sector. A realistic industrial policy must also consider the supporting investments—in research, infrastructure, and workforce development—that are necessary for strategic industries to succeed.

Policymakers should also continue nurturing the United States' underlying advantages. Capital markets could be further strengthened by lowering the tax burden on foreign capital from trusted sources seeking minority stakes in U.S. infrastructure and other priorities. And comprehensive immigration reform is essential to ensure that the United States has the human capital required for industry and for maximizing the odds that the next strategically important innovation happens at home.

The United States can lead in tomorrow's technologies and industries by leveraging its unparalleled capital markets, fostering public-private collaboration, and aligning policy incentives with long-term strategic goals. But success will require disciplined prioritization and a commitment to creating conditions that attract both domestic and international private capital. As global competition intensifies, Washington's ability to mobilize private capital will be central to safeguarding U.S. strategic interests.

VLADIVOSTOK, September 4. /TASS/. Russia is not going to discuss ideas of foreign military intervention in Ukraine in any format, Official Spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said at the briefing on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, commenting on plans of the European Union to potentially send troops to Ukraine.

"Russia does not intend to discuss the completely unacceptable and undermining any security foreign intervention in Ukraine in any form, in any format whatsoever," the diplomat stressed.

Security guarantees sought by Ukraine are guarantees of threat to the European continent and are absolutely unacceptable, Zakharova noted. "They are aimed at preserving Ukraine as a stronghold for terror, for provocations against our country. They are not security guarantees for Ukraine, they are guarantees of threat to the European continent," she stressed.

The US approval of the possible sale of more than 3,000 ERAM missiles and the equipment required for them contradicts the stated aspiration to settle the conflict diplomatically, Zakharova added.

Russia would use Donbas to further invade Ukraine in a renewed assault and could attack Europe next, President Volodymyr Zelensky told French outlet Le Point in an interview published on Sept. 3.

"If, tomorrow, we somehow left Donbas, which will not happen, we would open up an unprotected space for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, near a city of one and a half million inhabitants: Kharkiv. He would also seize the industrial center of Dnipro," Zelensky said.

"One thing is certain, we have not lost. We must look at the situation clearly: the second-largest army in the world has come to annihilate us, our history, and our identity. And this is not their first attempt. Several times in history, the Russian Empire has struck blows at the independence of our people," he said.

Russia has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine withdraw from Donbas, which consists of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Moscow first occupied the far-eastern region in 2014.

"It's very simple. Some media outlets claim that if Ukrainian soldiers left the eastern regions of our country, peace would be restored. This is not true," Zelensky said.

The Kremlin reportedly signalled to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff that it would be open to freezing the frontline in its war against Ukraine if Kyiv surrendered the rest of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia.

"Putin invaded Crimea (in 2014) to use it as a springboard and encircle the south of our country. That is, to prepare for another offensive. He invaded part of the east of our country in 2014 to use it as a springboard to completely occupy these regions," Zelensky said.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 used Belarus and Ukraine's southeastern regions as launching pads for its assaults across the country.

Zelensky noted the same could be done to attack the rest of Europe next if Ukraine were to fall to Russian soldiers.

"If Putin were to succeed in taking over our entire country, he would use it as a springboard in the same way. Whether he does so or not will depend on Europe's" strength, Zelensky said.

Despite sanctions from Ukraine's allies, Moscow is still able to wage its war, he noted.

"The pressure from Western partners is not strong enough economically; Putin still has financial reserves," he added.

Zelensky noted that security guarantees solely from Europe are enough to contain a Russian offensive, but that guarantees from the U.S. are necessary to end Russia's aggression and prevent a renewed war.

"Europe's security guarantees may not be enough. We need an alliance between Europe and the United States," he said.

Ukraine, alongside its European allies and Washington, has been discussing how to end Russia's war against Ukraine in recent weeks amid intensified efforts from U.S. President Donald Trump to broker a peace deal.

"The Russians came to try to erase our identity, to rewrite history. We are fighting to preserve our identity. Our fight is not just for territory. It is for Ukraine, which is made up of pieces of history and people," Zelensky said as Russia continues its advances on the front line.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries are ready to send troops or contribute other support to Ukraine as part of security guarantees. 

In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times.



The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said.

The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing.

The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal.



The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 112 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses intercepting 84. 

The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. 

Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.

U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results.

"That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said.

The number includes 840 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

"Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

As the leaders of China and Russia walked shoulder to shoulder on Sept. 3, a hot mic captured them discussing increasing longevity through organ transplants, possibly extending one's lifespan to 150 years.

The conversation, livestreamed through Chinese state media to billions online and on television, made international headlines as China watchers scrutinized the implications, with many pointing to longstanding concerns about forced organ harvesting.

SEOUL, September 4. /TASS/. Head of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un said during talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Pyongyang will support Moscow in defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the KCNA news agency reported.

The meeting took place on September 3 on the sidelines of festive activities in China. "Comrade Kim Jong Un said that DPRK will continue supporting to the full extent the struggle of the government, the army, and the people of Russia for protection of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests of the state, consider it the brotherly debt and stay committed to performance of the interstate treaty between DPRK and Russia," KCNA said.

The meeting of the two leaders was held in the friendly atmosphere, the news agency added.

Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, challenged his opponent in NYC's mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, to five debates in each of NYC's five boroughs during a press conference Thursday.

Andrew Cuomo challenged his NYC mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to five different debates across all five New York City boroughs during a press conference Thursday.

The challenge came as the former governor slammed Mamdani at his press conference in Manhattan's Upper West Side for failing "to give a straight answer" to reporters' questions and changing his mind "on everything" he has said on the campaign trail.

"When you try to ask [Mamdani] a question, he will simply not answer, and he obfuscates. And, frankly, you guys let him get away with it," Cuomo told reporters Thursday. "I won't let him get away with it. And New Yorkers won't let him get away with it."

Hours after Cuomo leveled his challenge to Mamdani, the self-described democratic socialist shot back a proposal of his own: debate President Donald Trump.

"Let's cut out the middle man. Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?" Mamdani's campaign told Fox News Digital in a statement. "If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors."  

The back-and-forth between Cuomo and Mamdani comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is weighing whether to offer jobs in his administration to incumbent NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the GOP candidate for NYC mayor, Curtis Sliwa. The move to offer the two candidates a job is reportedly a bid to clear the field for Cuomo, multiple sources with intimate knowledge about the matter have said. 

WHITE HOUSE SILENT ON REPORT THAT TRUMP ALLIES HAVE WEIGHED LURING ADAMS TO ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERCUT MAMDANI

The former governor indicated during his press conference Thursday that he was aware of media reports about Trump possibly offering his NYC mayoral opponents jobs, subsequently clearing the field for him, but added that he has "no idea" if the reports are accurate. Cuomo said he has not spoken to either Mayor Eric Adams or President Trump about the matter.

"I know nothing about that speculation," Cuomo told reporters Thursday about the matter. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Neither Adams nor his team responded to Fox News Digital's inquiries on Thursday either, but media reports Thursday indicated Adams met in Florida with Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, one of the president's closest advisors, to discuss a potential job with the Trump administration. 

News of the Adams meeting came after media reports last week indicating Trump had personally phoned influential businessman John Catsimatidis, an Adams ally, to set a deadline for the mayor and Sliwa to drop out.

JUDGE TELLS CUOMO TO STOP USING TAXPAYER MONEY TO ‘RESURRECT HIS PUBLIC IMAGE' IN LEGAL CASE

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the matter. 

Cuomo, who has positioned himself as the moderate left-wing alternative to Mamdani in the race, described Mamdani's policy proposals Thursday as "absurd," "out of the mainstream" and "discordant with what New Yorkers believe."

Shortly after launching his independent bid for mayor last month, Cuomo proposed that all the other candidates in the race, with the exclusion of Mamdani, make a pledge to agree that whoever is not leading in the polls by mid-September, would step aside. The aim of the pledge, Cuomo indicated, is to ensure the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Mamdani runs against him under the most favorable conditions possible.

However, the proposal has been rejected by Adams, and Sliwa suggested to Fox News Digital Thursday that Cuomo and Adams are not even the main frontrunners who New Yorkers want to win.

"This is a race between the two major party nominees, myself and Mamdani, and New Yorkers know I'm the only one with the experience and grit to take him on," Sliwa told Fox News Digital. "I'm running to save New York City from decline and give working people the future they deserve."

Speaking specifically to Mamdani's response to Cuomo's debate challenge, Sliwa added that Mamdani "is desperate to distract from his own radical agenda, so he hides behind cheap theatrics."

NFL legend Brett Favre discusses why he believes Trump won the presidential election so decisively on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Pro Football Hall of Famer Brett Favre was one of the loudest supporters of President Donald Trump during his 2024 re-election campaign from the world of sports.

The Packers legend spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before the election. 

Trump eventually defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election, carrying Wisconsin in the win.

Favre said in a recent interview with sports personality Sage Steele he took a "common sense" approach when it came to his decision to support Trump.

"I thought about the rally in Green Bay when he asked if I would come talk. There were those that said, ‘You know, people throw daggers at you anyway, they're really gonna throw daggers at you.' So, I thought about it. I weighed the pros and cons. I really thought, ‘I don't know if I'm going to influence it at this point,'" he said. 

"There's been a hard line drawn in the sand, and you're either on one side or the other. I thought about if you persuade five voters, and who knows, it may be a five-vote difference. Then, I would be beside myself if I didn't take advantage of that.

"It wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not a public speaker. I'm certainly not a political public speaker. But it was an honor that I was asked. And do I agree with everything President Trump says or does? No. Does he agree with everything that I do? No. Nor with anyone on the other side. 

"But from a common sense perspective, do you really think boys should compete in girls sports and that's fair? No. The illegal (immigration), the crime, the border, the things because of it — how can you think that's OK? I'm all for doing the right thing for the people, but we have to protect our own first."

He said he also wondered whether supporters on the left thought about whether the country's direction was really something they wanted to further support. He said he couldn't be one of those supporters who rested on his laurels, hoping things would get better.

"Some of the things that you're, on the left, are saying is normal, do ever not look in the mirror when no one is looking and it's just you and you go, ‘Are we out of our damn mind?'" he said. "So, I felt like the conservative crowd, in general, sits on our hands, and I think at times I was like you just expect people to do the right thing and to make common sense decisions. 

"So, you sit on your hands and you expect that. And it doesn't happen, and it continues to get worse. And the left has no problem talking. They don't shut up, and they blame it all on everyone else. And I'm thinking, ‘You know, like, if we don't start standing up and defending ourselves, not that we should have to, it is what it is, if we don't start taking a stand, we're gonna get dominated.'"

Favre said he had no plans to run for office but wasn't going to tone his voice down either.

"I would like to run off into the sunset and enjoy life, but we gotta fight. I'd love to sugarcoat it, but they ain't going away," he said.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on where Zohran Mamdani stands with top NYC Dems and the criticism he's recently faced on 'Special Report.'

The National Democratic Committee seemed to reaffirm their support for New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a social media post on Wednesday despite the surge of new reporting about the self-identified Democratic socialist's anti-Israel views and extreme, far-left policies. 

The DNC clipped and posted Mamdani telling "I've Had It" podcast hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, "We welcome anyone to join this movement."

Mamdani was describing how he fostered a broad coalition of supporters to win the Democratic primary in June by welcoming anyone to join his movement, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. 

Social media quickly seized on the post, criticizing the party for showing support for Mamdani. Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino said the DNC's post confirmed that the Democratic Party is "quickly finishing its transformation into a socialist party." 

MAMDANI'S FAILURE TO WALK BACK THESE POSITIONS COULD CAUSE RECKONING IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'FIVE-ALARM WARNING'

The post comes as several party leaders, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have yet to endorse his campaign with just two months until Election Day. 

THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NEW YORK

When asked in July about Republicans trying to anchor Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats, DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital, "The Democratic Party is a big tent party. We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have progressives and we have these leftists."

While the DNC affirmed their support for New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, party officials and establishment leaders have been careful to outright embrace Mamdani and his radical policy agenda. Throughout the summer, Fox News Digital has reported extensively about Mamdani's past comments, political connections and questionable stances.  

A Fox News Digital review discovered that Mamdani's growing circle of influence is littered with activists who have espoused anti-Israel views and socialist principles.

Mamdani also delivered remarks at a church led by a pastor with a history of controversial statements on race, anti-Israel ties and support for reparations.

Fox News Digital has also reported on a resurfaced interview in which Mamdani highlights his commitment to BDS, an acronym for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, and sanctions against Israel, as he runs for mayor in a city with the highest Jewish population in the United States outside of Israel.

Mamdani spoke at SAAG Interactive in June 2021 about BDS in the interview, saying that "the ways in which we can marry our struggle to our day-to-day life and show our solidarity in that life, I think that's critical to winning this fight because it can't all be, as you've very well stated, just kind of exclusively considered a legislative battle. It has to be a society-wide battle."

Another resurfaced interview included Mamdani explaining that the family he grew up in made him "open" to being a "radical" and suggesting that socialism needs to be rebranded.

"I think, honestly, growing up in the family that I grew up in, I was quite open to what would be considered being a radical from a very young age," Mamdani said on "The Far Left Show" in 2020.

"I mean, from the beginning, my identities are already considered radical by a lot of mainstream American political thought. So, being a Muslim and being an immigrant, these are things that already kind of put you in the box of ‘other.' And so it's not that far of a jump because whenever you ... stand up to speak up for the rights of others who share the same identity as you, then you're a radical, right? So, often people in this country are considered radicals if they stand up for Palestinian human rights."

Mamdani has faced criticism over some of his positions taken as a young man, including supporting an academic boycott of Israel, starting a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his college days and the past writings of his father, Mahmood Mamdani. 

A resurfaced video this summer also revealed that the socialist candidate floated the "abolition of private property."

"My platform is that every single person should have housing, and I think, faced with these two options, the system has hundreds of thousands of people unhoused, right? For what?" Mamdani asked in a resurfaced video that has been clipped and reposted across conservative social media.

Mahmood Mamdani, the Columbia University professor and mayoral hopeful's father, has a social media presence littered with anti-Israel comments and praise for radical activists, a Fox News Digital review found.

Mamdani, 79, who Fox News Digital previously reported sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, has posted on his X account about Israel on multiple occasions, using terms like "settlers" and "colonialism."

"When all ranks of the Occupation, from the armed settler to the settler state, claim 'the right of self-defense', what language is left for those who defend themselves against the Occupation but the right to resist?" Mamdani posted online May 21, 2021, as Israel was involved in a violent conflict with Hamas.

Mamdani's father also sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing "genocide" and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers.

Mamdani's college newspaper articles also shed light on the candidate's early views on a variety of topics, including his promotion of an anti-Israel boycott and concerns about "White privilege," a Fox News Digital review found.

Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine's prestigious Bowdoin College, from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel.

He also faced ridicule for his comments at the Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, where he urged attendees not to compromise on goals like "seizing the means of production."

"Right now, if we're talking about the cancellation of student debt, if we're talking about Medicare for all, you know, these are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country," Mamdani says in a video to conference goers. 

"But then there are also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS or whether it is the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment."

Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC and Mamdani but did not immediately receive a response.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on where Zohran Mamdani stands with top NYC Dems and the criticism he's recently faced on 'Special Report.'

The National Democratic Committee seemed to reaffirm their support for New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a social media post on Wednesday despite the surge of new reporting about the self-identified Democratic socialist's anti-Israel views and extreme, far-left policies. 

The DNC clipped and posted Mamdani telling "I've Had It" podcast hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, "We welcome anyone to join this movement."

Mamdani was describing how he fostered a broad coalition of supporters to win the Democratic primary in June by welcoming anyone to join his movement, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. 

Social media quickly seized on the post, criticizing the party for showing support for Mamdani. Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino said the DNC's post confirmed that the Democratic Party is "quickly finishing its transformation into a socialist party." 

MAMDANI'S FAILURE TO WALK BACK THESE POSITIONS COULD CAUSE RECKONING IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'FIVE-ALARM WARNING'

The post comes as several party leaders, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have yet to endorse his campaign with just two months until Election Day. 

THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NEW YORK

When asked in July about Republicans trying to anchor Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats, DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital, "The Democratic Party is a big tent party. We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have progressives and we have these leftists."

While the DNC affirmed their support for New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, party officials and establishment leaders have been careful to outright embrace Mamdani and his radical policy agenda. Throughout the summer, Fox News Digital has reported extensively about Mamdani's past comments, political connections and questionable stances.  

A Fox News Digital review discovered that Mamdani's growing circle of influence is littered with activists who have espoused anti-Israel views and socialist principles.

Mamdani also delivered remarks at a church led by a pastor with a history of controversial statements on race, anti-Israel ties and support for reparations.

Fox News Digital has also reported on a resurfaced interview in which Mamdani highlights his commitment to BDS, an acronym for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, and sanctions against Israel, as he runs for mayor in a city with the highest Jewish population in the United States outside of Israel.

Mamdani spoke at SAAG Interactive in June 2021 about BDS in the interview, saying that "the ways in which we can marry our struggle to our day-to-day life and show our solidarity in that life, I think that's critical to winning this fight because it can't all be, as you've very well stated, just kind of exclusively considered a legislative battle. It has to be a society-wide battle."

Another resurfaced interview included Mamdani explaining that the family he grew up in made him "open" to being a "radical" and suggesting that socialism needs to be rebranded.

"I think, honestly, growing up in the family that I grew up in, I was quite open to what would be considered being a radical from a very young age," Mamdani said on "The Far Left Show" in 2020.

"I mean, from the beginning, my identities are already considered radical by a lot of mainstream American political thought. So, being a Muslim and being an immigrant, these are things that already kind of put you in the box of ‘other.' And so it's not that far of a jump because whenever you ... stand up to speak up for the rights of others who share the same identity as you, then you're a radical, right? So, often people in this country are considered radicals if they stand up for Palestinian human rights."

Mamdani has faced criticism over some of his positions taken as a young man, including supporting an academic boycott of Israel, starting a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his college days and the past writings of his father, Mahmood Mamdani. 

A resurfaced video this summer also revealed that the socialist candidate floated the "abolition of private property."

"My platform is that every single person should have housing, and I think, faced with these two options, the system has hundreds of thousands of people unhoused, right? For what?" Mamdani asked in a resurfaced video that has been clipped and reposted across conservative social media.

Mahmood Mamdani, the Columbia University professor and mayoral hopeful's father, has a social media presence littered with anti-Israel comments and praise for radical activists, a Fox News Digital review found.

Mamdani, 79, who Fox News Digital previously reported sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, has posted on his X account about Israel on multiple occasions, using terms like "settlers" and "colonialism."

"When all ranks of the Occupation, from the armed settler to the settler state, claim 'the right of self-defense', what language is left for those who defend themselves against the Occupation but the right to resist?" Mamdani posted online May 21, 2021, as Israel was involved in a violent conflict with Hamas.

Mamdani's father also sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing "genocide" and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers.

Mamdani's college newspaper articles also shed light on the candidate's early views on a variety of topics, including his promotion of an anti-Israel boycott and concerns about "White privilege," a Fox News Digital review found.

Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine's prestigious Bowdoin College, from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel.

He also faced ridicule for his comments at the Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, where he urged attendees not to compromise on goals like "seizing the means of production."

"Right now, if we're talking about the cancellation of student debt, if we're talking about Medicare for all, you know, these are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country," Mamdani says in a video to conference goers. 

"But then there are also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS or whether it is the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment."

Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC and Mamdani but did not immediately receive a response.

            Democratic city officials in New Orleans are clashing with Republican state leaders over President Donald Trump's threat of sending in the military to patrol streets and assist local enforcement in the Big Easy.
    


            Trump suggested Wednesday he may redirect National Guard members to New Orleans next, instead of Chicago where he has recently been threatening to surge troops – even while it's still not clear troops will show up.
    


            “So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago, or do we go to a place like New Orleans where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite tough, quite bad,” Trump told reporters. “So we're gonna be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem.”
    


            The possible deployment comes as the Trump administration increasingly targets Democrat-led cities across the nation as part of a crime fighting effort that is often paired with ramped up immigration enforcement. These often-unwanted actions have been rife with controversy, sparking lawsuits and costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
    


            The White House has not yet responded to CNN's request for more details on the possible deployment of guard members to New Orleans.
    


Judge says Trump administration's use of US military in Los Angeles violated federal law



            The City of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department touted their downward crime trends and current approach with federal partners, calling it “instrumental” in the city's “ongoing success in reducing crime.”
    


            “The City of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) continue to observe a significant reduction in crime,” the statement says, and recent data appears to corroborate that assertion.
    


            Violent crimes are trending downward in New Orleans over the past year with homicides down about 27%, a 15% decrease in reported rapes and a 16.5% drop in robberies, according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a national organization of police chiefs.
    


            New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, a Democrat who was indicted last month over allegations of trying to hide her relationship with her bodyguard, did not immediately turn down Trump's proposal or comment directly beyond the city's statement.
    


            Cantrell, who is slated to leave office in just months due to term limits, joins two other Black female mayors who have found their city in Trump's crosshairs.
    


            Both Los Angeles and Washington, DC, each led by a Black woman, have seen National Guard troops deployed in their cities. In fact, Louisiana's governor sent the state's own guard members to Washington, DC last month even as two of its own cities – Shreveport and Lafayette – have violent crime rates higher than Washington, DC's.
    


            New Orleans City council member and mayoral candidate Helena Moreno, also a Democrat, vowed to fight a federal takeover and called Trump's plans “an attack on certain cities.”
    


            “There are many cities with mayors aligned with this President whose crime issues are severe, but they're not targeted. That clearly shows that this is about scare tactics and politicizing public safety,” Moreno said.
    


            While New Orleans politics lean heavily Democratic, Louisiana is overall a Republican stronghold, including its governor, both US Senate seats and four of the six seats in the US House of Representatives. Republicans also hold a majority in both the Louisiana Senate and House.
    


            Republican leaders across the state have endorsed the idea of military involvement coming to Louisiana, specifically to New Orleans where 14 people were killed in a terror attack when a driver rammed a pickup truck into a crowd during New Year's celebrations on Bourbon Street, the famous party area in the city's historic French Quarter.
    


            While other Democratic governors have rejected Trump sending National Guard troops to their states, Louisiana's governor is embracing the idea.
    


            “We will take President Donald Trump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport,” Landry, the conservative ally of the president said Wednesday in a social media post.
    


            Gov. Landry has not immediately responded to additional questions from CNN but spoke about a possible federal crackdown in New Orleans during a Wednesday news conference at the opening of “Louisiana Lockdown,” a new immigration detention facility at a notorious state prison. 



            “President Trump is focused on getting control of our cities but not doing it the way past presidents and other administrations have done, where it's temporary. What he wants to see is permanent safety for Americans,” Landry explained.
    


            Landry launched his own crime crackdown last year sending state police to establish a presence in New Orleans.
    


            Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill also took aim at local Democrats in support of Trump's plan to deploy military to New Orleans.
    


            “Whether it's the January 1 terror attack, the Orleans Parish Jail escape, no one monitoring ankle monitors, or countless other failures - People continue to die in New Orleans because ‘leaders' refuse to accept the resources that are available to them. If your gut reaction is to reject the President's offer for assistance without condition, perhaps you're the problem - not him,” Murrill said in a statement Wednesday.
    


Here's how the nighttime escape of 10 Louisiana inmates from a New Orleans jail unfolded



            Some local leaders suggest sending in troops may not be needed and it's more of a political move.
    


            “To have a militaristic environment where tourists come to the city to enjoy the ambience, the culture, the food and the people, sends the wrong message,” Marlon Defillo, a former assistant superintendent with the New Orleans Police Department, told CNN.
    


            Defillo said local law enforcement is doing a “tremendous job” combating crime, noting that federal partners already have worked closely with local enforcement this year for big events like Super Bowl LIX and Mardis Gras.  He does not see a current need to bring in any help.
    


            “Certainly, I don't think this city has reached that level where we have to have the military position in this city,” Defillo said, adding the idea of bringing federal resources in to patrol is “political in nature.”
    


            City leaders in New Orleans go a step further to tout this as nothing but a “political stunt.”
    


            “Sending troops into Black and Brown cities is not a solution,” New Orleans Councilmember Lesli Harris responded, suggesting “if the federal government truly wants to help, it should invest in our city's ongoing programs.”
    


            Louisiana Rep. Troy A. Carter, a Democrat, believes the city has the autonomy to govern itself and is open to challenging any possible troop deployment in court.
    


            “Militarizing the streets of New Orleans is not a solution. Period,” Carter responded to Trump's threat.
    


            “I'm grateful to Gov. Landry who has had state troopers on the ground working in conjunction, collaboratively with the New Orleans Police Department. But to have a military zone created in the middle of the city of New Orleans is not necessary and I think it's actually politically motivated,” Carter told CNN's Erica Hill on Thursday.
    


            Instead, the congressman suggested additional funding for the city's district attorney, improved infrastructure at the Orleans Parish Prison and funding programs to help the root cause of crime and poverty.
    


            The Peacekeeper Global Initiative, a national grassroots organization, echoes the sentiment that bringing in national troops wouldn't solve issues for locals.
    


            Bringing in troops to curb crime without providing services for people living in poverty or creating more jobs would not solve crime issues, Dennis Muhammad, the organization's founder, tells CNN.
    


            He believes the troops would just be in the city to pursue immigrants and worries that the issues impacting violent crime in the city won't be met.

Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss a historic FBI surge to fight violent crime in St. Louis and preview his new book, 'The Last Line of Defense.'

FBI Director Kash Patel said President Donald Trump's "'Make DC Safe Again' operation is delivering real results," announcing Thursday the initiative surpassed 1,800 arrests with dozens of guns and drugs seized in recent days.

From Wednesday to Thursday morning, FBI agents reported 28 arrests, 12 gun recoveries, 10 drug seizures and 80 total arrests by federal partners.

Patel said the crackdown is taking violent criminals off the streets and restoring law and order.

"President Trump's ‘Make DC Safe Again' operation is delivering real results," Patel said. "By working hand-in-hand with our federal, state and local partners, we are taking violent criminals off the streets and restoring law and order in our nation's capital. This is exactly what it looks like when the federal government puts the safety of American families first."

DC ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TRUMP OVER NATIONAL GUARD 'INVOLUNTARY MILITARY OCCUPATION'

Trump federalized D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department Aug. 11 for 30 days under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. 

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in a memo Wednesday extended the mobilization through Nov. 30.

The federalization was set to expire next week, and an extension seemingly needed to be approved by Congress.

DC ARRESTS SURPASS 1,000 AS TRUMP-BACKED CRACKDOWN ENTERS 12TH HOMICIDE-FREE DAY

About 30 minutes after Patel released the latest figures, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb shared on X that he filed a lawsuit to curb the administration's efforts in the nation's capital, arguing the deployment of 2,300 armed National Guard troops under federal command is unlawful.

"D.C. did not request or consent to the deployment of National Guard troops. Yet there are 2,300 National Guardsmen on our streets in military gear, carrying weapons, and driving armored vehicles," Schwalb wrote in the post.

He added the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act, threatens democracy and civil liberties and damages D.C.'s economy and public trust.

The White House defended the action, saying the president acted within his authority and that the operation has been effective in combating violent crime.

Kory Krause, Frontiersman Sports owner, talks about how Robin Westman, the shooter who killed 2 schoolchildren in Minnesota, did not show any warning signs to his employees while buying a firearm, in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.

ST. LOUIS PARK, Minn. (AP) — The shooter who killed two schoolchildren and injured 21 other people at a Catholic church in Minneapolis visited a suburban gun shop the weekend before the attack, but the owner of the store said Thursday that his staff saw no warning signs in their interactions.

Gun store owner Kory Krause told The Associated Press that Robin Westman spent around 40 minutes at Frontiersman Sports in St. Louis Park on Aug. 23 and appeared completely at ease. A surveillance video showed Westman examined several guns before ultimately buying a revolver.

Westman had already passed the required background checks and had a valid permit to purchase the gun, Krause said.

The revolver wasn't one of the guns Westman used in the shootings at the Church of the Annunciation on Aug. 27, when it was full of students from the affiliated Annunciation Catholic School who had gathered for their first Mass of the academic year. Investigators recovered a semiautomatic assault-style rifle, a shotgun and a different handgun at the scene, and said Westman was legally entitled to buy them. Krause said none came from his store.

Westman, 23, attended the school for eighth grade and Westman's mother formerly worked for the parish, but investigators are still trying to determine a motive. Westman died by suicide after firing 116 rifle rounds through the church's stained-glass windows.

As first reported by KSTP-TV, the security video shows Westman handling several firearms and talking with employees and other customers. Krause wasn't in the store at the time, but he said he promptly shared the video with investigators and is cooperating with them.

Krause stressed that nothing in Westman's conduct raised any concerns among his staffers, who he said are trained to watch for warning signs.

“This person said all the right things, they checked all the right boxes, asked all the questions, they were friendly, talkative, making jokes, laughing, knowledgeable about guns, handled a lot of guns that were not the type of guns you would think are of the interest of somebody looking to do a mass shooting,” Krause told the AP.

Krause said his employees have extensive experience in picking out bad actors, straw purchasers, people who are homicidal, suicidal, mentally unstable or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He said nothing stood out with Westman.

“We're still going over it,” Krause said. “We're still scratching our heads thinking, ‘What did we miss? What could we have done?' But it always ends with the answer of ‘nothing.' There was just nothing there. And that's what makes this situation so unique.”

At a news conference Thursday at Hennepin Healthcare, a trauma hospital that treated several victims, Annunciation parent Malia Kimbrell delivered a wrenching account about her daughter's injuries and implored lawmakers to ban assault weapons.

Her 9-year-old daughter, Vivian St. Clair, was shot three times: twice in the back and once in the arm. The girl, who had been in intensive care, is now recovering at home.

“Her friend said to her, ‘Vivi, are you OK? You have a hole in your back,'” Kimbrell recounted.

Kimbrell, a nurse in the hospital's newborn intensive care unit, challenged lawmakers to ban the kind of high-powered rifles and high capacity magazines used by the shooter, saying she will “settle for nothing less.”

“I will get the names of any lawmakers who stand in the way of that happening, and I will invite you to come to my living room and insist that you hold Vivian's hand while we do her dressing changes each night and she cries the entire time,” she said. “Action is our only hope. Thinking and praying are what you do after a tragedy. Taking action is what we can do before the next tragedy occurs.”

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday he intends to call a special session of the Minnesota Legislature to address gun and school safety, and he suggested that an assault weapons ban would be on his list of proposals, which he is still developing. But it would be very difficult for anything to pass the closely divided Legislature without at least some bipartisan support.

House Republicans on Thursday released a list of proposals that lack any restrictions on access to firearms. It calls for increased funding for school security and for school resources officers, including for private schools. The proposals would also prohibit districts from banning school resource officers, as Minneapolis and some other districts have done. 

The House GOP also called for more mental health treatment beds and mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat criminals who use guns and for straw purchasers of firearms that are used in violent crimes.

Students Demand Action, an arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, is organizing school walkouts across the country for Friday to demand that state and federal lawmakers ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., facing pointed bipartisan questioning at a rancorous three-hour Senate committee hearing lobs insults as he defends efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and explain federal health agency turmoil.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced bipartisan heat in a tense Senate hearing Thursday, as Republican senators - two of them medical doctors - pointedly questioned Kennedy's vaccine policies. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso warned he's “grown deeply concerned.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A contentious three-hour hearing between U.S. senators and Robert Kennedy Jr. devolved into multiple screaming matches on Thursday as the nation's health secretary fended off accusations about sweeping changes he's made to vaccines, health care policy and leadership.

The oversight hearing in the Senate Finance Committee was a chance for senators to seek answers from Kennedy on recent high-profile departures at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the appointment of vaccine critics to an influential federal advisory committee and changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations that will make it harder for many Americans to get the shots.

Both Democrats and Republicans came out swinging. They questioned whether he would keep his earlier promise that he wouldn't block vaccines for Americans who wanted them. A frustrated Kennedy dismissed those arguments but also sowed doubt on vaccine safety and effectiveness from the prominent perch on Capitol Hill.

Here are some key takeaways from the hearing:




Kennedy repeatedly disputed the account of fired CDC director Susan Monarez, who was abruptly removed from her post last week after less than a month on the job. Monarez was nominated by President Donald Trump, endorsed for the job by Kennedy and confirmed by a Senate vote in July.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Monarez reiterated that she was told to “preapprove” recommendations by Kennedy's handpicked vaccine advisers, many of whom have records of questioning basic vaccine science.

“I asked her: ‘Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said ‘No,'” Kennedy stated, explaining his change of opinion on Monarez. “If you had an employee who told you they weren't trustworthy, would you ask them to resign?”

An attorney representing Monarez called Kennedy's statements “false” and “patently ridiculous,” in a written statement. Her attorney said she would repeat the allegations in her Wall Street Journal op-ed under oath.

Later in the hearing, Kennedy acknowledged that he'd told Monarez to fire several senior CDC officials. Throughout the hearing, Kennedy accused the agency's scientists of failing to combat chronic disease and making unsound recommendations during the pandemic.

“The people who at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving,” Kennedy said.

For Kennedy, tough questions from angry senators were an opportunity to fight back.

Throughout the hearing, a resolute Kennedy accused senators of lying, misrepresenting his agency and making little sense. As a result, questioning from Democratic senators repeatedly turned into yelling matches.

“You're just making stuff up,” Kennedy told Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, after she accused him of “blaming school shootings on antidepressants.” The health secretary said on Fox News after the recent Minnesota shooting that antidepressants could potentially contribute to violence, and said his agency was investigating. While critics of antidepressants have long alleged they may increase homicidal behavior, the link is not supported by multiple, large clinical trials of the drugs.

When Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia questioned Kennedy about his disparaging rhetoric about CDC employees before a recent deadly shooting at the agency, Kennedy retorted: “Are you complicit in the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Kennedy said Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico was “talking gibberish” when the Democrat asked him about the details of his agency's autism research.

“Mr. Secretary, let me speak slowly and clearly so that you can understand me through my New Mexico accent,” Luján responded.

Democratic senators pressed Kennedy on recent changes narrowing the approval of annual COVID-19 shots. He repeatedly disputed or denied their accusations.

Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated shots but only for seniors or younger people with underlying health risks. That's sparked confusion and frustration from many Americans, including parents interested in vaccinating healthy children against the virus.

“Why have you acted behind closed doors to overrule scientists and limit the freedom of parents to choose the COVID vaccine for their children?” Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire asked.

“This is crazy talk,” Kennedy responded. Later, he acknowledged that access to vaccines at pharmacies “depends on the state.”

In many states, pharmacists are legally barred from administering vaccines outside the uses endorsed by the CDC's advisory panel, prompting CVS and other pharmacy chains to turn away people seeking shots in certain states.

“You promised that you would not take away vaccines from anyone who wanted them,” said Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“I'm not taking them away from people,” Kennedy said, noting that healthy Americans who want a shot should still be able to get one if a doctor prescribes one. Typically, Americans do not need to see a doctor for annual vaccine updates.

Until this year, the FDA and CDC had recommended yearly COVID vaccinations for everyone ages 6 months and up.

Kennedy could not be pinned down on basic facts and statistics, particularly when it came to vaccines and COVID-19.

In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner, Kennedy claimed nobody knows how many Americans have died from COVID-19 because of a lack of government data.

Both the CDC and the World Health Organization have concluded that approximately 1.2 million Americans have died from the virus.

“The secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from COVID,” said Warner, a Virginia Democrat. “How can you be that ignorant?”

Republicans also pressed Kennedy on his assessment of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump-led initiative that rapidly developed COVID vaccines in the first year of the pandemic. Trump has long claimed success for the effort, while acknowledging unsubstantiated theories that mass vaccinations may have caused more harm than good.

Kennedy has said it's unclear how many lives were saved by the vaccines because of imperfect data collected by the CDC and vaccine makers.

Nevertheless, when questioned by Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana — a physician whose vote was key in Kennedy's nomination — about Operation Warp Speed, Kennedy agreed that Trump “absolutely” deserved a Nobel Prize.

Senate Republicans were more aggressive with Kennedy than they have been with most of Trump's top officials, with several asking pointed questions about his efforts to limit access to vaccines. 

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, also a doctor and the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had grown “deeply concerned” that some vaccines could be in jeopardy after Kennedy had cut research funding and fired the CDC director. 

“Americans don't know who to rely on,” Barrasso said. 

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis read off a list of questions for Kennedy that he said he wanted answered after the hearing, including where the health secretary stands on the COVID-19 vaccine.

            President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday that will change the name of the Defense Department to the Department of War, a White House official told CNN.
    


            It's a move that the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have previewed in recent days, including Trump in the Oval Office last week when he told reporters his administration was going to “change the name.”
    


            “We call it the Department of Defense, but between us, I think we're gonna change the name,” the president told reporters on August 25.
    


            “We won the World War 1, World War 2 - it was called the Department of War, and to me, that's really what it is. Defense is a part of that, but I have a feeling we're gonna be changing.”
    


            The news about Friday's order was first reported by Fox News.
    


            While at Fort Benning on Thursday, Hegseth indicated the name change would be coming on Friday.
    


            “I would say standby tomorrow,” Hegseth said when asked about a potential change. “It's something that — words matter. Titles matter. Cultures matter. And George Washington founded the War Department. We'll see.”
    


            The last time the department's name was changed took an act of Congress. CNN has reached out to the White House about how it would change the name this time.
    


            The Department of War, as it as once called, was first established by President George Washington when he founded the country's Army. But the name was later changed in 1949 as part of a broader reorganization of the military under President Harry Truman.
    


            Truman signed the National Security Act in 1947, which merged the Department of the Navy, the newly created Department of the Air Force, and the Department of the Army — previously the Department of War, according to the Army — into one organization called the National Military Establishment, under the civilian secretary of defense. The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense in August 1949.
    


            The National Security Act also established the Joint Chiefs of Staff as an organization to advise the president on military planning and strategy.
    


            The effort to rename the Pentagon follows a number of similar steps by Hegseth to change the names of bases and ships. He reversed a Biden-era decision that had removed Confederate-era names of bases like Fort Bragg and Fort Hood, reverting to those titles but officially naming them after different individuals with the same names.
    


            In June, Hegseth also ordered the renaming of an oiler ship named after gay rights activist and Navy veteran Harvey Milk.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum' s strategy of managing a tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump may be running up against wider regional tensions and lack of willingness by the Trump administration to make concessions, experts say.

Since Trump took office, the freshly elected Mexican president has been lauded, and even dubbed a sort of “Trump whisperer,” for being able to offset the brunt of U.S. tariffs that have dealt a blow to other foreign economies. Sheinbaum has done so by cracking down on cartels with a heavier hand than her predecessor, delivering dozens of cartel affiliates to American authorities and pointing to lower fentanyl seizures at the U.S. border. 

It was an exchange she said Thursday that she hoped to formalize. When the two leaders spoke in February, Trump tied the fentanyl coming from Mexico to the tariff threat, she said. 

“So what do we propose?” Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference Thursday. “If this problems reduces, then we evidently want to see that 25% (tariff) shrink.”

But now, observers say Sheinbaum is increasingly backed against a wall. Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, said Sheinbaum is now having to walk “a fine line” with Trump that appears to only be getting more complicated.

“There's a sort of uncertainty that hangs over the relationship,” Shifter said. “Sheinbaum likely feels incredibly frustrated because she has taken major steps toward dealing with the cartels. And it never seems to be enough to satisfy Trump.”

Just a day before, Sheinbaum met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during his visit to Mexico, in which the leaders discussed security issues and agreed to continue working together to combat crime. 

For weeks, Sheinbaum had been gunning to sign a formal security agreement with the U.S. underscoring the importance of respecting Mexican sovereignty, with the hope of setting clear rules amid Trump's volatile foreign policy tactics. 

The push for the security deal came as Sheinbaum has repeatedly and publicly rejected offers by the Trump administration to send U.S. troops to fight cartels. Her meeting with Rubio came just after the Trump administration carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 people it claimed were trafficking drugs to the U.S., something Rubio said was meant as a warning. 

“I think the idea behind having an agreement is creating and building parameters,” said Carin Zissis, Washington interim director of the Council of the Americas. “You can see why Claudia Sheinbaum would be emphasizing sovereignty when on the way to visiting Mexico, Secretary Rubio was highlighting a U.S. military attack on an alleged vessel in the Caribbean.”

“U.S. boots on the ground, that's a very concrete concern from the Mexican side,” she said.

But by Wednesday's meeting, it was clear the two governments were not going to sign a formal agreement. Instead, they announced a high-level group of Mexican and U.S. officials who would monitor their cooperation. It was unclear how much of a change that would actually make, given the fact that Mexican officials have been meeting regularly with the Trump administration since January.

“That seems like a fancy term that means nothing, but it means a lot,” Rubio said of the newly established joint group.

Palmira Tapia, a political analyst for Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said it was a sign that while Sheinbaum was following through on promises to crack down on cartels, Trump was not likely to make many concessions to the Mexican leader. 

Just last month, Trump glibly told press that “Mexico does what we tell them to do” and last week said that while he liked Sheinbaum, he believed that Mexico was still run by cartels.

“There aren't really any incentives for Trump,” Tapia said. “Because his winning strategy has been to get what he wants with the threat of tariffs.” 

It's left Sheinbaum with few alternatives at a time when tensions have peaked in Latin America due to the U.S. strike in the Caribbean. 

The move ruffled the feathers of a number of leaders across Latin America, who still grapple with the complicated legacy and violent fallout of past American intervention in the region. Following the meeting with Rubio, Mexico's government once again reminded the Trump administration of the importance of operating in the region “without subordination” and respecting allies.

However, Zissis and other observers said that while the Trump administration has showed little willingness to cede ground, Sheinbaum does have a few cards up her sleeve. 

One, long used by Mexico's government, has been helping the U.S. in block migratory flows north. The other is Sheinbaum's soaring level of popularity in Mexico, where polls show she boasts anywhere between 70% to 80% approval.

At the same time, they said Sheinbaum has little room to radically shift her strategy toward Trump.

“It's a very delicate balance, because at the same time that she's handled this relationship so well, so much is at stake for Mexico,” Zissis said.

Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting push amid the nationwide battle over congressional remapping on ‘Fox Report.'

In the latest development in the mid-decade redistricting showdown between Democrats and Republicans, a Texas congressman is suing California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over an "unconstitutional and retaliatory" redistricting bill he signed in August. 

The lawsuit, which was filed by Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleges that the Newsom-backed Election Rigging Response Act, passed in response to Texas' redistricting plans, "is a plainly unconstitutional and retaliatory piece of legislation targeted against Texas, its citizens, and its congressional delegation."

The suit names Newsom and California Secretary of State Shirley Weber as the defendants. 

Jackson is seeking to block Newsom's California redistricting law, which, if enacted by voters in November, would favor Democrats on the basis that it was specifically designed to nullify a recently passed Texas redistricting law that was backed by President Donald Trump and favors Republicans. 

In his suit, Jackson argues that "California's scheme alters Congress' power dynamics in a way that harms the citizens of Texas" and that "if California's plan succeeds, Democrats could net several additional House seats from California in 2026, potentially determining the majority in 2027."

He claims that in passing the redistricting law, California violated the elections and guarantee clauses of the U.S. Constitution by violating its own state constitution, which "entrusts redistricting to the independent Citizens Commission and explicitly forbids drawing districts to favor or discriminate against a political party." 

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Jackson's office claimed that while Texas followed its state constitution, California violated its constitution "in a desperate attempt to undercut President Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms."

Jackson, a retired Navy rear admiral who served as President Donald Trump's physician during Trump's first term, told Fox News Digital Newsom's redistricting push "betrays every citizen who trusted him." 

"Gavin Newsom's deranged obsession with destroying President Trump has turned him into a lawless tyrant who violates California's own constitution and betrays every citizen who trusted him with the responsibility of running their state," said Jackson.

"I refuse to stand by while this partisan extremist weaponizes his office, silencing the will of the American people while betraying the state he took an oath to protect, all in the name of retaliating against Texas voters and the recent LEGAL redistricting process in Texas," he added. 

Newsom's office declined Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

In August, Newsom, a rumored frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, signed into law a set of bills to allow voters to decide whether to overturn the preexisting congressional maps and the state's independent redistricting commission, ushering in a new one with a more partisan bent.

The bills, sent to Newsom by the Democrat-dominated California legislature, are part of an effort in the blue state to nullify Texas' new congressional map with one of their own. The bills allow California voters to decide in a special election on Nov. 4 whether to allow the state to suspend its bipartisan redistricting commission and replace the current districts with a map drawn up by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Speaking at a press conference after the bills' passage, Newsom accused Trump of being "one of the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history" and claimed "he recognizes he will lose the election, Congress will go back in the hands of the Democratic Party next November."

Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) have proposed using the “speech and debate clause” in the Constitution to expose the clients of Jeffrey Epstein‘s alleged sex trafficking ring.

Greene, one of four Republicans who have signed onto a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill that would require a full release of the files related to the convicted sex offender, said Wednesday she would read the names on the House floor if Epstein's victims provide them. 

“That was Marjorie's innovation, was that that would be a good way to get the names out without endangering the survivors,” Massie told the Washington Examiner on Thursday. 

Although this clause is enacted on the floor at all times, it is not often used in cases similar to this one. Greene and Massie have expressed their understanding of the fear of sharing names, saying the people on the potential list could “sue these women into poverty and homelessness.” 

“In Jeffrey Epstein's home and the places they went with him, they saw the most powerful people in the world in his pictures, and they saw him with those people,” Greene said at the press conference. “Can you imagine how terrifying it would be to name names like that?” 

The speech and debate clause, under Article 1, Section 6, of the Constitution, gives members of Congress immunity to read the list of names aloud without ramifications in court for defamation. 

“The general purpose of the speech and debate clause is to protect members of Congress from having to worry that anything they say in the course of legislative activities will implicate them in a lawsuit,” Middle Tennessee State University's Free Speech Center wrote. 

This idea sparked after Epstein accuser, Lisa Phillips, said a group of survivors debated publishing a list of clients if the Department of Justice does not release more of the criminal case files. Epstein died in jail in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on charges related to sex trafficking, in what the DOJ deemed a suicide. Other survivors expressed that they back this effort but shared the sentiment that the duty falls to the DOJ to release information, as many of them remain fearful of their safety. 

“It's a scary thing to name names, but I will tell you, I'm not afraid to name names, and so if they want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the House floor and I'll say every damn name that abused these women,” Greene said. “I can do that for them.”

Massie backed Greene's idea in a post on X, while some Democrats have also expressed support.

Survivors at our press conference announced they are privately compiling their own Epstein list.They would be sued into homelessness for naming names, but @RepMTG and I are willing to name names in the House of Representatives under Constitutional “speech or debate” immunity.

“Obviously, putting forward new names would open them up to significant lawsuits, so that is a good solution that they mentioned,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) told the Washington Examiner.

“I think any and all ideas related to this issue, if people want to work together, we're very open to it,” she said. 

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) filed a so-called “discharge petition” this week to force a House vote on their Epstein Files Transparency Act, which calls for the full release of the criminal files with redactions to protect the victims.

The House Oversight Committee released 33,000 pages of DOJ files on Epstein this week, just hours after the discharge petition opened, but critics say it's not enough.

The discharge petition must reach 218 signatures for it to force the speaker to call a vote on the underlying legislation. Most, if not all, Democrats are expected to sign the petition, meaning only six Republicans would need to cross party lines to add their names. Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Nancy Mace (R-SC), and Greene signed on to the discharge petition after Mace left a House Oversight Committee meeting on Tuesday with the victims in tears after hearing their stories of abuse. 

Mace used the speech and debate clause earlier this year in a rare instance to speak out about her experience with sexual assault. She detailed accusations of sexual abuse, where she accused four men of rape, sex trafficking, and other sex crimes against her and other female victims.

“I rise today to call out the cowards who think they can prey on women and get away with it. Today, I'm going scorched earth. So let the bridges I burn this evening light our way forward,” she said on the House floor.

SIX TAKEAWAYS FROM EPSTEIN SURVIVORS SPEAKING OUT ON CAPITOL HILL

Mace told the Washington Examiner she supports Greene and Massie's use of this clause to protect the survivors while also holding the people involved accountable. The congresswoman listed other ways she and House leadership could protect the victims while getting those names out there. 

“I think using whatever tools constitutionally are necessary, but also in a deposition-type setting, if we as members of Congress asked questions about the name and they would be required to answer it, that would shield the victims from and provide some level of, I think, immunity for them as well,” she said.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the military is going back to basics on 'The Will Cain Show.'

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Friday to alter the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, reverting to the agency's former namesake, Fox News Digital has learned. 

Both Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have recently indicated they want to change the name of the agency. It is one of several initiatives the Trump administration has spearheaded as part of its "warrior ethos" campaign within the Pentagon. 

A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday that Trump would roll out the name change Friday. The executive order calls for using the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense, along with phrases like "secretary of war" for Hegseth, according to a White House fact sheet. 

The order also instructs Hegseth to propose both legislative and executive actions to make the name permanently U.S. Department of War.

Likewise, implementing the order will require modifications to public-facing websites and office signage at the Pentagon, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the "Pentagon War Annex," according to a White House official. Other longer-term projects also are in the works, the official said. 

Trump signaled in recent days the change was imminent. 

"Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "Then we changed it to Department of Defense."

Hegseth, who Trump already has referred to on occasion as the "secretary of war," also expressed similar sentiments and said the change would reflect a broader, cultural shift within the Pentagon.

"We won WWI, and we won WWII, not with the Department of Defense, but with a War Department, with the Department of War," Hegseth said in an interview Wednesday with "Fox & Friends." "As the president has said, we're not just defense, we're offense.

"We've reestablished at the Department the warrior ethos. We want warriors, folks that understand how to exact lethality on the enemy," he said. "We don't want endless contingencies and just playing defense. We think words and names and titles matter. So, we're working with the White House and the president on it. Stand by." 

The U.S. employed the Department of War title for its military agency until 1949, when it was renamed the Department of Defense in accordance with a series of massive reforms included in the National Security Act of 1947.

It's unclear if Congress, which has the authority to establish federal executive departments, will need to step in to issue final approval on the move. However, Trump previously has voiced confidence that he doesn't need approval from lawmakers and that they will get on board if necessary. 

"We're just going to do it," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that."

FBI Director Kash Patel discusses the move outside the Hoover building and responding to foreign threats on 'Special Report.'

FBI Director Kash Patel said his agents thwarted a potential tragedy after arresting a North Carolina man who allegedly threatened online to massacre dozens of Black children at a preschool.

Zachary Charles Newell, 25, of Newport, was arrested Monday and is charged with interstate threat to kidnap or injure, according to a criminal complaint filed Sept. 2 in the Eastern District of North Carolina.

"Threats of violence against children are beyond unacceptable acts of cowardice," Patel wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The FBI worked quickly with our partners in Carteret County to ensure this individual was taken into custody before he could act. Parents should know we will never hesitate to respond with urgency to protect their kids, their schools, and their communities."

Prosecutors allege Newell posted a comment on YouTube under the username "CommentatorsHateMe" on Aug. 27, stating his intention to "shoot up" a preschool, injuring or killing 20 Black children, among other violent and racist threats.

The day before, he allegedly posted another vicious, race-related threat under the same account, which included a number of slurs, according to the complaint.

Google LLC reported the threats to the FBI's National Threat Operations Center on Aug. 31, having linked the "CommentatorsHateMe" account to an email registered to Newell, with associated phone numbers and an address.

Law enforcement traced the account's IP address to Charter Communications in Newport, and on Aug. 31, Carteret County Sheriff's Office deputies confronted Newell at his home. 

Newell allegedly admitted to making the YouTube comment, according to the complaint.

A search warrant was executed at his home, and he was initially charged in state court with communicating a threat of mass violence on educational property.

The Carteret County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital Newell was given a $30,000 bond by a state magistrate, where he was able to post bond.

Later that evening, the sheriff's office worked with the FBI to take him into federal custody on federal charges. Additional charges will be forthcoming by the FBI.

FBI North Carolina special agent in charge James C. Barnacle Jr. told Fox News Digital every child deserves to go to school without fear.

"Your FBI will work with local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to investigate threats directed at schools," Barnacle wrote in a statement. "This federal charge should be a warning to anyone who believes they can sit anonymously behind a keyboard and make violent threats."

The sheriff's office said there were no specific preschools or educational properties mentioned in the threats, and there is no active threat of violence at any Carteret County schools.

"The comments posted by this suspect were violent, hateful and shocking to the conscience," Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Our office worked swiftly to take this subject into custody and worked with the [FBI] to subsequently have him placed into federal custody. … Suspects who make these types of comments will be dealt with as severely as the law allows."

The contents of the suspect's alleged comments were not included in this report due to their highly disturbing nature.

Fox News Digital spoke with Mykel Hawke, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, author and television and film personality, on the ongoing manhunts in Washington state and Montana for Travis Decker and Michael Brown.

The FBI said Wednesday that remains discovered during last week's grid search for fugitive father Travis Decker were reviewed and found to not be human.

Officials recovered bones during their two-day search of Washington campgrounds on Aug. 25-26 as part of the manhunt for Decker, the man accused of murdering his three young daughters. The bones were analyzed and found to not be of human origin, according to a statement Wednesday from W. Mike Herrington, special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle field office.

"During the search, personnel recovered multiple bones, including those that required additional examination to determine if they were animal or human," Herrington said in the statement. "Central Washington University has reviewed the bones and assessed that they are not human."

While the 250-acre search of the Rock Island Campground near Leavenworth did not lead to any direct evidence of Decker's location, it provided investigators with additional information, officials said.

"While we do not anticipate further updates related to this specific search, the investigation continues," Herrington said. "This extensive search was just one step in a three-month process by a variety of agencies to locate Travis Decker, discover signs of his whereabouts or find any other evidence of the murder of his three daughters."

A spokesperson for the FBI Seattle field office told Fox News Digital in an email that, as of Thursday, the agency has "discovered no evidence to indicate that Travis Decker is alive or dead."

Decker, an Army veteran with survival expertise, has evaded capture for more than three months.

Authorities began searching for him on June 2, when he failed to return his daughters — Paityn, 9, Evelyn, 8, and Olivia, 5 — to their mother after a scheduled visitation. The children's bodies were discovered near Rock Island Campground along Icicle Creek with bags over their heads. Autopsies confirmed they died of suffocation, and their deaths were ruled homicides.

The U.S. Marshals Service is offering up to $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of Decker. Authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous.

Dramatic video shows a brand-new luxury yacht sinking just minutes after it was launched off the coast of Turkey, forcing its crew to leap overboard.

According to reports, the new $1 million vessel, an 85-foot cruiser named Dolce Vento, was launched Tuesday in the Ereğli district of Zonguldak, a port city on Turkey's Black Sea. 

The amateur video shows the boat being pushed into the ocean down a track on the beach and then swaying within 15 minutes of setting off.

As bystanders watched, the luxury yacht lurched to one side, tilting dangerously before taking on water.

Chaos erupted as people on board had to scramble onto the sloping deck. As the vessel sank quickly, they were forced to dive into the sea.

One clip shows a man in a dark suit standing on the vessel's side before springing into the water.

The Turkish Coast Guard and port teams reportedly rushed to the scene, setting up a security perimeter around the capsized craft as it slipped further into the water, per TMZ.

According to TMZ, a spokesperson for the shipyard hosting the yacht, Med Yilmaz, said the cause of the disaster is under investigation.

Technical inspections will be carried out to determine whether a construction flaw, balance issue or human error doomed the luxury vessel.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal magistrate judge on Thursday angrily accused top Justice Department prosecutors of trampling on the civil rights of people arrested during President Donald Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital.

Judge Zia Faruqui, a former federal prosecutor, said leaders of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office have tarnished its reputation with how they are handling the deluge of cases. He said Pirro's office is routinely bringing cases that don't belong in federal court and needlessly keeping people in jail for days while they evaluate charges.

“It's not fair to say they're losing credibility. We're past that now,” Faruqui said. He later added, “There's no credibility left.”

Pirro has been critical of Faruqui, one of four magistrates at the district court in Washington. On Thursday, she responded to Faruqui's latest remarks by saying the judge “has repeatedly indicated his allegiance to those who violate the law and carry illegal guns.”

“This judge took an oath to follow the law, yet he has allowed his politics to consistently cloud his judgment and his requirement to follow the law,” she said in a statement posted on social media. “America voted for safe communities, law and order, and this judge is the antithesis of that.”

The clash between the judge and the top federal prosecutor for Washington marks an escalation in the Trump administration's ongoing showdown with the federal judiciary. Trump has repeatedly attacked the courts and challenged their authority since he returned to office in January. But it's rare for a prosecutor to publicly criticize a judge by name, as doing so could damage the office's relationship with the federal bench.




The judge lambasted Pirro's office during a hearing at which he agreed to dismiss the federal case against a man accused of threatening to kill Trump while in police custody. The defendant, Edward Alexander Dana, spent more than a week in jail before a federal grand jury refused to indict him.

It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to balk at returning an indictment, but it has happened at least seven times in five cases since Trump's surge started nearly a month ago. Faruqui said it is ironic that “an occupying force is at the mercy of the occupants” serving on the grand juries.

Faruqui said there is no precedent for what is happening at the courthouse over the past few weeks. He said Trump administration officials are frequently touting the arrest figures on social media with seemingly no regard for how the arrests are affecting people's lives.

“Where are the stats on the people illegally detained?” he asked.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Conor Mulroe said prosecutors from Pirro's office are working around the clock on the influx of new cases.

“You are busy because you all have created this mess,” he told Mulroe. “I'm not saying it's your problem. It's your office's problem.”

Mulroe was the only representative of Pirro's office who attended Thursday's hearing. Faruqui questioned why Pirro or her top deputies “don't have the dignity to come here” and defend their charging decisions.

“That's what leaders do,” he said.

The White House says over 1,800 people have been arrested since the operation started Aug. 7. Over 40 cases have been filed in district court, which hears the most serious federal offenses, including assault, gun and drug charges.

Dana was jailed for approximately a week after his arrest on Aug. 17. A different judge ordered his release on Aug. 25. On Thursday, Pirro's office opted to drop the federal case against Dana but charge him with misdemeanors, including destruction of property and attempted threats, in D.C. Superior Court.

Dana's attorney, assistant federal public defender Elizabeth Mullin, said prosecutors should have known that this case didn't belong in federal court.

“A 15-year-old would know,” she said. “It was obvious from the outset.”

Dana was arrested on suspicion of damaging a light fixture at a restaurant. An officer was driving Dana to a police station when he threatened to kill Trump, according to a Secret Service agent's affidavit. Dana also told police that he was intoxicated that night. Mullin said Dana's “hyperbolic rambling” didn't amount to a criminal threat.

Faruqui ordered prosecutors to file a brief explaining why they didn't immediately inform him of its charging decisions in Dana's case. The judge apologized to Dana “on behalf of the court” and suggested that Pirro's office also owes Dana an apology.

Pirro said in an earlier statement that a grand jury's refusal to indict somebody for threatening to kill the president “is the essence of a politicized jury.”

“The system here is broken on many levels,” she said. “Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a specific threat to kill the president, the grand jury in D.C. refuses to even let the judicial process begin. Justice should not depend on politics.”

TORONTO (AP) — “I wish I had more bad things to say about him,” Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary “John Candy: I Like Me.”

It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like “Planes, Trains and Automobiles,” “Uncle Buck” and “The Great Outdoors,” he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, “He was a total actor because he was a total person.”

“John Candy: I Like Me,” directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was “Johnny Toronto,” the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy's cameo in “The Blues Brothers,” it's an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.

“I can't tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,” Hanks says. “And I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.”

“John Candy: I Like Me,” which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, “I Like Me” is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.




“Part of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,” Reynolds says. “He left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That's the thing that stays.”

Hanks, Reynolds and Candy's children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of “John Candy: I Like Me,” the title of which comes from one of Candy's most memorable lines from “Trains, Planes and Automobiles.” But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.

Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: “He was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn't make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.”

“He left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,” says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. “That would be through the way he raised us and also saying it's OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.”

For the Candys, “I Like Me” is an extremely emotional experience but one they're grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father's loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father's grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father's talent.

For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.

“I jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,” she says. “For me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his ‘Radio Kandy' show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.”

Hanks, whose directorial work includes the 2015 documentary “All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,” wanted to find a thread for the film that went beyond tribute. To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of “Splash.”

“I have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents' friends, someone they worked with,” says Hanks. “He had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.”

“I had been on the periphery of the most intense fame you can have, as well as a much smaller version myself,” adds Hanks. “It is an adjustment. It is hard to navigate. Not that it's not amazing and great, but that idea of how much you can actually give of yourself to people.”

Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy's since growing up watching “SCTV” reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.

“I feel like in the bigger movies I'm always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from “Planes, Trains,” says Reynolds. “I tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.”

As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the “Deadpool” films. In one moment, he utters the “I like me,” albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene.

“I like having him around,” says Reynolds. “I feel safer. I feel better. I also feel maybe just a skosh more honest.”

“John was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that's an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it's perfection,” Reynolds adds. “It's like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody's willing to suck at anything.”

For Jennifer and Chris, “John Candy: I Like Me,” awash in memories of their father,” is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured. 

“I'm fortunate that I will always have this,” says Chris. “And I love it for that.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Demolition to build President Donald Trump's new ballroom off the East Wing of the White House can begin without approval of the commission tasked with vetting construction of federal buildings, the Trump-appointed head of the panel said Thursday.

Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary, said during a public meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission that the board does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.

“What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,” Scharf said. He called Trump's promised ballroom “one of the most exciting construction projects in the modern history of” Washington. 

He made the comments during the only public meeting of the commission scheduled before crews are expected to break ground on a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom likely to greatly alter the look and size of both the White House's East and West Wings. 

The planning commission is responsible for approving construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. But Scharf made a distinction between demolition work and rebuilding, saying the commission was only required to vet the latter.

“I think any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been, or it will be, is simply false,” he said. 




Scharf said the White House hadn't yet submitted building plans for the White House renovations but when that happens, “I'm excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so.”

Asked after the meeting if the eventual approval process might delay work on the ballroom, Scharf said, “Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you're talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process.”

“Given the president's history as a builder, and given the plans that we've seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” Scharf said.

L. Preston Bryant Jr., who was appointed to chair the National Capital Planning Commission in 2009 by President Barack Obama and served in that role for nine years, said proposed projects typically worked in four major stages of commission approval that began “with an early consultation, where a project is very much conceptual.” 

That hasn't been the case with Trump's promised ballroom. 

“The White House and its design team would be very, very wise to involve NCPC and its staff very much on the front end of the project – in the early design stages – as it'll make for a better project and help ensure it meets all regulatory and legal compliances,” Bryant said. “I cannot stress enough the value to be had at the conceptual and early consultation stages.”

Trump has been anxious to hustle toward work beginning on the ballroom, with an eye toward completing it prior to his leaving office in January 2029. A building mogul before he was a reality TV star and politician, has relished personally overseeing improvement projects at the White House and walked last month on the building's roof with construction officials.

The ballroom will be the latest change introduced to what's known as “The People's House” since Trump returned to office in January, and the first structural change to the Executive Mansion itself since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.

Trump already has substantially redecorated the Oval Office through the addition of golden flourishes and cherubs, presidential portraits and other items, and installed massive flagpoles on the north and south lawns to fly the American flag. The lawn in the Rose Garden was paved over with stone and patio tables reminiscent of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, complete with exterior speakers. 

Scharf also used the meeting to argue that the Federal Reserve had flouted planning board jurisdiction while undertaking major renovations to its building. Trump has for months called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to resign, and has specifically decried the long-planned building project for going well over budget.

The Fed has posted on its website that the designs for the original improvement plans to its building were previously approved by the planning commission, and that it “does not regard” subsequent changes made to the original plan as being major enough to warrant “further review.” 

But Scharf said he'd be sending a letter to the Fed “noting my severe concerns” and accusing the central bank of arguing it essentially had the right to do “whatever the heck it wants on its property. They could build an amusement park on their property and no one would have any qualms.”

A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday. 

Scharf said after the meeting of Fed officials, “I'm hopeful that they'll see the light of day and come back in and re-present their construction project as they should have up front.”

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday condemned rumors that President Donald Trump is getting involved in the race to defeat his candidacy to become the Big Apple's first socialist leader. 

“This is… about an affront to our democracy, an affront to what makes so many of us proud to be Americans, that we choose our own leaders, not that they get to pick themselves, not that they get to be picked by the president of the United States,” Mamdani said. “We know that this city will decide its own future, and we know that it is New Yorkers that we will turn to make that decision in November, not the White House in Washington, D.C.”

His words come after Politico and the New York Times reported this week that the Trump administration had contacted New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa, who are running against Mamdani, and floated federal positions for them if they agreed to drop out of the race. Both Sliwa and Adams have refuted the reports, which allege the Trump administration believes clearing the field could consolidate support for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's campaign. 

“I am angry. I'm angry because so often we think of this solely in terms of the dynamics of politics,” Mamdani said during a press conference. “But the reason that so many New Yorkers are fed up with politics as they know it is because of news like this, backroom deals, corrupt agreements, all of which serve to increase the sense of disaffection and despair as it pertains to how people feel about politics across this country, and to know that having defeated Andrew Cuomo by 13 points, having won the votes of close to 600,000 New Yorkers, has only been understood by that former government as an invitation to collaborate with Donald Trump.” 

As it stands, some Republicans fear the campaign could be Mamdani's to win because the race is split four ways between him, Adams, Cuomo, and Sliwa. Independent mayoral candidate Jim Walden dropped out of the race on Wednesday, urging other candidates “trailing in the polls” to suspend their campaigns and allow one contender a better chance of challenging Mamdani in November to defeat his chances of governing the country's largest city. 

Adams and Cuomo are both running on independent lines and are viewed as the leading contenders to Mamdani. Sliwa is campaigning as a Republican and is unlikely to make a competitive challenge to the socialist, whose rise has alarmed moderates on both sides of the aisle. 

Although polling looks fairly grim for the candidates opposing Mamdani, the Trump administration reportedly believes Cuomo has a better chance of defeating him than Adams, despite the former governor losing to the socialist congressman in the city's Democratic primary earlier this year. A recent poll showed Mamdani winning the race in nearly every scenario except a head-to-head matchup with Cuomo.

Trump said in July that Cuomo has “a shot” of winning if he runs a “tough” campaign. White House officials have declined to comment to media outlets about the veracity of reports that the Trump administration floated a job offer to Adams at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in exchange for bowing out of his reelection bid.

In the wake of reports that Adams was offered a federal position during a Monday trip to Florida, where the president maintains a private residence, the mayor said Wednesday that he met with “several elected officials” during the visit but said the question of whether he would take a job in the Trump administration was “hypothetical.”

“If there's any changes in this race, I will announce that,” the incumbent mayor said. “Whenever I make a move, I'll make an announcement.”

Cuomo said Thursday that his staff has not been in touch with Trump to “clear the field” for him to beat Mamdani in November.

“I read the rumors, but no, it is up to Mayor Adams whether or not he wants to run or get out of the race,” Cuomo said during a campaign stop. “If he doesn't want to run, then he'll decide what to do next in his career.”

            A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
    


            On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. A preliminary injunction is a temporary order put in place until a court can make a final decision in a case.
    


            “After careful consideration, we grant the defendants' motions and we stay the preliminary injunction and the underlying case itself pending appeal,” ruled the divided three-judge panel in the majority opinion.
    


            The makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure.
    


            Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier called the stay a “victory against an activist judge” in a social media post.

            “The 11th Circuit not only blocked Judge (Kathleen) Williams' order to close Alligator Alcatraz, but they blocked her from proceeding with the case until the appeal is complete. A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!”
    


            In a major blow for the plaintiffs – environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – and their key legal argument, the judges ruled the detention facility is operated by the state, not the federal government, and therefore falls outside the obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA, signed by President Richard Nixon, is considered one of the foundational environmental laws formed at the beginning of the modern environmental movement.
    


            “The Facility is a site built, led, operated, and funded unilaterally by a state government—in accordance with the state's laws—at which the state retains discretionary control over who is detained at the facility, all of which adds up to state control over the project's outcome, not federal control,” said the majority in the order.
    


            The majority noted Florida could eventually seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but until such funding is formally approved, the project does not qualify as a “major federal action” that would trigger NEPA's environmental review requirements.
    


            A single judge on the Atlanta-based panel dissented saying he would have let William's shutdown order stay in place in what should have been a “relatively simple denial” of the state's motion.
    


            The dissenting judge agreed with the lower court that the plaintiffs face irreparable harm and stressed that testimony and official statements showed the detention site was a federal project in practice.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security requested the facility, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspected the facility and both DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis publicly said the federal government would fund it. That, the judge argued, makes it a “major federal action” subject to environmental review.
    


            Eve Samples, the executive director for Friends of the Everglades – a plaintiff in the environmental lawsuit – told CNN “the case is far from over.”
    


            “In fact, it's just starting, and we're committed to fighting on,” she said. “We're hopeful that the appeal of the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it's reviewed on its merits during the appeal.”
    


            Elise Bennett, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another plaintiff in the case, described the ruling as a “heartbreaking blow to America's Everglades and every living creature there.”

            “I know many are questioning why the Trump and DeSantis administrations are insisting on pouring millions of taxpayer dollars into this dirty, destructive detention facility in the heart of the Everglades,” she told CNN. “Our legal system can and should stop this incredibly harmful boondoggle.”
    


            The next step, according to Bennett, is that a freshly-selected panel of appellate judges will now decide whether to reinstate the injunction to shut down the Everglades facility or strike it down altogether.
    


            “The mission continues,” DeSantis said in a video statement celebrating the appellate panel's decision. “Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we've always said, open for business.”
    


            It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July.
    


            The remote migrant detention camp deep in the marshy wetlands of the Everglades has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.
    


            And the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida – a Native American tribe whose reservation lies within miles of the facility – had raised concerns about the impact the facility will have on their land and the environmentally sensitive area, including the plants and animals that inhabit the Everglades.
    


            “The project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” US District Judge Kathleen Williams said in her order in late August.
    


            Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

Oops.

The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening to decide whether President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff policy is lawful. Two federal courts, and a total of 10 federal judges, have all concluded that it is not.

The remarkable thing about Trump's petition asking the justices to take up this case, which is known as Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, it that it opens with a long list of factual claims that, if taken seriously by the Court, would compel the justices to strike down the tariffs. But that would assume the Republican-controlled Supreme Court applies the same limits on executive power to Trump that it imposed on Democratic President Joe Biden — a highly uncertain proposition.

During the Biden administration, the Republican justices relied on something called the “major questions doctrine” to strike down several of Biden's policies. The Court's Republicans only recently invented this doctrine. It has no basis in law, and it has only ever been used against one president in history: Joe Biden.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

That said, the Court did preview the doctrine in an Obama-era decision that applied it to a hypothetical regulation. In that case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014), the Republican justices announced that “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'” The idea was that, even if a federal law can be read to permit the executive to enact a particular policy, courts should read those laws narrowly if the policy is too ambitious.

Indeed, under Biden, the Court even used this recently made-up doctrine to strike down policies that are unambiguously authorized by federal law. In Biden v. Nebraska (2023), the Republican justices struck down the Biden administration's attempt to cancel many student loans. But federal law could not possibly have been clearer that the executive is permitted to cancel these loans.

The relevant statute gave the education secretary broad authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs” during a national emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The secretary could use this power, moreover, “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans.

Nevertheless, the Republican justices overrode this statute, pointing to the loan cancellation plan's high price tag of “between $469 billion and $519 billion.” The “economic and political significance” of such a plan, they concluded, “is staggering by any measure.” And thus the program must be canceled.

Which brings us back to Trump's petition asking the justices to hear the tariffs case. That petition describes the tariffs as Trump's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative.” It claims that the tariff is necessary to close US trade deficits of “$1.2 trillion per year.” It alleges that the tariffs have given Trump leverage to extract multi-trillion-dollar concessions from foreign nations. And it also claims that the increased taxes Trump has unilaterally imposed on imports — taxes that will largely be paid by the American consumer — “will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.”

Trump, in other words, claims that the economic significance of these tariffs is an order of magnitude greater than the significance of the student loan program at issue in Nebraska — the one the Republican justices said they must strike down because its significance is “staggering by any measure.”

To be sure, it's never a good idea for a court to base its decisions on factual claims made by this particular administration. But independent analysis confirms that the economic and political significance of the tariffs is at least as “staggering” as the significance of Biden's student loan program. An August analysis of the tariffs by Yale's Budget Lab, for example, concluded that Trump's tariffs will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025, and that the tariffs will raise $2.7 trillion in taxes over a 10-year window.

It would seem, then, that a straightforward application of the major questions doctrine compels this Court to invalidate Trump's tariffs. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh already appears to be looking for a way to bail out Trump. Concurring in FCC v. Consumers' Research (2025), Kavanaugh suggested that this newly invented doctrine does not apply to “foreign policy contexts.”

Trump's petition also suggests other ways the Court could exempt him from the doctrine, including a claim that the doctrine doesn't apply when the president personally authorizes a federal policy, instead of promulgating that policy through a federal agency.

Are these arguments persuasive? The truth is that there's no such thing as a persuasive argument involving the major questions doctrine, because the whole thing is a figment of the Republican justices' imagination. The Court has never published a majority opinion claiming that this doctrine can be found in any provision of the Constitution, or in any federal statute. And while some individual justices have offered their own explanations of where this recently invented doctrine comes from, those explanations range from silly to ridiculous.

Concurring in Nebraska, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett claimed that the doctrine is implicit in a parable about a babysitter.

Asking whether the doctrine applies to foreign policy decisions, in other words, is a bit like asking your daughter whether her imaginary friend likes fried chicken. The answer is whatever your daughter wants it to be.

As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this year, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.” If the major questions doctrine derived from a constitutional provision, then the justices could read that provision to determine if it contains a foreign policy exception. If it derived from a statute, they could refer to the statute.

But, because the major questions doctrine is simply something that the Republican justices made up, there is no principled way to determine if it conveniently contains an exception that just happens to rescue a Republican president's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative” from invalidation.

That said, courts are supposed to apply the same rules to Democratic presidents that they apply to Republicans. If the Republican justices actually buy Trump's claim that he is exempt, that will leave little doubt that these justices are simply playing Calvinball — creating one set of rules to spite Democrats, and a different, far more favorable set of rules for Republicans.

            Billionaire and onetime top White House advisor Elon Musk said he was invited to a tech leader summit at the White House's newly renovated Rose Garden on Thursday, but will not be attending.
    


            “I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there,” Musk said on Thursday, replying to an X user who asked why the xAI, SpaceX and Tesla leader was not invited.
    


            The guest list for Thursday's event includes Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, according to a White House official.
    


            The fact that Musk was invited could be a sign that the relationship between Musk and the White House is thawing. Once referred to as “the first buddy,” and near constant presence at President Donald Trump's side, Musk had a messy blowup with the president this summer after leaving his position at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk even vowed to support primary challengers of Republicans who voted for Trump's signature funding bill, and he claimed he would be starting a new political party, although there does not seem to have been any movement on that front.
    


            The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
    


            In recent days, public comments from Trump and Vice President JD Vance seem to suggest Musk would be welcomed back into the fold.
    


            Speaking to CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his podcast this week, Trump said Musk is “a man of common sense,” a “good man,” even though he “got off the reservation incorrectly.”
    


            “He's got 80% super genius and then 20% he's got some problems. When he works out the 20%, he'll be great,” Trump said. “I liked him… I like him now.”
    


            In an interview last month with far-right outlet Gateway Pundit, Vance called Musk's relationship with the Trump White House “complicated.” But he said he expects and hopes Musk will support the Republican Party by next November's midterm elections.
    


            “My argument to Elon is like, you're not going to be on the left, even if you wanted to be — and he doesn't — they're not going to have your back. That ship has sailed. So I really think it's a mistake for him to try to break from the president,” Vance said.
    


            Musk has backed off attacking the administration on X and, in some cases, appears to be fully supporting the White House. Last month, he replied with a fire emoji and a laughing emoji to a post from White House communications adviser Margo Martin, who captioned a photo: “President @realDonaldTrump showing President Zelenskyy and President Macron his 4 More Years hat.”
    


            The White House invitation could also be a lesson in history: Musk was famously not invited to a White House summit on electric vehicles in 2021 during President Joe Biden's administration. (Part of the reason appeared to be because Tesla is a nonunion automaker.) Musk has been vocal about how much he continues to be upset over the snub.
    


            On Thursday, he reposted a 2023 interview where he said Biden “added insult to injury” and hurt the company by claiming at the event that General Motors was “leading the electric car revolution” while Tesla made far more EV cars.
    


            Musk reposted the 2023 video with the comment: “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them.”

            Offshore wind developers and the attorneys general of Rhode Island and Connecticut are suing the federal government in an effort to reverse a stop-work order on a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
    


            It's the latest development in a rapidly escalating battle between President Donald Trump's administration and the offshore wind industry over several ongoing and planned wind energy projects off the East Coast. Trump has continued to target wind power in his second term, releasing a series of executive orders and statements to undermine the industry.
    


            Danish company Ørsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables filed the lawsuit Thursday in DC District court to try to finish its Revolution Wind project, which was 80% complete when the stop-work order was issued last month. The states also announced their intent to sue Thursday.
    


Thousands of jobs hang in the balance while the project is in limbo; Revolution Wind supports over 2,500 US jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding and manufacturing, an Ørsted spokesperson recently told CNN.
    


            The project would provide enough energy to power upwards of 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to Ørsted. Reviews for the venture started over nine years ago and it received all required federal and state permits in 2023 under the Biden administration. The project was scheduled to be finished next year.
    


            “Revolution Wind is projected to save Connecticut and Rhode Island ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over 20 years,” a joint news release from the states' attorneys general said. Their complaint says “Rhode Island and Connecticut ‘seek to restore the rule of law, protect their energy and economic interests, and ensure that the federal government honors its commitments,'” according to the release.
    


            The developers are still trying to work “collaboratively” with the Trump administration to resolve the stop-work order but believe the federal government “lacked legal authority for the stop-work order and that the stop-work order's stated basis violated applicable law,” they said in a news release.
    


            Trump Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace declined to comment on the litigation.
    


            Revolution Wind is one of a series of projects targeted by the federal government under Trump. In a Wednesday court filing for a separate case, the Trump administration said it also planned to revoke approvals of the Avangrid-owned New England Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, which was set to start construction this year.
    


            In April, a similar stop-work order was issued for another offshore wind project in waters surrounding New York. That order was eventually lifted in May after discussions between the administration, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the developer ultimately allowed construction to continue — but at a cost of $955 million to the company behind the project.
    


            Trump has long been an opponent of wind energy, criticizing offshore wind for being too expensive and saying it has detrimental impacts to wildlife around it. Trump's cabinet secretaries have repeated some of those claims, and although the Interior Department has the biggest federal jurisdiction over offshore wind farm approvals, several other agencies have also gotten involved in an effort to stymie the projects.
    


            During a recent White House cabinet meeting, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. mentioned an “interdepartmental coalition” of agencies including his, the Defense Department, Commerce Department, Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency who “are all working on this issue” and “meeting together.”
    


            “The economic outlook for offshore wind in the United States is not promising,” US Energy Sec. Chris Wright told Bloomberg in a Wednesday interview. “Offshore wind has been entirely a government-mandated, government-funded business.”

            The Republican-controlled Missouri legislature began redrawing its congressional map Thursday to target one Democratic-held seat in the US House, responding to demands by President Donald Trump and his allies to help the GOP eke out more seats in next year's midterm elections.
    


            Lawmakers in the Missouri House are holding committee hearings and initial votes on the map this week, with the full House expected to take up the legislation early next week. Republicans hold a supermajority in the Missouri legislature, making it likely that the map will be approved.
    


            On Thursday evening, the redistricting committee endorsed the new map by a 10-4 vote — moving it closer to debate on the House floor.
    


            The proposed map would dramatically alter the Kansas City-area district long represented by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, splitting parts of the city and adding a wide swath of rural and heavily Republican central Missouri.
    


            Changing those contours favors Republicans, giving the party an advantage in seven out of eight US House districts in Missouri. GOP lawmakers currently hold six of those seats; Democrats hold two.
    


            The legislation in Missouri is the latest move to redraw maps across the country for partisan advantage, spurred by Trump as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the US House for the final two years of his presidency.
    


            State GOP Rep. Dirk Deaton, the sponsor of the map in the Missouri House, called it an “improvement” over the current lines.
    


            “It's my belief that it is a better map for Missouri,” he told members of a House special committee on redistricting.
    


            In the heated opening moments of the hearing, Democratic lawmakers slammed the redistricting effort as a raw power grab by Washington interests.
    


            “Democracy in Missouri is taking a devastating blow … one it might not recover from,” said state Rep. Mark Sharp, the top Democrat on the panel.
    


            State Rep. Ashley Aune, the minority leader in the House, said Republican lawmakers had opened the hearing without first publicly sharing data about the demographics of the new districts. She questioned who drew the new lines.
    


            Deaton said the map was drawn by staffers in the office of Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.
    


            “I think that everyone watching actually understands that the people who drew these maps are sitting in DC,” Aune retorted. “It's ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.”
    


            Kehoe last week announced the special session and unveiled what he called a “Missouri First” map – a move immediately hailed by Trump.
    


            Texas recently passed new maps that aim to help Republicans net five seats in that state; Democratic officials in California have responded by seeking a new map that could flip as many five GOP-held seats. California voters must approve that move in November.

The world's largest and most enduring iceberg is splintering into smaller pieces, to the point that it's no longer the biggest chunk of ice floating in the oceans. It's currently drifting between the southern tips of Africa and South America

The world's largest and most enduring iceberg is splintering into smaller pieces, to the point that it's no longer the biggest chunk of ice floating in the oceans. 

The shrinking megaberg, known as A23A, is unlikely to survive through the end of November and may face a sudden and spectacular collapse like an avalanche of ice at sea, said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos.

“It's an interesting thing to watch, certainly not unprecedented,” Scambos said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press. “But every time these happen, it's sort of a big spectacular event.”

Because ice shelves already float on water, ice reductions like this won't raise the sea level. But the reduction in ice shelves will cause melting land glaciers to flow into the oceans, and that causes sea levels to rise a few feet (meters).

A23A first broke away from Antarctica's Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986 along a massive crack that scientist first noticed in the 1950s and called “the Grand Chasm.” It hovered close to the southern continent for about three-and-a-half decades uneventfully until the last couple years when it drifted north to the place where massive icebergs go to die, around South Georgia Island, Scambos said.

Earlier this year the iceberg was the size of Rhode Island and weighed in at a trillion tons, now it's down to the size of Houston and shrinking fast. The world's new biggest iceberg is D15A. It's nearly twice as big as the shrunken A23A, according to Andrew Meijers of the British Antarctic Survey.

A23A has already spawned smaller chunks named A23D, A23E and A23F. NASA satellite images Thursday show the smaller bergs that weren't detached on Saturday, just a few days before. 




“It's still quite thick, but it's a lot thinner than it was when it left the continent,” Scambos said. “And so now it's being flexed by long period waves, by tides, which sweep across the area. And with that flexing, even though it's incredibly gentle and subtle. It's finding weak spots in the iceberg, and those are breaking off.

“I expect its fracturing will accelerate,” Meijers said via email. As the iceberg moves further north and the Antarctic spring begins Meijers expects by the end of the season, A23A will likely rapidly fall apart into chunks too small to track, he said.

If the iceberg survives the Antarctic spring, the summer looks even more brutal, Scambos said. That's when it can collapse with warm water even at the top and it will then look “sort of like an avalanche that's floating” and even fall apart in a single day, he said.

Back in January, Meijers, who visited the iceberg at the end of 2023, painted a different picture of A23A: “The iceberg itself is colossal and it stretches from horizon to horizon ... It's a huge wall, a Game of Thrones style wall of ice that towers above the ship.”

Megabergs spawning is a natural process that has happened for centuries, Meijers said, and so is their breaking apart around South Georgia Island when the current and warmer waters get hold of them, Scambos said.

Republicans and Democrats scrutinized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for more than three hours Thursday morning on Capitol Hill.

The hearing was scheduled as a review of President Donald Trump's healthcare agenda, but it quickly became a referendum on Kennedy's leadership of the sprawling department, with the heated conversation ranging from abortion to COVID-19 policy, to the recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez.

Here are some of the highlights from the more than three hours of Kennedy's testimony, which at times veered into confrontation and personal accusations.

Kennedy lambasted Monarez's credibility when asked repeatedly by Democrats and Republicans about the cause for her termination last week.

He flatly said that Monarez lied when she wrote in her Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that Kennedy told her to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel,” whose members were handpicked by the secretary.

“No, I did not say that to her, and I never had a private meeting with her other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say I never said that,” Kennedy said.

Later in the hearing, Kennedy said he fired her because she admitted that she was untrustworthy.

“I told her that she had to resign because I asked her, ‘Are you a trustworthy person?' And she said, ‘No,'” Kennedy said.

Monarez's lawyers told the Washington Examiner that they dismiss Kennedy's claims “as false and, at times, patently ridiculous” and that she stands by what she wrote in her op-ed.

A handful of Republicans criticized Kennedy's move to restrict approvals for COVID-19 vaccines to only those with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease, including seniors over age 65.

Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and John Barrasso (R-WY), both physicians, said their professional colleagues have expressed concern that Kennedy's administration is limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines, because HHS approval is essential for insurance coverage of the shots.

Cassidy tripped up Kennedy about whether to praise Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that fast-tracked mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during the first Trump administration.

Kennedy said Trump “absolutely” deserved a Nobel Prize for the effort, but Cassidy then quickly noted that Kennedy has, on record, said the COVID-19 vaccine killed more people than the disease itself.

Kennedy defended his record by saying that he supported Operation Warp Speed itself but that he opposed the top-down mandates for the vaccine during the Biden administration.

Sens. James Lankford (R-OK) and Steve Daines (R-MT) questioned Kennedy on the timing of the promised safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone.

The secretary said he spoke with Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary about the matter in advance of the hearing, who said that the review of mifepristone is “progressing apace.”

“We're getting data, and all the time new data that we're reviewing,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy referenced a study published by the anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center this summer using insurance data that concluded that the complication rate of mifepristone is roughly 11%. This includes hemorrhaging and severe infections due to incomplete abortions.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) questioned Kennedy about whether he supported letting the extended premium tax credits for Obamacare exchange insurance plans lapse by the end of the year.

The tax credits, which Democrats passed as part of COVID-19 relief efforts in 2021 and 2022, are likely to be a main focus of both chambers of Congress before the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown.

Kennedy declined to give a direct answer. Instead, he said Democrats “had two chances to make them permanent, and they didn't.”

“I want to fix the system, and that's what we're doing, fixing systematically to make premiums lower,” Kennedy said. “That's what President Trump wants.”

Kennedy clashed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

Warren argued that Kennedy curbed access to the vaccines by limiting the recommendation for shots only to people with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease. Because the shots are not recommended, she said, they are not available at many pharmacies or covered by insurance.

Kennedy said the vaccines were not intended for healthy people. As the exchange became heated, he attacked Warren as having received funding from the industry.

“I know you've taken $855,000 from pharmaceutical companies,” he said.

“I'm not taking them away,” he later said. “Everyone can get access to them.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century.

The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. The company plans to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the results and then apply for Food and Drug Administration approval.

Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards.

“I see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,” said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University's psychedelic center and was not involved in the research.




Psychedelics are in the midst of a popular and scientific comeback, with conferences, documentaries, books and medical journals exploring their potential for conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The FDA has designated psilocybin, MDMA and now LSD as potential “breakthrough” therapies based on early results.

Still, the drugs have not had a glide path to the market.

Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA — also known as ecstasy — as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues.

The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.

MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.

The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD — under professional supervision, but without therapy — and then were followed for about three months.

The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted. 

“In many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,” he said.

For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.

At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose — 100 micrograms — continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.

Patients who got dummy pills also improved — a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies — but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.

The research was not immune to problems seen in similar studies.

Most patients were able to correctly guess whether they'd received LSD or a dummy pill, undercutting the “blinded” approach that's considered critical to objectively establishing the benefits of a new medicine. In addition, a significant portion of patients in both the placebo and treatment groups dropped out early, narrowing the final data set.

It also wasn't clear how long patients might continue to benefit.

Mindmed is conducting two large, late-stage trials that will track patients over a longer period of time and, if successful, be submitted for FDA approval.

“It's possible that some people may need retreatment,” said Dr. Maurizio Fava of Mass General Brigham Hospital, the study's lead author and an adviser to Mindmed. “How many retreatments, we don't know yet, but the long-lasting effect is quite significant.”

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials have expressed interest in psychedelic therapy, suggesting it could receive fast-track review for veterans and others suffering psychological wounds.

Generalized anxiety disorder is among the most common mental disorders, affecting nearly 3% of U.S. adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.

The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn't new.

In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to “turn on, tune in and dropout.”

A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs — without any medical use and high potential for abuse — essentially halted U.S. research.

When a handful of nonprofits begin reassessing the drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, they focused on lesser-known hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin, the main ingredient in magic mushrooms, to avoid the historic controversies surrounding LSD.

“LSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,” Fava said.

In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner about how many Americans have died from COVID-19, RFK Jr. claimed that nobody knows because of a lack of government data.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., facing pointed bipartisan questioning at a rancorous three-hour Senate committee hearing on Thursday, tried to defend his efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and explain the turmoil he has created at federal health agencies.

Kennedy said the fired CDC director was untrustworthy, stood by his past anti-vaccine rhetoric, and disputed reports of people saying they have had difficulty getting COVID-19 shots.

Medical groups and several Democrats in Congress have called for Kennedy to be fired, and his exchanges with Democratic senators on the panel repeatedly devolved into shouting, from both sides.

But some Republican senators also expressed unease with his changes to COVID-19 policies.

The GOP senators noted that Kennedy said President Donald Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for the 2020 Operation Warp Speed initiative to quickly develop mRNA COVID-19 vaccines — and that he also had attacked the safety and continued use of those very shots.

“I can't tell where you are on Operation Warp Speed,” said Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.

Tillis and others asked him why the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was fired last week, less than a month into her tenure.




Kennedy said she was dishonest, and that CDC leaders who left the agency last week in support of her deserved to be fired.

He also criticized CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic tied to lockdowns and masking policies, and claimed — wrongly — that they “failed to do anything about the disease itself.”

“The people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving,” Kennedy said. He later said they deserved to be fired for not doing enough to control chronic disease.

The Senate Finance Committee had called Kennedy to a hearing about his plans to “Make America Healthy Again,” but Democratic senators pressed Kennedy on his actions around vaccines. 

At the start of the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon tried to have Kennedy formally sworn in as a witness, saying the HHS secretary has a history of lying to the committee. The committee's chair, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, denied the Democrat's request, saying “the bottom line is we will let the secretary make his own case.”

Wyden went on to attack Kennedy, saying he had “stacked the deck” of a vaccines advisory committee by replacing scientists with “skeptics and conspiracy theorists.” 

Last week, the Trump administration fired the CDC's director — a Trump appointee who was confirmed by the Senate — less than a month into her tenure. Several top CDC leaders resigned in protest, leaving the agency in turmoil.

The ousted director, Susan Monarez, wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that Kennedy was trying to weaken public health protections.

“I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote. “It is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.”

Kennedy told senators he didn't make such an ultimatum, though he did concede that he had ordered Monarez to fire career CDC scientists.

Kennedy pushed back on concerns raised by multiple Republican senators, including Tillis and Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Both Barrasso and Cassidy are physicians.

The health secretary had animated comebacks as Democratic senators pressed him on the effects of his words and actions.

When Sen. Raphael Warnock, of Georgia, questioned Kennedy about his disparaging rhetoric about CDC employees before a deadly shooting at the agency this summer, Kennedy shot back: “Are you complicit in the assassination attempts on President Trump?”

Kennedy called Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico “ridiculous,” said he was “talking gibberish” and accused him of “not understanding how the world works” when Lujan asked Kennedy to pledge to share protocols of any research Kennedy was commissioning into autism and vaccines.

He also engaged in a heated, loud exchanges with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota.

“I didn't even hear your question,” Kennedy replied to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto as the Nevada Democrat repeatedly asked what the agency was doing to lower drug costs for seniors.

He also told Sen. Bernie Sanders that the Vermont independent was not “making any sense.” 

Some senators had their own choice words.

“You're interrupting me, and sir, you're a charlatan. That's what you are, ” said Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat. “The history on vaccines is very clear.”

As the hearing neared its end, Kennedy pulled his cellphone from his pocket and then tapped and scrolled as Wyden asked about mifepristone, a drug used for medication abortion.

In May, Kennedy — a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement — announced COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a move opposed by medical and public health groups.

In June, he abruptly fired a panel of experts that had been advising the government on vaccine policy. He replaced them with a handpicked group that included several vaccine skeptics, and then shut the door to several doctors groups that had long helped form the committee's recommendations.

Kennedy has voiced distrust of research that showed the COVID-19 vaccines saved lives, and at Thursday's hearing even cast doubt on statistics about how people died during the pandemic and on estimates about how many deaths were averted — statistics produced by the agencies he oversees.

He said federal health policy would be based on gold standard science, but confessed that he wouldn't necessarily wait for studies to be completed before taking action against, for example, potential causes of chronic illness.

“We are not waiting for everything to come in. We are starting now,” he said.

A number of medical groups say Kennedy can't be counted on to make decisions based on robust medical evidence. In a statement Wednesday, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and 20 other medical and public health organizations issued a joint statement calling on him to resign.

“Our country needs leadership that will promote open, honest dialogue, not disregard decades of lifesaving science, spread misinformation, reverse medical progress and decimate programs that keep us safe,” the statement said.

Many of the nation's leading public health and medical societies, including the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have decried Kennedy's policies and warn they will drive up rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia on Thursday challenged President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in Washington, asking a federal court to intervene even as he plans to send troops to other cities in the name of driving down crime.

Brian Schwalb, the district's elected attorney general, said in a lawsuit that the deployment, which now involves more than 1,000 troops, is an illegal use of the military for domestic law enforcement. 

“No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,” Schwalb wrote.

The White House said deploying the Guard to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement is within Trump's authority as president.

“This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. 



Members of the D.C. National Guard have had their orders extended through December, according to a Guard official. While that does not necessarily mean all those troops will serve that long, it is a strong indication that their role will not wind down soon.




The Republican president has credited the weekslong surge in Washington with reining in crime and said he plans to send the National Guard into Chicago and Baltimore, despite staunch opposition in those Democrat-led cities. In the nation's capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has backed up some of Trump's claims that crime is down during the takeover. Still, data shows and critics argue that crime was already falling before the surge.

Bowser said Thursday that her focus is on preparing for when the emergency ends, which under the law would be Sept. 10, unless Congress extends it. In the order she issued this week, that preparation centered on how the District could best coordinate with and communicate with the federal law enforcement agencies that will likely remain in contact with the city's citizens.

A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids in June was illegal. It does not directly apply to Washington, where the president has more control over the Guard than in states. 

Several GOP-led states have added National Guard troops to the ranks of those patrolling the streets and neighborhoods of the nation's capital. 

Schwalb's filing contends the deployment also violates Washington's Home Rule Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973, and wrongly asserts federal control over units from other states.

The lawsuit is the second from Schwalb — whose office is separate from Washington's federal U.S. attorney, a presidential appointee — against the Trump administration since Trump asserted control over the city's police department and sent in the Guard. Those actions have been with protests from some residents. 

Violent crime has been an issue in the capital for years, though data showed it was on the decline when Trump intervened with an executive order on Aug. 11.

Bowser has pointed to a steep drop in offenses such as carjackings since it began, while also expressing reservations about the use of the Guard from other states. 

There are clear divides between some D.C. Council members and Bowser, whom critics have accused of acquiescing to the administration.

Speaking at a Free DC “Federal Forces Out Now” news conference on Capitol Hill, one councilmember, Robert White, said his own young daughters do not see the military personnel and officers as protectors. 

“They are here to catch them, to condemn them, to take away their rights,” he said. 

White said when history is written about this moment “we will have to justify what we did and did not do. I'm not prepared to say that I capitulated. I'm prepared to stay the course. I'm not prepared to say I went along to get along.”

He encouraged the D.C. Council, Congress, the mayor and the district's attorney general to “stand together not in fear, not in compliance, but against an authoritarian takeover of our city.”

            The Shroud of Turin — a 14-foot-long linen cloth bearing an image of a crucified man — has captivated people for centuries, stirring debate over whether the relic once wrapped the body of Jesus Christ.
    


            For some, the cloth serves as visual proof of Jesus' resurrection; for others, it is merely a medieval relic made by an artist in the 14th century.
    


            Now, researchers have found new evidence that the authenticity of the cloth was disputed in writing earlier than once thought: medieval texts from a respected and influential French philosopher, Nicole Oresme, who alleged around 1370 that the Shroud was faked for the purpose of the church. These claims appeared in Oresme's collection of writings known as his “Problemata,” which are dated between 1355 and 1382, according to the new study published on August 28 in the Journal of Medieval History.
    


            Oresme's Problemata has been well researched — much of the text is even available online —but the philosopher's claims about the Shroud had been overlooked for centuries. It wasn't until lead study author Nicolas Sarzeaud, a researcher in history at the Catholic University Louvain, in Belgium, received the text from a colleague editing an unpublished treatise that he realized the significance of the writing.
    


            “The fact that we have this new testimony on this object is very, very valuable,” said Sarzeaud, who is also a fellow of the Villa Medici, a French Academy in Rome. Oresme was an interesting figure, not only for his merit as a scholar and philosopher, but because of his unbiased approach to topics, particularly those involving the church. “In his debates, he tried to be sure that a phenomenon was real before he (discussed it). … he wrote a lot about believing. ‘What is believing? And why do we believe in something?'”
    


            Prior to the discovery of Oresme's claims, the oldest known documentation of the Shroud was in a series of documents from 1389 to 1390 written by notable figures such as the former bishop of Troyes, Pierre d'Arcis, who stated that the Shroud was created by an artist.
    


            While researchers like Sarzeaud claim Oresme's text adds to the already plentiful scientific and historical evidence that the Shroud is fake, some remain unconvinced.
    


            According to the 1389 documents, including a letter written by Bishop d'Arcis to the pope, the Shroud of Turin appeared in the Champagne region of France around 1355. The cloth, bearing an image of a naked man with long hair and a beard, as well as reddish-brown stains resembling wounds from crucifixion, quickly became popular. News spread that the fabric was believed to have once wrapped the body of Christ, and the Shroud was said to cause miracles.
    


            Shortly after, the documents noted, the bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, announced that the cloth was fraudulent, adding he had met the artist who created the image. About 30 years later, when the cloth began to attract popular attention once more, the following bishop, Pierre d'Arcis, also stated in his letter that the cloth was artwork, and the pope decided soon after that it could continue being on display only as a representation of the true Shroud of Christ.
    


            The cloth moved around several times after that, until it was relocated to Turin, Italy, in 1578. It can still be found there today, at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.
    


            Radiocarbon dating, conducted in 1988 by three separate laboratories, dated the fabric between 1260 and 1390, said Andrea Nicolotti, a professor of the history of Christianity and churches at the University of Turin who was not involved with the study but had worked with Sarzeaud previously.
    


            The Shroud shows evidence of being a relic from medieval times, as its patterns are complex and would have required a sufficient loom likely not introduced until the 13th century, added Nicolotti, who is also the author of the 2019 book “The Shroud of Turin: The History and Legends of the World's Most Famous Relic.”
    


            “In my opinion, we already have enough information to have settled the debate a long time ago,” he said.
    


            “Since no human body can leave that kind of image on the cloth, only two possibilities seem to remain: either it was artificially created by an artist, or it is a miracle,” Nicolotti said in an email. “Being able to say that the shroud is the result of a miracle, and that it is proof of the resurrection, is very tempting for some Christians: they think this way they can demonstrate Christ's divinity to the world.”
    


            In his Problemata, Oresme recommended caution when assessing alleged miracles, “because many clergy men thus deceive others, in order to elicit offerings for their churches.” He cited the Shroud as an example: “There is manifest experience of that in a church in Champagne, where it was said that there was the shroud of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Oresme died in 1382, seven years prior to the claims from the bishop of Troyes in the 1389 letter.
    


            More than 600 years after its documented discovery, the Shroud of Turin is still being researched and debated. In July, a study from a researcher in Brazil using 3D-modeling software concluded that the image on the cloth is more likely the result of an imprint from a statue rather than from a human body.
    


            Those who believe the Shroud to be authentic, however, argued that the 3D-modeling study was incomplete. Skeptics claimed that the researcher did not factor in findings from the 1978 Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) that could disprove the theory of the cloth being artwork, such as a lack of pigment and the details of the blood stains, which are detectable with UV technology.
    


            Cheryl White, the Hubert Humphreys Endowed Professor of History at Louisiana State University at Shreveport, said that the newly examined texts from Oresme do not add much to our understanding of the Shroud and its debated authenticity. White was not involved in the new study.
    


            “This reference points only to something I think historians have always known — that skepticism about the Shroud existed early on,” White, who also served as the historical consultant for the original Shroud of Turin exhibition at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, said in an email. “There is no question (Oresme) was one of the leading intellectuals of 14th-century France, a bishop and royal advisor. His skepticism might carry more weight given his standing, but it actually reflects his broader fight against false relics more than drawing upon any direct knowledge he had of the Shroud itself.”
    


            “My position is that the Shroud of Turin has defied explanation for centuries. … It is neither falsifiable nor is it reproducible, making it an ongoing mystery,” White added. “We need both more historical documents and the most advanced scientific testing; however, the Shroud may never be ‘put to rest' — its enduring mystery is what makes it so compelling.”
    


            Sarzeaud believes the document is significant because it shows how the Shroud was perceived in the 14th century. But like many other researchers, he acknowledges that additional research would be beneficial to understand more about the Shroud and how it was made: “I think the problem is that everything and its opposite has been written about the Shroud of Turin, so that it has become possible to pick and choose what we like and what we don't like.”

Former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger received welcome news in her campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to become Virginia's next governor, with the Center for Politics' “Crystal Ball” rating the race in her favor.

The Center for Politics on Thursday published ratings for a number of races, including in Virginia, where Democrats are hoping to flip the governor's seat blue. Polling shows Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is trailing by a narrow margin in the state's gubernatorial race to replace term-limited Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), although some polls indicate she has made strides in closing in on her Democratic rival in recent months. 

The institute changed its “Crystal Ball” prognosis for the Virginia campaign this week, writing that the outcome will be “likely Democratic,” marking a boost for Spanberger after it previously predicted the race “leans Democratic.” 

“Spanberger's lopsided financial advantage, and the fact that the Trump administration seemed to go out of its way to ensure the state continues its longstanding trend of reacting against the presidential party, have had us feeling that Democrats should be stronger favorites to flip the governorship,” the Center for Politics wrote. 

“We'll be paying attention to whatever tea leaves that may show up in the early voting patterns, but for now, we are upgrading Spanberger's position,” it continued. 

The University of Virginia-based institute criticized several recent polls that indicate Earle-Sears is closing in on Spanberger, suggesting they are biased in her favor. 

In late May, pollsters had Spanberger up 43% to 26%. The Hill's Decision Desk HQ polling average had Spanberger leading the race 45% to 36% on Aug. 1. A few weeks later, a Roanoke College Poll further shrank Spanberger's lead at 46% to 39% on Aug. 19. An Aug. 26 poll from co/efficient showed just a five-point gap between the two candidates, with Spanberger leading 48% to 43%.

The Center for Politics argued the two latest polls “arguably stress-tested Spanberger's lead by suggesting an electorate that may be redder than what we will see in November, and she was still ahead.”

“To be clear, we also don't necessarily think Spanberger is “actually” leading by considerably more than what these polls show—mid-to-high single digits may very well be where the race is at,” the pollsters added.

Republicans have been eyeing Virginia, as well as New Jersey, as states they believe are trending Rightward due to the results of the 2024 election. At the time, President Donald Trump increased margins of support for the Republican Party by significant levels, leading the GOP to mount pushes in both states to expand red territory. 

In Virginia, Spanberger has come under attack from the GOP partly due to her positions on transgender and immigration policy.

VIRGINIA PUBLIC SCHOOL TRANSGENDER CONTROVERSIES COULD SCRAMBLE GUBERNATORIAL RACE

Sears and Youngkin have criticized the Democratic candidate for not supporting the Laken Riley Act, which targets illegal immigrants accused of committing violent crimes for swift deportation after one such man was convicted of murdering a Georgia nursing student. 

And Spanberger has also been pressured to support the federal government's push to mandate bathroom use on the basis of biological sex instead of gender identity. The matter has become a front-and-center issue in several Virginia counties, including Loudoun County, as multiple school districts refuse the Trump administration's request to reform transgender bathroom policy.

            Stephen Miran, the White House economist President Donald Trump nominated to the Federal Reserve's top ranks, just got an earful about the importance of the central bank's independence – just as the Trump administration actively defends removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her post.
    


            The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing Thursday to consider Miran's nomination to fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors. It was a crucial step in Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed, potentially eroding its long-accepted independence from politics, which in part has helped the US economy grow to and remain the world's largest over the past century.
    


            Republican and Democratic senators were unequivocal that the Fed's decisions on interest rates should remain free of political considerations. Miran agreed at various points throughout the hearing, stating that Fed independence “is critical to the well functioning of the economy and financial markets.”
    


            But Democrats questioned Miran's ability to distance himself from Trump, should he be confirmed to become a Fed governor. After all, Miran plans to technically remain an employee of the White House if he becomes Fed governor on a temporary basis.
    


            Miran said he would take a leave of absence from his current role as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers if his Fed term only lasts through January, but said he would resign if he remains for longer. He said he was advised to take that approach by legal counsel.
    


            “You are going to be technically an employee of the President of United States, but an independent member of the board of the Federal Reserve, that's ridiculous,” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said.
    


            Meanwhile, less than a mile away from Capitol Hill, a federal judge is set to review new court filings from the Trump administration and perhaps rule as early as Thursday whether Cook, whom the president fired last week over allegations of mortgage fraud, can remain as a Fed governor while her lawsuit challenging Trump's removal order moves forward in litigation.
    


            Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has been subject to unprecedented attacks by the Trump administration because central bankers haven't heeded the president's demands to lower interest rates. Fed officials have stood pat since December because they've wanted to see how the US economy responds to Trump's sweeping policies first, though they're gearing up for a rate cut in two weeks.
    


Miran, a Harvard-trained PhD economist, has challenged the Fed's independence in the recent past.
    


            Last year, Miran co-authored a Manhattan Institute report last year, that called the Fed's independence an outdated “shibboleth,” and he called for shorter terms for Fed governors to give the president more power to hold sway over the agency.
    


            “Central bank independence has long been considered an essential element for successful monetary policy. But central banks are creations of political exigency, and pure independence exists only in textbooks,” the report said. “It can also bestow power without accountability.”
    


            Miran is also one of the main architects of Trump's aggressive trade policy. In a November 2024 paper, Miran detailed how a tariff -centric approach, aimed at weakening the dollar, could reshape the global trading system in favor of the United States.
    


            His unconventional perspective will likely come into full view during his hearing. Democrats — and some Republicans — are expected to press Miran particularly on his view about the Fed's independence.
    


            Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the banking committee's ranking member, said in prepared remarks published ahead of Miran's hearing that “every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn't an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump's puppet.”
    


            If confirmed to be a Fed governor, Miran would no longer play a role in shaping the administration's fiscal and trade policy. Fed officials typically avoid weighing in on those matters in the spirit of Fed independence. But lawmakers are expected to challenge Miran about whether his economic views are perhaps too radical to serve on the Fed.
    


            There's a chance Miran won't just be a Fed governor.
    


            When Miran's nomination was announced, Trump said the appointment would last through January, aimed at filling the remainder of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, who resigned in early August without citing a reason for her departure. Last week, Trump said he is considering a longer term for Miran.
    


            “We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on August 26, referring to Cook's term, which is slated to last through 2038 and is currently in litigation after his firing of her. “We'll have a majority very shortly. So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great.”
    


Why Trump's Fed nominee may get the cold shoulder at the central bank



            For months, Trump has complained that the Fed not lowering interest rates is forcing the federal government to make massive interest payments on its debt and that it is hurting housing affordability for Americans.
    


            If confirmed, Miran would be in a position to be elevated as Fed chair, potentially taking the same route that other former Fed chairs have taken, such as Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke (who also led the Council of Economic Advisers).
    


            According to Fed rules, the chair can be chosen only among current Fed governors, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has attacked for months, has refused to reveal if he's staying on the board after his term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell's term on the board runs through 2028, so he could theoretically choose to stay as a Fed governor, though Fed chair typically step down altogether after their term as chair ends.
    


            While senators consider the possibility of Miran as a Fed governor, Cook's own status on the central bank's governing board is in question.
    


            Last week, Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's firing of her, claiming the president violated her due process rights under the Constitution and federal law. The federal government said the firing was justified because the president determined there was sufficient cause, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud.
    


Judge wants to hear more about Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's effort to fire her before ruling



            Cook requested that the court allow her to remain in her job while the litigation moves forward, but in an emergency hearing on August 29, US District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee, asked for more written arguments to be submitted to her this week.
    


            The court's ruling on whether Cook will keep her job while the high-stakes case plays out is crucial, with a Fed policy meeting coming up on September 16-17. The Fed is widely expected to lower rates for the first time since December.
    


            Last week after Cook was fired, the 11 Democrats on the committee that will consider Miran's nomination called on the chair, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, to postpone Miran's hearing.

The case for giving one to your 3-year-old is not as outlandish as it sounds.

If you're a parent, you've probably grappled with the question of when your kid should get a smartphone. There's a nationwide movement, Wait Until 8th, that argues that devices should be kept out of kids' hands until they're deep into middle school. Some families manage to hold out even longer. Andrew Przybylski, a professor of technology and human behavior at the University of Oxford's Oxford Internet Institute and father of two, has a different idea.

“The kids have always had phones — since they were 3,” he told me a few months ago. I almost fell off my chair.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Before you come for us with pitchforks, it's not as extreme as it sounds. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Introducing the device into his children's lives was an incredibly intentional process, akin to putting a series of training wheels on a bike. At first, the only app on the toddler phone was a photo album filled with family pictures. Then, when they got a little older, the kids got access to the phone's camera, then audiobooks and music handpicked by the parents, and eventually, they could call and text their family.

“It's designed so that everything about technology is a conversation,” he said. “And it's a conversation that we and the kids have now with the idea that the kids will have this conversation with themselves in the future.”

Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps.

Giving phones to toddlers is a counterintuitive idea, and that's putting it lightly. If you've read any of the reporting on the mental health crisis that struck young people around the time they gained access to social media, parents are rightfully scared to give their children phones. However, once you come to terms with the fact that these devices are also a vital tool in an increasingly tech-dependent world, the concept of teaching kids how to live with a phone from an early age — with guardrails, of course — makes perfect sense.

In the past two years, the debate over kids and smartphones has been heating up. Thirty-five states have laws or rules restricting or outright banning phones in schools to address a converging set of problems, including cyberbullying, classroom distraction, and the youth mental health crisis. Social media use, specifically, has been linked to depression and anxiety in kids. Parents and teens actually agree that social media in particular is a threat to mental health. It's one thing to try to put controls around kids' social media use but many parents are trying to prevent their children from having smartphones for as long as possible, if at all. It's even driving parents to sign pledges that they'll hold out and not buy their kid a phone until eighth grade.

This is a bad idea, in my opinion. Critics like Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, have a point that kids and parents are completely outgunned by tech giants pushing addictive products onto kids. They're also correct that many solutions to keep kids safe, like better age verification, create new problems. But trying to keep kids away from smartphones, one of the most ubiquitous devices in the world today, is a fool's errand. Many parents — even those that signed pledges — have tried and failed.

More than anything, teaching kids how to safely use technology is a good idea. Phones are a fact of life in the 21st century, and even if you try to keep them away from your kids, their friends will get devices, possibly without any safeguards, before you know it. Meanwhile, there's also growing evidence that screen time can be a good thing, especially when parents are directly involved. It's never too soon to teach digital literacy, if only so that children can spot scams and misinformation online, whenever they get access. By turning tech use into a conversation, parents also invite their children to come to them when things online inevitably go sideways.

I will confess, I have not yet decided when I'll give my daughter her own phone. I have spent the past few weeks asking experts about the idea of giving kids phones when they're 3. And based on everything I've learned, I don't think I'll be signing any pledges any time soon.

Smartphones aren't just popular — they're unavoidable. Nine out of 10 Americans have a smartphone. The number of children with devices is growing, too. Common Sense Media reported earlier this year that 40 percent of 2-year-olds have their own tablet, and the percentage grows to 58 percent for 4-year-olds. The percentage of kids with their own smartphones are much lower: 4 percent for 2-year-olds and 8 percent for 4-year-olds. But if you're looking at how many kids have access to a smartphone at home, the number jumps to 96 percent.

If you're wary of the idea of iPad kids, these numbers might alarm you. But if parents are involved in what the kids are watching, which apps are available, and how long kids can use phones, screen time doesn't have to be a bad thing.

“The research suggests that that can be effective in encouraging children's digital literacy, encouraging children's agency and exploration, and learning and avoiding the problems of saying, ‘I can use my phone, but you can't have one,'” Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has been studying kids and tech for decades, told me. “You know, it becomes a forbidden fruit.”

The idea of starting a toddler out with a photo album makes great sense. My daughter primarily wants to see family photos on my phone, which I inevitably have to take away from her.

A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. 

Video calls have long been established as an early, educational screen time activity. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. A later study found that parent participation improved learning even more.

As kids get older, though, passively watching videos can be good, too. We know this because of decades of research into children watching TV. A seminal study on the effects of Sesame Street found that watching the show in early childhood led to improved school performance. Of course, Sesame Street is created by a nonprofit with the explicit mission to educate kids. The infinite feed of YouTube, with its sometimes uncanny kids' content, is a different animal. The American Psychological Association said last year that features like endless scrolling and infinite feeds are “particularly risky” to young people, whose brains aren't as easily able to stop scrolling or watching and may become more distractible as a result.

That's why every expert I talked to emphasized an intentional approach to introducing tech to kids. Creating playlists of music or videos and selecting specific audiobooks or podcasts is akin to putting training wheels on that corner of the internet. The most important part of that process is talking to kids about what they're watching or listening to, and eventually, discussing how platforms like YouTube and Spotify work. That includes explaining how dark patterns and algorithmic feeds can compel them to keep consuming content.

“With some new boundaries and communication and approaches to content, parents can shift things in the right direction,” said Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School who coaches families on intentional approaches to tech use. “These tech companies don't deserve to occupy so much of our family's time and space.”

These tech companies are also acutely aware of the very public perception that their products harm kids. That's why we've seen the introduction of things like YouTube Kids and Instagram Teen Accounts, which offer more parental controls but still profit from capturing the attention of children. The least parents could do is empower those kids with digital literacy skills so that they gain an understanding of how these powerful platforms work.

The more I think about it, giving them their own smartphone to start the process at an early age — and talk to them about it constantly — is a great first step.

The last thing parents want is for the full weight of the internet to slam into their child's prefrontal cortex at the wrong time. You could argue that middle school, when many kids are deep in the throes of puberty, is the worst time for them to gain access to everything a smartphone can do. And even if there are parental controls in place, teens are famously good at figuring out ways to bypass them.

It's hard to imagine keeping phones out of kids' hands until an arbitrary age and then expecting them to develop a healthy relationship with the device overnight. At the same time, I get that giving a phone to a 3-year-old may strike many as way too young. In general, the concept of easing them into technology is a good one, and should remain the same regardless of the age the child gets their first tablet or phone or smartwatch. The process starts with a series of guardrails that gradually come off, and it requires time and attention from parents.

The last thing parents want is for the full weight of the internet to slam into their child's prefrontal cortex at the wrong time.

“The goal is absolutely to think about how we can foster healthy, meaningful use of technology early on,” said Eisha Buch, who oversees the digital citizenship program at Common Sense. “Because those skills and the mindsets ideally are there to stay and stick with them for when they are 16 or 18 or whenever they've left the house and the parent isn't there to guide them.”

Something that struck me when I started to imagine doing this for my own family is remembering the order in which I gained access to digital tools in the '90s. My first real gadget was a digital camera — not dissimilar to the device Przybylski says it's okay to give a 3-year-old. Then, I had an iPod, and eventually a flip phone. When I pick up my phone today, I still think of it primarily as a device that does helpful things like take pictures, play music, and connect me with family and friends. Admittedly, my phone has also turned into a way to waste time, thumbing through feeds or watching videos, and even my adult brain struggles to stop doing that.

David Bickham, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, suggested a framework that I found particularly useful: Parents should give their kid a device when it serves a need. They should engage with their kid about tech, release oversight sequentially, and give the kid tools to handle challenges or talk to a parent when they're in trouble.

“The worst outcome is a child who needs help from an adult but can't go to their parents because they don't have the trust that their parent is going to do something that's really going to help them,” Bickham said.

It's possible that starting this process at a very young age is particularly good at addressing that challenge. A toddler, in the best of circumstances, goes to their parents for help with everything: peeling a banana, putting on shoes, seeing pictures on a phone. One of the first sentences many toddlers learn is, “I need help.” If a parent wants to be seen as helpful when it comes to technology, making themselves available early on seems smart.

Even in the near future, when we'll be able to talk to AI agents in our glasses, smartphones will remain ubiquitous. This generation of parents, who mostly grew up in the '80s and '90s, have a unique opportunity to ease their kids into this tech-filled world and to help them develop a healthy relationship with that tech. Whether you start at age 3 or age 13, it's a hard but incredibly important job. Personally, I'll take the years-long head start that comes with starting sooner rather than later.

Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” — but doesn't want you to see a report that could do just that.

Most Americans still don't know that alcohol can cause cancer — and the alcohol industry is working hard to make sure it stays that way.

For the past three years, the industry, aided by its allies in Congress and later the Trump administration, has sought to discredit and eventually bury a major analysis that offers new evidence of the link between drinking alcohol and getting sick and dying from various causes, including cancer.

It appears their campaign has succeeded. Three co-authors on the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, which was commissioned in early 2022 by the US Department of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden, told Vox that they were informed last month that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the final draft of the study or its findings.

“The thing that the alcohol industry fears more than increased taxes is increased knowledge about the risks associated with drinking alcohol, particularly around cancer,” Mike Marshall, CEO of a group dedicated to reducing alcohol's harms called the Alcohol Policy Alliance, who was not involved with the study, told me. “Like the tobacco industry, like the opioid industry, they are working hard to prevent the American people from gaining the knowledge that they need to make the best decisions for themselves.”

Why assert so much pressure? It makes sense if you look at the headwinds the alcohol industry faces. Americans today are drinking less. This year, Gallup recorded a historic low in the percentage of US adults who drink: 54 percent, down from 67 percent in 2022.

Though the vibes around alcohol are shifting, a lot of people still don't fully understand alcohol's health consequences. Surveys have found that while the percentage of Americans who know that alcohol is a carcinogen has been rising, it is still below 50 percent.

By the end of the year, the federal government will issue new dietary guidelines — something that happens every five years — which include recommended limits on alcohol consumption. The alcohol study's results were intended to inform those guidelines.

“I was hopeful. … Look at all this evidence we have,” Priscilla Martinez, deputy scientific director of the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute and one of the co-authors, told me in an interview. “This is when the change is going to happen.”

But after the authors submitted their final report to Trump's health department in March and never saw it again, Reuters reported in June, citing anonymous sources, that the new dietary guidelines would eliminate any specific recommended limits on alcohol consumption.

“I think it's a shame,” said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and another co-author. “Anyone who is a decision-making authority, you want them to have all of the information.”

It is another example of the Trump administration seeming to work against the best interest of public health — despite allying itself closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again movement.

Kennedy and MAHA are fixated on harmful toxins and the corrupting influence of corporate interests. But neither Kennedy, who has been in addiction recovery himself for decades, nor the broader movement has seemed to make reducing alcohol consumption a priority. Instead, the Trump administration will not release a report that would actually show just how harmful to people's health drinking alcohol can be, the latest in a series of decisions that could actually leave Americans less healthy.

Vox reached out to the White House and HHS to ask why the administration hasn't published the study, but a spokesperson for the Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration, the HHS subagency that oversaw the Alcohol Intake and Health Report, declined to address our questions directly.

“People are going to get sick who might have avoided getting sick, because they might have decreased their drinking,” Martinez said.

For this story, I spoke with three of the six authors of the study: Martinez, Keyes, and co-author Tim Naimi, an alcohol researcher affiliated with the University of Victoria and Boston University. They all emphasized that they had sought to conduct a study that would fairly represent America's alcohol consumption. They not only reviewed a wide range of observational studies, but they also ran data through a statistical model based on the US population, specifically to estimate the mortality effects of alcohol for Americans.

Martinez said the thinking was: “We've got to make this relevant to Americans.”

They broke out their findings by different drinking levels — from one drink per day to three — and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. Their big-picture conclusion: Among the US population, the negative health effects of drinking alcohol start at low levels of consumption and begin to increase sharply the more a person drinks. A man drinking one drink per day has roughly a one in 1,000 chance of dying from any alcohol-related cause, whether an alcohol-associated cancer or liver disease or a drunk driving accident. Increase that to two drinks per day, and the odds increase to one in 25.

The general finding that the health risks from alcohol start at low levels of drinking and increase significantly for people who drink more is consistent with previous research, as I covered in a story earlier this year. Public health experts broadly agree that heavy drinking is bad for your health; the debate has been over moderate amounts of drinking. There is another issue that continues to complicate the debate: Lay people may have an inflated definition of what “moderate” drinking means compared to their doctor or a scientist, which could lead to people putting their health at risk even if they don't think of themselves as heavy drinkers.

In that context, the report is a harrowing read: Alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer — colorectal, breast cancer in women, liver, oral, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Risk for these cancers increases with any alcohol use and continues to grow with higher levels of use, the study's authors concluded. Women experience a higher risk of an alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed than men. Men and women who die from an alcohol-attributable cause die 15 years earlier on average.

Amid all of the public discourse about alcohol and its health effects, here was a clear and authoritative summary of the evidence that would be most relevant to Americans. It was, its authors told me, consistent with the scientific consensus at this time.

“Nothing we're saying is all that surprising or controversial to those of us who know the field,” Keyes said.

So, why has the US government buried the final draft of that report for the past six months? And why does it appear that the Trump administration will instead push the country's dietary guidelines in the opposite direction?

Every five years, the federal government reviews the nation's dietary guidelines and issues new ones that reflect the current best consensus among scientists about what we should eat, how much of it we should eat, and what we should avoid eating and drinking to lead a healthy life.

US officials always solicit expert opinion as they prepare a fresh set of dietary guidelines. The input is usually compiled into one massive report from a group of experts called the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and then submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, the two agencies that produce the guidelines.

That was how the process went in 2020, and at that time, the subcommittee of researchers dedicated to alcohol (including Naimi) advised the government to reduce the recommended limit down to one drink per day for men, from two. The Trump administration ultimately decided not to follow the recommendation.

Ahead of drafting the new guidance for 2025, the Biden administration began considering in February 2022 whether to take a different approach to more thoroughly review alcohol's health effects ahead of the 2025 dietary guidelines being developed and released. By April 2022, HHS had decided to launch a new review of the science on alcohol and health, called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study — the research Trump's administration has yet to release — to be conducted by an outside expert panel. That analysis would be submitted to Congress as part of an annual report on underage drinking, and it would be shared with USDA and HHS to consider for the 2025 dietary guidelines.

It makes sense why the federal government would launch an effort like this. The negative health effects of alcohol have been getting more and more attention, and research continues to link drinking even in moderate amounts to cancer, liver disease, and mental health problems. The World Health Organization declared in 2023 that no amount of drinking could be considered safe. It was time to take a hard look at American drinking.

With their mouthful titles and tangle of acronyms, it's easy to lose track of which government report is which. To keep them straight, here are the key ways the Biden-commissioned Alcohol Intake and Health Study differs from the more recent National Academies report:

But almost immediately, controversy was already brewing around the Alcohol Intake and Health Study.

In December 2022, several months after HHS had decided to launch the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, Congress included a provision in a routine government spending bill: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine should undertake its own study of alcohol's health effects and submit that as the basis for the 2025 dietary guidelines. Two of the initial co-authors for that report were removed after objections over their reported connections to the alcohol industry. But at least one of the scholars who replaced them has also had their work supported by the industry.

When the experts who would produce the Alcohol Intake and Health Study were named in 2023, the alcohol industry began to circulate documents to lawmakers and other government officials claiming authors of the study were prejudiced against alcohol (all of the researchers had submitted conflict-of-interest paperwork ahead of joining the project). Naimi, in particular, has been labeled a “new prohibitionist” by Reason, a libertarian publication.

Keyes told me that she believed she had been criticized for, in effect, describing the findings of various alcohol-related studies.

“When I read criticism of my involvement in the committee, and it was described as a conflict of interest, the conflict was that I had accurately described scientific research in the media,” Keyes said.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill waded into the fight. In March 2024, Congress tucked a provision into another omnibus spending bill that instructed HHS and USDA to consider the National Academies report when writing the alcohol guidelines. Representatives from states including Kentucky and California — where whiskey and wine are important cultural exports, respectively — sent letters to HHS in April 2024 and again that September, criticizing the Alcohol Intake and Health Study for being duplicative of the National Academies report — even though the former was commissioned by the government first. (HHS said at the time that it would not be duplicative but complementary.) The House Oversight Committee even sought to subpoena documents from the agency on the HHS report and the process that was producing it.

Both groups of researchers continued to assemble their reports as the public relations war raged. But when it came time to publish their findings, they had very different experiences.

A draft version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study was posted on January 15, just days before Trump's second inauguration and around the same time that then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recommended that alcohol come with cancer warning labels; you can still find it online here. This is the process for most government reports: The authors put together a draft, the initial findings are released for public comment, stakeholders submit their takes, and then the authors will take those comments into consideration and revise their report for its final publication.

But that didn't happen with the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. After the public comment period, the authors made minor revisions — not to the findings themselves but to help translate its takeaways for non-experts. They sent that final report to the Trump administration in March.

And after that…nothing. The report never surfaced, and, according to the three co-authors I spoke with, they received no explanation for the radio silence.

Vox contacted HHS with a detailed list of questions about the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and why it hasn't been released, as well as Kennedy's general perspective on alcohol and health. The agency sent a brief comment in response:

“This information has been provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Guidelines,” an HHS spokesperson said.

Some of the authors still held out hope that the study would be included in the annual report on underage drinking that is required by federal law to be submitted to Congress and is expected later this year.

But then in August, those hopes were shattered: According to all three co-authors, they were told that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the study in any form and would not include it in the upcoming congressional report on underage drinking. (The authors are currently working, as they always planned to do, on publishing their findings in an independent academic journal.)

Then, at the beginning of September, Congress introduced a new government spending bill that would, among many other things, defund the interagency group responsible for launching the Alcohol Intake and Health Study in the first place during the Biden administration.

The National Academies report, on the other hand, has been released on time. Its findings, however, were controversial: It indicated that moderate levels of drinking could actually be beneficial to people, and even the links to cancer, despite ethanol being widely classified as a carcinogen, were limited. Some unaffiliated alcohol researchers have called their findings and their methodology into question.

Critics said the National Academies report was based on observational studies that can show a correlation between, for example, moderate drinking and cardiovascular health, but don't prove a cause; the National Academies report's authors acknowledged that limitation. As Naimi told me earlier this year, many moderate drinkers may have other attributes — such as higher incomes — that could explain their better health without accounting for alcohol. Critics of the National Academies report also said the authors had used overly restrictive criteria for which research to include, excluding many studies that have found harmful effects from alcohol use.

The Alcohol Intake and Health Study, on the other hand, focused on health outcomes for which there is a substantiated link to alcohol, included more studies, and modeled the available data to the US population.

The ball is now in the Trump administration's court. Will it change the dietary guidelines as rumored and eliminate a specific recommended limit on alcohol consumption? The National Academies report would appear to set the stage for such a change, with its industry-preferred messaging that low levels of drinking could make people healthier.

And all the while, the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and a very different perspective on alcohol's health effects remains locked in the administration's proverbial basement.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized the military's strike on a Venezuelan drug boat, saying “even the worst people in our country” get trials.

The boat strike, which President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday, killed 11 people associated with the Tren de Aragua organized crime group.

Paul suggested the drug boat's occupants should have been given a chance to be tried for their crimes.

“The reason we have trials and we don't automatically assume guilt is what if we make a mistake and they happen to be people fleeing the Venezuelan dictator?” Paul said.

Paul said it isn't “our policy” to “blow people up” on the United States's coast. He added, “Even the worst people in our country, if we accuse somebody of a terrible crime, they still get a trial.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the strike on Tuesday, saying they “conducted a lethal strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug vessel which had departed from Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.”

Trump suggested the objective of the strike was to put fear into the hearts of drug dealers. 

“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” the president wrote on Truth Social.

The administration said Venezuela's government enables drug dealers and traffickers. It denied that, and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called Attorney General Pam Bondi's move to raise the award for President Nicolas Maduro's arrest “pathetic” and a “crude political propaganda operation.”

Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking in a U.S. federal court in 2020. The U.S. has not said whether it will strike Venezuela directly.

TRUMP'S TIKTOK DEAL ‘HOSTAGE' TO CHINA TRADE TALKS AS DEADLINE LOOMS

The U.S. recently boosted its military presence near Venezuela, deploying three warships to the coast of the country to combat drug cartels. Venezuela reacted negatively to the deployment.

Maduro called the ships an “extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat” and moved his forces to the country's coastline to defend against a possible American attack.

Trump directed the military to target Latin American cartels last month.

A streetcar derailed in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and injuring about 18.

Several were seriously injured in the Portuguese capital, known for its streetcars, which are a prime tourist attraction.

The accident is the worst in the city's recent history. It's unclear how many foreigners or Americans were injured.

The wrecked streetcar is colored yellow and white and was named the Elevador da Gloria. It operates up and down a steep downtown hill in the city and is classified as a national monument.

Witnesses say the streetcar went down the hill without control and ended up on its side. The sides and top of the car were damaged, and the car appeared to have crashed into a building where the road bends. Several parts of the metal vehicle were crushed.

Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa offered his condolences to the families, and the mayor of Lisbon, Carlos Moedas, said the city was mourning the accident.

“It's a tragedy of the like we've never seen,” Moedas said. “It's a tragedy of the like we've never seen,” Moedas said.

Portugal's government announced that a day of national mourning would be observed on Thursday. “A tragic accident … caused the irreparable loss of human life, which left in mourning their families and dismayed the whole country,” it said in a statement.

It's unclear what caused the crash during the evening rush hour. Emergency officials said victims were pulled from the wreckage in just over two hours. The government said an investigation into the incident would happen after the recovery operation is finished.

Several world leaders mourned the accident, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “It is with sadness that I learned of the derailment of the famous Elevador da Gloria,” she wrote in Portuguese on X.

WHO IS LISA COOK, THE FED GOVERNOR TRUMP IS TRYING TO FIRE?

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on X that he was “appalled by the terrible accident.”

Lisbon brings in millions of tourists yearly, with the streetcar as one of its most popular attractions.

OpenAI is rapidly expanding its presence in India — one of the key markets for its flagship ChatGPT product.

India is an appealing destination for U.S. tech giants, with companies ranging from Google to Meta betting on its huge — and young — population over recent years.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visited the country in February this year and met with the country's IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to discuss collaboration. During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.

He has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is "amazing to watch."

"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world," he said on X earlier this year.

India is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. "OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge," he added.

Here's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.

Since its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.

Downloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.

The download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.

User spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.

That underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.

To address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.

"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later," Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.

According to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.

The ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.

It also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.

While India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.

Continued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms. 

OpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.

"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles," Futurum Group's Patience said.

"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain."

As Gen Z workers return to the office, they're reshaping corporate norms by embracing AI, normalizing mental health chats, and being more authentic at work.  

Born between 1997 and 2012, many Gen Zers entered the workforce during the pandemic, navigating their first jobs amid remote work arrangements, uncertainty and rapid change.  

Some top business leaders linked the rise of remote work to Gen Z, raising concerns about workplace discipline and engagement. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, "the zoomers don't show up" — referring to Gen Z professionals. 

British businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, said young people "just want to sit at home," and that they need to get back to the office.

Despite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL. 

As older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age. 

This has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral "Gen Z stare", to the "office siren" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like "ick"  becoming normalized in professional lingo.  

"Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity," Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC.  

Senior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap. 

Twenty-five-year-old Weirong Li, a communications professional who graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business, said she was going into the office five days a week, while more senior colleagues would stick to a hybrid or remote schedule. Li noted that the people who do come into the office are generally of a similar age to her.  

"With this hybrid schedule, it's based on your hierarchy, so if you are higher up...you have more of a slack to not come into the office because you're in a position where you've already proven yourself and you don't need to build a network." 

This has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities.  

"Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. I would reach out to people on LinkedIn or even cold email people," Li explained.

She added she takes water-cooler chats "quite seriously" because she views them as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and meet someone new.

Some Gen Zers are deliberately signing up to professional networking events to try to bridge the gap and mingle in a structured environment, as CNBC previously reported.  

Twenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up.

Gen Z workers aren't shy about bringing their personalities to work and blurring the boundaries between personal and professional, including dressing more casually and being unfiltered in meetings and conversations.  

Twenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings "her whole self to work," she said. "'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on. I wear sneakers or my Birkenstocks every day."  

 Gen Z workers are often more casual and comfortable in how they show up at work — sometimes literally.

"It'll always be the Gen Zers that sit on the floor instead of sitting like in a chair at a desk," Lanni said, referring to team meetings. "We find the bean bags, or we find the more unique seating situations." 

Li believes showing up to work with an authentic personality is a unique trait of Gen Z culture, regardless of whether it aligns with corporate norms.  

"It's a part of our kind of Gen Z norm, which is showing who we are, what we stand for, our mission, our purpose... value-based actions and conversations do matter for us," she said. "We're more open, and we realize that's also a superpower, that's how people remember us."  

Where mental health was formerly a hush-hush conversation in the workplace, Gen Z workers like prioritizing wellbeing.

Roughly 51% of young people view mental and physical health as a primary metric of future success, more than other factors like wealth, occupation and family relationships, according to a recent global EY study of over 10,000 respondents aged between 18 and 34 years.

Communications professional Li noted that, after the pandemic, "psychological safety has been very important" for young people, so essentially being able to bring their emotional side to work.  

She said that her friends and colleagues often check in with each other during lunch breaks. "We really value having conversations about how we are doing mentally or physically so that we acknowledge the person in a work context and environment."  

Instead of making the typical office small talk, young workers like Li try to take the conversation deeper.  

"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people," Li said. "We feel like we have shared values and can relate. It makes communications easier. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7."  

Lanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace. 

Lanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are "pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted."  

Gen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work.

Twenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams.  

"We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI," she said. "We can be that resource as much as we can."  

Around 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte.  

Lissick said that adopting AI is an advantage because it shows your ability to be tech agile and forward-thinking to managers.  

Li said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work.   

"The goal is to have more time to do other stuff later on and so I think that we're a quite focused generation contrary to what other people think. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work," she said.

Workplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: "Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss."

CNBC obtained a copy of the National Football League's Summary of Attendance Statistics for the 2024 season, an internal document shared within the league, but not available to the public. The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.

The NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.

Story continues after interactive chart.

The VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.

The league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.

The San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts. The Indianapolis Colts were next to last, at $83.3 million, and the Arizona Cardinals came in just above the Colts, at $83.4 million.

The 49ers also had the highest general admission ticket price, at $190.78 last season, followed by the Philadelphia Eagles, at $184.27, and the Las Vegas Raiders, at $165.58. The New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls but have not made the postseason since 2021, charged the highest club seat premium at $471.92 — more than double the NFL average.

The NFL declined to comment in response to CNBC's questions regarding the Summary of Attendance Statistics report.

President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who lower courts ordered reinstated after he terminated her.

Trump wants the Supreme Court to pause her reinstatement as he appeals the case.

"President Trump acted lawfully when he removed Rebecca Slaughter from the FTC," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

"Indeed, the Supreme Court has twice in the last few months confirmed the President's authority to remove the heads of executive agencies," Desai said. "We look forward to being vindicated for a third time — and hopefully after this ruling, the lower courts will cease their defiance of Supreme Court orders."

Trump in March removed Slaughter and another Democratic commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, as part of a sprawling effort to exert his influence over federal agencies.

Slaughter and Bedoya then sued Trump, seeking to be reinstated. But Bedoya resigned from the FTC in June and dropped his case.

In July, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Slaughter's firing was illegal.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C., upheld that ruling in a 2-1 decision.

The appeals court  held that FTC commissioners cannot be removed unless there is cause, which has been defined as neglect or malfeasance in office. 

Trump did not give a reason for firing Slaughter.

"The government has no likelihood of success on appeal," the ruling said.

Slaughter returned to work at the FTC after the appeals court decision.

Slaughter's case is the second in recent weeks to raise the question of whether Trump has legal "cause" to justify removing a federal regulator.

The question of "cause" is also at the crux of Trump's unprecedented effort to remove Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Trump last month moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, claims that her attorney has denied, setting up a court battle that could also end up at the Supreme Court.

A court hearing on the matter ended without resolution last week, leaving the future of Cook's position unclear.

Lululemon shares plunged in extended trading Thursday after the company gave a much worse than expected full-year outlook.

The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. But it said it expected tariffs to hit its full-year profits by $240 million.

Lululemon said it expects full fiscal year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share, well below Wall Street estimates of $14.45 per share. It also anticipates full-year revenue of $10.85 billion to $11 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.18 billion.

"We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business," CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. "The increased rates and removal of the de minimis provisions have played a large part in our guidance reduction for the year."

Here's how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares of the company sank more than 10% after the bell Thursday. The stock is down more than 45% this year.

Programming note: Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald will be interviewed exclusively on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period. Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

McDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles "run too long," particularly in its lounge and social categories.

"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends," he said.

"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests," McDonald added.

Bret Taylor's artificial intelligence startup Sierra has just joined an exclusive club: The company sports a new $10 billion valuation after raising $350 million in fresh capital.

Sierra is one of just a handful of AI startups, including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines that are valued at or above $10 billion. 

Investors are pouring money into this competitive group of companies in the hopes that they'll eventually hit the public markets.

Taylor is the chairman of OpenAI's board, and previously served as co-CEO of Salesforce alongside Marc Benioff. Taylor co-founded Sierra in 2023. The company builds and implements AI agents for customer service. AI agents can carry out tasks autonomously on behalf of their users.

Shares of Salesforce fell 5% Thursday after the company reported weak guidance and concerns lingered about how AI is affecting software companies.

Sierra said its agents are already being used by "hundreds of millions of people" to help with tasks like refinancing homes, ordering lunch, delivering furniture, understanding insurance deductibles and fixing technology, among other things.

Greenoaks led Sierra's latest funding round, the company said. Its valuation more than doubled from its most recent raise in October.

"We're in this for the long term," Sierra said in a blog post on Thursday.

The company said it will use its fresh funding to invest in its platform and focus on domestic and international expansion.

Sierra's funding follows a flurry of other major AI raises in Silicon Valley. Earlier this week, Anthropic announced it had closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation.

President Donald Trump's administration said on Thursday it will drop a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers.

In December, the U.S. Transportation Department under then President Joe Biden sought public comment on the rulemaking process about whether airlines should be required to pay $200-$300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays. U.S. airlines sharply criticized the proposal.

The White House said in a document posted on Thursday that USDOT plans to withdraw the notice "consistent with department and administration priorities."

In May 2023, Biden said his administration would write rules requiring airlines to compensate passengers for disrupted flights.

Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines others, did not immediately comment but said last year that Biden's plan would raise ticket prices.

Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. Major carriers in 2022 committed to paying for meals, hotel stays and other expenses when they cause significant flight disruptions.

Canada, Brazil, the European Union and the United Kingdom all have airline delay compensation rules.

In December, USDOT said it was considering if airlines must cover meals, hotel stays and other costs after carrier disruptions and whether to require airlines to rebook passengers on their next available flights, or if flights are unavailable for 24 hours, potentially requiring them to use competitors.

The Trump administration has taken other steps to reverse Biden airline consumer efforts.

In May, the Justice Department dropped a lawsuit against Southwest Airlines filed by the Biden administration in its final days that accused the carrier of illegally operating chronically delayed flights.

Stephen Miran will take an unpaid leave of absence as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors at the White House while filling the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's Board if confirmed.

At a confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, Miran, President Donald Trump's nominee for the open Fed Governor role, said he wouldn't fully resign from his position at the White House while serving out the Fed Governor's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. He's set to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly at the beginning of August.

Miran's appointment comes amid speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" and obtain ample influence in the central bank, raising fears about the central bank's independence. Miran keeping his White House job while serving as Fed governor could further fuel those concerns.

"I have been advised by counsel that the legal approach is to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisors, cease my activities and if council advises me otherwise, I will follow the law and follow council's advice," Miran said at the hearing.

"The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign," he added.

Trump has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates, criticizing current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for staying put for too long. At the hearing, Miran repeatedly pledged to uphold the central bank's independence, stressing that no one at the administration had asked him to commit to easing monetary policy.

The Fed's next policy meeting takes place on Sept. 16-17.

A lawyer for Lisa Cook said the Justice Department appeared to open a criminal investigation in a desperate attempt to find a legal reason to fire her from the Federal Reserve's board of governors.

In a statement, Cook's attorney Abbe Lowell described the criminal probe as "cover."

"Predictably and recognizing the flaws in challenging their illegal firing of Governor Cook, the administration is scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach," Lowell said. "This Justice Department — perhaps the most politicized in American history — will do whatever President Trump demands."

"He wants cover, and they are providing it," Lowell added.

The Justice Department's criminal investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Bill Pulte — a Trump administration official who has aggressively attacked Cook — canceled a press conference in front of a Washington, DC, federal courthouse to present "new information" about the Federal Reserve board governor.

"Once you see what we present on Thursday, there's going to be a lot of people apologizing and retracting their false and defamatory statements," Pulte said on X Tuesday morning. "Watch."

Pulte on Wednesday canceled the press conference, however, tweeting he was doing so "out of respect for the process."

The Justice Department is using grand juries and sending subpoenas as part of its investigation, according to the Journal.

The criminal investigation marks a major escalation in the Trump administration's war against Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose term ends in 2038.

President Donald Trump published a letter in August saying he was firing Cook for "cause" based on a criminal referral from Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and says Cook lied on mortgage documents.

Pulte says Cook took out mortgages at around the same time for properties in Georgia and Michigan and said that each would be her primary residence.

Cook sued Trump last week, saying Pulte's allegations didn't meet the legal standard for a "cause" firing.

The federal judge overseeing the case, US District Judge Jia Cobb, is weighing whether to issue a temporary restraining order confirming that Cook will remain in her job while additional litigation plays out.

Earlier this week, Justice Department officials urged her to decide quickly so that the parties would have a chance to appeal her decision ahead of the Federal Reserve's September 16 meeting.

Neither Pulte nor the Justice Department responded to requests for comment.

At a court hearing Friday, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth said Trump rightfully fired Cook. The Federal Reserve's role in setting interest rates means that a person who lies on mortgage documents can't be trusted, he said.

He also criticized Cook for not providing any explanation for the apparent inconsistencies in her mortgage documents.

"Is there some material factual dispute?" Roth said during the hearing. "I think if there was something like that, we would have heard it by now."

Lowell, at Friday's hearing, said that the apparent inconsistencies did not meet the legal definition for "cause" required by the law. He said Trump needed to give Cook due process, and that the narrative about mortgage documents was a pretext for Trump filling the Federal Reserve with his own appointees to lower interest rates as part of his economic plan.

"A bad motive can illuminate the fact that there was no real cause," he said.

In a Tuesday court filing, Cook's attorneys wrote, "Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud."

Lowell said in his Thursday statement that he would continue to address the allegations.

"The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again," Lowell said.

This story has been updated to add additional comments from Abbe Lowell.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.

Kennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm, including death, especially among young people," apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.

Kennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, "I agree with it."

He also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access "depends on the state" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.

The Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.

"I'm not taking them away from people," Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.

But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.

The FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.

"You clearly are taking away vaccines," she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.

Kennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.

His comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of "a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections."

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he "is taking flak because he's over the target" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's "commonsense effort." 

Kennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness. 

"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start," Kennedy said.  

He also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.

"I would like to see the data and talk about the data," Kennedy said.

But data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024. 

The CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.

Those shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.

Kennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.

"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group," the HHS secretary said. "They are very, very pro-vaccine."

But a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at "historic lows for years" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.

Correction: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. An earlier version misstated the day.

A bad year just got worse for Salesforce.

Following a disappointing revenue forecast in its quarterly earnings report late Wednesday, Salesforce's stock slumped 8%, bringing its decline for 2025 to 28%. That's the worst performance in large-cap tech.

Revenue increased 10% in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier, cracking double-digit growth for the first time since early 2024. Sales of $10.24 billion topped the average analyst estimate of $10.14 billion, and earnings per share also exceeded expectations.

However, for the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce said revenue will be $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion, while analysts were expecting $10.29 billion, according to LSEG.

Salesforce regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, but the company hasn't been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers — particularly those focused on infrastructure. 

There's also a concern on Wall Street that AI is going to eat away at much of the software sector.

"While the investor community oozes angst over the future of SaaS, the here and now from Salesforce, while impressive at scale, is not enough to reshape the narrative," wrote analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a report on Wednesday. The analysts have a buy rating on the stock.

Salesforce is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products, Robin Washington, the company's president and chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts.

In its earnings release, Salesforce said it closed over 12,500 total deals for Agentforce, which can automate the handling of customer service questions. That includes 6,000 paid deals. The company said that over 40% of bookings for Agentforce and its data cloud came from existing customers.

CEO Marc Benioff maintained his optimistic tone, downplaying concerns about the AI threat to software and telling analysts on the earnings call that "we are seeing one of the greatest transformations" in the space.

"To hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, and people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth," Benioff said.

Salesforce kept its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue.

Retirement account balances, which fell at the start of the year due to market volatility, bounced back in the second quarter, according to the latest data from Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) savings plans.

The average 401(k) balance jumped 8% from a year earlier to $137,800, a record high, Fidelity found.

The average individual retirement account balance also rose 5% year over year to $131,366.

The rebound in account balances helped boost the number of 401(k) millionaires to an all-time high. 

The number of 401(k) accounts with a balance of $1 million or more jumped to 595,000 as of June 30, up 16% from the first quarter, according to Fidelity.

The number of IRA-created millionaires also increased by 16% to a record 501,481.

Positive savings behaviors were key to better outcomes, said Mike Shamrell, Fidelity's vice president of thought leadership.

The majority of retirement savers continued to make contributions, even during periods of market turbulence, Fidelity found. The average 401(k) contribution rate, including employer and employee contributions, largely held steady at 14.2%, just shy of Fidelity's suggested savings rate of 15%.

A great stretch for the major indexes also helped.

U.S. markets came under pressure after the White House first announced country-specific tariffs on April 2, causing some of the worst trading days for the S&P 500 since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, markets then rebounded from those losses. Savers who "stayed the course, continued to contribute at healthy levels and didn't make significant changes to their allocation, were able to take advantage of the positive market conditions that followed," said Shamrell.

As of Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 was up about 10% year to date, the Nasdaq had gained more than 11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose roughly 6%.

"We have seen a lot of resilience out of the market despite a lot of volatility," said Tim Maurer, a certified financial planner and the chief advisory officer at SignatureFD, based in Atlanta.

"Markets have a positive rate of return," said Maurer, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. "Any asset class that has a positive rate of return should regularly hit new highs."

I've traveled to more than 20 countries, but Mexico continues to be one of my favorite destinations to visit.

One Mexican city in particular has stolen my heart: Puerto Vallarta. Located on the country's west coast, Puerto Vallarta is more than just a classic resort town. It offers a unique blend of pristine beaches, a bustling downtown scene, and plenty of outdoor adventure.

I've visited Puerto Vallarta four times in the past two years — with friends, family, and for bachelorette parties — and every trip has offered something a little different.

Whether you're looking for nature, nightlife, relaxation, or mouthwatering dishes, there truly is something for every type of traveler. Here's why I love visiting this lively Mexican city.

One of the best parts of traveling is indulging in the local delicacies, and Puerto Vallarta has no shortage of incredible meals.

Those who want a fun and classic street-food-style experience should head to Pancho's Takos.

The restaurant's al pastor tacos are so good that you'll probably have to wait in a line that stretches around the block. Fortunately, it's in the heart of downtown, so you can see street performers and people-watch while waiting.

Travelers looking for something a little more luxe will love the stretch of restaurants along Playa Los Muertos (the main tourist beach).

I especially enjoy El Dorado, which has fresh-tasting seafood, craft cocktails, and attentive service. The best part is the option to dine with your toes in the sand.

I recommend going for dinner at sunset for a romantic and memorable dining experience — just be sure to make reservations ahead of time, as tables go fast.

Puerto Vallarta's nightlife offers an inclusive and spirited ambiance and is ideal for a late night on the town with friends.

The Zona Romántica, or Romantic Zone, is home to lots of bars and nightclubs. It's also a hub for the LGBTQ+ communities and reminds me of West Hollywood.

Once the sun goes down, crowds spill (or dance) out of bass-pumping bars on every corner.

If a party is what you're looking for, you won't have to try very hard to find it in the Zona Romántica.

Outdoorsy folks will love the plethora of scenic hiking trails, water sports, and natural wonders in or near Puerto Vallarta.

I recommend checking out the Palo Maria waterfall trail, a moderate 1.4-mile trail that leads to a small waterfall and swimming hole. I loved jumping in the water to cool off from the heat and snapping photos.

If whale watching sounds like something up your alley, make sure to visit between December and March, when humpback whales migrate to Puerto Vallarta's Banderas Bay to breed and give birth. It's an awe-inspiring sight to witness.

During one of my trips to the city, I even got to look under the sea's surface with a snorkeling tour to Los Arcos National Marine Park. You can get there by boat or kayak — I opted for a kayaking tour through the Garza Blanca Resort.

The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing for Stephen Miran on Thursday.

Miran, the economist nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the open Federal Reserve governor post vacated by Adriana Kugler, will come under scrutiny amid questions of the Fed's independence.

On Wednesday, Miran pledged to uphold the central bank's independence, as well as its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.

"In my view, the most important job of the central bank is to prevent Depressions and hyperinflations. Independence of monetary policy is a critical element for its success," Miran said in his opening remarks submitted to the Senate Banking Committee ahead of time.

The hearing is set to start at 10 a.m. ET.

Figma shares plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, falling to the lowest price since the design software vendor's IPO in July after the company reported earnings for the first time as a public company.

Results for the second quarter were largely inline with expectations, as Figma had issued preliminary results a little over a month ago. Revenue increased 41% from a year earlier to $249.6 million, slightly topping analyst estimates of $248.8 million, according to LSEG.

Analysts at Piper Sandler described the report as "largely a non-event," but noted that the "shares have witnessed hyper-volatility" following their 250% surge in the trading debut.

Since closing at $115.50 on its first day, the stock has lost more than half its value, lowering the company's market cap to about $27 billion.

For the third quarter, Figma forecasted revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

Figma's IPO was significant for Silicon Valley and the tech sector broadly as it represented one of the highest-profile offerings in years and signaled Wall Street's growing appetite for growth. The market had been in a multiyear lull that began in early 2022, when inflation was soaring and interest rates were on the rise.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

— CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Kern. It has been edited for length and clarity.

From June through September, my days revolve around the tide and the sun. When the sun sets, I know it's time to eat and rest. When the tide touches the bottom of my mooring buoy, it's time to work on the rock wall I'm building to help fight erosion.

That's what days are like on Planet Sand. That's my preferred name for the 1.5-acre island in Casco Bay, about a 15-minute boat ride from Portland, Maine. The island — officially called Sand Island — has no running water, electricity, or reliable internet. It's my home for three months out of the year.

While I'm on Planet Sand, I live in a structure I call my Garden Shed Tree Fort. It's built from recycled construction trash that I collected from dumps on the mainland. How big is it? It's perfect. That's the measurement system we use here on Planet Sand: too big, not enough, or perfect.

I have a gas-powered generator that I use to power a deep freezer. I don't fish, and I hate the taste of seafood, so I prefer to grill chicken or a burger. I'd like to add a crock pot to my supplies next summer, but I'm not sure how I'll power it.

I go into town as little as possible. My boat is small and slow, so Portland, the nearest city, is a 45-minute boat ride for me. My record is eight weeks, but it's more typical to go get supplies every three to five weeks. I collect water from a café on a nearby island, bringing over 30 gallons at a time.

People love to ask about the bathroom situation. I say, "Next question." I'm out here doing something extraordinary, working to save the world, and you want to know where I pee?

My parents bought a half-ownership in Sand Island back in the 1990s. We lived on another island in Casco Bay, but that one was populated, paved, and connected to the mainland by a bridge.

Sand Island is different; it's essentially a wasteland of sand and poison ivy. There were no structures or docks. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the shore of the island, including time to scramble over rocks. Still, I've turned trash into treasure.

My parents owned a 30-foot sailboat and loved to come to Planet Sand. I enjoyed camping there, and my stays got longer and longer. In the real world, I was an outsider, but on Planet Sand, I felt at home. The island called to me.

Unfortunately, I didn't always hear that call. I have some health issues and have struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism. For years, that made me forget about the island. But when I started getting healthier, I knew where I wanted to spend my summers.

When I first returned to Planet Sand for the summers, I was still drinking. I would wake up at noon, so hungover. We allow day visitors to the island, so I would see families playing together in this beautiful place, all while my head throbbed.

I thought, "What am I doing to myself?" I have this beautiful spot, and I'm throwing it all away. That's why I stopped drinking, too. This November, I'll mark seven years in recovery.

Being out here is not a vacation. I work all day, building a rock wall or repairing my winch system. I document my projects on my YouTube channel. While I work, I listen to songs on my battery-powered radio. I love '90s hits and oldies from the 1950s and '60s. Those songs are just so happy.

I like to socialize with the boaters who come by. Most of the time, it's just me here, but on one day this summer, we had 60 people on the island. I love watching people laugh and explore with their families. There are kids here making memories that will last their whole lives.

I've heard there's research about nature being good for mental health. If they say 15 minutes in nature can improve your mental health, just imagine what three months can do. For me, the island — my planet — is magic and medicine.

The National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, features around 350 planes and missiles in its collection, but there's one aircraft in the World War II Gallery that attracts a particularly large crowd.

Bockscar, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.

When accompanied by a museum volunteer, visitors can walk under the plane to see where the 10,000-pound bomb was loaded.

I visited the National Museum at the US Air Force in August to see the historic aircraft. Here's a closer look at Bockscar.

The US bombed Nagasaki three days after dropping the "Little Boy" atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

The bombing of Nagasaki initially killed an estimated 40,000 people and injured around 60,000 more, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources.

Japan didn't surrender after the US dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. After Bockscar dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, the emperor of Japan announced their surrender on August 15, bringing World War II to a close.

Additional factors, such as Japan's weakened military resources and the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria on August 9, are also understood to have contributed to Japan's surrender.

The aircraft measures 99 feet long with a wingspan of 141 feet and 3 inches.

It cost $639,000 to build in 1945, which is around $11.6 million in 2025 when adjusted for inflation.

Bockscar was based at Wendover Army Air Field in Utah. The plane flew from Utah to Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands and then from Tinian to Nagasaki.

The nose art was removed from the plane for the top-secret mission, and its tail markings were changed to indicate the 44th Bomb Group instead of the 509th to disguise its true purpose.

Bock normally flew Bockscar, but switched planes with Maj. Charles Sweeney, commander of the 393rd Bomb Squadron, for the bombing of Nagasaki.

Sweeney had previously piloted another B-29, The Great Artiste, that accompanied the Enola Gay as an observation aircraft during the bombing of Hiroshima.

At Nagasaki, Bock flew The Great Artiste, and Sweeney piloted Bockscar.

The Fat Man atomic bomb weighed 10,000 pounds and exploded with 20,000 tons of TNT.

The museum refurbished a demilitarized Mk III bomb to look like the Fat Man, which was painted yellow so that it could easily be seen after it was dropped.

Lt. Charles Levy took this colorized photo of the Fat Man's explosion from aboard The Great Artiste. The mushroom cloud rose over 60,000 feet in the air.

The exact number of people who died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will never be known. According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the "low" estimate shared by the US military in the 1940s counted 70,000 deaths at Hiroshima and 40,000 at Nagasaki, totaling 110,000. The "high" estimate, which anti-nuclear weapons scientists and Japan released in the 1970s, counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima and 70,000 at Nagasaki for a total of 210,000 lives lost.

If you're stuck in the weeds of the stock market every day, it can be tough to appreciate a historically significant shift happening right before your very eyes.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs led by Peter Oppenheimer, the firm's chief global equity strategist, say it's time to recognize such a change that's already underway. 

They call it the "postmodern cycle," which they say is the fourth long secular bull run since World War II. The strategists see a structural shift in stocks, with new factors starting to drive returns — and by extension, new opportunities for investors.

"The reason we called it the 'Postmodern' cycle is that we thought it would have elements that mirrored experiences of historical cycles but would also contain distinct and unique drivers that would shape investment opportunities differently," the Goldman strategists wrote.

Detailed below are the ways the current super cycle differs from past instances, as well as how the bank thinks investors can best position their investments for the new regime.

There are three things that differentiate the postmodern period from previous structural eras, according to Goldman.

High valuations. New structural bull markets tend to start off with stocks at low valuations. That doesn't look to be the case this time around, the bank said, pointing to the historically high S&P 500 Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, one measure of how expensive the S&P 500 is valued.

"So absolute returns are likely to be lower," the bank added of stocks.

Higher interest rates and inflation. Goldman says inflation and, consequently, long-term interest rates, are likely to trend higher. That differs from the past two super cycles, where interest rates generally trended lower.

Investors have already been eyeing the threat that inflation will run hotter this year as companies begin to feel the impact of tariffs, which could lead them to raise prices for consumers. Hotter inflation also gives the Fed less room to cut interest rates, raising borrowing costs in the economy.

"Post-Covid inflation has triggered a rise in term premia," Goldman said, adding that they believed interest rates had "little room to fall" today.

Government debt will swell. The government will likely continue to run up its balance sheet, Goldman said. That differs from past periods, such as during former President Bill Clinton's term in the late 1990s, when the US budget was in a surplus for the first time in decades.

Higher debt levels are another factor driving up borrowing costs in the economy. That's because investors in the bond market are concerned about the sustainability of the US debt, causing Treasury yields to rise.

"Each of these may weigh on aggregate corporate profits, although we are likely to experience wider differences between winners and losers," strategists said.

While those changes are largely a net negative on equity prices, that's not to say there won't be bright areas of the market for investors. The bank also highlighted three "mega trends" that it believed could offer "significant" opportunities for investors:

Technology. The tech boom will likely continue to power the overall market, the bank said, pointing to the recent momentum in the AI trade. US tech stocks have largely been responsible for powering the overall market to fresh records in recent years, and large firms are still shelling out big to invest in AI.

"The ascent of technology in driving both economies and financial markets in recent years has further to go, in our view," strategists wrote.

Services and Manufacturing. These two sectors are likely to "generate opportunities" for investors, given how technology will improve production, Goldman said.

"We are entering a period where a more symbiotic relationship between the virtual and physical worlds is developing. The promise of high returns from AI are not likely to be fulfilled without a significant ramp-up in physical infrastructure on data centres and electricity grids," strategists added.

Diversify outside the US. While the US will likely lead the world in terms of investment returns, there'll be a broader range of opportunities in other countries, the bank suggested.

Strategists pointed in particular to the All Country World Index ex. US exchange-traded fund, which is more cheaply valued relative to US assets.

"This is not an argument in favour of being underweight on the US, but rather in favour of being more open to undervalued opportunities elsewhere as a way of supplementing and diversifying from concentrated positions in the US index," the bank said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Yen, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Los Angeles who is the founder of Daily Work Journal and Surfers Jewelry. Business Insider has verified Yen's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

It's the classic story: You quit a 9-to-5 to become an entrepreneur and end up working 24/7.

I worked long hours in data analytics, but the difference now is that I'm willing to put in far more hours because it's my own company; it's part of my identity.

Now, my work includes things I love: talking to surfers, dreaming up brand trips — experiences I could never have had as a corporate analyst. It's high risk, high reward, but the flexibility and creative freedom make it worth it.

I started my career as a business technology analyst at Deloitte right out of UCLA in 2014. I chose Deloitte's San Francisco office for a change of pace from Los Angeles.

I had imagined a glamorous consulting life filled with travel, but my last project before quitting Deloitte involved commuting from San Francisco to Walnut Creek every day. It took two hours, round-trip, in traffic, and it drained me more than the job itself.

In consulting, you don't have much control over what projects you work on, and I realized I wanted more say in my career.

Being in San Francisco, tech was all around me, so I started interviewing for tech roles while still at Deloitte. I landed my first data role as a marketing analyst at Salesforce in January 2016. In interviews, I largely leaned on the Excel skills I built at Deloitte, and since it was also a core skill the team sought, it helped me transition seamlessly into my first tech role.

Salesforce was my introduction to data analytics, but I quickly realized marketing wasn't my long-term focus. I wanted to keep working with data while expanding into a broader scope, so I moved into business operations, which allowed me to touch strategy, business development analytics, sales analytics, and marketing analytics.

From there, I joined Yelp in a business operations and strategy analytics role, working across multiple functions. People analytics became the final area I wanted to explore.

The opportunity to round out my skills with people analytics came at Cruise, the self-driving car startup, which I joined in June 2019. At Cruise, my role aligned more closely with my interest in people and decision-making.

But after several years in the high-stress field of data analytics, I was exhausted. Everyone wants your time and expects you to build dashboards, often with quick turnarounds. You're responsible not only for the work but also for its absolute accuracy. I'd stay late testing dashboards and show up early to present results to executives, walking them through what the data meant and how to act on it. The stakes felt high.

At my peak stress, I had dreams about redoing Excel formulas, obsessing over whether I'd divided something twice or misplaced a decimal. It got to the point where I was constantly ruminating about tiny details that could throw off entire reports by orders of magnitude. That level of pressure wasn't sustainable for me.

While still at Cruise, I enrolled in a coaching program, the Coactive Training Institute in the Bay Area, got certified, and began taking on clients on the side.

In August 2020, during the pandemic, I decided to leave Cruise. I was burned out, single, living alone, and feeling the isolation of COVID-19. I wanted a break from corporate life and leaned into coaching full time.

At the same time, I launched my first product business in December 2020 — Daily Work Journal, a notebook brand. It was my first foray into e-commerce. I ran that company until I sold it in January 2024.

After selling Daily Work Journal, I took some time off and started surfing, purely for fun. I never planned on building a business around it, but it became the perfect synergy; that's how Surfers Jewelry began. I had confidence in my ability to run it because it's e-commerce-based, like my journal brand.

Now, my focus is entirely on my jewelry business: creating, marketing, and connecting with the surfing community. I only coach occasionally, when past clients reach out.

I always advise aspiring entrepreneurs to have a corporate career before striking out on their own. Whatever you specialize in becomes your edge as an entrepreneur.

My experience in data analytics gave me skills I now use every day and confidence in the financial side of my business. I understand the big picture, I can hold my own in negotiations, and I don't need to hire for that part of my company.

When I was younger, I never imagined this career path. Most of my peers stayed in corporate roles, and I didn't become an entrepreneur until my late 20s. But now, I can't imagine doing anything else.

Over the course of my career at companies like Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I've hired, developed, and evaluated hundreds of employees. Many of them were smart, capable, and ambitious. They wanted promotions, and they got them — but I've also turned down many requests.

If you think the group that got their requests granted was innately more talented or harder working than the group that didn't, think again. The truth is that, most of the time, the request itself wasn't the problem. The candidate wasn't even the problem. It was the timing that made the difference.

Promotions and pay raises are business decisions, not gifts. This means that even the strongest performers will hear "not now" if they ignore the situations that surround them.

Here are five of the most common timing missteps I've seen, and what I wish more rising leaders would do differently.

This is surprisingly common. Someone gets promoted in January and, by April, they're asking for another raise.

I once had a high performer who was promoted to senior manager after a solid year. Less than 90 days later, she sent me a proposal for another title change — accompanied by comp benchmarks and a list of expanded responsibilities.

She was doing more, but she hadn't been in the role long enough to demonstrate success at that level, and she lacked the self-awareness that no one should ask for more every quarter.

Keep a record of what's changed. If your role evolves quickly, talk about that during check-ins with your manager. Understand your career path and the next opportunity for growth. Then, give the business time to see your impact before you ask to level up again.

It's natural to want to impress a new boss. I've seen people use early 1:1s to talk about their career goals. This makes sense — to an extent. And it's fine to let your new manager know if you had conversations with your old manager about your path to a promotion.

However, when it turns into "What would it take for me to get promoted this year?" before the manager even understands your role (and hers!), it can create the perception that you're only thinking about yourself. It's like walking into a room you've never been in before and immediately asking to rearrange the furniture.

Start by understanding how your new manager defines success and taking an interest in her priorities and challenges. Ask smart questions, then deliver, and deliver consistently. You can talk about growth and next steps once you've built trust and credibility.

Some of the hardest "no" answers I've had to give were to employees who were deserving but seemed oblivious to what was going on around them. Even if you think you've done everything right, asking for more when the broader context is shaky can hurt your chances.

I've had employees come to me during expense freezes, department restructures, or right after we missed our numbers, sometimes with very strong cases for advancement. In those moments, the ask just wasn't feasible for the business.

Make yourself even more valuable by showing that you can lead patiently through uncertainty. Be the person who brings stability when others are scrambling. Once the business starts to recover — and you've played a visible role in that — you'll be in a much stronger position to ask for more.

This happens when someone moves too quickly after a mistake or learning opportunity. Maybe a key project didn't land, or they got feedback about how they lead meetings, and they haven't yet corrected for it. Then, a few weeks later, they're asking for a promotion.

Even if their overall track record is strong, the timing is off. Leaders want to see that you can take input, apply it, and grow from it. If you haven't closed the loop on feedback, asking for more shows a lack of accountability and self-awareness.

I once had a direct report who delivered great work but struggled with cross-functional influence and managing senior leaders. We talked about it openly, and he was aware and committed to improving. Two weeks later, he asked if he was in line for a promotion that quarter.

It was too soon. He hadn't had time to show progress yet, and asking so soon after our conversation made it seem like he didn't understand the gravity of the feedback.

Slow down, and shore up any doubts about your potential. When you hear feedback, don't just acknowledge it — change something.

Then, when you make the ask, it will be even stronger because your coachability and growth will become part of the case for advancement.

This mistake is almost as common and equally costly as the others. Every once in a while, someone has come to me unexpectedly and said, "I'm ready for the next level." If we hadn't been talking about growth, readiness, or performance over time, it could be challenging to make it happen quickly.

Big asks shouldn't come out of nowhere. They require a track record with a narrative, relationships, and often a process. Depending on other career path timelines you've observed, your own performance, and the standard cycle of mid-year and year-end performance conversations, you might start talking about your career goals once you've been in your role for 6-12 months.

Make career growth part of the regular conversation. Use 1:1s with your manager or HR to ask what overdelivering looks like. Get clarity on what's expected at the next level. That way, when you're ready to make a formal ask, your manager's already on the same page.

There's no perfect time to ask for a raise or a promotion. Yet, there are wrong times and there is a smart time. It's usually after you've shown clear results, earned credibility, and positioned yourself inside the broader business picture.

If you're preparing to make a case, put yourself in your manager's shoes, evaluate what's happening across the team or company, and ask yourself, "Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes'?"

At long last, the white whale of iOS has been harpooned: Instagram finally made an app for iPad.

Shockingly, there had never been a true iPad Instagram app — you could download the regular Instagram mobile app and use it on an iPad, but it was a uniquely crummy experience — you could use it with a phone-sized display or zoomed out, and the whole thing was clunky and sad.

Finally, there's a new iPad version, nearly 15 years after Instagram first launched. (The iPad, also launched in 2010, just barely predates Instagram.)

I tried it out on my iPad (which, honestly, I don't use all that much other than occasionally for scrolling on the couch when I leave my phone in the other room), and I have to say: This is the Cadillac of doomscrolling.

The biggest difference the iPad app has from the phone version is that it always opens onto the Reels tab. No more pretense that you might be hoping to see "photos" from your "friends" in the main feed.

Instead, you'll see Stories at the top, should you choose to interact with those plebes you know in real life who cling to the sad concept of posting photos and videos from their real life to share with their close friends.

What I like best about the experience is that the sound on the first video you see is off by default. But instead of having to tap the 🔊 icon in the corner of the frame, you simply scroll down slightly, and the sound starts playing. This saves you the highly unpleasant experience of opening an app and having sound start playing right away, and it's also more intuitive to just slightly scroll down than to hunt and tap for a sound on/off icon. Great!

What does it mean that Instagram's iPad app is so Reels-centric? A more video-first approach makes sense with Reels and iPads. Since iPads are popular for watching video content — YouTube or Netflix — why not sit back and watch some Reels?

Instagram's official blog post says: "With Instagram for iPad, we've redesigned the experience to reflect how people use bigger screens today — for lean back entertainment."

Buddy, you don't have to tell me twice to lean back and stare at a screen until I feel numb inside! Thanks, Meta!

Amazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent.

An internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated "hub" offices are hampering recruiting efforts.

The hub strategy is listed as one of the "hotly debated topics" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire "high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider.

Some Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely.

One of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.

In addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported.

The stakes are high. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind.

Oracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently.

In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said that the premise of this story was wrong, adding that the company continues to attract and retain some of the best people in the world."

"We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations," the spokesperson said. 

Many firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. It demands 5 days in-office and ties compliance to promotions and performance reviews. Those who refuse to relocate to "hubs" are considered by Amazon to have voluntarily resigned.

"We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time," the Amazon spokesperson said. 

Wall Street is already noticing. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

Amazon is about to enter the AI agent race in a big way, giving the tech giant another chance to make progress in the lucrative enterprise software market.

The Seattle-based company is testing new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.

Quick Suite empowers "every business user to make better decisions, faster, and act on them swiftly by unifying Al agents for business insights, deep research, and automation into a single experience," according to one of the documents, marked confidential.

Several companies have been given a private preview of the new technology, and Amazon recently sent out invitations for an internal beta test.

Quick Suite positions AWS to compete more aggressively in AI with agent-driven automation. Agents are the latest frontier in generative AI, designed to take action and independently use tools to complete tasks. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Salesforce — along with a host of smaller startups — are racing to be the main providers of agentic tools.

This is also another chance for Amazon to make a dent in the huge market for enterprise software and applications, known as SaaS. While the company is a pioneer in cloud computing, it's made less of a mark so far with software that runs on top of this infrastructure.

"With over 40% of business users expected to adopt Al-enhanced work environments soon, AWS is positioned to lead this shift by providing integrated solutions that help organizations — including our own — effectively deploy and scale Al agents in the workplace," Amazon's beta test invitation states.

Business Insider previously reported that Amazon was working on a unified "agentic" AI workspace, internally codenamed Q Business Suite, with "Quick" floated as a potential brand name.

"We are seeing strong growth of Amazon Q Business with customers like Remitly, Nasdaq, and Smartsheet, along with partners like Zoom and Asana, adopting it to provide employees with generative AI assistance to transform how work gets done," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 

"Similarly, we are seeing customers like BMW and GoDaddy embrace Amazon QuickSight in order to make data-driven decisions quickly," the spokesperson added. "We're building on this strong response with even more innovation to help customers realize the benefits of agentic AI in the workplace."

Quick Suite will merge some of AWS's existing products, such as its data analysis platform QuickSight and its AI chatbot Q Business, while also adding a new product called Quick Flows, according to another of the documents.

Quick Flows provides pre-built workflows that let customers automate tasks through natural language prompts, one of the documents explained.

Quick Suite will include a "deep research agent" to generate reports from company and external data, and will also enable customers to create custom agents for "specific business functions or team needs," which can then be shared across their organization, one of the documents said.

Amazon is inviting a "select group of beta testers" for Quick Suite and has already offered a "private preview" to at least 50 companies, the documents said.

It's unclear when Amazon plans to officially launch Quick Suite. The tentative launch date has already been delayed from mid-July to September, one of the documents said.

Quick Suite has received mixed feedback from beta users, according to one of the internal documents.

Customers praised its simpler setup and more intuitive design compared to Q Business, as well as its "compelling" deep research feature for both internal and external use. The ability to connect with external tools, such as Atlassian's Jira, has also been well received.

At the same time, some testers reported frustrations with networking limitations in virtual cloud environments and onerous permission requirements for linking data sources. Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, the document said.

Quick Suite's launch represents a turning point in AWS's AI application strategy. Q Business had been intended as the company's flagship offering for business users, but AWS is now making Quick Suite a priority, as BI previously reported.

A market correction. A wake-up call. A great digestion. Call it what you want: AI is going through it.

Two things appear to be happening in tandem. Businesses are starting to finally grasp what AI can — and importantly, can't — do to boost their bottom lines. And the sky-high expectations that have been partly inflated and overhyped by AI firms over the past few years are finally coming down to Earth.

In short, it's increasingly looking like both the AI doomers and boomers were both wrong. AI's trajectory is starting to look less like a time machine or space elevator and more akin computers, smartphones, televisions: The technology will get better, it will almost certainly change our lives in the fullness of time, but it will more likely do so incrementally — to the point that if AGI (artificial general intelligence) or superintelligence do in fact one day arrive, it might not seem like much of a leap at all.

There's perhaps no better example of this happening than OpenAI's latest and long-anticipated model, GPT-5, which was touted with a bang and landed with a shrug. Ahead of launch, OpenAI's Sam Altman said he'd felt "useless" compared to the model's intelligence, even drawing parallels with the Manhattan Project. When it arrived, users apparently felt less intimidated. "The degree of overhyping was too significant," one person wrote. "In the absence of massive gains, all you have is hype," wrote another.

But it may be a glimpse at our new reality, where the breakneck speed of AI progress is simply steadying, where progress cannot run on hype alone, and where we will neither experience an overnight white-collar job wipeout nor reach an AI abundance society overnight.

Welcome to AI's "meh" era. Stay calm. We've been here before. It'll all be fine. Probably.

When the internet revolution took hold in the late 1990s, companies were minting millions overnight with little more than a website and a savvy sales pitch. By the year 2000, the economic reality caught up to the hype, leaving trillions of dollars wiped out overnight. Not familiar? Go ask your parents what happened to Pets.com.

It's easy to see why talk of a bubble has once again reared its head. Even Altman recently (and in an unusually measured moment from AI's biggest hype man) said he believes the AI market might be in a bubble.

"If you go back to the 1990s when the dotcom bubble burst, there weren't the profits necessarily to back the investments up, but there were tangible productivity gains," says Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. If that sounds eerily familiar, a check on AI now could prevent history from repeating itself.

A recent study published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further stirred the pot last month, claiming that just 5% of companies it studied have managed to convert the technology into actual revenue — a revelation scary enough to cause a tech stock sell-off, even if the study had a lot of limitations.

Other evidence suggests AI is starting to have an impact on businesses that are adopting it. A study from Stanford University researchers that analyzed payroll data concluded that AI was killing off entry-level jobs for people aged 22 to 25, and was especially doing so in fields where AI was more likely to replace, rather than augment, labor. Marc Benioff claims AI agents are replacing thousands of Salesforce's support roles, while other companies are boasting about AI automating more of their work.

A study of AI's effects on the demand for foreign translators by Frey and fellow Oxford economist Pedro Llanos-Paredes, published earlier this year, concluded that the technology was having a small but provable impact on these jobs.

"We seem to be seeing reasonable revenue growth for a handful of firms that are pioneering the AI revolution, but we're not seeing it translate into broader economic growth," Frey tells me. "What I find concerning is that we're still not seeing any hint of it in the productivity statistics, and ultimately that's what matters. It doesn't really matter how well AI performs on tests or on some benchmark. What matters is translating that into real economic growth."

For the markets, a more modest uptake may be perfectly OK. Evercore ISI strategists predict AI excitement will buoy US stocks a further 20% by the end of 2026. "AI is 'bigger' than the internet," they wrote in a note published this week. "In three years, its effect has touched all parts of society and industry even as adoption only begins to inflect."

Last week's Nvidia earnings were a strong indicator of where we're at. The company, which sells the valuable chips on which AI is trained and run, has become something of a bellwether for the entire artificial intelligence boom and counts some of the biggest tech giants as key customers. (Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft spends about 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia's chips.) While it beat Wall Street expectations and its own sales records, its stock still dropped, suggesting investors weren't impressed with the figures they saw. Some analysts warn that the companies buying these services from Nvidia aren't yet seeing the returns. One UBS analyst characterized Nvidia's results in a way that may perfectly sum up the new steady-chug-along paradigm of AI: "good enough."

All to say, AI seems to have reached its iPhone 4 moment.

When Apple's iPhone 4 arrived in 2010, it was nothing short of a smash hit. Onstage in Cupertino, Steve Jobs boasted that Apple had made the thinnest phone in the world with a laundry list of new must-have features: a squared-off design, high-resolution display, a front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies, and the debut of Apple's custom silicon chip, the A4. It flew off the shelves — despite the antenna fiasco — and further cemented Apple as the king of the smartphone. One could argue that the market has been chasing the iPhone 4's "sandwich glass" design ever since.

Then things changed: With the exception of a couple of moderate leaps since, the iPhone has been on a more incremental trajectory. Evidence suggests artificial intelligence might be plotting a similar course. Frontier labs have been rolling out a steady flow of updates and mini-leaps, rather than waiting years between generations, and as a result, each new rollout has started feeling evolutionary, incremental.

"If you're not the leading expert in the field, I think the progress has been such that you probably won't even notice the improvements from now on," says Frey.

Last year, the big topic was whether AI labs were seeing diminishing returns when simply trying to throw more data and compute power at the models. That may go some way to explain how GPT-5 landed, but it's not the only factor.

Between the launch of GPT-4 in March 2023 and GPT-5 last month, OpenAI rolled out well over a dozen models, each one focusing on specific jobs or incrementally improving another. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that GPT-5 didn't blow our socks off. (In the same conversation in which Altman claimed AI is in a bubble, he also claimed that OpenAI has more advanced models than GPT-5, but can't deploy them because it doesn't have the capacity.)

Google's latest frontier model, Gemini 2.5, is also a bridge model, and the launch of GPT-5 may serve as a healthy warning to temper expectations for Gemini 3, which is expected before the year's end.

"The progress just feels more continuous," says David Krueger, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal who studies AI safety and risks.

Krueger still thinks we'll have the occasional "wow" moment, but said he also believes we'll need more breakthroughs on the technical side to reach any level of artificial intelligence that can go toe-to-toe with a human — and he says he doesn't believe we will reach AGI from large language models alone.

"I think LLMs and more broadly deep learning are probably a big piece of the puzzle. If I had to bet, the biggest one," he says. "But I think we're maybe missing a couple of puzzle pieces."

Krueger also lays blame at the feet of certain AI figureheads who have created "unreasonable levels of hype," and who are finally getting a reality check. Altman may be the worst offender, but he's not the only one.

In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI would be writing 90% of software developers' code in three to six months. The actual gains appear to be much more modest: During Alphabet's Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that more than 30% of code written at Google was being generated by AI.

"I think a lot of this sort of feeling of disappointment is due to unreasonable levels of hype from the companies," said Krueger. As the rubber hits the road and the breakneck speed of AI potentially slows, expectations for the future of AI — and the possible, maybe, one day, arrival of AGI — are finally being put in check.

You can see how we got here. In a January interview with Bloomberg, Altman predicted AGI would arrive during Trump's second presidency. Elon Musk once predicted it could be here by the year's end. According to some of the best minds in AI, AGI is often just a "few years away." In truth it feels like we're finally realizing nobody actually knows.

Perhaps nobody has had more of a humbling in AI than Apple, which earlier this year axed an iPhone 16 ad that promised several much-hyped new AI features that, as it turned out, were far from ready. When Tim Cook steps onstage next week, don't be surprised if he and other executives strike a more measured tone when talking about AI, as they pull back the curtain on the latest lineup of devices.

I hear the new phone will be a little thinner this time.

Warren Buffett's dealmaking made him a legend, but the breakup of Kraft Heinz marks one of his few missteps, the investor's close followers say.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate partnered with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to acquire Heinz for around $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, they teamed up again to merge Heinz with Kraft in a $40 billion deal.

Buffett, a fast-food aficionado, called it "my kind of transaction," adding that the combined company could "supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your Oscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favorite meal."

Buffett, who plans to retire later this year after 55 years in charge, loves to own famous brands with beloved products, as they can raise prices to counter inflation, and loyal customers help them to fend off competition.

Kraft and Heinz fit the bill. But Buffett's partnership with 3G Capital was a departure from his playbook.

Private equity firms often seek to quickly cut a company's costs and change its management to raise its value so they can sell it for a profit and use the money to fund their next acquisition.

In contrast, Berkshire is known for offering permanent, hands-off ownership to businesses it buys, and seeks to avoid bloat instead of eliminate it, as Buffett laid out in his 2015 shareholder letter.

After the Kraft Heinz merger, there were layoffs, management overhauls, massive writedowns, and asset sales. Its aggressive cost controls "significantly impaired" its ability to innovate, the Harvard Business Review wrote.

The company also settled a federal accounting probe and had a protracted decline in net revenues amid shifting consumer preferences.

David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a longtime Berkshire blogger, told Business Insider that merging Kraft and Heinz was a "rare mistake" for Buffett.

He pointed to Berkshire having to write down the value of its stake by billions of dollars twice: in 2018 and again in the second quarter of this year. Kass added that the investment has yielded a lower return than the benchmark S&P 500 index over the past decade.

On Tuesday, Kraft Heinz said it plans to split into two businesses. One will house Heinz, Philadelphia, and Kraft Mac & Cheese, and concentrate on sauces, spreads, and seasonings. The other will house Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables, and focus on North American staples.

Berkshire and Kraft Heinz didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider but Buffett told CNBC that he was "disappointed." He told the broadcaster that while the merger wasn't the best move in hindsight, he was skeptical that dividing up the company would solve its problems.

The "Oracle of Omaha" has said before that acquiring Kraft was an error. He told Berkshire's 2019 shareholder meeting that he "made a mistake" and "paid too much money" for it.

Kraft Heinz stock was down more than 70% from its 2017 peak before the split was announced. It fell another 7% on Tuesday before regaining some ground on Wednesday. The company's market value has fallen from over $110 billion at its peak to below $33 billion.

Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake. Buffett told CNBC he didn't rule out a sale, saying he would do what was best for Berkshire. 3G sold the last of its stake in 2023.

Kass said it was "puzzling" and an "apparent admission of failure" by management to split up Kraft and Heinz and undo the synergies created. He said it wasn't clear to him how this would generate value for shareholders. The company has said it anticipates $300 million of "dis-synergies" from the split, although it hopes to mitigate some.

John Longo — a finance professor, investment chief, and the author of "Buffett's Tips" — said acquiring Heinz was a "home run" for Buffett, but merging it with Kraft was a "rare misstep."

Longo said the merger generated fewer savings than expected. He also said that Kraft Heinz had faced challenges from weight-loss drugs like Ozempic that reduce people's appetites, and several years of high inflation, which has pushed some consumers to switch to cheaper, generic alternatives.

Alex Morris, the head of TSOH Investment Research and author of "Buffett and Munger Unscripted," said he agreed with the Berkshire boss that combining Heinz and Kraft "wasn't a great deal" but "splitting them up won't fix the key issues."

Morris said the company's challenges largely reflected mounting industry pressures on Kraft's legacy business, as consumer tastes have shifted toward fresher, healthier, and more natural alternatives.

Adam Mead, the author of "The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway," told Business insider that he didn't view the Kraft Heinz deal as a "major blunder."

"They've collected dividends along the way and still own great assets," Mead said. 'They're just not worth as much as originally thought."

Buffett's errors are rare, but he has admitted to them in the past.

He said his 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe, a Maine shoemaker that crumbled under pressure from cheap foreign imports, was his "most gruesome" mistake and a "financial disaster." He bought the "worthless business" using Berkshire stock that would be worth nearly $19 billion today.

Several Japan Airlines flights from Hawaii to Japan were delayed up to 18 hours after a pilot was found drinking the day before his flight.

The airline said in a statement to BI on Thursday that the pilot was scheduled to fly JL793 from Honolulu to Chubu Centrair International Airport on August 28. Japan Airlines told BI that the pilot came clean about drinking three cans of beer before the flight took off. 

The airline said in the statement that the captain had consumed three cans of beer alone in the hotel room the day before departure, and was deemed unfit to fly. A replacement pilot was found for the flight.

The flight and two subsequent flights, headed for Haneda Airport in Tokyo, were delayed by around 18 hours because of the incident, the airline said.

"It was also found that the captain had consumed alcohol at stay locations multiple times in the past," the statement said. The airline added that the pilot had altered the date and time settings of the alcohol detector to conceal results in previous instances.

Kyodo News reported that around 630 passengers were affected by the delays.

The news outlet said that Japanese transport and aviation officials visited Japan Airlines' headquarters in Tokyo on Wednesday and launched an investigation into the case.

"We sincerely apologize to our customers and all parties involved for the inconvenience and trouble caused," the airlines said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.

The statement added, "We are committed to working as a company to ensure the thorough implementation of measures to prevent recurrence."

This is at least the fourth case of a Japan Airlines pilot being caught drinking before a flight, causing delays.

In April last year, a flight from Dallas to Tokyo was canceled after the captain got drunk in a hotel bar and in his room. The Mainichi reported then that a hotel employee had called local police, reporting the pilot's disorderly conduct.

In February, two Japan Airlines pilots were suspended from flying for drinking before their December flight from Melbourne to Tokyo, per an AFP report.

It's not just pilots from Japan Airlines that have been found drinking before flights.

In March 2024, a Delta Air Lines pilot was jailed after he was found to be over the legal alcohol limit on a flight from Edinburgh to New York in June 2023, per a report by The Guardian. The pilot was caught during a bag search at Edinburgh with two bottles of Jägermeister, one of which was half empty. 

In January, a Southwest Airlines pilot who was due to fly from Savannah, Georgia, to Chicago was charged with driving under the influence. The pilot was removed from the cockpit, and the flight landed at its destination five hours after its scheduled time. 

Representatives for Japan Airlines did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Tesla released an iOS app for its robotaxi service on Apple's App Store on Wednesday.

"Robotaxi app now available to all. Download to join waitlist — expanding access soon," the company wrote in an X post. It added that an Android version would be "coming in the future."

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

When Business Insider downloaded and ran the robotaxi app, we were first taken to the robotaxi's terms of service, which said that rides are "being conducted autonomously" if a safety driver is not in the driver's seat.

The app then prompted users to tap a button to sign up for the waitlist by creating a Tesla account. It took about three hours before Business Insider's writer was taken off the waitlist and given access to the service. 

The app's design is simple. It displays two maps showing the service's availability in Austin and San Francisco. A carousel gives more details on the robotaxi's features.

When tapped, a button at the bottom of the app, labelled "Latest news on the service," takes users to Tesla robotaxi's account on X.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the robotaxi during a launch event in October. The service was first rolled out in Austin in June and then in San Francisco in July.

Musk told investors in January that he hoped Tesla would have unsupervised full self-driving vehicles in most countries by the end of next year. He added that this goal could be "limited simply by regulatory issues."

President Donald Trump is back to talking about his former backer, Elon Musk, on air.

Trump was asked about Musk during an interview on "The Scott Jennings Show" that aired on Wednesday. The interview, which took place over the phone, was recorded on Tuesday.

"He's got 80% super genius, and then 20% he's got some problems. And when he works out the 20%, he'll be great," Trump said of Musk.

"I always liked him. I like him now. But he went off the reservation and he wished he didn't do it," Trump added.

Trump told Jennings that Musk was "a man of common sense" and a "good man." He added that he was hopeful that Musk would not proceed with his plans to start a new political party and instead return to the GOP.

"I don't think he has a choice," Trump said. "What's he gonna do? He's gonna go with the radical left lunatics? They're lunatics."

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Trump and Musk initially enjoyed a close relationship after Musk threw his support behind Trump's presidential campaign in 2024.

Musk spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and other GOP candidates. He later joined the administration and was the de facto head of the White House DOGE office until his departure in May.

However, in June, Musk's relationship with Trump imploded in public view after the two posted heated messages directed at each other on X and Truth Social, respectively.

Musk criticized Trump over the president's signature tax bill, also known as the "Big Beautiful Bill," which passed earlier this year.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law "will result in a net increase in the unified budget deficit totaling $3.4 trillion over the 2025-2034 period, relative to CBO's January 2025 baseline updated to reflect enacted legislation."

Musk called Trump and the GOP's tax plan a "MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK" and even took credit for Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential elections.

"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House, and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate," Musk wrote in an X post on June 5.

"Such ingratitude," he added in a subsequent post.

Trump initially threatened to cancel the government contracts Musk's businesses had received, though he eventually struck a more conciliatory tone with Musk.

"Look, I wish him well. You understand? We had a good relationship, and I just wish him well," Trump told reporters in June.

In July, Musk said on X that he'd form a new political party, the America Party.

Business Insider reported in August that Musk had yet to begin the formal process of starting the America Party, a month after he had made the declaration on social media. Musk continued to be a major GOP donor.

Prominent MAGA figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have expressed hopes that Musk would return to the GOP. They argue that the billionaire was key to Trump's 2024 electoral victory and that having access to the world's richest man would be helpful in future elections.

Travis Kelce's proposal to Taylor Swift could have looked completely different.

"I once thought I would do it on water," Travis said on Wednesday's episode of the "New Heights" podcast, which he cohosts with his brother, Jason Kelce.

"Man, you've got to know your gal. You've got to know your gal or your significant other. You've got to know them. You can't let how somebody else does it make you feel like you need to do it that way," the Kansas City Chiefs tight end added.

Travis popped the question in a lush garden in Lee's Summit, Missouri, less than 20 miles away from his $6 million mansion.

"You can't read about it in a Cosmopolitan magazine, expect that they're going to know your person. You've got to know your person," his brother, Jason, added.

Travis noted that drawing inspiration from others is fine, but ultimately, the proposal has to fit your partner.

"I would just say know your partner, know who you're doing it for, and do it for the right reasons, and everything else will be beautiful," Travis said.

Ajay Anand, the CEO and founder of the diamond retailer Rare Carat, told Business Insider that Swift's engagement ring "appears to feature an antique old mine brilliant-cut diamond" that was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Swift and Kelce announced their engagement via Instagram last week.

Since she started dating Kelce in 2023, Swift has gone more public with her love life — even looping him into her business ventures.

She welcomed him onstage for a surprise cameo during an Eras Tour show in London and even announced details of her 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," on Kelce's football podcast.

A representative for Kelce did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Is the altcoin wave about to redefine investment strategies? In a landscape where cryptocurrencies have become a familiar term, investors are now venturing beyond Bitcoin, looking for emerging altcoins that promise substantial returns. At the same time, however, the risks of these investments remain prominent. In this article, let's examine the potential pitfalls of betting on emerging altcoins in comparison to more established units like Ethereum, effective avenues for SMEs in management, and where crypto payroll platforms fit in.

Why should you be cautious when diving into emerging altcoins? 

Emerging altcoins promise high returns, yet this comes with steep project risk and possible volatility. Unlike Ethereum, which has a stronger community and infrastructure, many investees have little to no credible backup. The absence of a well-maintained community affects their resilience and stability. Intense price swings can hit an altcoin hard, eroding the inherent project incentives provided by its founders.

Can you ignore the security threats? Yes, emerging altcoins might lack the comprehensive security measures that established systems have. Ethereum has been tweaked through laborious audits and community updates, allowing it to mitigate issues better than a new entrant. The possibility of hacks multiplies when no credible auditing process is present.

What of the regulatory landscape? Newer cryptocurrencies frequently find themselves in the crosshairs of heightened scrutiny from governments, while Ethereum navigates a clearer regulatory path. Global regulators are still shaping the decrees of the crypto landscape, making the rallying cry: “With great reward comes great risk.”

How do altcoins stack up next to Ethereum? Even as altcoins have higher upside potential, they come with massive downside risks. Ethereum's tight dominion of importance guarantees its weight in an account portfolio designed to counterbalance risk.

Why Ethereum over newer options? 

Ethereum's achievement is multifaceted, offering comparatively stable ground when investing. Possessing around 14.20% market share and garnering an influx of funds from robust investment streams and ongoing system improvements solidifies its portfolio stature.

Ethereum's use cases reach far and wide, carving out reliable market space in decentralized finance and smart contract technologies. Unlike many emerging alt-indices, Ethereum is a central node in a growing network attracting both public and private capital investments.

Why the growing reserve lock? Close to 30% of total Ether supply states its long-term investment confidence, with holders preferring to stake their funds for rewards rather than risk selling. 

Are there good strategies available to SMEs? 

Importance of spreading risk can't be underestimated. Invested funds in various altplayers, stables and traditional equity reduce dependency on a solitary stock, buffering volatility that rocks individual asset performance.

The tried-and-true strategy is applicable. SMEs can lower their volatility impact by embedding small constant costs into regular financial intervals to negate the impulse of lump-sum purchases.

A robust risk management setup is vital here. Reinstate rules while balancing between risk-taking and conservatism, and place barriers to protect against hacks or human errors.

Is examination good? Deployment of consumable AI tools and gathering on-chain data can help SMEs ascertain social sentiment, technology advancements and overall project viability.

How about hiring? What perks come from a payroll service? 

Sending money through stablecoins allows for wage payments hitting near-real-time, also permits paying in various tokens countering not only traditional routes but also traditional forex rates.

Given the surge of tech workers ages 25 to 30, incentivizing through cryptocurrencies melds cash with expertise. 

Optimizing through blockchain payment pathways gives cost efficiencies to not just licenses but low global costs.

Where are the benefits with crypto payroll? 

DAOs bring unique treasury management into the fold, practicing adaptive strategic funding with clear goals driving their funding purposes.

With varied governing frameworks led by token-holder voting and smart contracts, the goals of DAOs align with their overall mission.

Positioning varied assets, including stables smoothens cash flow for payroll while investing in other opportunities to keep bankbalances flowing.

Financial action teams specially created for collections, surrounded by smart contracts observable by all DAO members, increases opportunities to maintain treasury focus without confusion.

Riding high, Ethereum spot prices are nearing $4,450 with the launch of Avalanche's network. Emerging altcoins offer their challenges, but navigating the landscape is key. With the right strategies, one can sidestep both the peaks and pitfalls that are this ever-evolving journey in digital assets. The question now remains, are you prepared for the risks and rewards that the altcoin wave may present?

Oops, something went wrong

Software giant Figma's shares plunged Thursday after it published its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company, with its CEO claiming he wasn't trying to be Strategy boss Michael Saylor with regard to its Bitcoin holdings. 

Nasdaq data shows that Figma (FIG) was down nearly 20% Thursday afternoon, one hour ahead of the closing bell, with shares priced at $54.56. 

Shares reached a high of $122 at the beginning of August, just days after the company went public on the NYSE. 

The drop came after earnings on Wednesday showed that the software company's revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $249.6 million, slightly higher than expected. 

Adjusted operating income for 2025 is expected to be $88 million to $98 million, compared with an average projection of $88 million, the firm said. 

The company said in July that it had been holding onto a multi-million-dollar Bitcoin investment for more than a year via a Bitcoin ETF, at the time valued at close to $70 million. 

The 10 Public Companies With the Biggest Bitcoin Portfolios

But in an interview with CNBC, the software firm said that it wasn't trying to be like Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—which is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. 

"This is not a Bitcoin holding company,” CEO Dylan Field was quoted as saying. “It's a design company." 

Figma has bought Bitcoin as a diversification hedge rather than following in the footsteps of Bitcoin treasuries—companies that buy and hold the crypto to pump their stock. 

Still, the software giant said it would buy more Bitcoin back in July, and a Wednesday filing with the SEC showed that it had nearly $91 million in the crypto. 

Founded in 2012, Figma began as a browser-based interface design tool and has grown into a widely used platform for cross-functional product teams.

NEW YORK, Sept.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MAGACOIN FINANCE, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency project, today announced accelerating presale interest as demand continues to build across consecutive rounds. The development underscores the project's growing traction at a time when XRP maintains its established role in cross-border payments, highlighting a broader trend of investor rotation into emerging altcoins.

 

Presale Demand Builds Momentum

Each stage of the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has sold out quickly, reflecting strong engagement from early-stage backers. This pattern underscores confidence in the project's scarcity-driven tokenomics, designed to tighten supply as the token approaches its listing phase.

By combining a structured presale with cultural branding that resonates beyond crypto-native communities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as one of the more closely followed altcoin launches of 2025.

 

XRP as Market Backdrop

XRP continues to play a central role in blockchain-powered payments, with a longstanding community and institutional relevance. Market strategists note, however, that its large capitalization makes sharp percentage gains harder to achieve. This reality has encouraged many investors to diversify into smaller projects that can deliver stronger upside potential such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out

Independent commentators cite three drivers fueling the project's early-stage momentum:

These factors together suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the most notable presale entrants heading into the 2025 cycle.

Looking Ahead

With presale participation accelerating and community traction building, MAGACOIN FINANCE is preparing for its next phase. Market strategists highlight that its mix of scarcity mechanics, cultural positioning, and early demand provides a foundation for sustained growth after listings.

Conclusion

XRP continues to anchor conversations around blockchain payments, but the appetite for higher-upside opportunities is clear. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its accelerating presale interest and scarcity-driven model, is increasingly viewed as one of the standout altcoin launches to watch in 2025.

About MAGACOIN FINANCEMAGACOIN FINANCE is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency project designed to combine cultural relevance with scalable blockchain utility. With strong early-stage traction, a growing community, and scarcity-driven tokenomics, the project aims to position itself as one of the leading altcoin entrants of 2025.

 The FRNT stablecoin, backed by the US state of Wyoming, reportedly went live on seven blockchains at its August launch. 

The Frontier Stable Token (FRNT), a stablecoin authorized by the US state of Wyoming, will soon be available on the Hedera blockchain after its mainnet launch in August. 

In a Thursday notice, Hedera said the Wyoming Stable Token Commission — the body responsible for issuing the stablecoin — had selected the blockchain as a candidate for FRNT following a review of possible networks, and approved the proposal. 

The stablecoin reportedly went live on seven blockchains at launch: Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism and Base.

“The Commission selected Hedera for candidacy because its technical edge aligns with our commitment to security and compliance,” said Anthony Apollo, executive director of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission.

Though many expected FRNT to be available for purchase in a matter of days after the August launch, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission website said users would not have this option as of Thursday. 

Hedera said information on purchasing the coin would be available “soon.”

Though policies and regulations at the federal level affecting crypto companies appear to be softening at the federal level under US President Donald Trump, state governments still have some authority to determine how to handle digital assets. 

Wyoming, which was one of the first states to treat crypto as fiat money, has attracted several companies, lawmakers campaigning on digital assets, and conferences.

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken said in June that it would move its global headquarters to Cheyenne, citing “recognition of the pro-crypto policymakers and constructive regulations.” 

The American Innovation Project, an advocacy group that announced its launch amid a Wyoming conference, was the host for an event in which a Justice Department official suggested a radical change to enforcement cases involving crypto and blockchain.

 Bitcoin price faces pressure as investors shift to bonds and gold, and risk aversion raises the chance of BTC falling to $108,000. 

Key takeaways:

Rising demand for government bonds and gold underscores recession fears, limiting Bitcoin's ability to sustain bullish momentum.

Correlation with equities remains high, but structural catalysts like Strategy's S&P 500 inclusion could shift sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold onto its bullish momentum on Thursday as traders fled toward the safety of government bonds after weaker-than-expected United States labor market data. This move drove gold to an all-time high and raised doubts over Bitcoin's $108,000 level, with recession fears increasingly dominating investor sentiment.

Equities, however, responded positively. Market participants grew more confident that the US Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. In contrast, cryptocurrencies faced renewed pressure as BTC briefly traded under $110,000. Unlike digital assets, stocks benefit more directly from lower financing costs and reduced household debt burdens, both of which can stimulate consumption.

Yields on the 2-year US Treasury dropped to 3.60%, their lowest level in four months, signaling investors' willingness to accept lower returns in exchange for safety. The surge in demand followed ADP's Thursday report showing US private payrolls added 54,000 positions in August, a sharp decline from July's 106,000. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also reported that overall employment contracted.

Consensus around the Sept. 16-17 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting points to a 0.25% rate cut, bringing the benchmark down to 4.25%. Still, investors remain skeptical that the Federal Reserve can sustain such easing for long.

The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders expecting January 2026 rates at 3.75% or lower declined to 65% from 72% a month ago. This gauge uses Fed Funds futures prices to calculate implied probabilities ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28 meeting. Friday's US Bureau of Labor Statistics report will be crucial in guiding positioning across risk assets.

An eventual rise in inflationary pressure from lower capital costs could undermine economic growth, particularly with higher import tariffs in place. So, while lower interest rates may offer short-term relief, strong demand for gold and short-term bonds highlights persistent risk aversion, which could weigh heavily on cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq's 60-day correlation with Bitcoin sits at 72%, showing the two assets have largely moved together.

What might break this pattern remains uncertain, but some analysts highlight the potential addition of Strategy (MSTR) to the S&P 500. According to Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer at Bitpace, the inclusion “cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class.” Such a move would force index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the S&P 500 to purchase MSTR shares.

Even with elevated demand for US government bonds, fiscal imbalances could erode confidence in the domestic currency, a scenario historically favorable for Bitcoin. Bank of America analysts reportedly project the euro will strengthen against the US dollar by 2026, citing trade frictions and weakening institutional credibility.

In the short term, risk aversion may push Bitcoin to retest the $108,000 mark. However, the growing demand for short-term Treasurys alone should not be viewed as a long-term bearish signal.

Payments giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm on Thursday officially unveiled Tempo, their joint blockchain project designed for stablecoin payments.

The initiative, incubated inside Stripe, is designed to handle the kind of scale Stripe sees in real-world financial applications, processing tens of thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said in an X post.

The project launches with a list of heavyweight partners including Anthropic, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered and Visa, who will help shape its design, he added.

"We hope that Tempo makes it easier for things like payment acceptance, global payouts, remittances, microtransactions, tokenized deposits, agentic payments, and more, to move onchain," he said.

Tempo, first leaked in August in a job posting, is joining a growing roster of blockchain projects competing for stablecoin payments. It's potentially a huge market opportunity: Stablecoins, now a $270 billion class of cryptocurrencies, are projected to become a trillion-dollar market and poised to disrupt global payment flows as a cheaper, faster alternative to banking rails, proponents say.

Collison said Tempo was needed because current blockchains, even high-speed ones like Solana SOL$198.37, don't match Stripe's throughput or payment-focused requirements.

Tempo targets 100,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality, allows fees to be paid in stablecoins instead of native tokens and includes a built-in automated market maker to ensure neutrality across issuers, he said. The chain is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible and built on Reth, an Ethereum ETH$4,291.91 execution client.

Tempo is an independent entity with Paradigm and Stripe being early investors, Collison said. Paradigm CEO Matt Huang is leading a team of 15 person.

"We're building Tempo with principles of decentralization and neutrality," Huang said in an X post. That includes launching with a diverse set of validators with plans to transition to a permissionless model in the future.

James Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart argues the current market represents an altcoin season through digital asset treasury companies rather than traditional token price rallies, with upcoming ETF approvals unlikely to replicate Bitcoin's institutional success.

During a Sept. 4 interview with Milk Road, Seyffart said digital asset treasury companies (DATCO) have generated massive returns while individual altcoins remain relatively subdued compared to previous cycles.

He added:

“I think this is the alt season. This has been the alt season. These DATCOs, I mean, they've been on absolute fire.”

Further, the SEC's new framework for cryptocurrency ETFs positions approximately ten assets for immediate approval, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, Polkadot, Solana, and Hedera.

Additional tokens, like Cardano and XRP, could qualify within months once futures contracts reach the six-month requirement on CFTC-regulated exchanges.

However, Seyffart tempers expectations for altcoin ETF demand compared to Bitcoin products. He noted:

“Is it going to be the level of interest that a Bitcoin, the Bitcoin ETF launch had? I absolutely not.”

Seyffart expects basket products containing multiple cryptocurrencies to attract significantly more institutional capital than individual altcoin ETFs.

Two such products from Grayscale and Bitwise await SEC approval after receiving stay orders following initial technical approval.

Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins. Bitwise's product holds ten assets while Grayscale's contains five cryptocurrencies in market cap-weighted allocations.

The framework requires futures contracts to be traded for six months on CFTC-regulated exchanges, with Coinbase Derivatives serving as the primary qualifying platform. This outsources asset selection criteria to CFTC oversight while potentially allowing questionable projects into ETF wrappers.

Seyffart questioned whether traditional altcoin seasons will materialize as institutional money drives cryptocurrency performance. He observed:

“I just don't see a ton of institutional money coming into the 31st ranked crypto.”

Digital asset treasury companies have absorbed capital that historically flowed into altcoins during bull markets. Strategy's financial engineering allows investors to gain leveraged cryptocurrency exposure through traditional equity markets rather than direct token purchases.

Seyffart views current market conditions as increasingly institutionalized, with sophisticated players entering crypto markets.

This structural shift may permanently alter altcoin rally patterns as traditional finance channels provide easier access to crypto exposure through regulated products rather than direct token ownership.

Ethereum ETFs demonstrate this dynamic, generating substantial inflows after an initial sluggish performance, but failing to drive widespread momentum in altcoins.

The pattern suggests that institutional preferences favor established assets over speculative alternatives, regardless of the merits of the underlying blockchain technology.

Oops, something went wrong

An Ethereum wallet linked to Tron founder Justin Sun has been blacklisted after moving more than $9 million worth of World Liberty Financial tokens, or WLFI, according to blockchain data.

At the time of writing, WLFI, the native token of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial DeFi project, is changing hands for $0.1789, or 19% lower than it was this time yesterday. The token only just started trading on exchanges earlier this week. Exchange volumes indicate the token has been especially popular with traders in South Korea, on exchanges Upbit and Bybit.

It's unclear why World Liberty Financial would have blacklisted the wallet, identified as belonging to Sun by blockchain analytics platforms Arkham and Nansen, for transferring tokens. But it is possible that early investors, like Sun or the Tron DAO, would have received token warrants that prohibit them from selling for a set amount of time.

Neither World Liberty nor Justin Sun immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt.

Nick Vaiman, co-founder and CEO of Bubblemaps, told Decrypt he's not convinced Sun moved the tokens with the intention of selling.

“To be honest, I don't think this dump has anything to do with Justin Sun. He barely moved funds to centralized exchanges, and this morning's transfers were just from one of his addresses to another,” he said. “His latest statement saying he has nothing to do with the dump looks legitimate.”

 

The Sun statement the Bubblemaps team was referring to appeared on X in Mandarin. In it, Sun said the wallet “only generally did a few exchange deposit tests, the amounts were very low, then did a distribution to one address.” He added that the tests “did not involve any buying or selling,” and that it would have been impossible for the token movements to have impacted the market.

Another Bubblemaps analyst, the pseudonymous Deebs, added that sending tokens to an exchange doesn't prove that they were sold.

“The $9 million transfer that Arkham and others have cited was simply a transfer to another wallet under his control. He did not send those funds to an exchange (yet),” he said. But he cautioned that it's possible that World Liberty has access to non-public information that explains the blacklisting.

Some analysts have been incredibly skeptical about the World Liberty project. Last week, analysts at Compass Point flagged WLFI as “another catalyst that could potentially decimate retail traders.”

Trump-Backed World Liberty Token Could Decimate Retail Investors, Compass Point Warns

And users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have overwhelmingly agreed with them. Before the market closed yesterday afternoon, odds had tipped entirely in favor of WLFI seeing a red candle within its first 69 hours of trading.

Early investors of the WLFI token, including Sun, managed to buy in at just $0.015 per token, or a $1.5 billion valuation, and are still very much in the green by more than 10X. But those retail traders who bought WLFI as soon as it became tradeable at a price above $0.33? They're now down 45%.

The Trump family has a bitcoin mining company that started trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday.

Why it matters: Running mining rigs is one of the most policy-sensitive corners of the crypto industry, with its number one cost input being the price of power.

Catch up quick: American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began publicly trading on Wednesday following a merger with a small-cap bitcoin miner, which allowed it to skip a traditional IPO process.

How it works: According to an investor presentation, American Bitcoin has a three-pronged strategy to provide leadership in the U.S. bitcoin industry:

Zoom in: Later in the presentation the company talks about building platforms and monetizing its surface area in the industry.

The big picture: The Trumps are entering the industry as competition has gotten fierce.

Between the lines: The cost of energy is crucial to a mining operation.

What we're watching: Nukes. We'll be curious to see if American Bitcoin comes out ahead of other miners in cutting deals with new nuclear plants, if they start getting permits.

💭 Our thought bubble: This could be yet another play to profit off of the presidency, but bitcoin mining takes a lot more elbow grease than running a meme coin or a second-tier stablecoin.

As the price of ETH holds steady above $1,800, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem has rebounded to $90 billion. Established protocols like Aave, Curve, and MakerDAO are seeing renewed user activity, and many on-chain high-frequency traders have started positioning themselves for the next phase of high returns.

However, for many ordinary users, these complex protocols are difficult to navigate, and the volatile price swings often result in unexpected losses.

Therefore, more and more investors are turning to contract-based platforms like ProfitableMining that offer stable output and transparent returns to achieve truly “passive crypto earnings.”

Rather than “chasing hype,” it's better to “lock in certainty.”

This is exactly why an increasing number of people are choosing ProfitableMining. As a contract-based cloud mining platform, it requires no manual trading, no learning complex strategies, and no sleepless nights watching the market. You simply choose a suitable mining contract, invest, and receive stable returns over the contract period — mining coins daily, unaffected by market volatility.

For example:

Investing $1,300 in the Avalon Miner A1466 contract can yield a net profit of $239.19 during the cycle;

The beginner experience contract requires only $100 and yields $9 profit by the end of the cycle, allowing risk-free trial;

New users receive an instant $17 bonus upon registration and can earn an additional $0.90 daily for logging in.

Why are more ordinary users choosing ProfitableMining instead of diving into high-risk crypto trading?

The reason is simple — it's not a “gambling platform,” but a transparent, compliant, and consistently profitable contract mining platform with a low barrier to entry. It allows users to truly “earn coins through technology, not luck.”

Official Certification & Compliance: ProfitableMining is licensed by the UK financial regulatory authority, operating transparently and legally, eliminating risks of scams or fraud;

Beginner Experience Contract: Invest $100, total return $107;

Avalon Miner A1466: Invest $1,300, total return $1,536.59;

Bitcoin Miner S21: Invest $4,900, estimated total return $7,472.50;

Move will boost transparency as film investors who are not familiar with the industry often incur big losses, says lawmaker


Lam Ka-sing

Updated: 1:20am, 5 Sep 2025


Hong Kong's legal sector is taking an unprecedented leap into the world of Web3 and digital assets to revolutionise the city's film and television industry in a bid to better track investments, with some massive losses incurred as a result of a lack of transparency.

The bold new strategy, unveiled at a seminar on Thursday, enables the use of blockchain and smart contracts to fundamentally transform the industry and offer a new channel for financing creative content, according to lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, director of the eBRAM International Online Arbitration and Mediation Centre, a not-for-profit company.

“This legal technology is actually helping the industry upgrade,” Ng said. “With [legal technology] processes, the entire industry will become transparent and systematic, and investors will naturally choose projects and guide funds back into our industry.”

Ng noted that many film investors who were not familiar with the industry, including himself, often suffered losses of more than 90 per cent of their investments because of a lack of transparency over how the money was used.

Thomas So Shiu-tsung, chairman of eBRAM, said that “another critical step” had been taken. The centre formally signed a memorandum of understanding with broadcaster RTHK, the Asia Pacific Creativity Industries Association and the Association of Motion Picture Post Production Professionals.

“This partnership not only consolidates Hong Kong's position as a film and television deal-making centre, but also encourages the industry to choose Hong Kong's dispute resolution services,” So said.

“It can … help mitigate the potential legal risks associated with cross-border cooperation and transactions in a more convenient and cost-effective manner.”

Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, the acting secretary for justice, said new development opportunities for the film and television industry had arisen after revisions to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (Cepa), a free-trade deal between Hong Kong and mainland China.

Cheung said the changes included scrapping limits on the number of key personnel involved in film production and online television dramas, while companies were allowed to be established to distribute Hong Kong films on the mainland after obtaining approval from the relevant departments.

Hong Kong-produced dramas could also be broadcast during prime time on mainland stations, among other things, he added.

Alan Chiu, founder and managing partner of law firm ELLALAN, noted that many players in the film industry might not have good templates for contracts.

He said it would provide convenience to the film industry if certain essential and simple templates for movie-related contracts could be provided through eBram, accessed easily and signed electronically over mobile phones through its platform.

“For example, when filming a movie, there are thousands of collaborations, even tens of thousands of collaborations,” Chiu said.

Such templates would not affect the business of lawyers as A-list artists always required tailor-made advice and contracts with specific clauses from lawyers, Chiu added.

Rex Ma Wai-yip, honorary president of the Asia Pacific Creativity Industries Association, said there was a lack of “risk-management awareness” within the sector.

“That is, the realisation that if we don't do these things, when the technology world moves fast, with Web3.0, I may not adapt to the world's change,” Ma said.

Ma expressed concern that creative people were not using contracts to protect their post-production work or individual intellectual property rights, leading to a lack of evidence that could prove the work was theirs.

A virtualized Bitcoin advocate generated by AI, carrying forward early blockchain ideas and making technical concepts accessible.

- Telegram's 2025 TON blockchain integration revolutionized NFT accessibility via 800M+ users, enabling in-app trading without external wallets.

- Collectible Gifts generated $36M in sales with 184K+ wallets, transforming NFTs into engagement tools like usernames and phone numbers.

- Stars economy and Snoop Dogg's $12M NFT drop demonstrated mass adoption potential, bridging Web3 and traditional entertainment markets.

- Mini Apps ecosystem democratized NFT creation while TON's DeFi growth (3.5M+ NFT volume) signaled competitive positioning against Ethereum/Solana.

- Regulatory risks and platform dependency challenges remain as TON's user-centric model reshapes decentralized marketplace dynamics.

In 2025, the decentralized NFT marketplace landscape has undergone a seismic shift, driven by Telegram's integration of NFT trading via the Telegram Open Network (TON). By leveraging its 800 million+ user base and the TON blockchain's scalability, Telegram has redefined accessibility, utility, and adoption for digital collectibles. This analysis explores how Telegram's ecosystem is reshaping the NFT space, the implications for investors, and the risks that accompany this rapid growth.  

Telegram's 2025 NFT integration marks a pivotal moment in blockchain history. The TON blockchain, originally developed alongside Telegram, now enables users to create, trade, and interact with NFTs directly within the app, eliminating the need for external wallets or complex onboarding processes [2]. This seamless experience is underpinned by TON's high throughput and low transaction fees, which make it a compelling alternative to Ethereum and Solana [3].  

The platform's utility-driven approach has already shown promise. For instance, Telegram's Collectible Gifts feature—allowing users to trade animated stickers and profile decorations as NFTs—generated $36 million in sales, with over 184,000 wallets created in 2025 alone [4]. This demonstrates how Telegram is transforming NFTs from speculative assets into tools for real-world engagement, such as NFT-based usernames and anonymous phone numbers [3].  

Telegram's Stars economy further amplifies its appeal. Users earn, trade, and spend Stars (Telegram's in-app currency) for NFTs and digital goods, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem [4]. High-profile collaborations, like Snoop Dogg's Telegram Gifts collection, highlight the platform's mainstream potential. The rapper's NFT drop sold nearly 1 million units in under an hour, generating $12 million in revenue [3]. Such events underscore Telegram's ability to attract both creators and consumers, bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional entertainment.  

Telegram's democratization efforts extend beyond NFT trading. The Mini Apps ecosystem allows developers to deploy NFTs and decentralized applications (dApps) directly within the platform, reducing technical barriers for creators [2]. The TON Foundation has emphasized equitable access to this ecosystem, advocating for fair exposure for all projects to foster innovation [6]. This approach aligns with broader goals of global adoption, as Telegram's user base spans regions with limited access to traditional Web3 infrastructure.  

The TON blockchain's performance in 2025 validates its potential. DeFi activity on TON nearly doubled in July 2025, while NFT trading volumes peaked at $3.5 million [4]. These figures suggest a maturing market, supported by TON's technical advantages and Telegram's user-centric design. For investors, the platform's focus on utility and accessibility positions it as a long-term contender in the NFT space, particularly as it competes with Ethereum and Solana for market share.  

Despite its momentum, Telegram's NFT ecosystem faces risks. Regulatory scrutiny looms, particularly as governments grapple with the implications of decentralized finance and digital asset trading. Additionally, the platform's reliance on Telegram's ecosystem—where users must adopt Telegram's tools and currencies—could limit cross-platform interoperability [4]. Investors must weigh these factors against the platform's growth potential.  

Telegram's integration of NFT trading via TON represents a paradigm shift in digital asset accessibility. By combining a user-friendly interface, gamified economics, and a focus on utility, the platform is democratizing NFT participation on an unprecedented scale. While challenges remain, the trajectory of TON's growth and the success of high-profile projects like Snoop Dogg's NFTs suggest that Telegram is not just a passing trend but a foundational force in the evolution of decentralized marketplaces.

Bitcoin's (BTC) feeble bounce this week ran out of gas on Thursday, with prices slipping back below $110,000 and some market watchers warning of a deeper pullback.

The largest cryptocurrency fell 2.2% over 24 hours to $109,500, erasing half the gains it made from the weekend's low of $107,000 as it topped $112,600 on Wednesday. Ether (ETH), Solana's SOL (SOL) and Cardano's ADA (ADA) all fell more than 3% over the past 24 hours.

Digital asset treasury stocks also bled. The largest corporate BTC owner Strategy (MSTR) dropped 3.2% and is 30% down since July. Japan-based MetaPlanet (3355) lost 7% and trades 60% lower than its June high, while KindlyMD (NAKA) slid another 9% and is now down 75% since mid-August. Ether-focused vehicles BitMine (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET) dropped 8%-9%.

Worries about further downside are growing louder, with some observers pointing to September historically being one of bitcoin's and and the broader crypto market's weakest months. 

At the same time, gold, the old-school safe haven and inflation hedge, broke out to fresh records above $3,500 following a multimonth consolidation, seemingly sucking capital from riskier plays.

A new report from Bitfinex noted that BTC has entered its third straight week of retracement from the August all-time high of $123,640. Historically, bull-market corrections averaged around 17% peak-to-trough, suggesting the market is nearing the typical limit of its drawdowns, the report said.

However, there's a risk of a deeper pullback, the analysts warned. The short-term holder realized price, a gauge of newer investors' cost basis of buying BTC, currently sits near $108,900, less than 1% below BTC's current price. If that level fails as support, it could open the way to a deeper retracement, with a dense supply cluster between $93,000 and $95,000 likely providing a durable floor, the report said.

Joel Kruger, market strategist of LMAX Group, remains more optimistic.

September has usually been a month of consolidation ahead of stronger fourth-quarter performance, he said, adding that this year's correction might be shallower if ETF inflows, corporate treasury allocations and regulatory tailwinds materialize.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Two of Silicon Valley's top tech firms are teaming up to change the payments landscape. On Thursday, the $91.5 billion fintech Stripe and the crypto venture firm Paradigm publicly announced their joint project Tempo, a so-called Layer-1 blockchain built around stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. 

Layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are more demanding to build and operate than “Layer 2s,” which sit atop other blockchains. Tempo is among a new crop of layer-1 projects dedicated to stablecoins, along with Circle's Arc and Tether's Plasma and Stable. 





The long-rumored blockchain comes amid a crypto boom. The Trump administration's embrace of the sector and Congress's passage of a stablecoin-focused bill in July have spurred many larger companies previously skeptical of blockchain technology, from banks to Big Tech companies, to begin exploring the space. But Stripe has been a pioneer, especially in Silicon Valley, including making landmark acquisitions of two stablecoin and crypto wallet companies. 





By helping build a blockchain alongside Paradigm—whose managing partner and Stripe board member Matt Huang will lead the project—Stripe is doubling down on its crypto bet as the future of global payments. 





Blockchains, or distributed ledgers that record transactions, have served as the foundation for crypto technology since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. The list of available options has proliferated, from mainstay layer-1 offerings like Ethereum and Solana to new generations built on top of old ones. Many have received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding but faded amid a lack of usage. 




While some like Ethereum are focused on building decentralized financial applications, a new slate of payment-focused blockchains has emerged over the past year in conjunction with the rise of stablecoins. These promise to process lightning-fast transactions with minimal fees, often built around native tokens, such as Circle's stablecoin USDC or the market leader Tether, which are often traded on Ethereum but deployed on many other blockchains as well.





Stripe and Paradigm will launch their own blockchain amid this heightened competition. Still, Tempo will have the advantage of Stripe's built-in customer base, with the startup serving as one of the world's largest payment infrastructure companies and catering to clients who, for the most part, don't operate in the crypto realm. Stablecoin proponents have long touted the technology as faster and more efficient than legacy money transfer services like SWIFT and wire transfers, which can be slow and costly. At the same time, adoption has been slowed by companies' hesitance toward crypto and the uncertain regulatory landscape. 





While other blockchains typically gain value through their native cryptocurrencies, Tempo will not launch with its own token, according to a source familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business information. Instead, it will accept different forms of stablecoins as “gas” fees, which are small payments made to a distributed network of entities that run a blockchain.





The source said that there isn't a timeline yet for Tempo's launch, though the project already has around 15 employees, including Huang, who will continue to serve as managing partner at Paradigm alongside Alana Palmedo. 





In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Paradigm wrote that Tempo will be focused on global payments, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments, or payments conducted by AI agents—an area that crypto advocates argue that blockchain technology will be essential. The post adds that, even with Stripe incubating the project, the goal is for Tempo to maintain “neutrality,” though it remains unclear whether other payment operators will utilize the blockchain. Paradigm said that different partners will be involved in the development of Tempo, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Deutsche Bank, and Shopify.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The total amount of bitcoin held by public companies surpassed 1 million BTC on Thursday, according to BitcoinTreasuries data.

Over the past year, the number of companies seeking to capitalize on bitcoin's steady price growth has been increasing rapidly. Michael Saylor's Strategy is considered the pioneer of the trend, with many other companies also deciding to hold the cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin miners like Mara Holdings and firms such as Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and GameStop all holding BTC on their balance sheets.

"Despite today's milestone, a number of indicators suggest institutional Bitcoin adoption remains in its infancy," said BitcoinTreasuries President Pete Rizzo. "For context, most major Bitcoin treasury firms have only started to deploy strategies aimed at long-term accumulation, meaning a large portion of raised capital remains yet to be deployed."

Strategy's success, both in terms of its share price growth and the accrued value of the bitcoin it holds, has inspired several other firms to pursue similar strategies. 



This chart excludes Tesla, Coinbase, and Block to focus on companies running the Bitcoin treasury play.

Bitwise executive Bradley Duke took to social media to comment on the 1-million bitcoin milestone. "That's about $111 billion locked up by institutions," he said. "The structural imbalance between BTC supply and demand is real and getting more pronounced."

According to BitcoinTreasuries, more than 100 public companies currently hold bitcoin. And the number of companies adopting Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies or simply deciding to hold the cryptocurrency doesn't appear to be slowing down.

In one of the more recent examples, on Tuesday, Nasdaq-listed sales development firm CIMG said it had completed a $55 million raise for purchasing bitcoin.

"As Bitcoin continues to outperform fiat currencies globally, we expect the number of public firms buying and holding Bitcoin to rise, with the asset becoming a larger percentage of the balance sheets of the over 50,000 publicly traded companies globally," Rizzo said.

With a market cap of over $2 trillion, the price of bitcoin was trading at $110,142.10 as of 10:53 a.m. ET on Thursday, according to The Block's price page. Bitcoin is up over 90% in the past year.

Three years ago, Finance & Development devoted a full issue to anticipating “The Money Revolution,” driven by innovations in finance, such as crypto assets. That revolution is now unfolding.

This issue of F&D looks at the new frontiers of finance, where technology, data, and changing societal values are reshaping how people and institutions move money and trade financial assets, who provides liquidity, and where new risks are brewing. We bring together academics and policymakers to assess this complex and politically charged landscape, one that generates excitement and anxiety in equal measure.

Stablecoins are one of these frontiers, a form of digital asset backed by currencies or government bonds. Stablecoin companies have racked up millions of users globally, transacting across borders 24/7 at very low cost. New legislation in the US and other countries may further boost their growth. Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become a financial lifeline for people in some economies with high inflation. 

Hélène Rey, a professor at the London Business School, assesses the macroeconomic and geopolitical implications of widespread adoption of US dollar–denominated stablecoins around the world. On the positive side: faster and cheaper cross-border payments. On the negative: risk of dollarization (where the dollar is used in parallel with the local currency), capital flows and exchange rate volatility, potential weakening of the banking system, money laundering and other financial crimes. While it's hard to forecast how the use of this technology will play out, it's “likely to create major financial stability risks,” she writes.

Yao Zeng of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School identifies one potential source of risk: “The global financial landscape has changed, yet the rules remain largely unchanged.” He puts stablecoins in the context of broader changes in financial markets. For example, lightly regulated nonbanks are providing more liquidity. And lenders are increasingly relying on AI and big data to speed loan approvals, reduce collateral requirements, and reach borrowers traditional banks often overlook. One thing is clear, he writes. “Stablecoins may function well in good times, but they can falter under stress.” 

Stablecoins are only one facet of the revolution. The public and the private sector alike are driving innovation. Some governments and central banks have responded to private payment initiatives by sponsoring systems that respond to consumer demand for fast, efficient payments. IMF researchers examine the case of India's Unified Payments Interface, which interconnects hundreds of banks, platforms, and apps and carries out more than 19 billion transactions a month.

At the same time, central banks and supervisors must contend with disruptive innovation. New entrants like fintechs and big techs, and new products like crypto and stablecoins, are challenging incumbent financial institutions. Iñaki Aldasoro, Jon Frost, and Vatsala Shreeti, from the Bank for International Settlements, explore how competition among the new entrants and incumbents might unfold. They conclude that forward-looking public policies must accompany radical innovation to achieve the most impactful breakthroughs.

Preventing crime is another area in which public authorities need to stay alert. Criminals, unfortunately, were among the earliest adopters of crypto, and all payment systems need to balance privacy and speed with the need to stop tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Stanford's Darrell Duffie and coauthors lay out a practical approach to getting ahead of the curve.

We must keep an open mind about stablecoins and financial innovation. Clearly, there is a lot of room for improvement in payment systems and financial markets in general. Users demand it. The key is to balance the risks and benefits through clear regulation that protects consumers and investors and limits spillovers. Who knows what new possibilities such innovations will unlock along the way?

**********

There are other thought-provoking pieces in our pages. Oxford's Carl Benedikt Frey discusses how a shift toward more centralization and less competition could snuff out AI's productivity-raising potential. Princeton's Swati Bhatt discusses the shifting geography of US start-ups, showing how entrepreneurial activity is migrating from California to southern states. Stanford's Nick Bloom, and the IMF's Hites Ahir and Davide Furceri, discuss economic uncertainty, how to measure it, and what it means for the global economy. Economic historian Marc-William Palen looks back to the 19th century, when free trade first faltered, in search of lessons for policymakers today.

We also profile Nobel laureate Guido Imbens, whose work is reshaping how researchers establish cause and effect in the real world. And Harvard's Stefanie Stantcheva explains in our Café Economics interview series how policymakers can raise taxes without scaring off innovators.

We are grateful to be able to share these insights with you. We hope that they reveal something new about the present that helps you better understand our world. Thank you, as ever, for reading and engaging.

The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in
years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins ("GENIUS") Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. The
GENIUS Act is part of a broader push to accelerate the development
of emerging technologies in the U.S., from artificial intelligence
to quantum computing. That same push is showing up in the patent
world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
("USPTO") and Patent Trial and Appeal Board
("PTAB") are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related
inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles.

Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a
recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain
patents. In Ex Parte David L. Newman, the PTAB reversed
the Examiner's rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. §
101 and provided some useful discussion of how the USPTO (and
patent applicants) should approach blockchain-related patents. The
claims at issue relate to "securely storing data across a
network in a multi-dimensional distributed database" in order
to "process[] license contracts, including computing
proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising
supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian
addresses."

The Examiner had rejected the claims as directed to the abstract
idea of "payment, distribution, and pricing for two users
bound by a contractual relationship," concluding that the
additional elements in the claims do not integrate the abstract
idea into a practical application. In the Examiner's view, the
invention simply used "a computer as a tool to perform an
abstract idea." The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging
that the claims involved an abstract idea because "[i]t is
well settled that commercial interactions involving payment
transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially
excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human
activity."

However, the Board drew the line at step 2 of the Alice
analysis. Unlike the Examiner, the Board determined that the claims
integrate the abstract idea into a practical application "by
improving the technical functioning of the recited blockchain by
transforming it into a multi-dimensional database slidechain that
allows for the execution and simultaneous processing of
supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain." In other
words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a
generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself
operates. As the Board explained, the claims "recite[] steps
that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved
processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork
blocks along the slidechain... [and] uses the recited abstract idea
in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a
particular technological environment."

Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major
hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in
blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent
PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in
blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions

Buried in the limited support of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, especially in developed markets, is a somewhat blinkered take on the concept: Not all CBDCs have the same objective.

A central bank digital currency can take many forms, but most involve the issuance by a country's central bank of currency tokens on a blockchain or other type of distributed ledger. Retail-facing CBDCs aim to gradually replace cash, retaining the same central bank guarantee as bills and coins, while offering the convenience of digital money.

A few examples have already launched, such as the Nigerian eNaira and the Bahamas sand dollar. Others are in advanced pilot phases, such as the Chinese e-CNY and the Indian digital rupee.

All of these examples are struggling to gain traction, and anti-CBDC activism worldwide is strong, triggered by fears of centralized control and a loss of financial privacy. In Europe, which will decide in October whether to launch development of a retail-facing CBDC, there is notable opposition, including among some legislators. And in the U.S., the House of Representatives passed an anti-CBDC bill which would bar the federal government from ever issuing a digital currency; a similar proposal is working its way through the Senate.

The fear overlooks an entire segment of the economy in which the central bank already controls movements of funds, and in which privacy is not an expected feature: interbank transfers, known as "wholesale" payments.

These easily account for the bulk of global transfers in terms of volume. And yet they still encounter significant frictions when they involve correspondent banking networks, currency exchange and different operating hours. Given the amount of money involved, the frictions add up.

In this light, a wholesale CBDC makes sense.

Like a retail CBDC, a wholesale CBDC, or wCBDC, would be issued by a central bank as a currency token on a blockchain. Unlike a retail CBDC, it would only be made available to commercial banks and other institutions with central bank accounts.

One of the key advantages is more streamlined settlement, as wCBDCs could, in theory, move directly between banks via a shared ledger — no correspondent accounts necessary. What's more, depending on the platform design, an on-chain transfer could compress messages (sent by banks via SWIFT) and payments, further reducing the number of necessary steps and the overall cost.

Another is the potential for smart contracts to handle complex and costly processes such as currency conversion and escrow.

And there's the direct connectivity with on-chain marketplaces for tokenized securities, digital trade invoices and more. Today, clearing and settlement involve reconciling various layers of information across different data systems. In an on-chain network, everything moves on the same layer, and while systems may differ, connectivity generally involves tweaking formats or adding a bridge rather than reengineering structures.

The opportunity is compelling, especially given the emergence of new trade barriers and geopolitical fragmentation — smoother cross-border payments could lead to smoother and more flexible supply chains.

The department is aiming to boost transparency and win Trump's trust after poor economic numbers last month led to a bureaucrat's firing.

Yet here, too, there are deep misunderstandings about blockchain potential.

Frictionless transfers between global banks can only happen on a shared ledger. Arriving at that happy state would require consensus among nations as to the ideal technology (there are many different types of distributed systems) as well as the platform's design, smart contract parameters, compliance requirements, legal status and governance. Getting nations to agree on anything so systemically significant would be a tall order, especially as it would mean giving up some sovereignty over how national currencies move.

Of course, each country could have its own blockchain system on which to issue a wCBDC, and they could connect with each other via a neutral shared platform. But this not only introduces some friction, it also raises a similar set of questions. Who would design it? Who would run it? In recent months, the BIS, IMF and some private entities have published proposals for a "unified ledger" on which all on-chain currencies can move. Would any of those invite universal trust? The BIS, as the "central bank's central bank," could perhaps be a contender — but it recently withdrew from the multi-CBDC pilot mBridge after contemplating shutting it down to prevent Russia using a similar system to avoid sanctions. In this increasingly fractious world, "neutral" quickly becomes elusive.

What about bilateral or group networks? For instance, a distributed ledger platform shared between China and Saudi Arabia for oil trade settlement, or one to boost financial flows among Latin American countries. This could solve some frictions but would introduce others: Would platform members want to hold each other's volatile currencies, or would they sell them in the market, depressing their value? There is a reason most global trade uses the dollar for at least one leg: It removes liquidity risk.

Perhaps smart contracts could ensure a measured currency conversion or lockup? But then the wCBDC would not be fungible with fiat, creating domestic monetary as well as legal complications. There's also the potential for national CBDCs to have embedded functionality, such as an "off switch" — trust, even among trading partners, is a scarce commodity.

And there's the need to trust the platform itself, which could run into network stability issues, especially in the early days or after upgrades. This happens in traditional systems today — but with greater connectivity, the disruption could spread.

In sum, public rejection of CBDCs due to fear of privacy erosion and greater government control overlooks the potential for a significant efficiency boost in a key economic segment that does not expect privacy or freedom from oversight — the technology is not necessarily the problem, it's the way it's applied.

And conviction that wholesale CBDCs will smooth away interbank transfer frictions overlooks the complexity of connecting a constellation of distributed ledgers, each with their own design, priorities and rules — the technology is not necessarily the solution, it's the way it's applied.

Zooming out, new technologies always run up against exaggerated expectations of both benefit and harm — in that regard, blockchains and distributed ledgers are no different.

Introduction 

The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. What started as a way to prove ownership of digital art has grown into a foundation for real-world applications across industries. From collectibles to real estate, NFT smart contract development is now pushing boundaries and opening doors to a tokenized economy.

Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent.

The Birth of NFT Smart Contracts

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. The real magic happens through smart contract development, which encodes the rules of ownership and transfer.

Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today.

NFTs in Digital Art

Digital artists were the first to feel the power of NFT smart contracts. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. Every sale, every royalty, and every ownership transfer was automated through blockchain smart contract development.

The brilliance was not just in ownership—it was in ensuring authenticity. No one could copy and claim the artwork as theirs because the blockchain recorded every detail of ownership. For artists, this meant empowerment; for buyers, it meant trust. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention.

NFT Smart Contracts Beyond Art and Gaming

While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Industries are finding creative uses for NFTs:

Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds.

Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs.

Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey.

Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access.

This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. As a result, companies see NFTs not just as collectibles, but as defi smart contract development tools for finance, business agreements, and beyond.

Technological Advancements in NFT Smart Contracts 

The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. For example:

Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells.

Fractionalization: High-value assets are split into smaller, affordable shares.

Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development.

Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools.

This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. It's not just about ownership anymore—it's about trust, automation, and innovation.

Future of NFT Smart Contracts 

The future of NFTs looks beyond art and gaming. Imagine a world where:

These are not distant dreams. With blockchain smart contract development, industries are preparing for decentralized systems where human trust is replaced with coded transparency. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution.

The Role of NFT Marketplace Development Companies

Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. These companies design and audit NFT smart contracts, ensuring smooth transactions and secure ownership transfers.

For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. From defi to niche NFT solutions, these firms bring vision to reality.

In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development.

Conclusion 

NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Their future will shape how we own, trade, and trust both digital and physical assets.

Company says it's already in discussions to commercialize the licensed tech

TNF Pharmaceuticals has entered into a licensing agreement with laser-based computing startup LightSolver for exclusive use of the latter's laser-based processing units (LPUs) for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications.

TNF also plans to change its name in accordance with its new venture, the company said.

Founded in 2020 by Ruti Ben Shlomi and Chene Tradonsky, Israel-based LightSolver has developed the world's first pure laser-based processing unit (LPU) that LightSolver says is poised to outpace and outperform quantum and supercomputers.

Its LPU100 system utilizes all-optical coupled lasers that require no electronics to compute and combines the company's all-optical LPU hardware with an algorithmic processing layer to provide ultra-fast results for problems with up to one million variables.

The system is around the same size as a traditional desktop computer; it looks similar to a standard server and operates with low power requirements and at room temperature.

TNF said that when applied to cryptocurrency applications, LightSolver's technology can be designed to reduce energy costs by up to 90 percent and offer a potential pathway to fully sustainable infrastructure.

“We believe LightSolver has created a disruptive computing paradigm that opens a new world of light-speed computation,” said Joshua Silverman, TNF's executive chairman. “Our new partnership with LightSolver gives us exclusive access to quantum-inspired LPU-based systems capable of unlocking unprecedented performance and sustainability for the cryptocurrency industry.”

He added that in addition to the new partnership with LightSolver, TNF is also in late-stage discussions with a tech infrastructure and crypto mining expert to lead the development and commercialization strategy for the licensed technology.

“With LightSolver, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the strong momentum behind both photonic computing and the future of cryptocurrency infrastructure,” Silverman said.

LightSolver CEO, Dr. Ruti Ben-Shlomi, said: “With LightSolver's LPUs, we believe compute-intensive combinatorial and physical problems can be solved at the speed of light—orders of magnitude faster than other methods. At the same time, crypto infrastructure is still using outdated tools that aren't tailored for crypto applications. We are excited to partner with TNF to develop what we believe to be the first light-based computing system to blockchain.”

In addition to the partnership announcement, TNF said that it has also entered into a securities purchase agreement for a $7 million private placement financing, including the sale of 7,000 shares of newly created Series H convertible preferred stock. This has a stated value of $1,000 per share, convertible into shares of its common stock following receipt of the requisite stockholder approval and accompanying common stock purchase warrants.

TNF said the securities purchase agreement is expected to close on or about September 4, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Indefinite causal order, a potentially revolutionary resource for future information processing technologies, receives a significant boost from new research exploring its behaviour within light-matter systems. Lorenzo M. Procopio, L. O. Castaños-Cervantes, and Tim J. Bartley, from Paderborn University, demonstrate how indefinite causal order establishes connections between distant cavity fields that never directly interact, offering advantages over traditional, fixed-order scenarios. The team's findings reveal that this approach consistently generates strong correlations between these fields, even when starting from a vacuum state, and crucially, enables the complete interchange of a single photon between cavities without altering the state of the atom involved, a feat impossible with conventional systems. This work highlights the potential of indefinite causal order to coherently control interactions between light and matter, paving the way for novel quantum technologies.

The results show that ICO creates entanglement between two distant cavity fields that never directly interact, and, crucially, when both cavity fields begin in the vacuum state, ICO consistently generates greater entanglement than fixed-order scenarios. Furthermore, the research demonstrates that ICO interchanges one photon between both cavities with a total probability of one, all while preserving the initial quantum state.

This research explores indefinite causal order (ICO), a quantum phenomenon where the sequence of events is not predetermined, potentially enhancing quantum information processing and communication. The team investigates how ICO can improve quantum algorithms, communication protocols, and precision measurement techniques. The researchers propose and explore using atom interferometers, specifically Sagnac interferometers, as a platform to realise and manipulate ICO, relying heavily on the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly superposition. Different causal orders are represented as sequences of quantum gates, and ICO allows for superpositions of these gate sequences.

The authors utilise concepts from quantum information theory to analyse the potential benefits of ICO, such as increased channel capacity or improved algorithm performance, while also considering the impact of decoherence. The core of the experimental approach involves atom interferometers, which split a beam of atoms into two paths travelling in opposite directions around a closed loop, creating a phase shift sensitive to the area enclosed and rotation rate. The researchers aim to control the atomic paths to create a superposition of different causal orders, proposing the use of guided atoms and waveguides to improve coherence and control. Multi-loop interferometers are explored to increase the complexity of the causal structures that can be realised. The research suggests that ICO could lead to improved quantum communication protocols and enhance precision measurements, potentially contributing to the development of new quantum technologies, such as quantum computers, sensors, and communication networks.

Researchers have demonstrated the potential of indefinite causal order (ICO) within a cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system, revealing a new pathway for quantum information processing and light-matter interaction control. Experiments show that ICO can generate entanglement between two distant cavity fields that have no direct interaction, a feat impossible with fixed-order scenarios. Specifically, the research demonstrates that ICO consistently creates substantial entanglement even when both cavity fields begin in a vacuum state, surpassing the performance of systems with a defined order of operations. The team further discovered that ICO enables the interchange of a single photon between the two cavities with a total probability of one, all without altering the atom's state. This photon exchange is unattainable in conventional cQED systems where the cavities are arranged in series. The team shows that introducing ICO, where an atom traverses two cavities in a superposition of orders, creates strong correlations between the cavity fields even when they do not directly interact. Notably, ICO consistently generates larger field correlations than scenarios with a fixed traversal order, and enables the complete interchange of a single photon between the cavities without altering the atom's state, a feat impossible with defined order. These findings suggest ICO could offer a new paradigm for coherently controlling atom-field interactions and manipulating quantum states of light and matter. The study successfully implements ICO using a control qubit to place the atom in a superposition of traversal paths. Future work could explore the application of ICO to more complex systems and investigate its potential for quantum information processing and enhanced sensing technologies.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Cybercriminals are deploying a novel evasion tactic by using Ethereum smart contracts to bypass detection in malicious npm packages, as threat actors intensify digital attacks using open-source tooling, according to a report by software security firm ReversingLabs.

The malicious software-supply-chain campaign utilized code to conceal command-and-control (C2) instructions for Node Package Manager (NPM) packages, introducing dangerous open-source elements within an extensive collection of JavaScript libraries.

Lucija Valentic, a ReversingLabs researcher, stated that two packages that emerged in July, “colortoolsv2” and a clone, “mimelib2,” pulled C2 URLs from onchain contracts before fetching a second-stage downloader.

A technical write-up published on Wednesday revealed that the packages executed an obfuscated script, querying an Ethereum contract to retrieve the next-stage payload location, rather than hard-coding links in the package itself. This route complicates detection and takedown, marking a new kind of attack vector.

“That's something we haven't seen previously,” the security expert wrote, adding that it shows how quickly threat actors are improving detection evasion strategies. The operation also leaned on fake, crypto-themed GitHub repositories, complete with inflated stars and auto-generated commits, to convince developers to add the packages as dependencies.

Valentic said the malware family was taken down after being reported to npm maintainers. Meanwhile, ReversingLabs tied the incident to a broader, ongoing effort to seed malicious npm and GitHub projects presented as trading bots or crypto tools.

“Once we decided to dig deeper into the packages, we discovered evidence of a much larger campaign that was spread across both npm and GitHub, trying to lure developers into downloading repositories that included malicious npm packages,” the researcher wrote.

While the new tactic was shut down, it's not the only code-related issue leveraging cryptographic technology. Beyond the two npm packages published in July, the company said the threat actors built credibility around decoy repositories such as “solana-trading-bot-v2,” which showed thousands of superficial commits, puppet maintainers, and coordinated stargazer activity, while the malicious dependency was quietly swapped between package names.

Also, ReversingLabs previously flagged related npm campaigns that abused developer trust and open-source tooling earlier this year.

“These latest attacks by threat actors, including the creation of sophisticated attacks using blockchain and GitHub, show that attacks on repositories are evolving,” said Valentic. “Developers and development organizations alike need to be on the lookout for efforts to implant malicious code in legitimate applications, gain access to sensitive development assets, and steal sensitive data and digital assets.”

Many of the world's largest banks have increased their crypto custody strategies recently.

Earlier this year, both State Street and JPMorgan Chase announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency custody service line in 2026, and US Bancorp has refocused on this service line. Now, we hear that Citi is looking to follow suit, with the global head of partnerships and innovation for the bank's services division stating that it is prioritising custody for high-quality assets backing stablecoins.

With the vast majority of stablecoin transactions taking place outside the banking system and the potential for these cryptocurrencies to enter the payments mainstream, banks have an obvious incentive to offer related services.

These moves are also partly a response to increased regulatory requirements – last month, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission updated its controls for licensed custodians of virtual assets.

Banks are particularly keen to benefit from increased appetite for virtual assets among institutional investors in the US, where a joint statement issued in July by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarified the responsibilities of banks holding crypto assets for customers.

Financial institutions under the supervision of the OCC have been able to conduct cryptocurrency custody activities as long as they implement appropriate third-party risk management practices.

However, this trend is also evident in Europe, where Deutsche Bank reportedly intends to launch cryptocurrency custody services next year.

Commerzbank launched a crypto custody offering for corporate clients in 2024, BBVA has partnered with Binance to provide off-exchange custody for its customers' digital assets, and it has also been suggested that Sberbank is preparing to offer custody services for cryptocurrency assets.

Regardless of location, though, banks will have to ensure their compliance teams are prepared for an increased workload and that their systems are capable of identifying potential anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing violations.

The head of the central bank and the government's chief finance minister appear to be at odds over the future of digital money in the UK.In a speech to the National Bank of Ukraine in June, Andrew Bailey suggested that to pass the test of being money, stablecoins must provide assurance of nominal value and that many of the current versions do not quite reach that standard.

He went on to say that he remained unconvinced of the need to create new forms of money such as central bank retail digital currency to realise the benefits of digital technologies in the area of payments.

“To be clear, I am not against stablecoins,” he said. “I am not against central bank retail digital currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.”

Bailey went even further during a recent media interview, suggesting that stablecoins created by banks and pegged to assets such as the dollar could pose a threat to the whole financial system and advocating focusing on tokenised deposits or digital money instead.These comments are significant as they come at a time when legislative developments in the US have encouraged the likes of Bank of America, Citi, and JP Morgan to issue stablecoins.

In her latest annual Chancellor address, Rachel Reeves said she planned to advance developments in stablecoins, which are benefiting from growing demand for dollar-denominated assets that sit outside the traditional banking sector.

Bailey's remarks also point to differences of opinion not just between the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but between senior figures within the bank. The executive director of financial market infrastructure told a recent conference that the Bank of England was open minded to stablecoins being able to provide innovation that could also be useful for wholesale markets.

With the UK not set to publish guidelines on stablecoins equivalent to the Genius Act or MiCA until next year, key policymakers need to get their affairs in order.

Another area where the UK lags its European rivals is in retail access to crypto exchange traded notes. ETN providers such as 21Shares, WisdomTree and Invesco have seen minimal trading in their professional investor products in the UK since they were introduced in May.

These firms and others will hope that the FCA's decision to allow retail customers access to these products from next month will set the scene for crypto ETFs and possibly even CFDs down the line, although the UK financial regulator remains wary of endorsing the latter, even with low leverage.

To ensure the integrity of the products, the FCA has proposed that crypto ETNs would only be allowed to trade on an FCA-approved, UK-based recognised investment exchange and will have to provide accurate information to potential investors.

One of the approved exchanges, LSEG, has analysed the listing and trading profile of the crypto ETNs on its market compared to other European primary exchanges to understand how these products currently trade.

It says this analysis has revealed that crypto ETN volatility has profiled similarly to all individual stocks within the FTSE 100 and has been less volatile than stocks in the FTSE 250.

LSEG suggests that many of the 25 issuers that have listed more than 150 crypto ETNs with a variety of underlyings across Europe are keen to enter the UK market, and there is potential for considerable product innovation.

The exchange observes that some €26 billion was traded on European exchanges in 2024 – an increase of more than 300% year on year compared to the previous 12 months – and expects similar growth this year.

However, 21Shares has criticised the decision to prohibit access to products not listed on UK exchanges and called for a transparent eligibility framework for a broader range of cryptoassets as underlyings for crypto ETNs. It will be interesting to see to what extent these limitations affect the appetite of other providers to enter the UK crypto ETN market.

Our previous discussions covered a wide range of issues, including the preservation of access to central bank money, the digital euro's role as an anchor for monetary and financial stability, the need to safeguard strategic autonomy and the benefits the digital euro would have for various stakeholders.[1] 

Today I would like to focus on two dimensions that have received less attention but are nonetheless fundamental for making the euro fit for the future: resilience and inclusiveness. In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times. Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union reminds us of our shared responsibility to safeguard the integrity of our currency and take the measures that are necessary for its continued use.[2]

As a digital form of cash issued by the European Central Bank, the digital euro will complement physical cash, which remains key for resilience and inclusion.[3] The digital euro will ensure that all Europeans can pay at all times with a free, universally accepted digital means of payment, even in case of major disruptions. 

At present, with the core of our digital payment systems provided by non-EU providers,[4] our capacity to act swiftly and independently – particularly in times of crisis – could be constrained.[5]

Digital payments bring many advantages such as speed, convenience and efficiency. But they crucially depend on the strength of our digital infrastructure. And when critical services are interrupted, citizens expect public authorities to ensure continuity. So what would happen if we weren't in a position to ensure payments continuity? We would be blamed for not having acted when we could.

Payment services are not a luxury but are as essential to daily life as electricity or clean water. As a basic service, there must be a payment solution that is always available to all. This is especially critical in today's world of rising geopolitical tensions and ever more sophisticated cyberattacks. 

Recent EU initiatives to strengthen civil and military readiness and enhance the EU's ability to prevent and respond to threats have underscored the importance of preparing for extreme crisis scenarios, and we must take this responsibility seriously.[6] Incidents such as the sabotage of undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea are stark reminders of how fragile our infrastructures can be.

And disruptions are not only the result of geopolitics or security crises. Think of the power and network outages in Spain and Portugal this past spring, during which many people were unable to pay because they had no cash on hand. Such events show why safeguarding our system is vital. Europeans turn to us at the ECB – and to you, the co-legislators – for decisive action and practical steps to prevent such upsets in the future.

Today, cash is our only true fallback and we are strongly committed to ensuring that it remains available, accessible and accepted throughout the euro area.[7] But as society increasingly moves away from cash, and as cash itself may be difficult to access in emergencies, especially if cash distribution networks are disrupted, we need to complement it with a digital version.[8] 

Against this background, the digital euro can have a meaningful impact. Not just as a technological innovation, but as a public good that strengthens Europe's resilience. The EU Council is already making progress in this direction, with invaluable contributions from several Member States which recognise the urgent need to strengthen our resilience.[9] 

The digital euro would in fact support business continuity in times of crisis by providing additional payment rails on top of the existing private solutions. In other words, by having alternative payment options in place, we would enhance resilience by ensuring that there is always spare capacity in the system. 

In terms of resilience, three features of the digital euro stand out.

First, the technical infrastructure for processing transactions will be distributed across at least three different regions, each equipped with multiple servers. In the event of a regional disaster or cyberattack, this will allow payments to be automatically rerouted, ensuring uninterrupted operations.

Second, the ECB will develop a dedicated digital euro app that will be made available to all and will allow users to switch easily between payment service providers offering the digital euro. Under normal circumstances, this fallback option will ensure flexibility. But in the event of a cyberattack on one or more providers, it would guarantee continuity. For example, if a cyberattack caused the outage of a bank's own app, but the bank's backend services were still functioning, customers would still be able to access their accounts with that bank through the ECB's digital euro app. Or if a bank became unable to operate at all, its customers could use the ECB's digital euro app to easily switch to a bank that has not been affected by the cyberattack. 

This dimension of resilience is one reason why we at the ECB have recommended that the legislation on the digital euro makes it mandatory for payment services providers to support the digital euro app provided by the ECB.

Third, the offline functionality[10] will provide an extra layer of security by allowing payments to be made even when internet connectivity is disrupted or cash is hard to access – for example, during a power outage or a natural disaster.[11] It is therefore vital that the legislation ensures citizens can easily and securely access the digital euro offline, including through options such as setting offline payments as the default[12] and automatic funding of offline holdings.[13] 

Now let me turn to inclusion.

As public institutions, we must ensure that no one is left behind as we move to an even more digital economy. For decades, cash has been a cornerstone of financial inclusion – offering accessibility, autonomy and trust.[14] We cannot afford to lose these benefits through inaction. 

Safeguarding inclusion must be more than a principle – it must translate into practical steps that address the barriers people face in their daily lives, as also highlighted by European consumer associations.[15] 

These barriers are real. They range from not owning a smartphone, to limited digital literacy, to user interfaces that are not designed with accessibility in mind.[16] To give you an idea how important accessibility is, more than 30 million Europeans are blind or partially sighted and at least 34 million are deaf or hard of hearing. If we are to build a truly inclusive digital economy, as we are mandated to do in the payment space, we must also cater for the accessibility needs of these citizens – and many others. 

The digital euro, as a public good, would guarantee access for all citizens – no matter where they live, how much they earn or how digitally skilled they are. Our strategy for this task is two-pronged. 

The first aspect of our strategy is technological design. The ECB will make sure that the digital euro is designed to be inclusive from the ground up. We are working closely with associations that represent vulnerable groups to better understand their needs so that we can build the technology around them.[17]

We are also conducting user research, including focus groups with vulnerable and digitally excluded consumers, to understand how the digital euro can mitigate entry barriers and address other pain points. And we are exploring adaptive user interfaces – such as voice commands, large-font displays and simplified workflows – so that the digital euro will work for people with accessibility needs or limited digital literacy.

These special features will be supported by the ECB's digital euro app, which will give users easy access to basic digital euro services and will go beyond the requirements of the European Accessibility Act.[18] The need for inclusiveness once again underscores the importance of requiring all payment service providers to support an app provided by the ECB. 

The second aspect is customer support at the country level. We are engaging with entities that could provide dedicated support if designated by an individual Member State – such as local authorities, libraries and post offices. These entities could provide free assistance and access to digital euro services. which would be a practical way of helping those most at risk of digital exclusion.

Let me conclude by stressing that resilience and inclusion are cornerstone features of cash, and they must remain so in the digital age. Legal tender must always be accessible to everyone in our monetary area.

As we prepare a digital legal tender – the digital euro – to complement physical cash, it is our shared responsibility to bring these trusted features of cash into the digital era. This will maintain confidence in our currency, the euro. 

The ECB is supporting the ongoing work by the European Commission and EU Council on resilience and inclusion. But for the digital euro to actually enhance the resilience of payments in the euro area, it must first become a reality.

Last March euro area leaders called for stepping up the pace on a digital euro, notably to “support a competitive and resilient European payment system and contribute to Europe's economic security”.[19] Progress in the legislative process will allow us to move forward in parallel and provide Europeans with a clear and specific timeline for when they can expect the digital euro to become a reality, ensuring easy access to a resilient means of payment that will protect Europe's economic security.

Thank you for your attention.

 	The ECB collaborates with the European Commission on the EU Preparedness Union Strategy, which emphasises the role of cash in strengthening societal resilience. We are also working closely with the national central banks of the euro area to enhance crisis preparedness and ensure that cash remains available during emergencies. See footnote 3.

 	Offline digital euro payments would be validated “peer-to-peer”, meaning the payer and payee would directly verify that the transfer of value between them had been carried out, without any third-party involvement.  

 	During a power outage the devices of the payer and payee would need to have sufficient battery power. 

 	This would mean all proximity digital euro payments below a certain threshold would automatically be conducted offline. 

 	This would be much like an automated way of withdrawing cash from an ATM, but without the need to physically go to a machine. The automatic funding feature would give people assurance that even in a crisis they would always have some digital euro available on their phone, ready to use regardless of connectivity. 

 	Concerning inclusiveness, cash provides payment and savings options for people with limited or no access to digital payment methods, making it crucial for the inclusion of socially vulnerable citizens. This concerns people with disabilities, people with no or insufficient digital skills and people of low literacy. Concerning autonomy: cash gives people control over their own money, regardless of any decisions (e.g. on credit policies or fees) by their bank and its systems. See Euro Retail Payments Board (2021), Report of the ERPB Working Group on Access and Acceptance of Cash, 25 November. 

 	European Consumer Organisation (2023), BEUC's recommendations on the legislative framework for the digital euro, 29 September. 

 	For instance, the recent private sector solutions aiming to offer interconnectivity among domestic schemes are “digital only” solutions. They will leave behind anyone unable or unwilling to use a smartphone app or without a sufficiently new smartphone. 

 	Vulnerable groups face significant barriers in accessing digital payment services. Older adults and people with low financial and digital skills often grapple with complex user interfaces, onboarding and multi-step authentication processes, which can discourage them from using digital payment services. Additionally, a lack of guidance or tutorials tailored to their needs can foster mistrust and fear of fraud. Similarly, people with physical impairment face accessibility challenges arising from physical infrastructure, such as payment terminals and digital interfaces that do not support assistive technologies. 

 	For instance, the Eurosystem is considering specific adjustments, such as allowing users to complete all actions from the keyboard only or supporting screen readers. 

 	“In a more fragmented and digital world, accelerating progress on a digital euro is key to support a competitive and resilient European payment system, contribute to Europe's economic security and strengthen the international role of the euro. We invite the President of the Eurogroup to report regularly on progress with these initiatives.” See General Secretariat of the Council (2025), Euro Summit Meeting – Statement, 20 March.

Cryptocurrency is gradually making inroads into residential real estate transactions, but few Americans realize that virtual money can be used to buy or sell a home—and even fewer trust it.

New research conducted by the Research and Insights team at Realtor.com® reveals that digital currency in real estate continues to be met with limited awareness and considerable skepticism driven by perceived risk, distrust, and confusion.

As part of the study, 209 consumers participated in a qualitative research activity from Aug. 15 to Aug. 20 to gauge their familiarity and use of cryptocurrency in general and in real estate deals in particular. Participants included a mix of first-time homebuyers, repeat buyers, sellers, and renters.

Nearly half of the participants were millennials, just under a third were Gen X, roughly 20% were baby boomers, and just 3% were Gen Z.

According to the results of the research, most participants were at least somewhat familiar with crypto, and some of them had owned or invested in blockchain-based assets.

However, most were unaware of digital currencies' use in homebuying or selling.

"While participants are not highly familiar with crypto being used in real estate transactions, many were able to intuitively identify how it could be used for the homebuying or selling process: direct peer-to-peer transfers, using digital assets as collateral for a loan, or converting crypto to cash for a traditional purchase, said Daniela Valdivieso Eguiguren, senior market researcher at Research & Insights at Realtor.com.

Asked about the pros and cons of using digital money over traditional methods of payment, participants named more drawbacks than benefits.

Among the perceived negatives associated with crypto, participants brought up volatility, risk and distrust, and a lack of clarity.

"Cryptocurrency is speculative and unreliable in my opinion. I would not personally trust it," a Gen X participant named Robert said.

Meanwhile, Nick, a first-time homebuyer, cited crypto's "variable value and less than solid backing" as some of the reasons why he would not rely on it "for a big purchase."

Other participants argued that blockchain-based currency had a potential for user error, with one fretting about having a typo in the digital wallet address, and another worrying about losing access to the assets by misplacing the account information.

"These concerns often led consumers to believe potential assets loss would outweigh benefits," according to the research summary.

Perceived benefits of cryptocurrency uses included greater transaction security, increased speed, and a potential to maximize earnings.

"It doesn't leave a paper trail because crypto is all digital," a Realtor.com participant named Christopher said. "It's a safe and secure form of digital payment that keeps both parties safe and keeps the transaction private."

A participant named Sabrina touted crypto's ability to save time and ensure a quick real estate transaction, especially for international buyers.

Only a few participants had used crypto for real estate deals, citing limited investments and distrust.

"It came as no surprise to participants that crypto can be used for real estate transactions," said Valdivieso Eguiguren. "However, many still think it is a new technology that needs time and reliability before it can be trusted for mainstream use in such a significant financial process."

Perhaps more alarmingly for the future of this industry, the majority of participants said they did not expect to harness crypto in the future to buy or sell homes because of lingering reliability concerns.

"I don't want to invest my hard-earned money into uncertain places," concluded a millennial repeat buyer named Madan, while a Gen Xer named Robert dismissed crypto as an "unreliable fad that should fail in the future."

Those still on the fence about virtual currency said they needed more information or time to see where it goes from here before they decide to get involved.

"I would need to learn a lot more about how that process works before I'd be willing to make that kind of decision," a participant named Sunnie said.

These comments come as no surprise to housing market experts.

"In the short term, consumer distrust will keep crypto a novelty or marketing tool in real estate rather than a mainstream payment option," says Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. "Uncertain regulations, unclear tax treatment, and limited institutional adoption make buyers wary, while the currency's volatility reinforces its reputation as speculative and risky."

In some good news for real estate professionals specializing in crypto transactions, a few of the participants praised the use of virtual money to buy or sell properties as forward-thinking and a smart investment.

"I think crypto is here to stay and I can see myself using some or a lot of it to buy a home in the future," a participant named Phil, who is a repeat homebuyer, said. "I am for sure open to it if I have enough and the system is easy to use and [safe] to use."

The mixed research findings come just as cryptocurrency has begun gaining traction on the housing market, with the West Coast branch of Christie's International Real Estate becoming the first major U.S. brokerage to debut a division dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency transitions in July.

Aaron Kirman, CEO of Christie's International Real Estate Southern California, who heads the new crypto-only unit, told Realtor.com that there is "a real market" for tokenized property deals.

"Crypto is here to stay—its influence in real estate is only going to grow in the coming years," Kirman said in July.

The real estate bigwig predicted that in the next five years, more than a third of all residential real estate deals in the U.S. could involve crypto.

Tokenized payments are growing increasingly popular especially among high-net-worth individuals and celebrities looking to protect their privacy and keep their property acquisitions under wraps.

Christie's Real Estate SoCal has already closed multiple deals totalling over $200 million paid entirely in cryptocurrency—and Kirman said his portfolio of for-sale homes whose sellers are seeking crypto offers boasts a combined worth of more than $1 billion.

The convergence of virtual currency and housing has not gone unnoticed by policymakers in Washington, DC.

In June, President Donald Trump's administration ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals for considering crypto holdings as assets when weighing the creditworthiness of a homebuyer applying for a mortgage.

The rule change would make it easier for homebuyers who own cryptocurrency to qualify for a mortgage, and potentially up their loan amount limits, without requiring them to convert their tokens into cash.

However, homebuyers would still need to make their monthly mortgage payments in dollars and not in crypto.

The move highlighted Washington's embrace of cryptocurrency, with Trump proclaiming himself a "crypto president" and vowing to make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the world."

Since taking office eight months ago, Trump has appointed David Sacks as "crypto czar" and hosted the first White House Crypto Summit in March. 

In July, Trump signed into law the landmark GENIUS Act, introducing federal rules for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoin.

Around the same time, the House passed the CLARITY Act designed to create a regulatory framework for digital assets and defining which agency has jurisdiction over different kinds of "digital commodities."

And yet, the use of blockchain-based assets in real estate so far has largely been limited to the ultra-luxury segment.

Jones says that could change going forward, but only if certain conditions are met.

"Long-term adoption will hinge on currency stability, regulatory clarity, ease of use, and greater normalization through precedent," says the analyst. "For crypto to become commonplace in real estate, it must first earn broader credibility and trust among buyers."

The director of a care home in Bridlington, Yorkshire, has been fined for refusing to respond to a request for a resident's personal information – known as a subject access request (SAR).  

In April 2023, a woman requested personal information about her father from Bridlington Lodge Care Home.   

Jason Blake, 56, was found to have blocked, erased, or concealed records held by Bridlington Lodge Care Home between 12 April and 12 May 2023 to prevent this information being disclosed.    

Under data protection law, people have the legal right to ask an organisation if it is using or storing their personal information and receive a copy of any personal information held.  

In this case, the daughter had the authority to request this information on her father's behalf due to a lasting power of attorney. The personal information requested included incident reports, copies of CCTV footage and notes relating to her father's care.  

After Mr Blake refused to respond to the request, a complaint was made to us. During our investigation, Mr Blake did not provide any explanation about why his organisation would not respond to the SAR.  

Mr Blake appeared at Beverley Magistrates Court on Wednesday 3 September 2025 where he was ordered to pay a fine of £1,100 and additional costs of £5,440 after being found guilty.  

Andy Curry, Head of Investigations at the ICO, said:

“We describe subject access requests as a fundamental right. This is because it helps people understand how and why organisations are using their information. This family put their trust in Bridlington Lodge Care Home to look after their father, and they had a right to receive information about his care.    

“By ignoring this request for personal information and refusing to provide any explanation, Mr Blake believed he was above the law. Not only did he dismiss the family's request, he also tried to avoid scrutiny by asking the ICO to cancel his registration.  

“I hope this successful prosecution reminds all organisations that data protection applies to everyone, and subject access requests must be handled lawfully and responsibly.”    

All organisations must respond to a SAR within one month of receipt of the request, which can sometimes be extended to three months.  

It is a criminal offence for organisations to alter, deface, block, erase, destroy or conceal information with the intention of preventing disclosure under Section 173 of the Data Protection Act.

Technology is evolving rapidly, and as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into various aspects of our lives and industries, the role of regulatory bodies like the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) becomes crucial.

To explore the ICO's role in the AI regulatory landscape, Sophia Ignatidou, Group Manager of AI Policy at the ICO, elaborates on the office's comprehensive approach to managing AI development in the UK, emphasising the opportunities AI presents for economic growth, the inherent risks associated with its deployment, as well as the ethical considerations organisations must address.

The ICO is the UK's independent data protection authority and a horizontal regulator, meaning our remit spans both the public and private sectors, including government. We regulate the processing of personal data across the AI value chain: from data collection to model training and deployment. Since personal data underpins most AI systems that interact with people, our work is wide-ranging, covering everything from fraud detection in the public sector to targeted advertising on social media.

Our approach combines proactive engagement and regulatory enforcement. On the engagement side, we work closely with industry through our Enterprise and Innovation teams, and with the public sector via our Public Affairs colleagues. We also provide innovation services to support responsible AI development, with enforcement reserved for serious breaches. We also focus on public awareness, including commissioning research into public attitudes and engaging with civil society.

AI offers significant potential to drive efficiency, reduce administrative burdens, and accelerate decision-making by identifying patterns and automating processes. However, these benefits will only be realised if AI addresses real-world problems rather than being a “solution in search of a problem.”

The UK is home to world-class AI talent and continues to attract leading minds. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach, combining technical expertise with insights from social sciences and economics, is essential to ensure AI development reflects the complexity of human experience.

Crucially, we do not see data protection as a barrier to innovation. On the contrary, strong data protection is fundamental to sustainable innovation and economic growth. Just as seatbelts enabled the safe expansion of the automotive industry, robust data protection builds trust and confidence in AI.

AI is not a single technology but an umbrella term for a range of statistical models with varying complexity, accuracy, and data requirements. The risks depend on the context and purpose of deployment.

When we identify a high-risk AI use case, we typically require the organisation, whether developer or deployer, to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). This document should outline the risks and the measures in place to mitigate them. The ICO assesses the adequacy of these DPIAs, focusing on the severity and likelihood of harm. Failure to provide an adequate DPIA can lead to regulatory action, as seen in our preliminary enforcement notice against Snap in 2023.

Emerging technologies such as federated learning can help address data protection challenges by reducing the amount of personal information processed and improving security. Federated learning allows models to be trained without centralising raw data, which lowers the risk of large-scale breaches and limits exposure of personal information. When combined with other privacy-enhancing technologies, it further mitigates the risk of attackers inferring sensitive data.

Blockchain, when implemented carefully, can strengthen integrity and accountability through tamper-evident records, though it must be designed to avoid unnecessary on-chain disclosure. Our detailed guidance on blockchain will be published soon and can be tracked via the ICO's technology guidance pipeline.

Data protection law embeds ethical principles through its seven core principles: lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability. Under the UK GDPR's “data protection by design and by default” requirement, organisations must integrate these principles into AI systems from the outset.

Our recently announced AI and Biometrics Strategy sets out four priority areas: scrutiny of automated decision-making in government and recruitment, oversight of generative AI foundation model training, regulation of facial recognition technology in law enforcement and development of a statutory code of practice on AI and automated decision-making. This strategy builds on our existing guidance and aims to protect individuals' rights while providing clarity for innovators.

The UK government's AI Opportunities Plan rightly emphasises the need to strengthen regulators' capacity to supervise AI. Building expertise and resources across the regulatory landscape is essential to keep pace with rapid technological change.

AI supply chains are global, so international collaboration is vital. We maintain active relationships with counterparts through forums such as the G7, OECD, Global Privacy Assembly, and the European Commission. We closely monitor developments like the EU AI Act, while remaining confident in the UK's approach of empowering sector regulators rather than creating a single AI regulator.

The Data (Use and Access) Act requires the ICO to develop a statutory Code of Practice on AI and automated decision-making. This will build on our existing non-statutory guidance and incorporate recent positions, such as our expectations for generative AI and joint guidance on AI procurement. The code will provide greater clarity on issues such as research provisions and accountability in complex supply chains.

The UK already plays a leading role in global AI regulation discussions. For example, the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, bringing together the ICO, Ofcom, CMA and FCA, has been replicated internationally. The ICO was also the first data protection authority to provide clarity on generative AI.

Looking ahead, our main challenges include recruiting and retaining AI specialists, providing regulatory clarity amid rapid technical and legislative change, and ensuring our capacity matches the scale of AI adoption.

A crypto strategist known for making timely altcoin calls says he's snapping up the utility token of a supply-chain focused project.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 476,600 followers on X that he accumulated OriginTrail (TRAC) after the coin dropped to a high-time-frame (HTF) support level.

“Added some TRAC to my spot holdings today, still just marinating in the HTF accumulation zone.”

In July, the analyst explained why he decided to include TRAC in his core holding.

“TRAC ran about 5x after it first came to my attention in 2023.

It has now found its way back to the original accumulation zone that I had marked off back then.

Fully diluted supply of 500 million and current market cap of 200 million means zero token inflation and plenty of upside potential for OriginTrail.

It has been a core holding for me since I spoke about it a couple of years ago, and it seems fundamentals have only gotten stronger since then.

I don't think you can go wrong with picking up some spot again at these levels.” 

TRAC powers a decentralized knowledge graph built for supply chains and beyond. At time of writing, TRAC is trading at $0.361, up over 7% on the day.

Looking at XRP, the analyst predicts that the payments altcoin is primed to outpace Ethereum (ETH), which has ignited strong rallies over the last two months. According to the analyst, XRP/ETH is flashing a bullish divergence on the three-day chart, indicating that a bullish reversal is in sight.

“One more confluent factor to support my thesis below of XRP outperformance over ETH in the coming weeks/months:

We have already printed confirmed daily bull divs on the XRP/ETH pairing and are currently in the process of printing one on the 3D time frame as well… The picture being painted is quite clear in my opinion.”

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to predict that XRP/ETH will rally to 0.00165 ETH. At time of writing, XRP/ETH is trading at 0.000066 ETH, worth $2.86.

Public Health Experts Slam RFK, Jr. after Senate Hearing

On Thursday Senators grilled Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., about vaccines and turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts responded to Kennedy's claims on social media in disbelief and anger

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., US secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025. Kennedy Jr. tried to defend himself against senators from both parties who questioned his moves to restrict vaccine access.

On Thursday a combative and acerbic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, appeared before the Senate Committee on Finance and fielded angry questions from some of the very senators that helped him join President Donald Trump's cabinet. The senators' concerns included the firing of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's newly appointed director Susan Monarez and Kennedy's decisions to limit vaccine development and availability.

Kennedy often interrupted the questioning: He told Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, “You're wrong,” when Cassidy said Kennedy was denying people COVID vaccines. And Kennedy told Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, “You're just making stuff up,” after she questioned what evidence he and the Food and Drug Administration used to change COVID vaccine recommendations. Kennedy defended his decision to fire Monarez after only 29 days of service by claiming that she said “no” when asked if she was “trustworthy.” In a piece in the Wall Street Journal, Monarez wrote that Kennedy had asked her to sign off on “the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.”

The hearing had originally been scheduled for Kennedy to talk about the president's health agenda, but in light of a gunman firing on the CDC last month, the FDA's decision on COVID vaccines and Monarez's ouster, several senators used it to excoriate Kennedy for weakening the American public health system. Many public officials and health-related organizations have called for Kennedy's resignation.

Throughout the hearing, public health experts, medical professionals and scientists responded on social media. A selection of such comments is below.

“Dr. Monarez was told days before she was fired that she could not decide vaccine policy. We spoke on the phone and she said ‘I won't ever abandon you, but I am no longer able to be involved in vaccine policy per HHS. Those decisions need to go through the chief of staff.'” —Demetre C. Daskalakis, former director, National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC, writing on X

“Thom Tillis (R) really lays into RFK [Jr.]. Goes after him on everything from vaccines to the Big Beautiful Bill, gently pointing out that he's effectively, and repeatedly, lied. Wants a ‘written statement' from RFK [Jr.] on his view of Warp Speed and RNA tech. RFK [Jr.] not getting overwhelming support from GOP.” —Pam Herd, Social Sciences University of Michigan, writing on Bluesky



“Kennedy continues to claim that vaccines aren't adequately tested.

“He is a liar. They are the most thoroughly tested intervention of all.” —Elizabeth Jacobs, epidemiologist, Defend Public Health, and professor emerita, University of Arizona, writing on Bluesky

“Stop thinking [Kennedy] will be truthful. He won't. He is a threat to public health & scientific progress. He's demonized innovation for:

“Food safety

“Food stability

“Farming

“Infectious diseases

“Cancer

“Genetic disorders

“Dental health

“Public & population health

“The environment.” —Andrea Love, scientist, writing on Bluesky

“Unbelievable

“‘We are the sickest country in the world. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC. They did not do their job' - RFK Jr

“CDC folks have been fired, fired at, and now being blamed for the country's health crisis by a anti-science quack.” —Madhu Pai, public health and tuberculosis expert, McGill University, writing on Bluesky

“Confirming a man who is arguably the world's most extreme & dangerous anti-vaxx activist & conspiracy theorist was a massive failure…..” —Gavin Yamey, global health expert, Duke University, writing on Bluesky

“It's very clear that RFK Jr. has been lying throughout his entire senate hearing that happened earlier today.” —Zachary Rubin, physician and science communicator, speaking on Instagram

“[Kennedy said], ‘We are the sickest country in the world. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC!'

“Wrong. We are not the ‘sickest country in the world.' Not even close, by any measure.

“He fired people at CDC because they would not agree to carry out his plan to end vaccines in America.” —Angela Rasmussen, infectious disease expert, University of Saskatchewan, writing on X

Macrophages, which hoover up pathogens, have been implicated in the chronic inflammation that sets in with the march of time.Credit: Science Photo Library

A newly discovered type of immune cell found in fat tissue seems to contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with ageing, according to preliminary data from mice — but other immune cells in fat help to keep inflammation at bay1.

The inflammation-promoting cells emerge only in older mice, researchers found. Although the cells' precise role is unclear, they display several signatures associated with ‘inflammageing' — the persistent inflammation that develops as people grow older. The findings were published on 2 September in Nature Aging.

“We did not anticipate that there would be a completely new cell type,” says study co-author Vishwa Deep Dixit, an immunobiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

When injuries or infections occur, the immune system mounts a protective response by releasing cells and proteins to affected tissues. This complex cascade is called inflammation. But as we age, inflammation gradually increases and becomes persistent instead of being a state that occurs only when things go wrong.

Ageing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world

Among the cells that that help to regulate this inflammageing are a variety of macrophages — white blood cells that hoover up pathogens and cellular debris — that reside in fat tissue. But the exact roles of each type of macrophage and how these cells change throughout the ageing process remain a mystery, says study co-author Elsie Gonzalez-Hurtado, also an immunobiologist at Yale University. “There wasn't really a good characterization of these cells.” 

To build a clearer picture, Gonzalez-Hurtado and her colleagues imaged macrophages in the visceral fat, the deep fat that wraps around the organs, of young and aged mice. The researchers sorted the macrophages into categories on the basis of the cells' RNA molecules. These molecules indicate which genes in a cell are active, and therefore offer a guide to the cell's function.

The results revealed 13 distinct types of visceral-fat macrophage, some of which varied in abundance with age. A previously known type of macrophage that resides near nerves, for example, became less numerous in female mice as they grew older — but its numbers remained constant in males. Another previously known type of macrophage, which congregates near fat-tissue blood vessels, was less numerous in elderly male mice than in younger ones, but its levels did not vary with age in female mice.

As we age, what and how much we eat tends to change. However, how meal timing relates to our health remains less understood. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and their collaborators studied changes to meal timing in older adults and discovered people experience gradual shifts in when they eat meals as they age. They also found characteristics that may contribute to meal timing shifts and revealed specific trajectories linked to an earlier death. The results are published in Communications Medicine.

"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status. Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," said lead author Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity."

Dashti and his colleagues -- including senior author Altug Didikoglu, MSc, PhD, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey -- examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, health outcomes later in life. The research team analyzed data, including blood samples, from 2,945 community-dwelling adults in the UK aged 42-94 years old who were followed for more than 20 years. They found that as older adults age, they tend to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they eat each day.

Later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions such as depression, fatigue and oral health problems. Difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes. Notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. Individuals genetically predisposed to characteristics associated with being a "night owl" (preferring later sleep and wake times) tended to eat meals at later times.

"Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," said Dashti. "Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults. These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,' especially for older individuals."

Dashti noted that this has important implications as time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting gain popularity, where the health impacts of shifting meal schedules may differ significantly in aging populations from those in younger adults.

Ultraviolet rays actually break down components of solar panels over time, but red onion

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Solar power is one of the best tools in humanity's decarbonization toolbox, but even these green energy technologies aren't 100 percent sustainable. For example, solar cells only convert light in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum, and actually require UV filters (light below the 400 nanometers) to protect critical components like passivation layers and the underlying silicon. 

Typically, commercial solar panels rely on petroleum-based filters made from polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to do this job. While bio-based replacements would be a preferable material, these oil-based filters get the job done in large commercial solar farms where panels can be responsibly recycled. However, some solar applications could benefit immensely from having a system that was safely biodegradable, particularly in microsensors. In a recent study—carried out by scientists at University of Turku and Aalto University in Finland and Wageningen University in the Netherlands—found that an unlikely ally could aid us in our quest for a more biodegradable solar sensor. In fact, it might even be in your fridge. 

In the study, published in the journal ACS Applied Optical Materials, scientists developed UV protection film using nanocellulose—a natural material typically harvested from bacteria or plants that just so happens to be the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. Then, the team coated the film with other bio-based material to provide UV protection, including lignin, iron ions, and red onion extract. While these options provided varying levels of protection, red onion extract out performed them all, providing 99.9 percent UV protection. It even outperformed commercial PET filters.

“Nanocellulose films treated with red onion dye are a promising option in applications where the protective material should be bio-based,” Rustem Nizamov, the lead author of the study from the University of Turku, said in a press statement. “These results are also relevant for the UV protection of other types of solar cells, including perovskite and organic photovoltaics, as well as any application where the use of a bio-based UV filter is paramount.”

Developing an effective solar cell filter isn't easy. While the filter needs to provide robust UV protection, it also needs to allow a significant amount of light transmission in the 700 to 1200 nanometer range—the energy-producing sweet spot for solar cells. The scientists discerned that red onion extract provided 80 percent light transmission between 650 to 1,100 nanometers while maintaining performance over the 1,000-hour testing period (equivalent to roughly one year of sunlight). 

This performance-over-time aspect proved especially important because filters treated with iron ions performed admirably at first, but degraded rapidly over the testing period. 

“The study emphasized the importance of long-term testing for UV filters, as the UV protection and light transmittance of the other bio-based filters changed significantly over time,” Nizamov said in a press statement. 

As we continue to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, nature once again provides. First, with the necessary sunlight to create solar power, and then with the red onions to make those solar cells even more efficient. Who knows what other bio-based innovations will lead us to a new, green future?

The New Frontier of AI Hacking—Could Online Images Hijack Your Computer?

Artificial-intelligence agents—touted as AI's next wave—could be vulnerable to malicious code hidden in innocent-looking images on your computer screen

By Deni Ellis Béchard edited by Dean Visser

Compromised images can take over AI agents on user computers (image for illustrative purposes only).

A website announces, “Free celebrity wallpaper!” You browse the images. There's Selena Gomez, Rihanna and Timothée Chalamet—but you settle on Taylor Swift. Her hair is doing that wind-machine thing that suggests both destiny and good conditioner. You set it as your desktop background, admire the glow. You also recently downloaded a new artificial-intelligence-powered agent, so you ask it to tidy your inbox. Instead it opens your web browser and downloads a file. Seconds later, your screen goes dark.

But let's back up to that agent. If a typical chatbot (say, ChatGPT) is the bubbly friend who explains how to change a tire, an AI agent is the neighbor who shows up with a jack and actually does it. In 2025 these agents—personal assistants that carry out routine computer tasks—are shaping up as the next wave of the AI revolution.

What distinguishes an AI an agent from a chatbot is that it doesn't just talk—it acts, opening tabs, filling forms, clicking buttons and making reservations. And with that kind of access to your machine, what's at stake is no longer just a wrong answer in a chat window: if the agent gets hacked, it could share or destroy your digital content. Now a new preprint posted to the server arXiv.org by researchers at the University of Oxford has shown that images—desktop wallpapers, ads, fancy PDFs, social media posts—can be implanted with messages invisible to the human eye but capable of controlling agents and inviting hackers into your computer.

For instance, an altered “picture of Taylor Swift on Twitter could be sufficient to trigger the agent on someone's computer to act maliciously,” says the new study's co-author Yarin Gal, an associate professor of machine learning at Oxford. Any sabotaged image “can actually trigger a computer to retweet that image and then do something malicious, like send all your passwords. That means that the next person who sees your Twitter feed and happens to have an agent running will have their computer poisoned as well. Now their computer will also retweet that image and share their passwords.”

Before you begin scrubbing your computer of your favorite photographs, keep in mind that the new study shows that altered images are a potential way to compromise your computer—there are no known reports of it happening yet, outside of an experimental setting. And of course the Taylor Swift wallpaper example is purely arbitrary; a sabotaged image could feature any celebrity—or a sunset, kitten or abstract pattern. Furthermore, if you're not using an AI agent, this kind of attack will do nothing. But the new finding clearly shows the danger is real, and the study is intended to alert AI agent users and developers now, as AI agent technology continues to accelerate. “They have to be very aware of these vulnerabilities, which is why we're publishing this paper—because the hope is that people will actually see this is a vulnerability and then be a bit more sensible in the way they deploy their agentic system,” says study co-author Philip Torr.

Now that you've been reassured, let's return to the compromised wallpaper. To the human eye, it would look utterly normal. But it contains certain pixels that have been modified according to how the large language model (the AI system powering the targeted agent) processes visual data. For this reason, agents built with AI systems that are open-source—that allow users to see the underlying code and modify it for their own purposes—are most vulnerable. Anyone who wants to insert a malicious patch can evaluate exactly how the AI processes visual data. “We have to have access to the language model that is used inside the agent so we can design an attack that works for multiple open-source models,” says Lukas Aichberger, the new study's lead author.

By using an open-source model, Aichberger and his team showed exactly how images could easily be manipulated to convey bad orders. Whereas human users saw, for example, their favorite celebrity, the computer saw a command to share their personal data. “Basically, we adjust lots of pixels ever-so-slightly so that when a model sees the image, it produces the desired output,” says study co-author Alasdair Paren.

If this sounds mystifying, that's because you process visual information like a human. When you look at a photograph of a dog, your brain notices the floppy ears, wet nose and long whiskers. But the computer breaks the picture down into pixels and represents each dot of color as a number, and then it looks for patterns: first simple edges, then textures such as fur, then an ear's outline and clustered lines that depict whiskers. That's how it decides This is a dog, not a cat. But because the computer relies on numbers, if someone changes just a few of them—tweaking pixels in a way too small for human eyes to notice—it still catches the change, and this can throw off the numerical patterns. Suddenly the computer's math says the whiskers and ears match its cat pattern better, and it mislabels the picture, even though to us, it still looks like a dog. Just as adjusting the pixels can make a computer see a cat rather than a dog, it can also make a celebrity photograph resemble a malicious message to the computer.

Back to Swift. While you're contemplating her talent and charisma, your AI agent is determining how to carry out the cleanup task you assigned it. First, it takes a screenshot. Because agents can't directly see your computer screen, they have to repeatedly take screenshots and rapidly analyze them to figure out what to click on and what to move on your desktop. But when the agent processes the screenshot, organizing pixels into forms it recognizes (files, folders, menu bars, pointer), it also picks up the malicious command code hidden in the wallpaper.

Now why does the new study pay special attention to wallpapers? The agent can only be tricked by what it can see—and when it takes screenshots to see your desktop, the background image sits there all day like a welcome mat. The researchers found that as long as that tiny patch of altered pixels was somewhere in frame, the agent saw the command and veered off course. The hidden command even survived resizing and compression, like a secret message that's still legible when photocopied.

And the message encoded in the pixels can be very short—just enough to have the agent open a specific website. “On this website you can have additional attacks encoded in another malicious image, and this additional image can then trigger another set of actions that the agent executes, so you basically can spin this multiple times and let the agent go to different websites that you designed that then basically encode different attacks,” Aichberger says.

The team hopes its research will help developers prepare safeguards before AI agents become more widespread. “This is the first step towards thinking about defense mechanisms because once we understand how we can actually make [the attack] stronger, we can go back and retrain these models with these stronger patches to make them robust. That would be a layer of defense,” says Adel Bibi, another co-author on the study. And even if the attacks are designed to target open-source AI systems, companies with closed-source models could still be vulnerable. “A lot of companies want security through obscurity,” Paren says. “But unless we know how these systems work, it's difficult to point out the vulnerabilities in them.”

Gal believes AI agents will become common within the next two years. “People are rushing to deploy [the technology] before we know that it's actually secure,” he says. Ultimately the team hopes to encourage developers to make agents that can protect themselves and refuse to take orders from anything on-screen—even your favorite pop star.

Maintaining the epigenetic identity of centromeres is essential to prevent genome instability. Centromeres are epigenetically defined by the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Prior work in human centromeres has shown that CENP-A is associated with regions of hypomethylated DNA located within large arrays of hypermethylated repeats, but the functional importance of these DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed tools to perturb centromeric DNAme, revealing that it causally influences CENP-A positioning. We show that rapid loss of methylation results in increased binding of centromeric proteins and alterations in centromere architecture, leading to aneuploidy and reduced cell viability. We also demonstrate that gradual centromeric DNA demethylation prompts a process of cellular adaptation. Altogether, we find that DNAme causally influences CENP-A localization and centromere function, offering mechanistic insights into pathological alterations of centromeric DNAme.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAme) regulate chromatin architecture, gene transcription and cell division, and are often deregulated in cancer1. Centromeres, the chromosomal loci that control faithful chromosome segregation during cell division2, are epigenetically defined by chromatin enriched in the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A3,4, generally within highly repetitive DNA sequences5,6. CENP-A, along with other factors, identifies and maintains centromeric position indefinitely throughout the cell cycle7 and is a key player in maintaining centromere assembly and consequent faithful chromosome segregation8,9. CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed with canonical histone H3, with CENP-A representing 4–25% of nucleosomes in centromeric chromatin10,11, which constitutes about 10% of each repetitive sequence array on average12. What defines CENP-A position and boundaries within centromeric regions is still an open question. In canonical human centromeres, CENP-A assembles on direct (head-to-tail) tandem arrays of 171 base pair (bp) α-satellite (α-sat) DNA repeats13. α-Sat arrays are further arranged in higher-order repeats (HOR), which are themselves repeated hundreds to thousands of times to create homogeneous HOR arrays spanning up to 5 Mbp12. Although each chromosome may contain multiple distinct HOR arrays, CENP-A typically localizes within one array, deemed the ‘active' HOR array14. Approximately every other α-sat repeat unit contains a conserved 17 bp motif named the CENP-B box, which is bound by CENP-B, the only centromeric sequence-specific DNA-binding protein identified so far15 and a key player in centromere organization and function16. Recently, the complete assembly of centromere sequences revealed that centromeric DNA is heavily methylated with the exception of a small hypomethylated region within every active HOR array named the centromere dip region (CDR)17, which corresponds to a region of high CENP-A density11,12,17,18,19. These findings, along with the evidence that links alterations of DNAme at (peri-)centromeric regions and diseases such as cancer or immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome20,21, hint that DNAme is an important contributor to the epigenetic determination of centromere identity and stability22 (Fig. 1a).

Source data

Here we have developed cellular tools to induce hypomethylation globally or targeted at centromeric regions to investigate the functional relationship among centromeric DNAme, centromere position and genome stability.

To probe the consequences of DNAme loss at centromeres, we fused the catalytic domain of ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1CD), one of the enzymes that catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to actively demethylate the DNA23 (Fig. 1b), to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of CENP-B, generating a construct that is inducible by doxycycline (DOX) and degradable by an auxin-inducible degron24 (AID) upon the addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The centromere-targeted demethylating construct (hereafter named DBDTET1AID) was integrated into the pseudodiploid colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1 either by lentiviral transduction (multicopy random integration) or by the Flp-In recombination method (isogenic single-copy integration at a specific FRT locus)25. Addition of DOX leads to DBDTET1AID accumulation at centromeres (Fig. 1d,e) and to a gradual reduction in DNAme levels at centromeric regions as observed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA; Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1c), pyrosequencing (Extended Data Fig. 1d) and nanopore sequencing (Fig. 1h). The catalytically inactive (or dead, dTET1) version of the construct had no effect on the centromeric DNAme levels despite its centromeric localization (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). DNA demethylation was not restricted to CENP-B-boxes, which harbor two CpG sites, and it spread throughout the centromeric α-sat repeats, while only minorly affecting noncentromeric regions including the flanking pericentromeric Human Satellite 2 (HSat2) regions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1d,f). As expected from the TET-mediated active demethylation (Fig. 1b), the expression of DBDTET1AID led to a rapid centromeric accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)—the first and most abundant oxidation intermediate in the pathway26—that decreased at later time points (Fig. 1i), indicating the completion of the demethylation cycle. The kinetics of DNA demethylation were slower in the single-copy integration system compared to certain clones of the multicopy lentivirus integration (Extended Data Fig. 1g), and the rate of demethylation of the clones was dependent on DBDTET1AID expression levels based on centromeric fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1e,g). All centromeres were demethylated with similar kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The demethylation process is antagonized by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery as seen by the enhanced demethylation kinetics upon concomitant induction of a DBDTET1 construct with an AID-mediated degradation of the endogenous maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which doubled the rate of DNA demethylation (Fig. 1j). According to the role of DNMT1 in maintaining DNAme at centromeres, the rapid depletion of DNMT1 in DLD-1 cells27 led to a reduction of DNAme at α-sat and CENP-B boxes and, to similar extents, at pericentromeric HSat2 repeats (Fig. 1k). Co-depletion of DNMT1 and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, but not of DNMT3B alone, strongly affected DNAme levels, highlighting a cooperativity between DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the maintenance of (peri)centromeric DNAme. Altogether, these data show that the expression of DBDTET1 demethylates the centromeres and suggests that centromeric DNAme is mainly controlled by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery, at least in somatic adult cells.

We then addressed whether DNAme controls the position of human centromeres by modulating the binding of centromeric proteins (CENPs; Fig. 2a). CpG methylation of the CENP-B boxes was suggested to reduce the binding of CENP-B28,29 and CENP-B was previously implicated in promoting centromeric CENP-A assembly7,30. Using microscale thermophoresis, we determined in vitro that CENP-B has an eightfold stronger affinity for unmethylated CENP-B boxes (dissociation constant Kd ~ 0.3 µm) than for methylated ones (Kd ~ 2.5 µm; Fig. 2b). An increase of CENP-B signal at centromeric regions upon gradual DBDTET1AID-mediated DNA hypomethylation was confirmed in cells by immunofluorescence and CUT&RUN–qPCR (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). DOX induction times were chosen for each cell line based on their demethylation kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1g) and, unless stated otherwise, were followed by 2 days of auxin treatment to remove any possible steric hindrance of the TET1 enzyme bound to the centromeres. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed an increase of CENP-A levels at centromeres as DNAme levels decreased (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The CENP-A increase was observed in all cell cycle phases (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f), including metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2g), indicating that this increase is not an artifact due to centromeric clustering in interphase nuclei. Notably, the CENP-A/CENP-B increase was also observed when depleting DNMT1 and DNMT3B (Fig. 2h). A similar increase, although less consistently pronounced, was also observed for CENP-C (Fig. 2c,d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c,g), a key factor for the assembly of the kinetochore31 and known to interact with both CENP-A and CENP-B7. The increase of CENP-A signal was independent of the CENP-B increase as the siRNA-mediated knockdown of CENP-B did not prevent CENP-A accumulation at hypomethylated centromeres (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c).

To strengthen our observations on the inverse relationship between centromeric DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B levels, we fused the prokaryotic DNA methyltransferase MQ1Q147L or its catalytically inactive variant dMQ1 (C141S and S317A)32 to CENP-BDBD, generating, as for TET1, a dually controllable DOX/IAA system for targeted centromeric CpG hypermethylation (Fig. 2i). We inserted this system in RPE-1 cells for which a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly was recently published33, therefore allowing us to assess specifically the methylation levels of the CDRs where CENP-A is enriched. DOX induction of the active MQ1Q147L construct led to a rapid increase in DNAme within the CDRs (~1.8-fold increase in 4 days) and only minorly at the surrounding regions or at random genomic regions compared to the catalytically inactive dMQ1, as observed by ultralong read nanopore sequencing (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3d). In this condition, both CENP-A and CENP-B intensity levels at centromeres decreased (Fig. 2k), reinforcing the inverse relationship between DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B centromeric binding.

The increase in CENP-A levels could reflect a higher density of CENP-A nucleosomes within the same region or, alternatively, could mean that CENP-A expands beyond its canonical domain, that is the CDR, with CENP-A nucleosomes being deposited in newly hypomethylated positions. To test this hypothesis, we performed a directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) experiment using ultralong nanopore sequencing to map CENP-A molecules on single chromatin fibers11 before and after demethylation. DiMeLo-seq involves antibody-mediated tethering of a sequence-nonspecific prokaryotic adenine methyltransferase to a DNA-binding or chromatin-binding protein in permeabilized cells and the subsequent methylation of nearby accessible DNA as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). The exogenous m6A will be read along with endogenous 5mC by nanopore sequencing of native DNA (Fig. 3a). We performed DiMeLo-seq from a cell population and a single clone of CHM13 cells, for which a T2T assembly is available34, harboring lentiviral expression of the DBDTET1 construct. DBDTET1 expression led to a strong decrease of 5mC both within and near CDRs, therefore removing the DNAme boundaries across all CDRs (Fig. 3b–e). After this TET1-mediated centromeric DNA demethylation, we observed an increase in m6A, reflecting an accumulation of CENP-A (Fig. 3b,f–h). This increase in m6A was detected on the same reads harboring 5mC loss at active α-sat HOR arrays and specifically within and around CDRs (Fig. 3b), although m6A levels remained higher inside CDRs. Similar results were observed in the CHM13 cells population, where ~70% of the cells efficiently expressed the DBDTET1 transgene (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). We saw no effect of DBDTET1 expression on m6A levels (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e) across random genomic positions, further validating the DiMeLo approach. Unlike the population (Extended Data Fig. 4f), the single clone presents a reduction of DNAme outside centromeres, possibly due to leaky DBDTET1 expression during the prolonged time in culture (Extended Data Fig. 4g).

Given that hypomethylation causes CENP-A levels to increase within and around the CDRs of all centromeres, we then investigated other possible changes to the centromeric chromatin following hypomethylation. To this end, we performed single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and DiMeLo-seq to map the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, known to flank CENP-A domains11 (Fig. 3i). Fiber-seq revealed enhanced chromatin accessibility at both CDRs and flanking regions following centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. 3j). On the other hand, DiMeLo-seq detected little to no change in H3K9me3 levels following loss of DNAme at the CDR and flanking boundaries (Fig. 3k), which was corroborated by immunofluorescence imaging in mitotically arrested cells (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Altogether, these data indicate that rapid hypomethylation of centromeric regions decreases chromatin compaction, but it does not decrease the level of the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3 on these short time scales.

We then assessed the short-term and long-term consequences of loss of centromeric DNAme for cell viability and chromosome segregation fidelity (Fig. 4a). Progressive centromeric DNAme reduction had a minor impact on the cell cycle, with a slight accumulation of cells in G2/M (Extended Data Fig. 5a), and a consistent negative effect on cell doubling and viability proportional to the kinetics of DNA demethylation in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 4b,c). These findings support a link between the level of centromeric DNAme and centromere function. Similar results were obtained in nontransformed, diploid RPE-1 cells expressing a DBDTET1 construct by lentiviral integration (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). DLD-1 cells expressing the catalytically dead construct had a similar capacity to form colonies compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4c), indicating that the binding of ectopic TET1 to the CENP-B boxes in and of itself does not account for the negative impact of the catalytically active TET1 on cell viability. The centromeric demethylation rate from different DLD-1 clones correlated with an increased frequency of micronuclei formation (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5e), suggesting that the speed of centromeric demethylation (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1g) negatively impacts centromere function. Time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence staining on a DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID revealed an increase in mitotic timing and chromosome mis-segregation in a DNAme-dependent manner (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5f), consistent with a loss of centromere function. Single-cell genome sequencing (scGS) further revealed that centromere-targeted acute demethylation causes a substantial increase in numerical and structural aneuploidies, with copy number alterations (CNA) occurring mostly near or at the centromeres (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5g,h), suggesting breaks at these regions. Loss of DNAme did not reveal any substantially distinct aneuploidy pattern (Fig. 4i), in agreement with the observed equal removal of DNAme at all centromeres. We conclude that both the total level of centromeric DNAme and the speed of DNA demethylation affect centromeric function.

Source data

Recently, it was revealed that centromeres are organized into a bipartite structure during mitosis, which is important for chromosome segregation fidelity35. To assess whether centromeric demethylation compromised this structure, we performed super-resolution expansion microscopy36 on the DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID (Fig. 4j). Although the largest fraction of centromeres conserves a bipartite structure in cells with demethylation, we observed an increase in the number of centromeres with noncanonical structures (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and with more than two CENP-A sub-domains (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). These results, along with the observed increase in mitotic intercentromeric distance (Fig. 2g; second CENP-A/CENP-C peak shift), demonstrate that centromeric demethylation alters the global organization of CENP-A chromatin.

Considering that one of the most prominent effects of centromeric hypomethylation is increased CENP-B binding, we tested whether removal of CENP-B could rescue the mitotic defects and cell lethality. To this end, we knocked out CENP-B by CRISPR–Cas9 in DLD-1 cells expressing high levels of the DBDTET1AID transgene to uncouple the effects of reduced DNAme from those related to increased CENP-B binding (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). Both the cell-growth defects and the frequency of micronuclei formation were reduced upon centromeric hypomethylation in CENP-BKO cells (Fig. 4m,n). Similarly, a mild ectopic overexpression of CENP-B—to mimic the levels observed following centromere hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. 6g) without affecting the normal centromeric methylation levels in DLD-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h)—led to a slight increase in micronuclei and few colonies formed compared to control and CENP-A overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 6i–l). This observed CENP-B-mediated toxicity could be due to an increased accumulation of DNA loops30 leading to impairment of replication fork progression causing chromosome ruptures37,38, as observed by the increase in CNA number that occurs within centromeric regions following hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. 5h). Accordingly, CENP-B overexpression caused a mild accumulation of the replication stress/DNA damage marker γH2A.X at centromeres during S-phase (Extended Data Fig. 6m). In addition, CENP-B knockout cells rescued with ectopic overexpressed full-length CENP-B (FL) had substantially higher centromeric breaks than cells rescued with a CENP-B mutant lacking the C-terminal dimerization domain (ΔC) that is required to form DNA loops30 (Extended Data Fig. 6n). Altogether, these results indicate that the accumulation of CENP-B at hypomethylated centromeric regions promotes genome instability and is partially responsible for the observed cell lethality following DNAme removal. This suggests that DNAme is an epigenetic layer that prevents excessive CENP-B binding to the centromeres.

Finally, we tested whether cells could adapt to gradual centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. 5a). To this end, we treated DLD-1 Flp-In cells with DOX for 16 days to induce mild DBD-TET1AID expression. After the removal of the construct by auxin addition for another 16 days, α-sat methylation levels increased only marginally, without reaching the original level (Fig. 5b). Accordingly, centromeric CENP-A and CENP-B levels remained substantially higher compared to untreated cells even after prolonged washout (Fig. 5c). Similar results were observed in RPE-1 cells that transiently expressed DBDTET1AID followed by ~30 days washout (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the new, stable epigenetic status of demethylated centromeres is translated into an equally stable increase of CENP-A and CENP-B levels. This suggests that, following slow and gradual hypomethylation, a process of cellular adaptation and remodeling of the centromeric protein landscape took place, ensuring cell survival in these new conditions. Accordingly, cells that were demethylated for either 8 or 16 days, then seeded in the absence of DOX, formed comparable numbers of colonies as fully methylated cells (Fig. 5d,e). In addition, cell viability did not further decrease in cells continuously treated for either 24 or 32 days with DOX compared to the 16-day treatment (Fig. 5d,e). These observations are in agreement with the stabilization in the percentage of cells with micronuclei at late hypomethylation times (Extended Data Fig. 5e).

To further test whether cells adapt to changes in DNAme, we generated a cellular model of ICF syndrome. This represents a unique physiological context in which centromeres have a naturally reduced level of methylation beginning in early development20,39. Patients affected by the disease have a poor life expectancy, mainly attributed to recurrent infections, but they can survive up to adulthood, proving that centromeric methylation is important but dispensable for cell survival40. To address the early consequences of the ICF mutations, we generated an ICF model in HTC116 cells by endogenously tagging both alleles of HELLS (Helicase Lymphoid-Specific, also known as LSH), which is mutated in ICF4 patients41, with mNeonGreen and an AID tag to mediate its rapid degradation (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). As expected from studies with patients, the degradation of HELLS causes DNA demethylation of specific genomic loci, including both pericentromeric (HSat2) and centromeric repeats as measured by nanopore sequencing, COBRA and pyrosequencing, but with extremely slow kinetics (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). As for the DBDTET1AID system, both CENP-A and CENP-B levels increased as a consequence of centromeric demethylation (Fig. 5j). CENP-B levels increased only slightly, in agreement with the less pronounced demethylation of CENP-B boxes compared to the DNMT1AID or DBDTET1AID cells (Fig. 5h). Similar results were observed in ICF3 (CDCA7 mutations) patient-derived fibroblasts (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 8e). In accordance with the hypothesis of cellular adaptation after slow centromeric DNA demethylation induced using TET1 targeting, degradation of HELLS has no effect on cell viability even at late time points, when the centromeres are demethylated to similar levels of the DLD-1 cells expressing the DBDTET1AID constructs (Fig. 5l and Extended Data Fig. 8f). Altogether, these results show that gradual and slow centromeric demethylation gives cells time to adapt to a new epigenetic landscape.

DNAme is a fundamental epigenetic mark that regulates key cellular processes, and which is often altered in disease. Centromeres notably lose methylation in cancer and in ICF syndrome, highlighting the importance of centromeric methylation for the normal physiology of the cell. Here we have demonstrated that DNAme acts as a boundary to help define the position of CENP-A chromatin, and the loss of centromeric DNAme induces centromere alterations, resulting in aneuploidy and increased cell lethality (Fig. 6).

Centromeric hypomethylation causes an increase in CENP-A and CENP-B binding to the centromeres and allows CENP-A to spread outside the CDR boundary. A rapid, short-term demethylation of the centromeres causes chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy and reduced viability. A slow, long-term demethylation leads to cellular adaptation to the new epigenetic status. Refer to the ‘Discussion' for the details. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Centromeres have a unique epigenetic landscape that sets these regions apart from the rest of the genome. While active α-sat HOR arrays are overall highly methylated, the CDR has been described in all active human centromeres12,17,18,19,41 and also in the eastern hoolock gibbon42, highlighting a functional link between DNAme and centromere position that transcends the human species. By using human cell models to induce targeted DNA demethylation, our data demonstrate that the hypomethylation of the CDR helps to define the localization of CENP-A. However, what determines the initial anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme remains unknown. Either CENP-A nucleosomes could favor the hypomethylation of the CDR or DNAme might prevent CENP-A loading. Neither possibility is mutually exclusive and could act together as a positive feedback loop. In the first scenario, the absence of lysines 14 and 18 in the CENP-A N-terminal tail may influence CDR establishment. These residues are present in H3 and are ubiquitinated by UHRF1, promoting DNMT1 recruitment independently of DNA replication43, a process crucial for maintaining DNAme in mid-to-late-replicating regions, like centromeres38,44. As a result, centromeric DNAme maintenance may be inefficient, causing passive methylation loss in CENP-A-rich regions. The anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme has also been recently observed at nonrepetitive neocentromere sites, suggesting that CENP-A loading in a given locus might prevent its DNAme45,46. For the second hypothesis, we can envision that DNAme disfavors the assembly of new CENP-A, possibly affecting nucleosome positioning and stability as observed for H3 at HSat2/HSat3 regions47, and/or the chromatin interaction of components involved in CENP-A deposition.

Loss of DNAme at centromeres caused an enhanced deposition of CENP-A at CDR and a mild spreading outside of the CDRs. This rapid change in CENP-A was observed only after 4 days of active demethylation in the CHM13 clone, which represents approximately two cell divisions. Our data suggest that the rapid loss of DNAme creates a permissive chromatin environment conducive to the incorporation of new CENP-A nucleosomes, not only within the CDR itself but also in its flanking regions. Previously and/or newly deposited CENP-A accumulates and spreads into these new chromatin environments, likely mediated by enhanced chromatin accessibility, which we observed by Fiber-seq. In this view, we cannot exclude that heterochromatin domains flanking CENP-A also have a role in controlling boundaries, as recently observed45, although, in our time scales, H3K9me3 levels barely changed. This indicates that loss of DNAme per se is sufficient to favor CENP-A spreading outside the CDR, likely replacing canonical histone H3. It is possible that with longer time in culture, the position of CENP-A could drift further away from the original CDR after DNA demethylation, as observed following long-term depletion of heterochromatin-forming enzymes45. Centromere drifting was already observed in nonrepetitive centromeres of chicken cells48 and equids49 and occurs at neocentromeres as observed in the human45,46 and in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii50.

The driving force that mediates CENP-A movement in hypomethylated centromeres remains to be elucidated. Here we speculate that, following the initial loss of DNAme boundaries, CENP-A nucleosomes redistribute during DNA replication and/or with transcription. This idea is supported by the particularly high number of replication origins found within the α-sats38 and by the fact that changes in DNAme are well known to be associated with deregulation in replication51 and transcription52. In addition, changes in DNAme have also been associated with changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization51,53, although only disrupting specific heterochromatin compartments27,54, that in turn could promote CENP-A deposition to certain locations, even favoring neocentromere formation55.

The changes of the overall architecture of centromeres following hypomethylation observed in our experiments are likely to be directly responsible for the observed chromosome mis-segregation. The increase in CENP-A sub-domains as a consequence of DNAme loss could promote incorrect kinetochore/microtubule attachment, possibly by incrementing the incidence of merotelic attachments35. It can also induce changes in the stiffness of the centromere/kinetochore interface, possibly through condensin56 or CENP-B30 misregulation. It is also possible that promiscuous CENP-A incorporation outside its predefined domain could weaken centromere/kinetochore function. In this view, if the expansion and loading of CENP-A is not balanced, it is possible that the local CENP-A concentration will not be sufficient to form stable higher-order chromatin structures compatible with kinetochore assembly, similarly to what was proposed for CENP-T57.

Our data highlight that the chromosome segregation defects observed in centromeric hypomethylated cells can be partially attributed to the demethylation-dependent increase of CENP-B. Here we show that while CENP-B is important for the normal topology of human centromeres, sustaining mechanical tension at the kinetochore/microtubules interface30, enhanced CENP-B binding interferes with DNA replication, possibly by forming an excessive amount of DNA loops, which in turn promote centromeric instability. This suggests that, at centromeric regions, the CENP-B-mediated fragility of centromeric DNA has a direct role in the observed aneuploidy and translocations of hypomethylated cells, possibly also fueled by the DNA damage repair activity of the TET1-mediated demethylation58. Therefore, we propose DNAme as an epigenetic layer that regulates centromere stability by controlling the binding of CENP-B to centromeric regions (Fig. 6). However, the fact that two CDRs have been detected on the Y chromosome59, the only human chromosome that lacks CENP-B boxes and CENP-B binding15, is a strong indication that the role of DNAme at the centromere is not limited to the regulation of CENP-B binding.

While rapid demethylation has severe effects on the cells, a slower and gradual demethylation of the centromeric DNA prompts a process of cellular adaptation as observed in the mild TET1-expressing cells and ICF4 (HELLS) cellular model. The molecular mechanisms by which cells adapt to low centromeric DNAme are still elusive, but this phenomenon can be related to the survival of ICF syndrome patients beyond early childhood despite having low centromeric methylation levels. Finally, our results offer mechanistic insights into the genesis of genome instability observed in certain cancers that display hypomethylation of repetitive regions, such as breast adenocarcinomas60, Wilms tumors61 and hepatocellular carcinomas62. While the association with genome instability was mainly established for pericentromeric repeats such as HSat2, it will be interesting to study how this imbalance in DNAme maintenance, including the dysregulation of TET enzymes, impacts specifically centromere functionality and stability, further promoting aneuploidy and chromosome rearrangements21,22,63.

Altogether, our findings provide unambiguous experimental evidence that DNAme influences CENP-A localization and is a major determinant in regulating centromere functionality. Our results provide a direct connection between the loss of DNAme at centromeres and the pathological chromosomal alterations also observed in ICF and cancer, highlighting the functional importance of DNAme for human centromere biology.

Primary ICF fibroblasts (ICF3)66 were cultured in DMEM–GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 15% FBS. DOX (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used at 100 ng ml−1 unless stated otherwise. IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used at 500 µm. 5Ph-IAA was a gift from M. Kanemaki (National Institute of Genetics, Japan) and now it is commercially available; it was dissolved in DMSO and used at 1 µm. For details on the generation of cell lines, see Supplementary Methods.

For immunofluorescence of cells in interphase, cells were grown to 60–80% confluence in 12 mm 1.5H glass coverslips (Marienfeld Superior). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min (fixation with extraction), washed thrice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (0.2 M glycine, 2.5% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100). Primary antibody incubation was performed for 2 h at room temperature in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, with mouse anti-CENP-A (1:500; clone 3-19, ENZO, ADI-KAM-CC006-E), rabbit anti-CENP-B (1 μg ml−1 polyclonal; Abcam, ab25734 or 0.539 μg ml−1; clone EPR24047-64; Abcam, ab259855), guinea pig anti-CENP-C (1:1,000; MBL, PD030), rabbit anti-GFP (1 μg ml−1; ChromoTek, PABG1), mouse anti-FLAG (4 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich, F3165), human anticentromere antibody (1:500; Antibodies Incorporated, 15-235-0001), rabbit anti-Geminin (1:500; clone E5Q9S; Cell Signaling Technology, 52508), rabbit monoclonal anti-CDT1 (1:500; clone EPR17891; Abcam, ab202067), rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (1 μg ml−1; Abcam, ab8898). Cells were washed thrice for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before incubation with species-specific secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at 1:500. Cells were washed thrice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before DAPI staining (1 μg ml−1 in PBS) for 10 min and subsequent mounting with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence of mitotic cells, cells were grown in 18-mm glass coverslips (Marienfeld) to ~60% confluence, blocked in mitosis for 3 h with 0.1 μg ml−1 colcemid (Roche) and subjected to a 7-min-long hypotonic shock in a 60% media, 40% water. The semidry coverslips were then centrifuged for 3 min at 320 rcf to spread the chromosomes and then promptly fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described for interphase cells.

Fixed imaging was performed on a DeltaVision Core system (Applied Precision) consisting of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a CoolSNAPHQ2 camera (Photometrics) and a 250-W xenon light source. Images ≤4 μm thick were captured in 0.2 μm z-sections at room temperature using a 100× Olympus UPlanSApo oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4), and then deconvolved and projected (3D maximum intensity) using DeltaVision's Softworx software. Alternatively, images were acquired on a Thunder Live Cell Imager (Leica) equipped with a Leica K8 CMOS Black-thinned camera, LED lamps and a DFT 51010 dichroic Cube using the LAS X (v1.4.7, Leica) software. Images were captured using a 100× HCX PL APO oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4) and processed with Instant Computational Clearing. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on a 35 mm FluoroDish (World Precision Instruments) with 0.17 mm-thick optical-quality glass bottom and fitted with a four-well silicone insert (Ibidi). Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min for 20 h using an inverted Eclipse Ti-E microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 (Yokogawa) spinning disk integrated in Metamorph software, and a four-laser bench (Gataca systems). Furthermore, ~45 μm z-stacks were acquired (z-step size = 3 μm) with a ×60 CFI Plan Apo VC oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The microscope has a motorized Nano z100 piezo stage (Mad City Lab), a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit) and an EMCCD camera (Evolve, Photometrics).

Fiji67 was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity in the deconvolved/Instant Computational Clearing images. For the quantification of fluorescence intensity at the centromeres of cells in interphase, an automatic analysis was performed by detecting the maximum intensity of CENP-C per nucleus, drawing 0.3 μm radius circles (region of interest (ROI)) and measuring the fluorescence of each channel on each ROI (custom Macro script, available upon request). For the quantification of fluorescence intensity in metaphase cells, circles of 0.84 μm radius were automatically drawn (custom Macro script, available upon request) and manually adjusted to encompass the whole centromere of each chromosome. The fluorescence intensity on each ROI was measured for each channel. For the line-scan quantification, the fluorescence intensity on each channel was measured along >3.5 μm long lines manually drawn across the centromeres. The data were manually phased to align the first peak of CENP-C with each centromere.

Genomic DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Between 0.5 and 2 µg of DNA (equalized quantity for parallel comparisons) was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The converted DNA was amplified by PCR using locus-specific primers64 (Supplementary Table 1). PCR reactions were performed with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 200 μm of each primer and 0.5 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR products were digested for 3 h with 10 U of the appropriate enzyme at its digestion temperature (Supplementary Table 1). An equal amount of PCR product was incubated alongside the digestions without enzyme (undigested control). The full digests were loaded in 3% agarose gels. Images were acquired using a ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) and band intensities were quantified using Fiji. The absolute methylation percentage is calculated from the ratio of the intensity of the methylated (digested) bands divided by the sum of all bands on the same lane (unmethylated + methylated). Bisulfite conversion affects C, 5fC and 5caC, all being considered as unmethylated DNA. Furthermore, 5mC and 5hmC are protected from the conversion and therefore considered methylated.

The enrichment of centromeric DNA (CenRICH) was performed as described before65. Nanopore long-read sequencing was performed after CenRICH. The DNA was treated with the Short Read Eliminator kit (cutoff < 25 kb, Circulomics SKUSS-100-101-01) to remove contamination from shorter DNA fragments. Libraries were prepared using the Library Preparation by Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)), quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and checked by capillary electrophoresis with a TapeStation 4150 system (Agilent). The sequencing was performed on a Spot-ON Flow Cell (R9.4.1) on a MinION Mk1B device. The raw nanopore data were basecalled using the ONT software Guppy version 4.0 with a high accuracy modified-bases model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5mc_hac.cfg), which at the time could only identify 5mC modification. The resulting data were then converted with the fast5mod utility (https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast5mod), to produce as output the sequences of all nanopore reads and their per-base likelihood of methylation, expressed as a value ranging from 0 to 255. Details of the reads processing can be found in Supplementary Methods.

DiMeLo-seq was performed as described in ref. 11 using a mouse anti-CENP-A antibody (ENZO, ADI-KAM-CC006-E) or a rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab176916), and replacing pA-Hia5 with a nanobody-Hia5 construct described in ref. 68. The CHM13 population was sequenced with R9 chemistry (Supplementary Methods). The CHM13 single clone and RPE-1 hypermethylation experiments were sequenced with R10 chemistry.

Fiber-seq was performed using the same protocol as DiMeLo-seq, with the following alterations: the primary antibody binding, protein A-Hia5 binding and activation steps were skipped. Instead, following nuclear isolation, nuclei were washed once in Tween-wash, then incubated with 1 µM free Hia5 and 800 µM S-adenosyl methionine in 100 µl activation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Supernatant was removed, and nuclei were resuspended in 1× PBS.

Ultrahigh molecular weight gDNA was extracted using the NEB Monarch UHMW DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue (NEB, T3010), with a modified protocol. Nuclei from DiMeLo-seq or Fiber-seq reactions were resuspended in 40 µl of 1× PBS. In a separate tube, 1.8 ml NEB Monarch HMW gDNA Tissue Lysis Buffer and 60 µl proteinase K were premixed, then used to gently resuspend nuclei by pipetting with a wide-bore tip. The sample was then incubated at 56 °C for 10 min. Next, 15 µl of RNase A was added, and the sample was returned to the thermomixer to incubate for ten more minutes at 56 °C, this time with agitation at 650–750 rpm. Two glass beads were added to the sample, and 2.5 ml of isopropanol was added. The tube was gently inverted by hand until a clear, jelly-like substance was seen forming around the glass beads. After 1 min incubation at room temperature, the isopropanol was aspirated from the tube, taking care to avoid the DNA. The beads were washed twice with 2 ml Wash Buffer and then were transferred to a bead retainer with a collection tube beneath, quickly spun to remove liquid and quickly transferred into 200 µl extraction elution buffer from the ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10). DNA was eluted overnight. Beads were transferred to a bead retainer with a clean Eppendorf tube beneath and spun at 1,000g for 1 min. The eluted DNA solution was then brought up to a final volume of 750 µl with extraction elution buffer, and quantified by Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q3328).

Samples were prepared for sequencing using an ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10) and sequenced using one PromethION flow cell per sample, achieving estimated N50 values of 50–90 kb and throughput of 33–60 Gb per sample for the CHM13 population, estimated N50 values of 124–127 kb and throughput of 36–44 Gb for the CHM13 single clone CENP-A DiMeLo-seq, estimated N50 values of 120–130 kb and throughput of 12 Gb for the CHM13 single clone H3K9me3 DiMeLo-seq, N50 values of 79–86 kb and throughput 37–78 Gb for the CHM13 single clone Fiber-seq. Adaptive sampling was performed on all R10 experiments to deplete noncentromeric reads by providing a bed file with the genome-wide complement of all α-satellite HOR arrays in chm13v2.0 plus a 100 kb buffer to either side.

Nanopore (R10) DiMeLo-seq raw data (.pod5 files) were aligned to the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome and basecalled using dorado (v.0.8.3) and DNA model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v5.0.0 with the following option specified: --modified-bases 6 mA 5mCG_5hmCG. Native barcoding runs had the following additional option specified: --kit-name SQK-NBD114-24. Aligned reads were filtered for primary alignment and sorted using samtools (v1.16.1). Barcoded runs were demultiplexed with dorado demux (v0.8.3).

Centromeric ‘core' reads were defined as those overlapping T2T-CHM13v2.0 CDR coordinates, as specified in ref. 29. Noncore reads (α-sat) were defined as those overlapping active α-satellite HOR, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium), but excluding CDR coordinates with a 10 kb buffer. Overlapping reads were isolated using samtools view (v1.16.1) and bedtools intersect (v2.30.0). Modification calls were dynamically thresholded using modkit call-mods (v0.1.13) with default parameters. Calls above the empirically determined threshold were clamped to certainty, while those below were discarded. Nucleosomes were called with the ft add-nucleosomes subcommand with default parameters using fibertools (v0.5.3). Chromatin accessibility was assessed by computing the proportion of methylation-sensitive patches over 50 bp using ft extract (fibertools v0.5.3) and custom Python scripts.

To assess methylation levels at CDRs, samtools view was used to filter for reads aligning to α-sat HOR sequences, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium). Reads were converted to fasta format with samtools fasta (v1.16.1), re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference genome33 using minimap2 (v2.26-r1175) with parameters specifying ONT sequencing (-x map-ont), then converted back to bam format and filtered for primary alignment with samtools view. MM/ML tags were repaired by broadcasting modification calls from the original BAM file with modkit repair (v0.1.13). Reads were visualized in IGV (v2.18.2 and v2.19.1). To assess off-target methylation, reads were converted to fastq format with samtools fastq (v1.16.1) with the -T MM, ML option specified to preserve modification calls and re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference with minimap2 with the following options specified: -ax map-ont --eqx -y --MD. Re-aligned reads were converted back to BAM format, filtered for primary alignment and sorted with samtools view and samtools sort, respectively. A bed file defining 10,000 random 1,000 bp intervals across the RPE-1 genome was generated with bedtools random (v2.30.0). Reads corresponding to these random intervals were isolated using bedtools intersect (v2.30.0), and the output was re-indexed with samtools index. To generate rolling profile plots, modkit pileup (v0.1.13) was used to count modifications at each reference position. The resulting bedGraph file was sorted using bedtools (v2.30.0), then converted to a bigWig file with bedGraphToBigWig (v2.10). The bigWig file was used to plot rolling mCpG/CpG values with a custom Python script.

To quantify the kinetics of 5mCpG-to-5hmCpG-to-CpG conversion, we analyzed a time-course dataset from DLD-1 cells generated using native barcoding nanopore sequencing (R10 chemistry). Sequencing and basecalling were performed with the same parameters described above for DiMeLo-seq. The data were processed using modkit pileup with the --cpg setting enabled, and a CpG modification threshold of 0.8 was applied to classify cytosines as methylated (mCpG), hydroxymethylated (hmCpG) or unmethylated. CpG sites were then filtered to retain only those present in reads aligning within CENP-B boxes and α-sat HORs.

Cells grown on 12 mm coverslip (1.5H) were permeabilized for 1 min with 0.1 M PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) with 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by fixation for 10 min with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) in PBS. Both pre-extraction and fixation solution were prewarmed to 37 °C. After fixation, coverslips were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA, 0.5% Triton in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted at 1:100 in 3% BSA were added to the coverslips and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Next, cells were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and incubated with DAPI (1 μg ml−1) and secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in 3% BSA 0.5% Triton in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed thrice with PBS and prepared for ExM.

Stained samples were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 Acryloyl-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A20770) in PBS for 2 h, washed thrice with PBS and incubated for 5 min in monomer solution (1× PBS, 2 M NaCl, 2.5% (wt/wt) acrylamide, 0.15% (wt/wt) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and 8.625% (wt/wt) sodium acrylate). Coverslips were placed on top of a drop of 90 μl of freshly prepared gelation solution (monomer solution supplemented with 0.2% (wt/wt) TEMED and 0.2% (wt/wt) APS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Gels were then incubated in digestion solution (8 U ml−1 proteinase K, 1× TAE, 0.5% TX-100, 0.8 M guanidine HCl) for 2 h at 37 °C and washed in PBS containing DAPI (1 μg ml−1). Full expansion was performed in a 10-cm plate by several washings of 30 min with excess volume of Milli-Q water (~4 to 4.5-fold expansion). Expanded samples were immobilized on 25 mm (1.5H) coverslips covered with 0.01% (wt/vol) poly-l-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich, P8920) and imaged on a Nikon Ti-E motorized microscope equipped with a Zyla 4.2Mpx sCMOS camera (Andor) and 100×1.35-NA objective lens (Nikon). Images were acquired as z-stacks at 0.3 μm intervals. Images from Nikon and Zeiss systems were deconvolved with Huygens Professional (v20.10) using up to 40 iterations of the Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm with theoretical PSF. The images were only adjusted in brightness and contrast on raw or deconvoluted data using the Fiji software. The number of subunits per single centromere was manually scored in z-stacks using Fiji.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol buffer and by sonication. The lysates were BCA-quantified and denatured at 95 °C in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE using TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris–buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG (0.8 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; clone 14C10; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-HELLS (0.75 μg ml−1; Proteintech), rabbit anti-CENP-B (1 μg ml−1 polyclonal; Abcam, ab25734) or mouse antivinculin (1:2,000; clone hVIN-1, Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired on a ChemiDoc imager (Bio-Rad) and analyzed on Image Lab software (v6.1; Bio-Rad).

Statistical analysis of all the graphs was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, www.graphpad.com). Details, including the value of cells and/or of centromeres measured, are reported in the figure legends. Full statistical test results can be found in Supplementary Table 5. The choice of the statistical method was made following the guidelines mentioned in ref. 69. Briefly, when possible GraphPad Prism's normality test was used to determine whether data followed a normal distribution. Depending on the data distribution, unpaired t test or Mann–Whitney test were used to compare two groups, ordinary one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test to compare more than two groups, Fisher's exact test to compare categorical data and one-sample t test to compare samples to a fixed value. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. All experiments were performed using several biological replicates. The number of biological replicates and of measurements for each experiment is indicated in the corresponding figure legend. Several steps were taken to ensure the reproducibility of experimental findings and key results were confirmed using complementary experimental approaches. With respect to data randomization, sample assignment to treatment and control groups, as well as data collection, were performed randomly without prior assessment of any cell culture characteristics. Generally, data collection and analysis were not performed blindly to the experimental conditions; however, quantitative image analyses, which are at the heart of all presented data, were independent of experimental conditions. No data were excluded from the analyses.

Antibody–drug conjugates have shown impressive clinical outcomes, particularly in metastatic breast cancer, but biomarkers to predict response and resistance remain unidentified. Here we report the results of ICARUS-BREAST01, a phase 2 study evaluating efficacy, safety and biomarkers of response and resistance to patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), in patients with HR+HER2− metastatic breast cancer, who previously progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and one line of chemotherapy. From May 2021 to June 2023, 99 patients were enrolled to receive HER3-DXd 5.6 mg kg−1 intravenously every 3 weeks. The study met its primary endpoint, showing an overall response rate of 53.5% (90% confidence interval [44.8–62.1%]). The most frequent adverse events were fatigue (83%), nausea (75%), diarrhea (53%) and alopecia (40%). Exploratory biomarker analysis of baseline tumor samples suggested preliminary associations between overall response rate and both HER3 spatial distribution and absence of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations, as well as between progression-free survival and HER3 expression, pending further validation. Analysis of on-treatment tumor samples showed that treatment efficacy seems to be associated with antibody–drug conjugate intratumoral distribution and interferon response. Overall, HER3-DXd showed promising activity and manageable tolerability in patients with HR+HER2− metastatic breast cancer who progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors. These findings highlight the need for larger trials to define HER3-DXd efficacy relative to other drugs, including antibody–drug conjugates (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04965766).

Breast cancer remains the most frequent cancer in women, with 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths worldwide in 2020 (refs. 1,2). There is therefore an urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents for this disease. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are complex compounds that combine a tumor-targeting antibody with a cytotoxic or bioactive payload via a chemical linker. The antibody binds to a membrane protein (target) that leads to the ADC internalization and ultimately to the payload release upon cleavage in the endosomal or lysosomal system3. However, as it has been estimated that only a small proportion of the drug reaches the tumor cells, the mechanism of action of ADCs is likely to extend beyond payload delivery, with additional mechanisms contributing to their efficacy, such as the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and immunogenic cell death4,5,6. Furthermore, it has been shown that both the bystander effect and the systemic release of the payload, related to either linker–drug instability or antibody–linker instability, can also determine ADC activity across tumor cells with a wide range of target expression7,8,9. ADCs have ushered in a new era in oncology, by providing unprecedented results in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has substantiallyimproved survival outcomes in patients with HER2 (also known as ERBB2)-expressing breast cancer (HER2+ and HER2-low)10,11. Similarly, sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in HER2-low and HER2-0 breast cancers12,13. However, there remains room to develop new ADCs and combination strategies to expand the range of targetable antigens, enhance safety profiles and further personalize ADC selection based on patient and tumor characteristics, ultimately broadening the therapeutic landscape.

Furthermore, reliable biomarkers for identifying patients most likely to obtain clinical benefit from ADC therapies remain an unmet medical need and the mechanisms of action of ADCs are still not well understood4,5. This is due to the limited number of clinical trials that systematically perform baseline (BL) and on-treatment tumor biopsies to understand ADC mechanisms of action and resistance. Such serial tumor biopsy was performed in the DAISY trial, which showed that response to T-DXd was associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) spatial distribution and the level of drug internalization was correlated with the expression of HER2 (ref. 14). Nevertheless, the impact of ADC intratumoral distribution on treatment outcome, along with the underlying mechanisms of action of most ADCs in patients, remains largely unknown. To address these gaps, we developed the ICARUS-BREAST01 study15. This academic, phase 2 trial aimed to evaluate clinical efficacy, safety and biomarkers of response and resistance to HER3-DXd, in patients with HR+HER2− advanced breast cancer, who previously progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy and received one line of chemotherapy. In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and HER2− advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors has significantly improved disease and survival outcomes and several effective therapeutic agents are available beyond progression, particularly PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy16,17,18,19. However, about 50% of patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors experience disease progression over the first 2 years of treatment and become rapidly eligible for standard chemotherapy, which is often associated with significant toxicity20,21. In breast cancer, HER3 expression plays a key role in resistance to PI3K–AKT–mTOR inhibitors, HER2-targeting therapies and endocrine therapy and is associated with poorer prognosis22. HER3-DXd is a new ADC composed of an anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase-I inhibitor by a cleavable peptide linker, which has shown preliminary signs of activity regardless of breast cancer subtype and HER3-expression in earlier phase 1 and 2 studies23.

From 27 May 2021 to 9 March 2023, we screened 164 patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) and HER2− (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ and in situ hybridization (ISH) negative, or IHC 1+ or IHC 0+), unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who had progressed on previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy and received one line of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. A total of 99 patients were enrolled to receive HER3-DXd 5.6 mg kg−1 intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity (Fig. 1). The study primary endpoint was the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by a local investigator, whereas secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS) and safety. To explore biomarkers of response or resistance to HER3-DXd, we collected one frozen and three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples at BL, on-treatment (corresponding with cycle 1 day 3 (C1D3), cycle 1 day 19 (C1D19) or cycle 2 day 3 (C2D3)) and at end of treatment, along with whole-blood and serum samples. The main demographic and clinical characteristics of patients at study entry are reported in Table 1. Overall, 39.4% of patients had IHC HER2-0 breast cancer, as centrally assessed on the tumor biopsy at study entry. The median number of systemic therapies for advanced breast cancer was two (range one to four). All patients, with the exception of one, had progressed on previous CDK4/6 inhibitor with a median treatment duration of 13.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 6.5–19.7 months). At data cut-off, 16 April 2024, 19 patients were still on treatment and the median number of treatment cycles was 11.0 (IQR 6–18.0), with disease progression being the primary reason for treatment discontinuation in most patients (64.6%), as reported in Supplementary Table 1.

The confirmed ORR by the local investigator was 53.5% (90% confidence interval (CI) [44.8–62.1%]), with 2 patients having obtained complete response (CR) and 51 partial response (PR). Overall, 37 patients had stable disease (SD), with a clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CR, PR or SD ≥ 6 months) of 62.6% (95% CI [52.3–72.1%]) (Fig. 2a).

The response was determined by investigator assessment according to RECIST v.1.1 and required confirmation after the first observed response at least 4 weeks later. The Clopper–Pearson (exact) method was used for the CIs. b, Kaplan–Meier estimates of PFS as assessed by a local investigator (median 9.2 months (95% CI [8.0–12.8 months]). c, Kaplan–Meier estimates of duration of response as assessed by a local investigator (median 9.3 months (95% CI 8.2 months–N/A)). aPatients who developed new lesions; bClopper–Pearson (exact) method used for the 90% CI; ctwo patients not evaluable (NE) for ORR: one patient had only one tumor assessment with PR and then treatment discontinued due to clinical progression and a second patient had no evaluable global response-of-target lesions.

With a median duration of the study follow-up of 15.3 months (95% CI [13.0–17.2 months]), 62 patients experienced disease progression or death. The median PFS as assessed by the local investigator was 9.2 months (95% CI [8.0–12.8 months]) (Fig. 2b). The median DoR was 9.3 (95% CI [8.15–not available (N/A)) months] (Fig. 2c). OS was not mature at the time of data cut-off.

We also performed a post-hoc analysis of ORR and PFS according to HER2 expression as centrally assessed on the tumor biopsy at BL and we found an ORR of 60% (95% CI [40.6–77.3%]) in the HER2-low (1+, 2+) and of 48.7% (95% CI 32.4–65.2%) in the HER2-0 patient populations. Median PFS was 12.8 (95% CI [8.11–N/A]) months and 9.1 (95% CI 6.7–N/A) months in HER2-low and HER2-0, respectively (Supplementary Table 2a,b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Given the high ORR observed by the local investigator assessment, the study was also amended in November 2024 to include a retrospective independent central review of RECIST, which confirmed an ORR of 55.6% (95% CI [45.2–65.5%]).

The median duration of treatment at data cut-off was 251.0 d (range 144.5–402.0 d). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 97 patients (98.0%) and the rate of grade ≥3 TRAEs was 50.1%. Serious TRAEs were reported in 18.2% of patients. TRAEs led to dose reductions in 20 patients (20.2%), dose interruptions in 22 patients (22.2%) and HER3-DXd discontinuation in 11 patients (11.1%). No fatal TRAEs were reported, although one patient died while on treatment due to a massive pleural effusion not related to HER3-DXd. The most frequent TRAEs of any grade (>30% of patients) were: fatigue (83%), nausea (75%), diarrhea (53%) and alopecia (40%). Any grade treatment-related thrombocytopenia was reported in six patients, of whom two had a grade 3 and three a grade 4. The most common TRAEs and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are reported in Table 2. Note that the study protocol recommended systemic prophylaxis with a serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist in all patients and the use of an additional antiemetic as indicated per the investigator's discretion. AEs of special interest (AESIs) were reported in 15 patients: eye disorders of any grade occurred in 10 patients and were mostly low grade (grade 1: 5 patients; grade 2: 3 patients; grade 3: 2 patients). Throughout the conduction of the study, 10 patients (10.1%) experienced interstitial lung disease (ILD) or suspicion of ILD attributed to the study treatment by the local investigator, of which 7 were grade 1 and 3 grade 2. Eight patients had adjudicated HER3-DXd-related ILD, as determined by an independent ILD adjudication committee. Most cases (n = 6) were classified as grade 1, with one leading to study drug discontinuation at the investigator's decision and two were grade 2, both resulting in treatment discontinuation as per protocol. Treatment was required in four of the grade 1 cases and in both grade 2 cases. Among the six patients with available data on ILD duration, two cases resolved within approximately 3 weeks, two cases within 1 month and two cases required around 6 months for resolution.

One of the primary objectives of the exploratory analysis of the ICARUS-BREAST01 study was to identify predictors of treatment response using tumor samples collected at BL. We defined the patients as responders if they achieved a confirmed CR or PR and as nonresponders if their best response was SD or progressive disease (PD). We first investigated whether the target expression and spatial distribution were associated with treatment outcome (ORR or PFS). Therefore, we evaluated membrane HER3 expression, on FFPE tumor samples at BL (n = 72), as measured by overall membrane positivity at ×10 magnification and membrane H-score. Although the HER3-expression prescreening was removed by amendment on 15 April 2022, after the inclusion of the first 29 patients, most patients (n = 49 of 72 (68%)) had ≥75% of HER3-membrane positivity and only 22% (n = 16 of 72) had <25%, with a median of 82.5 (range 0–100) (Table 1). We found a slightly greater ORR in patients with HER3-membrane positivity >25%, with the ORR 43.8% (95% CI [19.8–70.1%]) in the group with <25% (n = 16), 85.7% (95% CI [42.1–99.6%]) in the group with 25–75% (n = 7) and 51.0% (95% CI [36.3–65.6%]) in the group with >75% (n = 49). Conversely, we did not find a meaningful difference in the ORR across the HER3-membrane expression as measured by the H-score (Extended Data Fig. 1). Analysis of PFS according to HER3-membrane expression showed a trend toward a slightly longer PFS in patients with HER3-membrane positivity >75% (median(m)PFS 10.9 months (95% CI [8.2–17.7 months]) or with HER3-membrane H-score >200 (mPFS 10.9 months (95% CI [8.51 months–N/A]) compared with those with the lowest HER3-membrane scoring (mPFS 8.1 months (95% CI [4.4 months–N/A]) in HER3-membrane positivity <25%; mPFS 6.7 (95% CI [5.3 months–N/A]) in HER3-membrane H-score 0–100) (Extended Data Fig. 1). Developing these results further, we performed a post-hoc analysis of ORR and PFS using the HER3-membrane IHC scoring 1+, 2+ and 3+ as previously reported in ref. 23 and selected the top IHC algorithms and cutoffs (percentage of tumor cells (%TC) with membrane 2+ and 3+ ≥50%, %TC membrane 1+, 2+ and 3+ ≥75%). Consistent with earlier analysis, we did not find a statistically significant association between ORR and HER3-membrane positivity; however, we observed a trend for longer PFS in patients with %TC membrane 2+ and 3+ ≥50% versus <50% (9.7 months (95% CI [8.1–15.3] months) versus 6.8 months (95% CI [5.3 months–N/A]; P = 0.126)) and in those with %TC membrane 1+, 2+ and 3+ ≥75% versus <75% (10.9 months (95% CI [8.1–17.6 months]) versus 8.1 months (95% CI [6.7 months–N/A]); P = 0.136; Fig. 3a,b). Nevertheless, the correlative analysis of HER3 versus efficacy should be interpreted with caution, because the limited sample size results in wide CIs. We also analyzed the correlation between HER2 and HER3 expression by IHC to determine whether their expression is associated. We did not observe any clear correlation between HER3 and HER2 expression. Indeed, tumors with ≥50% HER3+ membrane staining were found across both HER2-0 and HER2-low groups (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Digitized DAB-stained slides were overlapped with digitized H&E-stained slides. These regions were then segmented into eight different clusters. Box plots show the proportion of each cluster in 63 evaluable patients, according to treatment response: responders (CR, PR) and nonresponders (SD, PD). The box center lines, box ranges, whiskers and dots indicate the medians, quartiles, 1.5× the IQR and outliers, respectively. Our analysis revealed an association between treatment response and the percentage of cluster 0 (P = 0.040), with an odds ratio of 1.527 95% CI [1.020–2.287]. For all these analyses, using R v.4.1.2, we applied Dirichlet's regression to identify which clusters were significantly associated with the objective response to treatment (statistical significance was assessed using Wald's test based on Dirichlet-distributed parameters; the reported P values were unadjusted for multiple comparisons). d, H&E-stained slide showing the composition of cluster 0, characterized by a moderate number of TCs, surrounded by connective areas, with a few immune cells and no necrotic areas. e, Proportion of the different cell phenotypes (epithelial, connective, inflammatory, necrotic and neoplastic areas) across the identified clusters (n = 63). The box center lines, box ranges, whiskers and dots indicate the medians, quartiles, 1.5× the IQR and outliers, respectively.

We further explored whether the spatial distribution of HER3+ cells was associated with response to the treatment. After the pathologist's review, we analyzed 69 IHC or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. First, we performed machine learning analysis on digitized, annotated, DAB-stained slides (membrane HER3 expression) by using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, as previously done in the DAISY trial14. Using two different models to extract patch representations, we did not find any significant association between the identified clusters and response to HER3-DXd. Afterwards, to map the distribution of HER3+ cells relative to neighboring cells, we superimposed digitized, whole DAB-stained slides with digitized H&E-stained slides from the same sample, capturing the architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (n = 63, because 6 samples were excluded as a result of suboptimal registration quality control). We developed a new pipeline to identify epithelial, connective, inflammatory and necrotic areas, together with HER3+ and HER3− areas (Methods). These regions were then segmented into eight different clusters, the proportion of which was compared between responders and nonresponders. Our analysis revealed an association between treatment response and the percentage of cluster 0 (odds ratio (OR) 1.527; 95% CI [1.020–2.287]; P = 0.040; Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5). According to the pathologist's review, cluster 0 was characterized by isles containing a moderate number of HER3+ cells, surrounded by connective areas enriched with blood vessels, with few immune cells and no necrotic areas (Fig. 3d,e). To explore whether cluster 0 was associated with better tumor vascularization, we used ERG (ETS-related gene) IHC staining to selectively identify endothelial cells. We found a significant positive association between cluster 0 and number of ERG+ cells (P = 0.0275; Supplementary Fig. 3); however, this association did not remain significant after multiple testing correction and should be interpreted with caution. We further evaluated the proportion of cluster 0 in tumor samples collected at progression and we did not find any statistically significant difference in the proportion of cluster 0 at baseline and that at progression; however, these results should be interpreted with caution because only 11 tumor samples were analyzable at disease progression (Supplementary Fig. 4). By training the clustering algorithm without incorporating DAB information, we also found that cluster 0* and cluster 1* were associated with response to the treatment (OR 1.48 and 1.58 and P = 0.029 and 0.014, respectively). Although cluster 0* was composed of only connective tissue and so lacked biological rationale, cluster 1* seemed to share similar properties with the previously identified cluster 0, featuring TCs surrounded by connective areas, few immune cells and no necrotic areas (Supplementary Fig. 6). Next, we analyzed whether genomic alterations at BL were associated with response to HER3-DXd. We carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) on frozen tumor biopsies at BL (n = 43). Nonsynonymous point mutations, insertions or deletions (indels), homozygous deletions, loss of heterozygosity and low, medium and high-level amplifications were assessed. A set of 73 genes of interest was selected before the start of the project (Methods). Analyses of WES were focused on these genes (Supplementary Table 3). TP53 alterations were observed in 53.8% (14 of 26) and 29.4% (5 of 17) and PIK3CA alterations in 38.5% (10 of 26) and 17.6% (3 of 17) of responders and nonresponders, respectively.

It is interesting that we found a higher proportion of ESR1 mutations in nonresponders 52.9% (9 of 17) compared with responders 23.1% (6 of 26), with all 4 patients with PD as best response presenting ESR1 alterations at baseline. ERBB3 mutations were detected in 11.5% (3 of 26) of responders versus 5.9% (1 of 17) of nonresponders, with 2 of 3 mutations found in responders that were ranked as likely pathogenic according to OncoKB. Finally, we found a higher frequency of FGFR1 amplifications (5 high, 3 medium and 1 low level) in responders, 34.6% (9 of 26), including the 2 patients with a confirmed and prolonged CR, compared with nonresponders, 23.5% (4 of 17) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). WES analysis according to the CBR, as defined by CR, PR or SD ≥ 6 months confirmed the same results (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also performed the analysis of 21 mutational signatures with activity in at least 2% of breast cancer samples, showing an association between APOBEC-related SBS2 and treatment response (Supplementary Fig. 7). Next we investigated the association between gene expression at BL and PFS, by performing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 56 BL frozen tumor biopsies. The adaptive lasso model procedure led a five-gene model for prediction of PFS, which contained RAB40AL, MAGEB17 and MKRN7P (P < 0.05). Note that RAB4 proteins are localized in early endosomes and regulate early endosomal recycling, determining a fast transport of internalized receptors from the endosomes back to the plasma membrane24. Therefore, the association of higher expression of RAB4 with poor prognosis suggests that higher recycling of internalized HER3-DXd back to the plasma membrane is detrimental to its efficacy (Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally, given the higher proportion of ESR1mut (mutated) in nonresponders, we tried to better characterize the ESR1mut and ESR1wt (wild-type) group. We found that the median number of genomic alterations along with tumor mutational burden were similar in the two groups (Supplementary Table 4). We also compared the proportion of luminal tumors in the ESR1mut and ESR1wt groups, by performing PAM50-intrinsic subtyping on available bulk RNA-seq data (n = 14 ESR1mut, n = 23 ESR1wt) and we did not find any difference between the two groups (χ2 test, P = 0.57) (Supplementary Table 4). Nevertheless, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Hallmark gene sets showed activation of estrogen pathways in ESR1mut compared with ESR1wt tumors (Supplementary Fig. 9).

We also aimed to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action of HER3-DXd and determine whether distinct mechanisms of action or pharmacodynamic events could explain treatment response. For this purpose, we analyzed tumor samples collected at BL and during treatment by using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and bulk RNA-seq to explore, first, the intratumoral distribution and the effects of HER3-DXd on TCs and its role in gene expression modulation and, second, the effects of HER3-DXd on the TME. By IMC, a multiple protein analytical method that relies on metal-tagged antibodies to simultaneously detect multiple proteins and provides spatial analysis, we detected the expression of 23 proteins (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10) at subcellular resolution (Hyperion) on FFPE tumor samples. We profiled 61 FFPE samples at BL and 57 on-treatement (on-T) (C1D3, C1D19 or C2D3), of which 39 were matched pairs. The heatmap of TC and immune cell density at baseline is shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. First, we explored the intracellular distribution of HER3-DXd in TCs and its association with treatment outcome, by using an anti-DXd antibody that selectively binds the DXd moiety linked to the antibody. The HER3-DXd expression was not found at BL, whereas a high proportion of both pan-keratin-positive (PANK+) and pan-keratin-negative (PANK−) cells were positive for intact-DXd in on-T tumor biopsies, with the highest values at C1D3 (Fig. 4a). We quantified HER3-DXd+ cells across cell phenotypes (PANK+, PANK−, PANK+HER3+ and PANK+HER3−) at C1D3 and found a similar proportion of HER3-DXd+ cells among PANK+ (median: 10.4 (IQR 1.3–22.9)) and PANK− (median 10.2 (IQR 1.7–37.2)) cells, also with a comparable proportion of HER3-DXd+ cells among the PANK+HER3+ (median 11.2 (IQR 0.9–26.5)) and the PANK+HER3− (median 9.6 (IQR 1.3–24.6)) cells (Supplementary Table 6). Among the HER3-DXd+ cells, the most prevalent phenotypes were PANK− and PANK+HER3− (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Nevertheless, the interpretation of these data should take into account that the proportion of HER3+ cells significantly reduced at C1D3 compared with BL (see below). As analyzable samples at C1D3 (n = 20) were all from patients who achieved CR, PR or SD, we then looked at the mean tumor shrinkage according to the proportion of PANK+HER3-DXd+ cells. We defined HER3-DXd positivity as having ≥5% positive cells. This threshold was chosen because, at BL (before any drug exposure), the maximum percentage of HER3-DXd+ cells observed was 3.75%, likely due to background noise. Even with the limitation of the small sample size, we found that mean tumor shrinkage was −56.2% (s.d. = 23.4%) and −29.4% (s.d. = 20.4%) in patients with PANK+HER3-DXd+ cells ≥5% (n = 11) and PANK+HER3-DXd+ cells <5% (n = 9) at cycle 1 day 3 (Mann–Whitney U-test, U = 17, P = 0.013), respectively (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 12). Similarly, the mean tumor shrinkage was −55.0% (s.d. = 24.3%) and −33.3% (s.d. = 22.8%) in patients with HER3-DXd+ cells above and below the median staining (U = 25, P = 0.063) (Supplementary Fig. 13). Although HER3-DXd positivity does not necessarily mean that an ADC has been internalized, we sought to evaluate whether the HER3-DXd positivity was associated with alterations or different expression of genes involved in the endocytosis pathway (Clathrin, Dynamin2, Rab, Numb, Caveolin, LAMP1 and CD71). The genomic profile at BL was available for 7 of 11 patients with HER3-DXd+ cells ≥5% (HER3-DXd+ tumor) and 4 of 9 patients with HER3-DXd+ cells <5% (HER3-DXd− tumor). We found that three of seven HER3-DXd+ tumors harbored a genomic alteration in genes involved in endocytosis, of which one had a stop mutation in the LAMP1 gene, one a synonymous mutation in LAMP1 and one a synonymous mutation in RAB11, although we did not find any genomic alteration in these genes in the HER3-DXd− tumors. Transcriptomic profile at BL was available for 8 of 11 patients with HER3-DXd+ tumors and 5 of 9 with HER3-DXd− ones. Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data between the two groups did not reveal any significant difference of the expression of genes related to endocytosis (adjusted P or Padj > 0.05). As a specific tumor architecture potentially favoring the ADC intratumoral distribution (cluster 0) appeared to be linked to treatment response, we also analyzed the proportion of cluster 0 at BL in tumors with HER3-DXd positivity ≥5% and <5%, and did not find any statistically significant association (Supplementary Fig. 14).

The boxes represent the IQR and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within each group. c, Left: image of a tumor with HER3-DXd staining ≥5% of TCs at C1D3: intact-DXd+ cells 21% of the PANK+ cells.

PANK+ cells are shown in red and Intact-DXd+ cells in blue; similar staining patterns were observed across all analyzed samples (n = 20). d,e, Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in paired on-T and BL tumor samples in responders (d) and nonresponders (e). The P values shown are from two-sided tests and were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. f, Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in on-treatment samples of HER3-DXd+ (≥5% TCs, n = 5) and HER3-DXd− (<5% TCs, n = 7) tumors. The P values shown are from two-sided tests and were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Next, we characterized the dynamics of HER3+ tumor cells after HER3-DXd administration and their association with response. We observed that HER3 expression dramatically decreased after HER3-DXd administration, with a greater decrease in responders (Student's t-test, P = 0.011; Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Then, to determine the effect of the ADCs on TCs, we analyzed on-T gene expression changes to identify which genes were modulated by HER3-DXd. We carried out bulk RNA-seq on 22 pairs of BL and on-T frozen tumor biopsies, collected 3 d or 19 d after cycle 1 or 3 d after cycle 2, selected to have tumor cellularity ≥30%. We conducted differential gene expression (DGE) analyses looking at the fold-change of gene expression of matched on-T BL samples in the overall population (n = 22) and, then, separately in responders (confirmed CR and PR; n = 14) and nonresponders (SD, PD and not evaluable; n = 8). A higher proportion of up- and downregulated genes was observed in responders (n = 410 genes) compared with nonresponders (n = 5 genes) after one or two doses of HER3-DXd (Padj ≤ 0.05; Fig. 4d,e). As most of the downregulated genes could be related to decreased cell proliferation, we further focused on upregulated genes to explore genes and pathways modulated by HER3-DXd. The top ten upregulated genes in responders were EDA2R, IFI44L, RTP4, GBP1P1, IFIT1, IFIT2, AIM2, SELL, CLEC4E and IFIT3, with log2(fold-change) between 0.88 and 0.68 (Padj ≤ 0.05). Most of these genes are involved in the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. On consideration of the results of the IMC analysis showing an association between intratumoral detection of HER3-DXd and tumor shrinkage, we carried out DGE analyses of on-T samples of HER3-DXd+ (HER3-DXd+ cells ≥5%, n = 5) and HER3-DXd− tumors (HER3-DXd+ cells <5%, n = 7). We observed a larger number of upregulated genes in HER3-DXd+ compared with HER3-DXd− tumors (Padj ≤ 0.05; Fig. 4f). We further explored whether genes modulated by the drug administration clustered in specific pathways, by running a GSEA. In the overall population, using the gene set Hallmarks, we observed an activation of pathways involved in immune response, particularly IFNα and IFNγ (gene ratio 0.45) and complement signaling (gene ratio 0.3; Padj ≤ 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 4a). Likewise, activation of pathways of immune response, notably IFNα and IFNγ, and complement signaling was found in responders (Padj ≤ 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 4b), whereas, in nonresponders, no gene set was modulated by treatment exposure (Padj > 0.05). We also compared the pathways modulated on treatment between responders and nonresponders and confirmed that activation of immune-related pathways was enriched in responders compared with nonresponders (Padj ≤ 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 4c). However, we did not find any upregulation of IFN pathways in on-T HER3-DXd+ compared with HER3-DXd− tumors (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Finally, among the 54 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) gene sets modulated by the treatment, we could identify that the ‘endocytosis' gene set was suppressed on treatment (gene ratio 0.36; Padj ≤ 0.05), a finding possibly related to an adaptation of cancer cells to therapy (Supplementary Fig. 15). We also performed GSEA using the gene set Hallmarks according to CBR and, consistent with the previous results, we found activation of immune-related pathways in patients with CBR (n = 16) compared with those without (n = 6; Padj ≤ 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 16).

Given the IFN response observed in sensitive patients, we evaluated PFS in patients with upregulation of the IFNα or IFNγ pathway versus those presenting a stable or downregulated pathway. We observed a trend toward a longer PFS in patients with either α (P = 0.26) or γ (P = 0.04) pathway activation (Extended Data Fig. 5).

As the second step in determining the mechanism of action of T-DXd, we evaluated its impact on the TME. To this end, we investigated how HER3-DXd modulated the immune cell composition in the tumor and TME. Despite the activation of IFNα and IFNγ pathways being associated with a better treatment outcome (ORR, CBR or PFS), we found both increases and decreases of T cells with no clear differences between responders and nonresponders. However, the most significant increase in CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD8+CD107a+ cell densities was seen in two responders, whereas the greatest increase in CD3+CD8+GzmB+ cell density occurred in one of these two patients (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d and Supplementary Table 7). We also observed that CD68+ cell density was decreased in the TME after one or two doses of HER3-DXd, without any difference between responders and nonresponders (Extended Data Fig. 6e). We finally performed immune deconvolution analysis using CIBERSORTx_ABSOLUTE on paired on-T versus BL tumor samples (n = 22) to assess changes in immune cell subpopulations. However, we did not observe any significant increase or decrease in specific immune cell subsets in responders (n = 14) compared with nonresponders (n = 8), suggesting that HER3-DXd did not induce major shifts in the immune composition of the TME (Supplementary Fig. 17).

In the ICARUS-BREAST01 study, HER3-DXd showed considerable efficacy in patients with HR+HER2− advanced breast cancer who had previously progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and one line of chemotherapy. Most of the patients achieved a confirmed treatment response (ORR 53.5%) and experienced prolonged disease control. In addition, HER3-DXd showed a manageable safety profile, with a low rate of grade ≥3 TRAEs and TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Notably, the rate of ILD adjudicated as drug related was low (8.1%), most being grade 1 and thus allowing treatment recovery at ILD resolution, except in three cases. T-DXd was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with inoperable or metastatic HR+HER2-low breast cancer after at least one line of chemotherapy and, more recently, also for patients with HR+HER2-low or HER2-ultralow breast cancer that has progressed after at least one endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting, based on the remarkable results of the DESTINY-Breast04 and DESTINY-Breast06 trials10,25. Overall, the clinical results of the ICARUS-BREAST01 study appear to be comparable to those observed with T-DXd in the DESTINY-Breast04 study, although the latest included a more pretreated population10. For these patients, T-DXd is not an option if HER2 expression is <1% (about 20% of HER2-nonoverexpressing tumors)25,26 and the efficacy of T-DXd in the HER2-ultralow setting was based on exploratory analyses of the DESTINY-Breast06 study. Therefore, the ICARUS-BREAST01 findings emphasize the need for a large phase 3 study in patients with HR+HER2− breast cancer, who can no longer benefit from endocrine therapy, to determine the efficacy of HER3-DXd in HER2-null tumors and also in HER2-low or HER2-ultralow breast cancers, in which it could be a valuable alternative to T-DXd, considering some differences in the safety profile. This study would also provide an opportunity to further validate the preliminary findings, suggesting a positive trend between HER3-enriched populations and PFS, which helps to refine patient selection strategies. Furthermore, although the ICARUS-BREAST01 study excluded patients previously treated with ADCs, because they were designed before the results of the pivotal trials of DESTINY-Breast04, TROPICS-02 and DESTINY-Breast06 (refs. 10,12,25), we recognize the importance of investigating the activity of HER3-DXd after previous ADCs. Previous clinical data showed that ADC resistance may sometimes derive from reduced target expression, while preserving payload sensitivity27,28,29. Leveraging these preclinical and clinical data, we designed the ICARUS-BREAST02 study (NCT06298084), which is currently evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of HER-DXd either as a single agent or in combination with olaparib in patients who have progressed on previous treatment with T-DXd.

An essential part of our study was to explore biomarkers of response to HER3-DXd by analyzing tumor samples at BL and understand mechanisms of action of the drug, by analyzing the effect of HER3-DXd on the tumor and the TME of samples collected on-T. To identify potential predictors of response, we first explored the role of the target expression and spatial distribution in predicting treatment outcome. Although there was no association between ORR and HER3 expression, we found a trend toward a longer PFS in patients with higher HER3 expression. This trend was consistently observed across all three scoring methods. Therefore, although this association did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the small sample size, and does not allow for the definition of a clear HER3 expression threshold, it remains a promising finding that warrants further investigation. It is interesting that we did not find a strong association between HER2 and HER3 expression, because there are tumors with high HER3 expression that have HER2-0 or HER2-low expression, reinforcing the interest in further determining the efficacy of HER3-DXd in both settings. Furthermore, using machine learning analysis on IHC and H&E slides, we found that the distribution of HER3+ TCs within tumor tissue may play a role in determining a better ADC penetration and distribution. Indeed, tumors with a higher proportion of cluster 0, and thus containing a moderate number of HER3+ cells and being surrounded by connective tissue areas and no necrotic areas, had a higher likelihood of responding to the treatment. It is important to note that the association between cluster 0 and treatment outcome may not be driven solely by the spatial distribution of HER3+ cells relative to neighboring cells. Instead, it could be the result of a specific tumor architecture favoring the ADC intratumoral distribution, independent of HER3 expression. Indeed, when HER3 staining was excluded from the clustering algorithm, two response-associated clusters were identified, of which one (1*) shared features with cluster 0, including TCs surrounded by connective tissue, sparse immune cells and absence of necrotic areas, and the other (0*) containing only connective tissue, interpreted as not biologically relevant. The composition of the 0* clusters and lack of significance of similar clusters in the initial analysis led us to interpret it as a compositional artifact, in contrast to clusters 0 and 1* sharing similar biological characteristics with a more straightforward interpretation. As Dirichlet-regression models have relative, rather than absolute, cluster proportions, significant clusters can also emerge due to shifts in other clusters, not necessarily reflecting direct association with treatment response. Given the limited sample size and novelty of the mechanisms, these analyses remain nevertheless exploratory and hypothesis generating, requiring validation in independent cohorts to confirm the relevance of HER3 spatial mapping.

We also investigated whether driver mutations in breast cancer and genomic alterations of interest in DXd activity (for example, TOP1mut) could be associated with the response to treatment. We did not find any association between response to HER3-DXd and known breast cancer driver mutations or alterations in genes involved in HER3-DXd activity, except for ERBB3mut which was more frequent in responders (11.5%) versus nonresponders (5.9%). Although most ERBB3mut changes occur in the extracellular domain, previous preclinical data did not show differences in HER3-DXd activity across cell lines with or without ERBB3mut30. Furthermore, we observed that tumors harboring ESR1mut were more likely to be resistant to HER3-DXd (52.9% in nonresponders and 23.1% in responders). Although ESR1mut tumors are resistant to aromatase inhibitors and tend to be more heavily pretreated, we did not find any significant difference in the clinical characteristics of patients with ESR1mut tumors and those with ESR1wt tumors, such as the number of previous systemic therapies and time from initial diagnosis to study entry. Likewise, the median number of genomic alterations along with tumor mutational burden were similar in the two groups. However, given the small sample size, these data should be interpreted with caution. Previous preclinical studies demonstrated a bidirectional crosstalk between the ER signaling pathway and the HER3 or HER2 pathway in ER+ breast cancer31. For instance, it has been shown that exposure to tamoxifen or fulvestrant, which inhibits ER signaling, also increases epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2 and HER3 expression32,33. Therefore, it is possible that, in ESR1mut tumors, the constitutive activation of the ER pathway, as we found in our cohort, can be associated with downregulation of HER3. Furthermore, although no differences in the PAM50-subtype assignment were observed between ESR1mut and ESR1wt tumors in our cohort, it is likely that ESR1mut tumors exhibit more luminal characteristics which may reduce the response to HER3-DXd. This aligns with the observed higher prevalence of TP53 mutations in responders and previous clinical findings, because these mutations are associated with more proliferative and chemosensitive tumor profiles34.

The exploratory analysis of the ICARUS-BREAST01 study also aimed to decipher the key mechanisms of action of HER3-DXd and particularly its interaction with the tumor and the TME. With this objective, we analyzed on-treatment tumor samples by IMC and bulk RNA-seq. IMC analysis revealed that tumors with a higher proportion of PANK+HER3-DXd+ cells 3 d after cycle 1 had a deeper treatment response. Although HER3-DXd+ cells at IMC do not necessarily indicate that the ADC has been internalized, we can hypothesize that a greater ability of ADCs to penetrate tumor tissues could allow a higher ADC uptake by TCs and ultimately increase cell death. DGE analysis further supported these findings, showing a greater number of modulated genes in responders compared with nonresponders and also in HER3-DXd+ tumors compared with HER3-DXd− ones. Although the DGE modulation cannot exclude a resistance to the payload, these data suggest that an impaired HER3-DXd tumor penetration may significantly limit the proportion of the DXd interacting with tumor cells. These preliminary findings raise the hypothesis that the ADC tumor penetration and cell internalization may play a critical role in determining ADC efficacy. Furthermore, these results induce consideration of new strategies for early detection of ADC uptake in TCs and prediction of treatment response. For example, new technologies for the detection of ADC uptake in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could represent a significant advancement in monitoring ADC efficacy in real-time.

Furthermore, gene expression analysis of matched on-T or BL samples showed upregulation of genes involved in immune response, particularly IFNα and IFNγ, and complement signaling significantly enriched in the entire cohort, in particular among responders. It is possible that DXd-induced DNA damage activates the cGAS–cGAMP–STING pathway, leading to the upregulation of type I IFNs in tumor cells, which has been associated with better treatment outcomes (ORR and PFS). These findings suggest that a greater ADC intratumoral distribution can lead to a greater ADC intracellular uptake and DNA damage, resulting in an IFN response in tumor cells35,36. However, in our study, the exploration of immune TME composition by IMC on paired tumor samples at BL and on-T showed a notable T cell expansion and activation (increase of CD4+, CD8+, CD8+GzmB+ and CD8+CD107a+) after 3 d from cycle 1 in only two patients who achieved tumor response to the treatment. Similarly, immune deconvolution analysis did not show any significant upregulation of immune cells. Although IFNα and IFNγ activation in tumors may indicate a response to treatment, the absence of immune cell expansion is likely driven by the immunosuppressive nature of the TME and also by additional contributing factors, such as the low density of immune cells at BL (as shown in Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 11), likely related to the predominance of liver metastases in the biopsy samples, known for their inherently low immune infiltration, and the possibility that the on-T time point was not optimal for capturing the immune cell expansion that is likely to happen later on. Therefore, it would be worthwhile exploring, in the future, IFNα and IFNγ activation in CTC, as an early predictor of optimal drug–tumor interactions and, ultimately, treatment response, so helping to refine patient selection and treatment strategies.

Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the sample size was relatively small and the study was a nonrandomized single-arm trial, which lacks the rigor of randomized controlled trials, and treatment response has not been confirmed by a blinded independent central review. Nevertheless, the high efficacy of HER3-DXd demonstrated in the ICARUS-BREAST01 study, also confirmed by the central review, certainly warrants being confirmed in larger trials in similar settings. Second, we included a higher proportion of patients with HER2-0 breast cancer than we would have expected37, which was due to the almost simultaneous activation of an expanded access program for T-DXd in HER2-low breast cancer in France (https://www.has-sante.fr/jcms/p_3341817/fr/enhertu-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-cancer-du-sein-her2), which limited the inclusion of these patients. Although these patients' characteristics could affect the generalizability of the clinical results, we did not find significant differences in treatment outcome between patients with HER2-0 and those with HER2-low breast cancer. In addition, the limited sample size, the lack of information on tumor biology at study entry (for example, ER expression) and the absence of a validation cohort for several of the translational findings may affect the robustness and reproducibility of the biomarker analyses. However, the high proportion of tumor samples collected at BL and on-T in this study offers a unique opportunity for generating a hypothesis on some of the key mechanisms of response and resistance to HER3-DXd.

In conclusion, the ICARUS-BREAST01 study shows a substantial efficacy and a manageable safety profile of HER3-DXd in patients with HR+HER2− breast cancer that make it an optimal candidate for further larger studies in this setting. This study also identifies potential biomarkers of treatment response and provides some insights into the mechanisms of action of HER3-DXd. Although limited by the nature of purely exploratory analyses, our findings generate a hypothesis on the mechanism of action of this ADC, suggesting that target expression and spatial distribution, and ADC intratumoral distribution, intracellular uptake and subsequent DNA damage, may influence treatment response. These findings warrant further investigations and underline the importance of further studies, employing similar approaches, to define biomarkers that will allow optimal patient selection for a given ADC. Despite the challenges associated with serial sample collection and analysis, such studies are nevertheless important in providing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of new ADCs.

The ICARUS-BREAST01 study (NCT04965766) is an academic, single-arm, phase 2 study which has been conducted across 11 cancer centers or hospitals in France. The following are the key eligibility criteria: female or male patient aged ≥18 years; locally advanced or metastatic (MBC) that was HR+ (ER+ and/or PR+) and HER2− (IHC 2+ and ISH negative, or IHC 1+ or IHC 0+) at the time of the first diagnosis (if the tumor were ER+ and/or PR+ at initial diagnosis and became ER− and/or PR− in the following biopsies performed while receiving previous standard treatments for MBC, the patient could be included); progression on endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors; must have received one line, but not more than one, of chemotherapy for MBC; may have received previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, AKT inhibitors and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors; must have metastatic site easily accessible to biopsy (with the exception of bone metastasis) and have accepted the performance of pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

The study was initially designed to include only patients with HER3 membrane expression ≥75% with 10× in-tumor biopsies at BL; however, this inclusion criterion was deleted by amendment on 21 April 2022, after inclusion of the first 29 patients; afterwards recruitment proceeded regardless of HER3 expression. This decision was taken because data across different tumor types, including breast cancer, showed HER3-DXd clinical benefit across a broad range of tumor HER3 expression levels23. Patients with clinically inactive or treated brain metastases who were asymptomatic were eligible, whereas patients with any history of ILD (including pulmonary fibrosis or radiation pneumonitis), current confirmed or suspected ILD or with clinically severe intercurrent pulmonary illnesses or previous treatment with an ADC containing a topoisomerase-I inhibitor payload were excluded. Mandatory tumor biopsies were performed (1 frozen + 3 FFPE): pre-treatment (baseline), on-T and at the end of treatment. For on-T tumor biopsies, patients were divided into three groups to undergo a single on-T biopsy at the following time points: group 1 (34% of patients) at C1D3 ± 1 d, group 2 (33% of patients) at C1D19 ± 1 d and group 3 (33% of patients) at C2D3 ± 1 d (1 frozen + 3 FFPE). Serum and blood samples were also collected at multiple time points, which are detailed in the first and last versions of the protocol provided in Supplementary Information. Patients received treatment with HER3-DXd 5.6 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks until investigator-assessed radiological progression (per RECIST v.1.1), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or any other discontinuation criterion indicated in the protocol. The protocol was submitted to the competent ethics committee (CPP), which gave its approval on 12 March 2021. This study was also approved by the competent authority on 29 April 2021 and performed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and other applicable regulatory requirements. All patients provided written informed consent before study participation.

The primary statistical test was a one-sided exact test for a binomial proportion. The null hypothesis was that the treatment with HER3-DXd yields an ORR ≤ 12%; 99 patients were required to provide 85% power to test this null hypothesis at a one-sided 5% significance level, assuming an ORR of 23% under the alternative hypothesis. The primary endpoint, ORR, was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed CR or PR, as assessed by local investigators, without initiation of new anticancer treatment. Confirmation of response had to be demonstrated with an assessment 4 weeks or later after the initial response. The treatment objective response was radiologically assessed every 6 weeks using RECIST v.1.1. For equivocal findings of progression (for example, very small and uncertain new lesions, cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment was allowed until the next scheduled assessment. Tumor imaging assessment was performed every 6 weeks (±7 d) starting at 6 weeks from the first dose for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (±7 d). Secondary endpoints were: PFS by investigator assessment, DoR, CBR, OS and safety. CBR was defined as the presence of at least a PR or CR, or a SD for ≥6 months under treatment.

The 95% CIs for rates such as ORR and CBR were calculated using the Clopper–Pearson method. A waterfall plot was also used to present each patient's (unconfirmed or confirmed) ORR according to their variation for the minimum sum of the patient's tumor size from baseline.

Kaplan–Meier estimations and curves were used to describe DoR, PFS and OS. PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose until documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occured first. For patients with no documented radiological progression, follow-up was censored at the date of last radiological assessment without progression, unless death occurred within 12 weeks of the date of last known progression free, in which case the death was counted as a PFS event. The DoR was calculated for the patients with either confirmed CR or PR and defined as the time from the first documented confirmed CR or PR until the date of disease progression or the date of death. Follow-up time was calculated using the reverse Kaplan–Meier method38. Safety endpoints (AEs, AESIs, serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs and TRAEs), defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v.5.0) were described as maximum grade for each patient by the CTCAE term. TEAEs are defined as those AEs with a start or worsening date on or after the start date of study treatment until 47 d after the end date of study treatment (that is, on-T period). SAEs starting or worsening after the on-T period, if reported as related to the study treatment, were also counted as TEAEs. Proportions of treatment discontinuation, interruptions and dose reductions due to any AEs were also described. All potential cases with ILD were reviewed by an independent ILD adjudication committee. Data management was performed using TrialMaster software compliant with 21 CFR Part 11. The same software was used for patient registration. Continuous variables were presented by their mean and s.d. or median and IQR and categorical variables as percentages. All enrolled patients received at least one dose of study drug so that the full analysis set and safety analysis set correspond to the same population. Exploratory analyses were performed to assess the association between BL and dynamic biomarkers on ORR and PFS through logistic and Cox's regression models. To assess the assumption of linearity, splines were used. All additional tests beyond the primary test were two sided; R/SAS 9.4 was used for all analyses. DEG of RNA-seq data was performed using R packages Deseq2 and glmmseq and the Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to control for the false discovery rate (Padj < 0.05). The study protocol was amended on 15 April 2022 to include patients with tumors presenting any HER3-membrane expression level at study entry and, thereafter, on 26 November 2024 to add a central review of RECIST response.

HER3 staining was centrally performed on 72 samples by Roche CDx CAP/CLIA Laboratory (Tucson) using clone SP438 and scored as follows: membrane H-score: 0–300; cytoplasm H-score: 0–300; overall membrane positivity at ×10 magnification: 0–100. Overall, 4 samples at baseline were not available (not provided by the participating centers) and 23 samples were excluded from the analysis due to tumor cellularity <10%. Centralized HER2 assessment on tumor biopsies at BL was performed by a GEFPICS (Groupe d'Etude des Facteurs Pronostiques par Immunohistochimie dans le Cancer du Sein)-trained pathologist using the Roche HER2 (4B5) clone and scored according to the last version of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines39. ‘Ultralow' HER2 category was defined as cases showing a faint-to-weak, incomplete membrane staining in <10% of tumor cells (classified in the IHC 0 category following the ASCO and CAP guidelines). A total of 69 samples was available for centralized HER2 assessment, because 4 samples were not provided and the remaining 26 had insufficient tumor tissue for further analysis.

Pairs of H&E and IHC slides stained for HER3 expression were collected at BL and analyzed by machine learning algorithms to identify primary markers of resistance. On the pathologist's review, 69 pairs containing sufficient tumor tissue and TME were selected for analysis.

We first reproduced the analysis of target spatial distribution on the IHC slides as performed in the DAISY clinical trial14. The same preprocessing operations were used to delineate the tissue of interest within annotations provided by an expert pathologist, highlighting tumor tissue and its surrounding environment. Nonoverlapping patches of size 80 × 80 pixels2 were extracted to account for the different resolution at which the slides were scanned in our study. Patches with >60% of red, green and blue values <2 and 90% of red, green and blue values >240 were identified as black and white patches and discarded. Two different models were employed to extract representations from the patches: the same model used in the Daisy clinical trial and the CONCH model40. Using the Davies–Bouldin index, we determined an optimal number of clusters to be seven for the DAISY-like embeddings and eight for the CONCH embeddings for a number of clusters ranging from seven to twelve. Subsequently, we applied the mini-batch K-means algorithm to these optimal cluster numbers and computed the cluster percentages.

To further integrate tissue microenvironment in the analysis, we aimed to leverage the information available from both H&E and IHC slides. To this end, we first extracted microenvironment features from the H&E slide using the CellViT model41. Specifically, we employed the CellViT-SAM-H model with HoVer-Net decoder42 trained on the Pannuke dataset43 to segment and classify nuclei into five classes: neoplastic, epithelial, inflammatory, connective and dead.

To incorporate HER3 expression, we registered the H&E slide onto the IHC slide. The slides were serialized, with a difference of up to 15 μm between H&E and IHC slides, providing a solid foundation for joint modality analysis. To perform registration, we relied on the VALIS registration pipeline44. Originally developed on surgical cuts, we adapted the method for biopsy slides with several preprocessing steps.

Initially, we identified the tissue regions on the slides that could be registered. These regions were then cropped to ensure the same scale on both modalities. The resulting images were subsequently processed using a preprocessing operator based on color deconvolution from a K-means clustering, with adaptive histogram equalization. Due to the noisy nature of the clustering results, we ran the VALIS pipeline on three different seeds and retained the seed with the best rigid registration error provided by the method. We finally computed the micro-nonrigid registration on 25% of the full-resolution whole-slide imaging. After registration, we identified six pairs of slides with a relative target registration error above one, which we considered too high to be exploitable in our next analysis. We excluded these slides and extracted nonoverlapping 128 × 128 pixel2 patches from the remaining H&E slides. Black and white patches were discarded and warped onto the IHC slide using the coordinates of the top left corner through the trained registration models produced by the VALIS pipeline. To ensure that the patches contained relevant information, we removed any that fell outside the tissue contours of the IHC slide after registration.

For feature extraction, we performed the following steps: from the H&E slide, we extracted the number of cells for each class and computed several morphological features (area, perimeter, compactness, roundness, solidity and elongation) averaged across each class within each patch. From the IHC slide, we measured the distribution of DAB staining (mean, s.d., minimum, maximum and median q1 and q3 values) on the corresponding registered patch. The feature vectors from both modalities were concatenated, normalized and fed into a K-means algorithm, after which we computed cluster percentages on each slide. We switched to the Calinski–Harabasz score to identify the optimal number for clusters because it provided a more precise indication in this case. For a number of clusters ranging from 7 to 12, we identified an optimal number of 8 clusters. The same analysis was performed on the features obtained from the H&E slides exclusively, where we identified an optimal number of ten clusters. Unlike the DAISY-like analyses, this process did not require a pathologist's annotations due to the additional information available from the H&E slides. For all these analyses, using R v.4.1.2, we applied Dirichlet's regression to identify which clusters were significantly associated with the objective response to treatment. Statistical significance was assessed using Wald's test based on Dirichlet-distributed parameters. The second analysis involved investigating HER3 distribution within TCs. First, we segmented the nuclei on the IHC slides by extracting patches of size 512 × 512 pixels2 with an overlap of 20 μm and removed black and white patches. Then, we employed SOP45 on the extracted patches to retrieve nuclei segmentation using the same training protocol applied in the DAISY trial. Overlapping nuclei with >50% overlap were merged. A contrast correction operation was applied to enhance nuclei segmentation, involving clamping values >0.3 and rescaling the value within this new range. The resulting nuclei segmentation was then exported to QuPath v.5.0.0 (ref. 46). We used the provided tools to estimate stain decomposition vectors and cell membranes and to measure staining distribution within the segmented cells. For the stain decomposition vectors, we estimated the vectors from the first slide of the stack and applied the same values for every slide. For estimating the cell membranes, we used the provided cell expansion tool with a limit at 20 pixels from nuclei boundaries. Finally, we removed negative cells and/or cells with a background detected in the cytoplasm and mean DAB cytoplasm optical density variance across the cells for each patient. To identify negative cells, we trained a K-means algorithm to delineate two clusters from DAB optical density average value in the detected cells over all the slides and set the threshold at the average between the two detected centroids. We compared the distribution of this value between nonresponders and responders using a Mann–Whitney U-test. Finally, among the 63 slides used to compute the clustering, 48 were compared with slides stained for ERG expression. Using QuPath software, we identified positive and negative cells within these slides. The absolute number of ERG+ cells in analyzed tissue was then compared with the number of patches belonging to each cluster for each patient with Spearman's correlation test and P values adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

The tumor samples were qualified for WES and bulk RNA-seq if the sample contained ≥10% and 30% TCs, respectively. In total, 43 frozen tumor biopsies at baseline were analyzed for WES and 43 blood samples were used as germline control. Overall, at baseline, 15 fresh biopsies were either not collected or not provided by the participating centers, 28 were excluded due to <200 ng of DNA or <10% TCs and 13 failed the quality control. Then 22 pairs of baseline or on-T frozen tumor biopsies were analyzed for bulk RNA-seq (n = 12 at C1D3, n = 4 at C1D19 and n = 6 at C2D3). At BL, 15 fresh biopsies were not provided by the participating centers, 28 were excluded due to <200 ng of RNA or <30% TCs, 5 failed the quality control and 29 did not have the matched on-T sample. On-T, 22 fresh biopsies were unavailable because they were either not provided or not collected by the participating centers, 39 were excluded due to <200 ng of RNA or <30% TCs, 1 sample failed the quality control and 15 did not have the matched BL sample.

DNA and RNA extraction Genomic DNA was isolated from blood using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 69504), according to the manufacturer's guideline. DNA or RNA dual extraction from the tissue biopsy was done using the Allprep DNA/RNA Micro kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 80284) to purify DNA along with TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10296028) to purify RNA. In brief, after homogenizing the biopsy cells, the lysate was passed through the Allprep DNA spin column provided by the kit. After centrifugation at 8,000g for 30 s, the DNA kept in the column filter was used for DNA purification while the flow-though was used for RNA purification using the TRIzol LS Reagent, according to the manufacturers' guidelines.

The DNA quality was checked on the Agilent Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and the quantity was determined using Qubit dsDNA Broad Range Assay (Invitrogen, cat. no. Q32853). Genomic DNA, 200 ng, was sheared with the Covaris E220 system (LGC Genomics or Kbioscience) to obtain 150-bp fragments according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA fragments were end-repaired, extended with an ‘A' base on the 3′-end, ligated with paired-end adapters with the Bravo Platform (Agilent Technologies) and amplified to generate libraries (ten cycles). Hybridization-based exome enrichment was performed using the Agilent SureSelectXT Low Input Clinical Research Exome v.2 target enrichment system (Agilent Technologies). The final libraries were indexed, pooled and sequenced using the onboard cluster method, as paired-end sequencing (2× 100 bp) on an Illumina NovaSeq-6000 sequencer at Gustave Roussy.

The RNA integrity (RNA integrity score ≥2.0) was checked on the Agilent Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and the quantity was determined using Nanodrop. A SureSelect Automated Strand Specific RNA Library Preparation Kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with the Bravo Platform (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, 200–300 ng of total RNA per sample was used for poly(A) messenger RNA selection using oligo(dT) beads and subjected to thermal mRNA fragmentation. The fragmented mRNA samples were subjected to complementary DNA synthesis and further converted into double-stranded DNA using the reagents supplied in the kit; the resulting double-stranded DNA was used for library preparation. The final libraries were indexed, purified, pooled together in equal concentrations and subjected to paired-end sequencing (2× 100 bp) on a Novaseq-6000 sequencer (Illumina) at Gustave Roussy.

Point mutations, small indels and copy-number alterations (CNAs) were detected using an end-to-end pipeline on the raw WES files. In brief, paired-end reads were controlled (FastQC v.0.11.8), trimmed (Fastp v.0.20)47 and aligned to the reference human genome GRCh37 (BWA-MEM v.0.7.17)48. Files with aligned reads were processed following the best practices of GATK bundle v.4.1.8.1. Processed and aligned reads were then used as input to mutation- and CNA-calling algorithms. As advised in GATK guidelines, we used a ‘panel of normal' to remove artifactual or false-positive mutations recurrently found in normal blood samples. Point mutations and small indels were called using Mutect2 (ref. 49) and the panel of normal. All putative variants identified by Mutect2 were first filtered to account for possible sample contamination and read orientation artifacts. Additional threshold- and rule-based filtering was applied to the read coverage, genomic position and variant allele frequency.

After all the filtering, 6,608 somatic point mutations and small indels were considered in the analysis of the 43 WES samples. CNA, tumor purity and average tumor ploidy were identified with the FACETS R package v.0.5.14 (ref. 50) run with parameters cval_pre = 25 and cval_pro = 500. To mitigate the effect of segmentation errors, only gene CNAs arising from segments spanning <10 Mb were considered in downstream analyses. Each CNA was classified into one of six categories and only high-level focal amplifications or homozygous focal deletions were considered. CNAs were categorized into five classes, with thresholds adjusted for the presence of whole-genome duplication (WGD): high-level gain was defined as six or more copies without WGD or ten or more copies with WGD; medium-level gain as four to five copies without WGD or seven to nine copies with WGD; low-level gain as three copies without WGD or five to six copies with WGD; homozygous deletion as zero copies; and loss of heterozygosity as one to two copies overall and zero copies for the minor allele without WGD, or one to four copies overall and zero copies for the minor allele with WGD. Oncogenic events were identified by intersecting point mutations and small indels with the OncoKB51 database and gene amplifications or deletions with the OncoKB or CIViC52 databases.

Point mutations from all 43 WES samples were summarized into a matrix of mutation counts with 96 rows for the 96 trinucleotide mutation categories, totaling 6,280 point mutations. Only samples with at least 50 detected somatic point mutations were used for the mutational signature analysis, resulting in the selection of 36 out of 49 samples with WES data available. Mutational signature activities in each sample were determined by projecting this matrix onto a shortlist of reference signatures from the SBS signatures COSMIC v.3.2 database. The shortlist was established by downloading known signature activities in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Pancancer Analysis of Whole Genomes cohorts (available at https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn11804065) and selecting signatures showing an activity in at least 2% of breast cancer samples in any of the two cohorts, or of particular interest to our cohort (signatures SBS31, SBS35, SBS44 and SBS90). Overall, 21 signatures were selected and used as a reference set to perform the deconvolution using MutationalPatterns R package53 v.3.12.0. In an effort to mirror the original SigProfiler algorithm used for deconvoluting mutational signatures, we used the part of the Julia code (https://bitbucket.org/bbglab/sigprofilerjulia) that implements the SigProfiler algorithm from ref. 54 to run the sparsity-inducing step occurring after a first signature activity assignment by non-negative matrix factorization.

Raw Illumina reads were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v.2.20 (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html). Quality control of reads was performed with fastQC v.0.11.8 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) and contamination assessment with Fastq_Screen v.0.15.3 (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1344583) against the default genomes database. All quality control reports were aggregated using MultiQC v.1.14 (ref. 55). Bad sequence quality and adapter trimming was performed using fastp v.0.23.2 (ref. 47). Transcript-level quantification was performed using Salmon v.1.4.0 (ref. 56) with the reference human genome hg38.101. Sample-level quantification were aggregated using the tximport v.1.32.0 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html) package on R v.4.4.1. Genes that had fewer than five counts for any of the compared condition levels were discarded. DEAs were performed using the DESeq2 (ref. 57) package v.1.44.0. Differential analyses using an interaction term were performed using the glmmSeq (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmSeq/vignettes/glmmSeq.html) R package v.0.5.5, GSEA, clusterProfiler v.4.12.0 package and multiple term databases in their latest version (MSigDb v.7.1, WikiPathways, KEGG, Reactome, DisGenet, Disease Ontology, Gene Ontology, Network of Cancer Genes). All P values from any statistical test performed were false recovery rate adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method58. To investigate the prognostic signature for PFS, we used z-scores to avoid the influence of highly expressed genes. We used transcriptomic data obtained by RNA bulk analyses from 50 frozen biopsies at BL after passing quality control. We performed univariate Cox's proportional hazard models for each transcription factor using the Survival package in R. We generated a prognostic signature, using an adaptive lasso method with a preliminary step in the model subject to the ridge penalty. A 5× crossvalidation was used to determine the optimal value of λ. We repeated the adaptive lasso selection 100× and selected the transcription features with repeated occurrence frequencies >80%. The analysis were performed using R package biospear59. PAM50 molecular subtypes were determined using normalized transcriptomic data transcripts per million through the following steps.

The 50 genes comprising the PAM50 signature were extracted from the normalized transcripts per million expression matrix for each sample. PAM50-specific normalization: given that all samples in our cohort were HR+HER2−, a tailored normalization approach was applied, as recommended for subtype prediction in this specific context (the normalization was performed using the publicly available code: https://github.com/afernan4/PAM50_ER_HER2_normalization). Application of the PAM50 predictor: after normalization, the PAM50 predictor was applied using the original method and code available at: https://genome-publications.bioinf.unc.edu/PAM50.

We analyzed, using IMC, 61 samples at BL and 57 on-T. At baseline, 4 samples were not available because they were not provided by the participating center, 6 samples were excluded for insufficient tumor cellularity (0%) and 28 were nonanalyzable due to inadequate tumor staining (technical issues). On-T, 30 samples were not available because either they were not provided by the participating centers or biopsies were not collected and 12 samples were nonanalyzable due to inadequate tumor staining (technical issues).

All antibodies used in IMC were first validated by immunofluorescence using breast and lung cancer tissues to determine optimal staining and specificity. Note that the anti-DXd antibody selectively binds the DXd moiety linked to the antibody and does not bind the payload detached from the antibody, because the free unbound DXd is washed out during processing of the samples and only DXd bound to the antibody can still be detected. Validated antibodies were conjugated to metal isotopes and tested by IMC to ensure staining specificity and intensity. They were then further validated in multiplexed IMC experiments and optimal concentrations of all metal-conjugated antibodies were determined by analysis of IMC images in breast cancer tissues (Supplementary Table 5).

Metals were conjugated to antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Maxpar X8 Antibody Labeling Kit). Metal-tagged antibodies were stored in a Candor Antibody Stabilizer (Candor Biosciences) at 4 °C.

FFPE tumor slides were cut at 5 mm and incubated at 60 °C for 2 h before they were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in 100% alcohol and washed in water. Tumor tissues were incubated in antigen retrieval (Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0, 96 °C for 30 min) and left on the bench for 30 min to cool down. Next, slides were washed in water, then in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), before blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 45 min and incubation with metal-tagged antibodies overnight at 4 °C. They were incubated with the remainder of the metal-tagged antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, slides were washed with PBS and 0.1% Triton, then they were incubated with Cell-ID intercalator-Ir 125 µM diluted in PBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for DNA detection (Fluidigm, cat. no. 201192A) for 5 min. Finally, slides were washed with water and air dried. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, the pathologist marked the regions of interest (ROIs) on each slide. Hence, three ROIs were identified on each slide and then delineated using the IMC (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Before the acquisition, the Hyperion mass cytometry system IMC was auto-tuned using a three-element tuning slide according to the tuning protocol provided by Standard BioTools. ROIs with sizes of 1 mm2 (1,000 × 1,000 µm2) were ablated and acquired at 200 Hz. For each sample, one to three ROIs were defined for the acquisition on Hyperion. The data obtained from each scanned spot, where each antibody corresponded to a single image per sample, were processed. These individual images were then combined to create a multi-image stack.

Raw data were visualized and converted to tiff format using the Standard BioTools MCDTM viewer. Next, ROIs were converted to TIFF concatenated images using Fiji software and cell segmentation was performed on the iridium channel for each ROI of each patient using the Qupath Stardist module. This segmentation process allowed the identification of individual cells and the extraction of single-cell distribution information. Using QuPath, a training image composed of several images from the dataset was used to classify regions and cell phenotypes. To discriminate the tumor region from the stroma, a pixel classifier tool was trained on a pan-cytokeratin marker. Then, to classify each cell population, an object classifier tool was trained by manually selecting positive and negative cells. The random Forest algorithm was applied to classify these detections (Supplementary Fig. 10). In addition, spatial analysis was conducted to explore the interaction between immune cells and TCs.

The study was designed to collect circulating TCs (CTCs) from the first 35 patients enrolled at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center.

CTCs were enumerated using CellSearch (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) on 7.5 ml of blood according to the manufacturer's protocol as previously described60. Using CellSearch, we obtained CTC count data for 36 patients, with 22 having CTC assessments at each time point.

Blood samples, 28 ml, were collected in CellSave tubes (Menarini Silicon Biosystems). Negative selection of CTCs was performed using the RosetteSep Human CD36 Depletion Cocktail (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 15167) according to the manufacturer's protocol as previously reported61,62,63. The enriched cell fraction was washed with 1× PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 558g. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of fixative solution medium A from the Fix&Perm kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. GAS004) and washed with 1× PBS (5 min, 368g). After centrifugation the cell pellet was resuspended with 100 μl of permeabilization solution medium B from the Fix&Perm kit and anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody (2 µg ml−1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, clone RTJ2, cat. no. MA1-860), and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After a 1× PBS wash the secondary goat anti-mouse AF488 antibody (Life Technologies, cat. no. A11029, 1:800) and 50 μl of staining reagent containing cytokeratin (CK)-phycoerythrin (CK 8, 18 and 19) and CD45-allophycocyanin antibodies (Menarini Silicon Biosystem, cat. no. 7900001) were added (dilution 1:6). The cell suspension was incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. After a 1× PBS wash, the cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of 1× PBS and kept at +4 °C. Hoechst 33342 (16.7 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 14533-100MG) was added before cell sorting. Individual CTC isolation was performed using a BD FACS ARIA III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with four lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm). The system was run at 138 kPa pressure, a 100-μm nozzle and yield precision mode. Cell sorting was started by gating Hoechst+ elements. The second gate enabled selection of CD45-APC− events. Three populations, including Hoechst+CD45−CK+HER3−, Hoechst+CD45−CK+HER3+ and Hoechst+CD45−CK−HER3+ cells, were sorted and collected in a 96-well plate. As a control, 20 Hoechst+CD45+CK−HER3− cells were sorted. Plates were centrifuged 10 min at 280g and frozen at −20 °C for at least 30 min. For FACS, CTC count data were available for 34 patients, with 27 having 3 assessments at different time points.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis through its thermogenic effects and the secretion of regulatory molecules. Here we report that RAP250 haploinsufficiency stimulates BAT in mice, thus contributing to a decrease in fat accumulation. Local in vivo AAV-mediated RAP250 silencing in BAT reduces body weight and fat mass and enhances glucose oxidation, thereby indicating that RAP250 participates in the regulation of BAT metabolic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms led to the finding that Neuritin 1 is produced and released by brown adipocytes, it plays a key metabolic role, and it participates in the enhanced BAT metabolic activity under RAP250 deficiency. Forced overexpression of Neuritin 1 in UCP1-expressing cells markedly decreases fat mass and body weight gain in mice and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Neuritin 1-deficient brown adipocytes also shows a reduced β-adrenergic response. We demonstrate a metabolic role of BAT-derived Neuritin 1 acting through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Based on our results, Neuritin-1 emerges as a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, affecting 650 million people worldwide (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight). Comorbidities of obesity—most notably type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia—are now major public health concerns1. Recent data also indicate that obesity is associated with a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 and risk of fatality2,3. Thus, there is an urgent need to delineate the precise mechanisms that underlie the onset of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an organ specialized in performing non-shivering thermogenesis, and it is present in adult human subjects4,5,6. The capacity of thermogenic fat to oxidize substrates and increase energy expenditure has drawn growing interest as a therapeutic approach to tackle obesity and associated metabolic disorders7. BAT thermogenesis requires the release of norepinephrine from local sympathetic axons; norepinephrine activates the β-adrenergic receptor-cAMP-PKA pathway in brown adipocytes to drive lipolysis and thermogenic respiration8. The release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and β3-adrenergic receptor binding to brown adipocytes determine the level of thermogenesis in BAT by regulating the activity of lipases, providing the immediate fuel molecules for BAT mitochondria and heat production8. Recent data indicate that brown adipocytes secrete multiple signaling molecules, named batokines, including FGF21, Myostatin, CXCL14, EPDR1 and adiponectin, among others, which operate as endocrine factors9,10,11,12,13,14. Other batokines work as local autocrine/paracrine factors, as reported for BMP7, BMP8b, NRG4, and S100b15,16,17,18. Regarding the locally-acting factors, some of them are produced by vascular cells, while others are generated by brown adipocytes15,16,17,18. The action of these local factors is highly variable, ranging from effects promoting neurite outgrowth from sympathetic neurons to direct effects on the metabolism of brown adipocytes.

RAP250 (encoded by NCOA6 gene) is a co-activator of nuclear hormone receptors. It also transactivates other transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, CBP, heat shock factor 1, SRF, E2F-1, Rb, NFκβ, and C/EBPα19. RAP250 is also an integral and unique component of a Set1-like complex named ASCOM (for ASC-2 complex), which contains histone H3-Lys-4-methyltransferase (H3K4MT) MLL3 or its paralogue MLL420,21. RAP250 is a pleiotropic modulator that affects growth, development, reproduction, apoptosis, and wound healing22. In addition, it participates in liver metabolism23,24 and modulates insulin secretion in mice and humans25,26, and it is required for white adipogenesis in vitro27. MLL3Δ/Δ mice show decreased adiposity and enhanced insulin sensitivity, although the underlying target tissues were not studied28.

In this work, we focused on the metabolic effects caused by the haploinsufficiency of RAP250. We report that RAP250 modulates the thermogenic activity of BAT in mice. Surprisingly, BAT from RAP250-deficient mice showed enhanced expression of Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), a protein that impacts on the central nervous system29,30,31,32. AAV-mediated expression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells caused metabolic effects leading to a reduction in fat mass and the induction of BAT thermogenic genes. The repression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells disrupted the capacity of these cells to respond to a β-adrenergic receptor agonist.

Based on previous reports indicating that RAP250 regulates metabolic homeostasis23,24,25,26,27,28, we examined whether it plays a relevant role in energy metabolism. To this aim, we monitored the phenotype of male mice heterozygous for RAP250 (RAP250+/) since homozygous knockout mice show prenatal lethality33. Heterozygous mice showed an almost 50% decrease in RAP250 expression in inguinal (ING) adipose tissue, brown (BAT) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig. S1A–F). Control (wild-type, WT) and RAP250+/− male mice showed a similar body weight at 10 weeks of age but later diverged, the latter being leaner, despite increased food intake (Fig. 1A, B). Thirty-week-old male RAP250+/− mice also showed smaller inguinal (ING) and perigonadal (PAT) adipose tissues compared with control animals (Fig. 1C, D). However, no differences in heart, skeletal muscle or liver weight were detected (Fig. S1G). We monitored the gain of adipose tissue volume by microCT in several sets of male mice. Data revealed that the differences in the size of subcutaneous and visceral depots (the latter defined as the sum of omental, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and perigonadal depots) were fully established at 30 weeks of age and were maintained thereafter (Fig. 1E–G). In keeping with a reduced adipose mass, male RAP250+/− mice showed a markedly reduced adipose cell size (Fig. 1H, I) and low plasma leptin levels (Fig. 1J). Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− male mice (Fig. 1K), thereby suggesting no changes in cellularity. Thirty-seven-week-old but not thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice showed a reduced body weight compared to controls (Fig. S1H). ING or PAT adipose depots were also reduced in female RAP250+/− mice at the age of 37 weeks (Fig. S1I). Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− female mice (Fig. S1J).

Data are expressed as grams of tissue weight (n = 10). D Representative images of PAT and ING depots from WT and RAP250+/− male mice. E Transversal gray scale image of mouse abdominal region showing the subcutaneous adipose mass (SAT) and visceral adipose mass (VAT); vertebrae are seen as the denser white structures; least dense areas represent the adipose mass, and the layer that separates the visceral compartment from the subcutaneous region can be observed.

G Progression of total abdominal fat volume in time, measured by microCT Scan, in the same cohort of mice (10 weeks n = 8; 15 weeks n = 7; 30 weeks WT n = 24 and RAP250+/− n = 25; 40 weeks n = 10; 60 weeks n = 16 for WT and n = 11 for RAP250+/−; 85 weeks n = 8 for WT and n = 6 for RAP250+/−).

Data are expressed as μg of DNA per depot (in ING depots n = 9 for WT and n = 6 for RAP250+/−, in PAT depots n = 10 for WT and n = 7 for RAP250+/−). Data are MEAN+/− SEM. Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B, C, F, I, J and K) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (A and G). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, we analyzed the response of RAP250+/− mice to a high-fat diet (HFD). Male mice subjected to a 60% fat diet gained body weight throughout the experiment (Fig. S2A), and RAP250+/− mice consistently remained leaner than control counterparts (Fig. S2A) under conditions in which food intake was similar in both genotypes (Fig. S2B). HFD-treated RAP250+/− mice also showed a smaller visceral fat depot (Fig. S2C) and lower plasma leptin levels compared to control animals (Fig. S2D). Female RAP250+/− mice also showed a lower body weight and reduced adipose depots after a HFD (Fig. S2E and F). These data reveal that male and female RAP250+/− mice are resistant to HFD-induced obesity.

Upon fasting, male RAP250+/− mice showed normal levels of plasma glucose, adiponectin and free fatty acids, and reduced concentrations of plasma insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol on a normal diet (ND) (Fig. 2A, B, and Table S1). Administration of a HFD for 20 weeks caused high plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin in control male mice, but concentrations remained within the normal range in RAP250+/− counterparts (Fig. 2C, D). Studies performed in 30-week-old male RAP250+/− mice on a standard diet showed improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin secretion compared to control mice (Fig. 2E and F). Glucose tolerance was also improved in male RAP250+/− mice fed with HFD (Fig. 2G), and under these conditions, plasma insulin was markedly attenuated (Fig. 2H).

A Fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) (WT n = 18 and RAP250+/− n = 14) and B insulin (ng/ml) levels (WT n = 14 and RAP250+/− n = 13) of 30-week-old male mice under a normal diet ND. C Fasting plasma glucose (n = 12) and D insulin levels (WT n = 10 and RAP250+/− n = 12) of 30-week-old male mice under a high-fat diet (HFD). E Plasma glucose (time 0 to 60 min WT n = 23 and RAP250+/− n = 22; time 90 and 120 WT n = 15 and RAP250+/− n = 14) and F insulin profiles (time 0 to 30 min WT n = 14 and RAP250+/− n = 13; time 60 WT n = 5 and RAP250+/− n = 5)) upon glucose tolerance test (2 mg/kg) in male mice on a normal diet. G Plasma glucose (WT n = 13 and RAP250+/− n = 12) and H insulin profiles (WT n = 13 and RAP250+/− n = 10) under glucose tolerance test (2 mg/kg) in male mice after 16 weeks on a HFD (n = 12). I Whole-body glucose turnover (Turnover), hepatic glucose production (HGP), whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), whole-body glycolysis rate (Glycolysis), and whole-body glycogen synthesis rate (Glycogen synthesis) were measured in a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (1.5 mU/kg/min insulin) in 30-week-old male mice (n = 9 for WT and n = 8 for RAP250+/−). J Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained paraffin slices of liver after 20 weeks of a HFD (scale bar=200 µm), and (K) Liver fat content as % of low density area (Lipid Droplets) over total histology slice area (n = 5, 25 slices per group). Data are MEAN+/− SEM. Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B, C, D, F, I and K) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (E, G, and H). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Female RAP250+/− mice showed no changes in plasma glucose or insulin under a standard diet or HFD (Fig. S3A, B). Thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice subjected to either a standard diet or HFD also showed enhanced glucose tolerance in the absence of changes in plasma insulin levels (Fig. S3C–F).

The impact of RAP250 deficiency on whole-body glucose utilization was also monitored in conscious male mice on a normal diet during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (Fig. 2I). Under hyperinsulinemia, RAP250+/− mice showed an increase in whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), glucose turnover (Turnover), whole-body glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis rate (Fig. 2I). Thus, these animals were indeed more insulin-sensitive than control mice. Moreover, hepatic steatosis induced by the HFD was prevented in RAP250+/− male mice, as reflected by large differences in hepatic fat deposition (Fig. 2J and K). In all, this pattern of changes suggests that RAP250+/− mice of both sexes show improved glucose tolerance as a consequence of the improved insulin sensitivity, which occurs even in the absence of changes in adiposity.

We next questioned whether the reduced adiposity detected in RAP250+/− mice derives from a higher rate of energy expenditure, thereby explaining a lower fat content and a parallel increased food intake. Indeed, RAP250+/− mice showed improved whole-body O2 consumption and CO2 production, as shown by ANCOVA analysis (Fig. 3A and S4A). Energy expenditure, glucose oxidation, and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were also increased (Fig. 3B, C, S4B and C). This enhancement occurred in the absence of alterations in ambulation (Fig. S4D). Exposure of control and RAP250+/− mice to a HFD for 20 weeks maintained most of the alterations detected under a standard diet, such as increased O2 consumption, CO2 production, energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation (Fig. S4E–H), and again, no changes in locomotor activity were detected (Fig. S4I).

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (A, D, E, G, I, J, L and N) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (C). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Given these observations, we explored the involvement of BAT in this phenotype. Interscapular BAT mass was reduced in RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3D), and glucose oxidation was markedly enhanced in isolated brown adipocytes obtained from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3E). In addition, histological examination revealed less accumulation of lipids and a smaller lipid droplet size in RAP250-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 3F and G). Additional histological analyses using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, to label the cell surface), DAPI (to label the nuclei), and anti-UCP1 antibody (to measure the differentiation state of adipocytes) were performed in BAT sections. Triple staining showed an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from RAP250+/− mice, consistent with an enhanced metabolic activity (Fig. 3H and J). In addition, data showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3H and I). In contrast, no differences in adipose cell size were detected in ING fat (Fig. S4J and K). Electron microscopy also revealed the presence of larger mitochondria in brown adipose cells in these mice (Fig. S4L and M).

To further study the alterations in BAT caused by RAP250 deficiency, we performed RNA-Seq analysis. More than 500 genes were significantly upregulated and more than 330 were downregulated in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3K). In keeping with the RNA-seq analysis, the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic genes such as Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Dio2, Ppargc1a, and Ucp1 was markedly increased in RAP250-deficient BAT, as determined by real-time PCR assays (Fig. 3L). In addition, the abundance of proteins PPARγ, C/EBPα and UCP1 was increased in brown adipose tissue from RAP250+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3M and N). In all, these data highly support the view that BAT is metabolically more active in RAP250-deficient mice compared to control, and that it may contribute to enhanced energy expenditure in response to RAP250 deficiency.

Our data indicate that RAP250 is a negative regulator of BAT metabolism in mice. In order to further analyze this, we studied the impact of cold exposure on the BAT expression of RAP250. Exposure for 8 h to cold (4 °C) induced the expression of genes Ucp1, Ppargca1, and Pde3b, and this was accompanied by a marked repression of RAP250 gene expression (Fig. S5A). In parallel to these observations, exposure of brown adipocytes for 2 h in the presence of IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induced Rgs2 and reduced RAP250 (Fig. S5B). This suggests that RAP250 participates in the activation of thermogenesis of brown adipocytes during cold and that the response is mediated by cAMP. In addition, RAP250 heterozygous mice showed a greater induction of Ucp1 mRNA levels in BAT in response to cold exposure (Fig. S5C). Under these conditions a greater induction of glucose oxidation was also detected in RAP250+/− mice during cold (Fig. S5D).

Next, we addressed whether local alterations in BAT were sufficient to induce some of the metabolic alterations detected in RAP250+/− mice. To repress RAP250 in interscapular brown adipose, we injected adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding shRNAs directed against RAP250, under H1 promoter, into the BAT of 2 month-old C57Bl/6 J mice (control mice were injected with AAVs encoding a scramble sequence). The injection of shRAP250 AAVs into this tissue reduced RAP250 expression (Fig. 4A and B), and this led to a significant decrease in body weight (Fig. 4C) and fat mass up to 10 weeks after the injection (Fig. 4D). In addition, shRAP250-injected mice showed enhanced glucose oxidation (Fig. 4E) and an improved respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Fig. 4F). The expression of UCP1 protein was also enhanced in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 4G). Under these conditions, plasma leptin levels remained unaltered (Fig. 4H).

In parallel studies, the perigonadal (epididymal) adipose tissue depots of 2 month-old C57Bl/6J male mice were injected with shRAP250- or scramble RNA-encoding AAVs. Data indicate that shRAP250 AAV administration reduced RAP250 expression in adipose tissue by 50% (Fig. S6A and B) 24 weeks after AAV injection. Under these conditions, body weight and total fat mass or perigonadal adipose depots were not altered in the RAP250-deficient group (Fig. S6C–E). RAP250 deficiency in WAT depots did not alter RER or glucose oxidation (Fig. S6F and G). Plasma leptin levels were not altered upon PAT gene manipulation (Fig. S6H). Based on our data, we propose that selective repression of RAP250 in BAT is the main driver that leads to alterations in energy expenditure that resemble those detected in RAP250+/− mice.

Next, we examined whether the metabolic profile of RAP250+/− mice was modified upon exposure to thermoneutral conditions, i.e., upon inactivation of BAT metabolic activity. Thus, control and RAP250+/− mice were housed at 30 °C for 14 weeks (starting at 8 weeks of age). Half the mice were fed a standard chow diet (TN-ND), while the other half received a HFD (TN-HFD), which enhances thermogenic activity due to the high amount of fat34,35. RAP250+/− mice subjected to thermoneutrality and a standard diet did not show alterations in body weight (Fig. 4I) or total fat mass (Fig. 4K). In contrast, RAP250+/− mice subjected to a HFD had a lower body weight (Fig. 4J) and a marked reduction of fat mass (Fig. 4K). Under these conditions, the weight of BAT was only reduced in RAP250+/− mice upon a HFD (Fig. 4L). Tissue sections revealed unaltered adipose cell size in mice on a standard diet (Fig. 4M and 4O) but a reduced adipose cell size in the RAP250+/− group upon treatment with a HFD (Fig. 4N and 4O). These studies provide further evidence that BAT plays a major role in the alterations in energy metabolism of RAP250+/− mice.

To explore the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced metabolic activity of BAT under RAP250 deficiency, we focused on the differentially expressed gene sets detected in RNA-seq assays (Fig. S7A). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in the action potential of neurons in RAP250-deficient BAT (Figs. 5A, and S7A), and an enhanced expression of the neurotrophic factor Neuritin 1 (Nrn1) and not for others as Nrg4, Ngf, Bdnf and S100b (Fig. 5B). In keeping with these data, RAP250-deficient BAT showed an enhanced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), suggesting an increased sympathetic innervation17 (Fig. 5C and D). In keeping with this, cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics detected an increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 5E). This is relevant since sympathetic nerve fibers innervating BAT are predominantly non-myelinated Schwann cells, and they play a key role in neurotransmission, allowing rapid norepinephrine release to stimulate thermogenesis36,37. This type of analysis also revealed an increased abundance of myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. S7B).

Analysis of western blot and real-time PCR validated the increased expression of Nrn1 in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. 5F–H). The increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA was detected in BAT from RAP250+/− mice aged between 2 and 6 months (Fig. 5H). Nrn1 mRNA was more enriched in brown adipocytes compared to the expression detected in the stromal vascular fraction obtained from BAT, similarly to was detected for UCP1 or RAP250 (Fig. S7C–E). AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT also caused an increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 5I and J). In contrast, AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in perigonadal adipose tissue did not alter the expression of Nrn1 (Fig. S7F). Exposure of mice to thermoneutrality abrogated the stimulation of Nrn1 mRNA levels in BAT (Fig. 5K), in keeping with the absence of changes in fat mass.

In separate studies, we analyzed the expression of Nrn1 in mouse brown adipose cells during adipogenesis. Nrn1 mRNA was substantially expressed in preadipocytes and it underwent a two-fold increase in adipocytes under conditions in which UCP1 was markedly induced (Fig. 5L). In contrast, the expression of Nrn1 protein was not detectable in preadipocytes and was markedly induced during brown adipogenesis (Fig. 5M). Nrn1 was detected as 15 kDa and 12 kDa bands and it is likely that the former is an unprocessed form of the protein. Nrn1 protein was also detected in culture media from brown adipocytes, suggesting that it was secreted. Moreover, the secretion was rapidly stimulated in response to isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 5N). In all, our data indicate that Nrn1 is expressed and secreted by brown adipose cells and that its expression is markedly enhanced in response to brown adipogenesis.

We next tested whether Nrn1 expression in thermogenic adipose cells had metabolic effects in mice. To this end, control mice subjected to a normal diet were treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Thirty weeks after the AAV administration, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a 3-fold greater expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein in BAT whereas no changes in expression were detected in ING adipose tissue (Fig. 6A, and S8A). Plasma levels of Nrn1 were detectable but no differences were found between control and Nrn1-treated groups (Fig. S8B). Under these conditions, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower body weight and lower fat mass (Fig. 6B and C) in the absence of alterations in lean mass (Fig. 6D). Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, CO2 production and glucose oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 6E, F, S8C and D). Under these conditions, food intake but not ambulation was enhanced (Fig. 6G, and S8E). AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides, normal glycemia, and a trend for reduced leptin levels (Fig. S8F–H).

Sections of BAT revealed reduced size of brown adipose cells and lipid droplets upon Nrn1 treatment (Fig. 6H, and I). Triple staining of BAT section showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 6J and K). In addition, an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from Nrn1 mice was also detected (Fig. 6J and L). In all, these data suggest an enhanced BAT metabolism and thermogenesis upon Nrn1 expression.

In keeping with this view, we detected an increased expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the AAV-Nrn1-treated group (Fig. 6M), and also an enhanced expression of phosphorylated HSL, active PKA, UCP1 (Fig. 6N and O). We also detected that chronic overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipocytes enhanced the expression of OXPHOS subunits relevant in respiratory complexes I and II but not for CV (Fig. S8I and J). The Nrn1 group also showed a reduction in adipose cell size in visceral and subcutaneous depots (Fig. S8K and L).

Mice subjected to a HFD were also treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Nrn1-treated mice showed increased Nrn1 gene expression in BAT and ING adipose tissue (Fig. 7A), and no differences in plasma levels were detected between groups (Fig. S9A). AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower rate of body weight and fat mass gain compared to control mice (Fig. 7B and C) in the absence of alterations in lean mass (Fig. S9B). Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and lipid oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. 7D, E, and S9C). Under these conditions, food intake was not altered (Fig. S9D), and nocturnal ambulation was enhanced in these mice (Fig. S9E). These mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides and leptin, and normal glycemia (Fig. S9F–H). We also detected an enhanced expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the Nrn1 group (Fig. 7F).

As we found that enhanced Nrn1 expression activates brown adipose tissue, we next analyzed the mechanisms involved. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq assays using BAT samples from AAV-Nrn1-treated and control mice. 218 genes were significantly upregulated and 249 were downregulated by Nrn1 expression (p < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enhanced abundance of Hallmark Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Adipogenesis pathways in response to chronic NRN1 (Fig. 7G and H). Analysis of GO Cellular Compartment GSEA revealed that most of the genes upregulated were mitochondrial (encoding for mitochondrial proteins) (Fig. 7I). The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. Our data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure (Fig. 7J). These data indicate the existence of common processes operating in Nrn1 overexpressing BAT and upon cold exposure.

We performed cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics from control and Nrn1 overexpressing BAT tissues, and we detected and increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells (Fig. 7K), which was parallel to an increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 7L and M). Moreover, a reduced abundance of myelinated Schwann cells was also detected (Fig. S9I). In all, these data indicate a sympathetic remodeling in BAT by Nrn1 involved an increased proliferation of non-myelinated Schwann cells.

To further analyze whether Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we repressed Nrn1 in primary brown preadipocytes using lentiviruses encoding shRNA (Fig. 8A). These cells showed a normal differentiation and the expression of protein markers such as PPARγ2, PPARγ1, UCP1 and HSL was indistinguishable from that observed in control adipocytes (Fig. 8B and S9J). Given these observations, we monitored the acute stimulatory response of brown adipocytes to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol39. Isoproterenol activated the phosphorylation of HSL and other PKA substrates in control brown adipocytes (Fig. 8C–E). This activation was markedly reduced in Nrn1-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. 8C–E). Isoproterenol also induced crucial genes, such as Ppargc1a and Ucp1, in control cells (Fig. 8F, and G). This process was largely repressed in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. 8F and G). We also analyzed the effects of Nrn1 deficiency on mitochondrial respiration in brown adipocytes. In control brown adipocytes, mitochondrial respiration was reduced upon addition of oligomycin, and isoproterenol increased mitochondrial respiration to values close to those measured in the presence of FCCP (maximal respiration) (Fig. 8H). Depletion of Nrn1 reduced the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration, and also maximal mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 8H). Under these conditions basal respiration or ATP-coupled respiration were unaltered in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. 8I). The reduced response to isoproterenol was not a consequence of changes in the expression of β3-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 8J and K). In all, these results indicate that Nrn1 protein is synthesized by brown adipocytes and that it can modulate the metabolism of brown adipocytes and their capacity to respond to catecholamines.

To analyze whether extracellularly present Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we have expressed and purified mouse recombinant NRN1 to homogeneity (Fig. 8L). Next, we incubated brown adipocytes with recombinant NRN1 (100 ng/ml). Short-term incubation with recombinant NRN1 enhanced the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates in brown adipocytes (Fig. 8M). In addition, NRN1 caused a marked induction of Ucp1 and Ppargc1a gene expression in brown adipocytes (Fig. 8N and O). NRN1 also increased the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 8P). Long-term incubation of brown adipocytes with NRN1 enhanced the expression of NDUFB8 subunit of the respiratory complex I (Fig. 8Q and R). These results clearly reveal a thermogenic effect of extracellular NRN1 in brown adipocytes, and further suggest that NRN1 has the capacity to act as an autocrine/paracrine factor in brown adipose tissue.

The results reported here support the following highlights: a) RAP250 protein is a key component of energy homeostasis and it modulates BAT metabolism; b) RAP250 deficiency in brown adipose cells induces the expression of Nrn1, a factor until now unknown as a regulator of BAT biology; c) AAV-mediated overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells improves energy expenditure and stimulates BAT metabolism; d) Nrn1 repression disrupts the metabolism of brown adipocytes, an observation that indicates an autonomous cellular response; and e) exogenous mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue.

Our findings reveal that RAP250 plays a key role in maintaining energy metabolism and adiposity in mice. We demonstrate that RAP250 deficiency upregulates energy metabolism, reduces adiposity, and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice. In addition, we found that global RAP250 deficiency in these animals stimulates BAT metabolism and that local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT reduces adiposity and enhances global glucose oxidation and BAT UCP1 expression. In addition, we document that RAP250 expression is markedly attenuated in BAT in response to cold, and is also reduced in brown adipocytes by phosphodiesterase inhibitors suggesting a regulatory role of cAMP. Based on all these data, we propose that RAP250 regulates energy metabolism, most likely through the modulation of the metabolic activity of BAT. In keeping with these data, many common variants of RAP250 show a very strong association with hip circumference-adjusted BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NCOA6)40 (Fig. S9). This observation points to the participation of RAP250 in human metabolism.

Our data indicate that RAP250 deficiency causes leanness in mice as a result of increased BAT metabolism and energy expenditure. We are aware of different studies indicating that

RAP250 plays a key role in white adipogenesis under in vitro conditions27. Thus, the transcriptional activity of PPARγ is impaired in RAP250 KO mouse embryo fibroblasts27,41,42, and these cells are refractory to PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis27. Future studies are required to proof that RAP250 indeed controls in vivo white adipogenesis. RAP250 also regulates liver metabolism, and its inactivation disrupts hepatic lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity23,24,43. This combined set of changes explains the phenotype of RAP250-deficient mice, namely reduced gain of adiposity and lack of ectopic fat deposition in tissues under conditions of nutritional overload.

The enhanced energy expenditure of RAP250+/− mice was linked to greater glucose oxidation under a normal diet and to increased lipid oxidation upon HFD conditions. Moreover, these animals showed an enhanced BAT metabolism that was characterized by large transcriptomic alterations, increased glucose oxidation, improved mitochondrial respiration, high expression of key genes Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Ppargc1a, Ucp1 and Dio2, and increased expression of proteins UCP1, PPARγ and C/EBPα. Two additional experimental findings revealed that BAT plays a major primary role in the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice. Thus, local repression of RAP250 protein mediated by the injection of AAV shRAP250 particles into the interscapular BAT depot of wild-type mice phenocopied many of the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice, including reduced body weight, lower fat mass, and enhanced glucose oxidation. These effects were specific to RAP250 repression in BAT, because a similar genetic manipulation of RAP250 in PAT did not have metabolic consequences. A second observation came from the exposure of RAP250-deficient mice to thermoneutrality, which inactivates BAT thermogenesis. Under these conditions, marginal or no differences in body weight, fat mass or glucose tolerance were detectable between control and RAP250+/− mice. Moreover, the combination of thermoneutrality and a HFD, the latter enhancing the thermogenic activity of BAT35,44, maintained the differences in body weight, fat mass, and glucose tolerance normally appearing in RAP250-deficient mice. In all, our data strongly support the view that RAP250 modulates energy expenditure through the regulation of BAT activity in such a way that primary changes in BAT function lead to alterations in adiposity.

Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), originally termed candidate plasticity-related gene 15 or Cpg15, was identified as a gene induced by the glutamate analogue kainate in the hippocampus dentate gyrus30. Nrn1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuropeptide expressed in postmitotic neurons and it regulates synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, and neuronal migration and survival29,31,32,45,46,47. It is also involved in memory and learning48. Moreover, Nrn1 operates in cells other than neurons. In this regard, it is also produced by follicular regulatory T cells, and it acts on B cells to suppress autoantibody development against tissue-specific antigens49. In addition, this protein is expressed in tissues such as the placenta, lung and spleen50. In this study, we have identified that Nrn1 is synthesized in BAT and induced in RAP250-deficient conditions. Our data support the notion that Nrn1 plays a key role in BAT metabolism.

In this study, we document that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT under conditions of RAP250 deficiency. Given the observation that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT upon local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression, we support the notion that RAP250 locally modulates Nrn1 gene expression in BAT. Moreover, we document that Nrn1 is abundantly expressed in brown adipocytes and that its expression is regulated during differentiation state at translational or post-translational levels. As RAP250 participates in COMPASS-related complexes containing the H3K4 methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL420,21,51, we propose that RAP250 repression drives epigenetic changes, thus causing an enhanced expression of Nrn1. The intricacy of those complexes is high, and MLL3 and MLL4 induce monomethylation of H3K4 at enhancer regions, whereas another enzyme in MLL3 and MLL4 COMPASS, namely UTX, demethylates H3K27me3, a modification associated with transcription repression by the Polycomb group of proteins52,53.

Here, we also demonstrate that Nrn1 expressed in brown adipose cells causes the local activation of BAT metabolism and thermogenesis. Thus, the expression of Nrn1 in thermogenic adipose cells causes the activation of energy expenditure under normal conditions or upon an HFD. Under these conditions, we also detected a reduction in body weight gain. This occurred in parallel to an enhanced expression of BAT metabolic genes, including Prdm16, Ppargc1a, Cidea, Cpt1a, Hsl, and Dio2. RNA-Seq assays revealed the existence of a metabolic reprogramming in response to chronic NRN1 expression in BAT characterized by the induction of mitochondrial genes and also genes relevant in adipose cell differentiation. The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. In all, these data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure.

The effects of Nrn1 in BAT seem to be largely local. In this regard, the changes in energy expenditure or in BAT gene expression detected upon overexpression of Nrn1 in BAT occurred in the absence of alterations in the plasma levels of Nrn1. At a cellular level, Nrn1 seems to operate through an autocrine/paracrine mode of action. In this context, we detected that Nrn1 is secreted from brown adipocytes and that this secretion is significantly enhanced in the presence of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. In addition, we found that Nrn1 repression in brown adipose cells does not alter differentiation, but it markedly reduces the response to isoproterenol. Nrn1 groups with local-acting factors, such as BMP8b, which are secreted by brown adipocytes and activate BAT metabolism16,54. Interestingly, some common variants of the Nrn1 gene show a very strong association with BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NRN1), which suggests that Nrn1 participates in human metabolism.

Interestingly, incubation of brown adipocytes with mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue. The specific receptors for NRN1 have not been definitively identified. To date, no canonical, high-affinity cell surface receptor has been unequivocally demonstrated55. Moreover, NRN1 is not part of a known ligand family like neurotrophins or FGFs, and it does not display any conserved domain homologous to these or other classical signaling molecules56. Several studies have proposed indirect mechanisms or potential receptor candidates for NRN1. For instance, cross-talk between NRN1 and insulin signaling has been observed, suggesting that neuritin may enhance or depend on insulin receptor pathways for its effects57. Notably, pharmacological blockade of the insulin receptor, but not the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, abrogated these effects, indicating a specific involvement of the insulin receptor in neuritin signaling. In addition, there is evidence that neuritin interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) to mediate axonal branching in granule neurons. Immunoprecipitation assays have revealed a strong association between neuritin and FGFR1, and inhibition or knockdown of FGFR1 significantly suppressed neuritin-induced axonal branching, suggesting that FGFR1 plays a critical role in neuritin's effects on neuronal development58. Regarding downstream signaling, activation of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways has been observed following neuritin 1 treatment, consistent with its role in promoting cell survival and growth57,59. It is also likely that Nrn1-receptor complex undergoes internalization, which may be relevant in further signaling49.

In our study, we further demonstrate that neuritin 1 can rapidly activate protein kinase A signaling in brown adipocytes. Altogether, these findings suggest that neuritin 1 acts pleiotropically, modulating multiple pathways depending on the cellular context. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its actions remain to be fully elucidated and warrant dedicated investigation.

On the basis of our findings, we conclude that Nrn1 is a key regulator of brown adipocytes, it performs trophic actions, and it preserves the capacity to respond to catecholamines, a crucial physiological characteristic of brown adipocytes. We do not exclude the possibility that Nrn1 exerts a neurotropic action in BAT. In fact, Nrn1 overexpression caused an increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression and enhanced abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in BAT, supporting a role on sympathetic innervation in this tissue. Given the properties of Nrn1, it emerges as a potentially useful protein for targeting energy expenditure in humans.

RAP250 heterozygous mice, with a null mutation in the RAP250 gene, were used in this study42. Briefly, exons 7 and 8 were replaced with the neo gene which is flanked by a 5-kb homologous region on each side42. All animal work was conducted following the guidelines established by the Animal Care Committees of the “Parc Científic de Barcelona” and the University of Barcelona.

Heterozygous female mice were crossed either with C57BL/6J male or heterozygous male mice to obtain control and heterozygous littermates. Mice were kept under a 12 h dark/light cycle and provided a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. For the high-fat diet (HFD) experiments, 10-week-old male mice were fed a standard diet or HFD for 15–20 weeks (10% or 60% calories from fat, D12492 and D12450B; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Animals were fasted for 16 h (17:00–9:00) in glucose tolerance and glucose turnover tests. In thermoneutrality experiments, 8-week-old mice were kept for 22 weeks at 30 °C either under a standard chow diet or HFD. Mice were kindly gifted by the Mouse Mutant Core Facility at IRB Barcelona.

At the times indicated in figure legends, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Interscapular BAT (BAT), Perigonadal Adipose Tissue (PAT), Inguinal adipose tissue (ING), liver, gastrocnemius and heart were collected and used for RNA purification, protein extraction, or histology. Plasma was obtained by cardiac punction. All animal experiments were done in compliance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Barcelona Science Park and University of Barcelona (Protocol number 9279, approved by the Department of Territory and Sustainability, General Directorate of Environmental Policies and the Natural Environment, Government of Catalonia).

Single-stranded AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were generated and produced by the “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” (www.viralvector.eu) at the UAB. The sequence used to repress RAP250 was 5'-ACACATACCTCAGAACATA-3'. AAV-UCP1 empty and AAV-UCP1-Nrn1 vectors were generated by Vector Biosystems and produced by “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” at the UAB. The Vector plasmid pAAV-UCP1-m-Nrn1 contains the mouse Neuritin 1 (1-142Aa) including the signal peptide and C-terminal GPI.

The AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were administered as reported60. For BAT infection, 1 × 1010 of the total viral genome (vg) of AAV9 Scr or Sh was administered (4 × 10 μl of viral solution) per BAT depot to 8-week-old male mice. For PAT infection, 1 × 1011 of the total vg of AAV9 Scr or Sh was administered (50 μl of viral solution) to each PAT depot of 10-week-old male mice.

In Nrn1 protein overexpression experiments, 1.5 × 1012 of the total viral genome (vg) was intravascularly administered (by tail) to 8-week-old C57BL6J male mice. For HFD experiments, the diet was changed the day after the infection.

Mice were placed individually in metabolic cages and acclimatised for 24 h before measuring food intake over four consecutive days. Feeding was accessed by evaluating the food remaining in a 24-h period.

Blood samples were collected between 10:00 and 12:00 either after an overnight fast or under fed conditions; they were obtained by tail vein snip of unrestrained mice. Plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until assay. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were determined using the UltraSensitive Mouse Insulin Elisa Kit and Mouse Leptin Elisa Kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove IL, USA); adiponectin with the Quantikine Adiponectin kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA); and cholesterol and triglycerides with BioSystems Kits (Costa Brava, Spain). Blood glucose was assayed with an Accu-Chek glucose monitor and reactive strips (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) directly in blood drops from conscious mice.

were performed as described in ref. 61. Blood was collected, and glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at different time points.

The mice were fasted for 6 h before the infusions. The animals were connected to the infusion apparatus 2 h before the start of the infusions and had free access to water. Whole-body glucose utilization rate was determined under euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions. Under physiological hyperinsulinemic conditions, insulin was infused at a rate of 4 mU/kg·min for 3 h, and D-[3H]3-glucose at a rate of 30 μCi/kg·min. Throughout the infusion, blood glucose was determined from blood samples (3.5 μL) collected from the tip of the tail vein with a blood glucose meter when needed. Euglycemia was maintained by periodically adjusting a variable infusion of 10% or 16.5% glucose. Plasma glucose concentrations and D-[3H]3-glucose-specific activity were determined in 5 μL of blood sampled from the tip of the tail vein every 10 min during the last hour of the infusion, as reported62.

Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine by i.p. injection and positioned face down, with both legs fully extended, in a SkyScan 1076 high-resolution micro-CT scanner (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) mouse bed. 360° scans of the abdominal region were made at a rotation step of 0.8° and an isotropic voxel size of 35 μm; Source 50 kV/200 µA and 1.0 mm aluminium filter. Scans were reconstructed and analyzed using the NRecon and CTAn software provided by SkysScan. The region of interest (ROI) for each animal was defined based on skeletal landmarks from the gray-scale reconstructed images (between femoral head and L5 vertebra). Data are expressed as percentage of fat on a ROI: Fat Volume/ Total ROI Volume X 10063. Fat mass was also measured using magnetic resonance with EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer.

An indirect calorimetry system (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments) was used to measure oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), and ambulation. The experiment included two days of acclimation and a third day (24 h) of valid data recording. Average RER index (VCO2 ml/h produced/VO2 ml/h consumed); Energy Expenditure (Kcal/h/Kg) [defined as VO2x(3.815 + 1.232xRER)/1000]; Glucose Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [(4.545xVCO2)-(3.205xVO2)] /1000]; and Lipid Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [1.672x(VO2-VCO2)]/1000] were calculated from VO2 and VCO2 data. To remove variance in metabolic parameters derived from differences in body weight between animals, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. ANCOVA is a robust method to compare groups with divergent body weights and composition64,65. For data obtained in mice on a normal diet, values of O2 consumption and CO2 production were referred to an adjusted mean body weight of 25.8071 g determined with ANCOVA, using body weight as a covariate in WT and RAP250 male mice in normal diet. In acute cold exposure studies, a Sable Systems Promethion Core was used. In these studies, mice were acclimated to the cages during 4 days at 22 °C and subjected to 4 °C during 8 hours. Mice were sacrificed and brown adipose tissues were collected.

Mouse body composition was measured using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance with the EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer.

Glucose oxidation was determined using radioactive glucose (D-[U]-14C-glucose, Amersham Biosciences).

30-week-old male mice were killed by cervical dislocation; BAT was harvested and kept in cold Washing Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA (Albumin bovine serum, fraction V, minimum 96% lyophilized)), until further processing. BAT samples were then transferred to Digestion Buffer (KRBH solution, 3.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 mg/ml glucose (D(+)- glucose anhydrous), 1 mg/ml Collagenase type II from Clostridium histolyticum), at a ratio of 10 ml Digestion Buffer per gram of tissue. They were then mechanically minced and allowed to digest at 37 °C and under 250 rpm shaking for 30'−1 h. Undigested material was discarded by using a 100-μm strainer. The BAT digestion solution was diluted (to lower collagenase activity) and used directly. For glucose oxidation, 0.5 ml adipocyte solution was incubated for 4 h with 0.5 ml Oxidation Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA, 5 mmol/L glucose, 1 μCi/mL (D-[U]-14C-glucose) in 6-well plates, and CO2 was collected as in ref. 61. Data are expressed as nmol of glucose/h corrected by DNA content. Glucose oxidation from wild-type tissues was used as 100% value.

Approximately 1-mm3 pieces of BAT were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer. The protocol is described in ref. 66. Sections were observed under a JEM-1010 electron microscope (Jeol, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera SIS Megaview III and the AnalySIS software.

BAT, adipose tissue depots and liver were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in methanol and then paraffin-embedded. Sections were subjected to standard Hematoxylin/Eosin (HE) staining. Images were acquired with a NanoZoomer-2.0 HT C9600 digital scanner (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France) equipped with a 20X objective and coupled to a mercury lamp unit L11600-05 and using NDP.scan2.5 software U10074-03 (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France). Adipocyte area was measured using open software ImageJ (W. Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Liver fat content was estimated from HE-stained slides using the CTAn software (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). DAPI/Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)/UCP1 staining was performed as reported67.

RNA from various tissues was extracted using a protocol combining TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNAeasy® minikit columns (Qiagen. Alameda, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript RTII kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Ca, USA). PCRs were performed using the ABI Prism 7900 HT real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA), or Taqman Master Mix. The thermal protocol was 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15'/95 °C–60'/60 °C. All measurements for mouse mRNA were normalized to Arp. For each designed primer set, a melting curve of PCR products was performed to verify unspecific amplification or primer-dimer formation. The results were analyzed with the system SDS software. The primers used are specified in Table S2.

Total DNA was extracted from mouse interscapular BAT, inguinal subcutaneous Adipose tissue (SAT) and perigonadal adipose tissue (PAT). Tissue was digested with proteinase K (Merck Life Science S.L.U., 03115801001) and total DNA was purified using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504). Total cellular DNA (1 ng DNA) is used as a template and is amplified with specific primers for Cox2 gene, as a mitochondrial gene (Cox2f: CTACAAGACGCCACAT and Cox2r: GAGAGGGGAGAGCAAT) and for Sdha gene, as a nuclear gene (Sdhaf: TACTACAGCCCCAAGTCT, Sdhar: TGGACCCATCTTCTATGC) by Real-Time PCR using SYBRGreen. The ratio genomic-nuclear DNA/ mtDNA was calculated.

The concentration of total RNA in preparations was quantified with Nanodrop One (Thermo Fisher), and RNA integrity was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA Nano assay (Agilent). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared at IRB Barcelona's Functional Genomics Core Facility. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from 1.2 μg of total RNA using the kit NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). NGS libraries for RNA-seq were prepared from the purified mRNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Seven (WT/RAP250) and eight (Control/UCP1-NRN1) cycles of PCR amplification were applied to all libraries. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) and quality controlled with the Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA HS assay (Agilent), for WT/RAP250 BAT, and Tapestation HS D5000 assay (Agilent) for Control/NRN1 BAT.

For WT/RAP250 BAT RNA-seq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to sequencing at the Centre for Genomic Regulation. A final qPCR quality control was performed before sequencing in one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequencing output was 270 million 50-bp single-end reads, and at least 28 million reads were obtained for all samples.

For Control/UCP1 BAT RNAseq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to paired-end 150 nt sequencing on a NovaSeq6000 S4 (Illumina). More than 121 Gbp of reads were produced, with a minimum of 39 million of paired-end reads per sample.

FastQ files were aligned against the Mus musculus mm10 genome with STAR 2.5.2b68 using default options. Aligned reads were used to obtain raw counts at mm10 NCBI RefSeq gene level using featureCounts from Rsubread version 1.32.469 with options minMQS=1. DESeq2 1.22.270 was used to find differentially expressed genes in KO vs WT. Genes were selected as differentially expressed with thresholds |FC| > 1.5 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P < 0.1. For functional enrichment analysis (GSEA), regularized log transformation (rlog) was applied to read counts using DESeq2 and rotation gene set testing using the maxmean statistic was performed71. For cell type deconvolution analyses, the DWLS algorithm (https://github.com/dtsoucas/DWLS) was used with reference single cell data obtained from ref. 72. All analyses were performed in R-3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2018).

Immortalized brown preadipocytes were generated as described in refs. 67,73. Retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40 LT-Puro antigen was purchased from Addgene. Cells were grown in monolayer culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). The differentiation process is described in ref. 67.

Immortalized brown preadipocytes were also used to generate the NRN1 deficiency model. Lentivirus encoding for a shRNA scramble or against Nrn1 (TRCN0000177415 validated clone from Merk), as control (SCR) or knockdown (shNRN1), were produced in HEK 293 T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) as reported74. Transduced cells were selected based on Puromycin resistance (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-108071; 3 μg/ml).

Adipocyes and SVF were obtained as reported75,76.

A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 28-115 inclusive of mouse Neuritin (Accession number NM_153529) was amplified using the following semi-nested primers:

NRN1fwdout gcgtagctgaaaccggccaccatcaccatcaccatgctagcgaaaacctgtattttcagg

NRN1fwdin caccatgctagcgaaaacctgtattttcaggcgggcaagtgtgatgcagtctttaagggc

NRN1rev cggcctcgagcggccgcTTagttgctgctgccgcagagttcgaataagctg

and KOD polymerase. The resulting 343 bp fragment was purified using AMPure (Beckman Coulter) before InFusion (Takara Bio) into KpnI and NotI-cut pOPINTTG77. The resulting construct will produce the following protein when expressed in mammalian cells:

MGILPSPGMPALLSLVSLLSVLLMGCVA ↓ETGHHHHHHASENLYFQ↓AGKCDAVFKGFSDCLLKLGDSMANYPQGLDDKTNIKTVCTYWEDFHSCTVTALTDCQEGAKDMWDKLRKESKNLNIQGSLFELCGSSN*. The protein consists of the µ-phosphatase signal peptide (with signal peptidase site indicated, first ↓, a Hexa-histidine tag and TEV cleavage site (indicated, second ↓) followed by amino acids 28-115 of mouse Neuritin. This protein will be secreted, can be purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and can then be cleaved with TEV protease to produce mature ‘soluble' NRN1 (this construct is truncated to also exclude the GPI-anchored G116).

293-6E cells78 were cultured in shaken flasks in F-17 Freestyle media (Gibco) supplemented with GlutaMax, Poloxamer 188 and G418 (final concentrations of 4 mM, 0.1% and 25 µg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At a density of approximately 2.0 × 106 cells/ml cells were transfected with a 1:4 polyplex of plasmid DNA:PEI MAXX at a concentration of 1 mg plasmid DNA/litre of cells. After 24 h the media was supplemented with sterile TN1 solution (Tryptone N1, TekniScience Inc. to 0.5% w/v in F-17 Freestyle media). After a further 96 hours the media was cleared by pelleting the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g then 5000 g followed filtration through Whatman 3 M paper filters. All further steps were performed at 4 °C.

Urea was added to a final concentration of 4 M and the pH adjusted to pH 7.5 before the sample was applied to a 5 ml Excel IMAC column equilibrated with IMAC Wash Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 4 M, Imidazole 20 mM, DTT 2 mM). His-NRN was eluted with IMAC Elution Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 4 M, Imidazole 500 mM, DTT 2 mM). His-NRN containing fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged to Digest Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 500 mM, Urea 2 M, DTT 2 mM) using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column before the addition of His-tagged TEV protease at a 1:25 His-TEV:His-NRN ratio and incubation overnight at 4 °C.

The TEV-digested sample was first passed through a 1 ml Excel HisTrap column to capture uncut His-NRN and His-TEV before size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Superdex 30 pg 16/600 column equilibrated with Tris pH8 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 6 M, DTT 2 mM, EDTA 2 mM.

Peak fractions were buffer exchanged (as before, using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column) into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use.

Adipocytes (Scr and shNRN1) at day 10 of differentiation were stimulated with Isoproterenol (10 uM) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 2 h. Cells were lysed to obtain RNA or total cell extracts. Media was kept and centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000 × g for 20 min to remove any precipitate and then stored at −20 °C.

For the detection of proteins phosphorylated by PKA (p-PKA substrates) control adipocytes were washed in PBS twice and were incubated during two hours in media without serum. Cells were treated with NRN1 at different concentration during 2 h and then total cell extracts were obtained.

For NRN1 chronic studies, brown adipocytes at day 4 of differentiation were treated with NRN1 at 100 ng/ml in the presence of differentiation medium. NRN1 was maintained during all the process of differentiation.

Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (ROCHE)) for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Tissue samples were homogenized in 10 vol of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] with a disperser homogenizer (Ika Ultra-Turrax® T25basic, S25N-10G probe). Homogenates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C in an orbital shaker and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins from total homogenates were resolved in 8% (RAP250 detection) or 10% acrylamide gels for SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Proteins were detected by the ECL method and quantified by densitometry using Genetools from Syngene or by NIR-fluorescence detected with LI-COR Odyssey System and measured with Image Studio software.

The following antibodies were used: RAP250 (ASC2 antibody BL1874, Bethyl laboratories and NCOA6 polyclonal antibody 25241-1_AP, Proteintech); p-HSL (S563, #4139), HSL (#4107), P-PKA substrates (#9624), βactin (AC-15, SIGMA); α-tubulin (SIGMA); Vinculin (Abcam); GAPDH (2118S, Cell Signaling), UCP1 (ab10983 Abcam); PPARγ and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz); total OXPHOS rodent WB antibody cocktail (ab110413, Abcam), ADRB3 (bs-1063R Bioss Antibodies), NRN1 (B-9 Santa Cruz and AF283 from Biotechne R&D Systems); TH (R&D Systems MAB7566SP and ab6211 from Abcam).

Preadipocytes (Scr/ ShNRN1) were plated, grown and differentiated as it is described in ref. 67 For NRN1 treated cells, recombinant NRN1 protein was added chronically at day 4 of differentiation until d9-d10 at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Media was changed every two days. Seahorse experiments were performed as reported79.

Neuritin 1 (NRN1) ELISA Kit (Catalog No: abx155876, Abbexa) was used to measure Nrn1 from mouse plasma and cell culture media. 75 μl of plasma and 300 μl of culture media were used following a commercial protocol.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed t-Student test, or by two-way ANOVA (Šidak's multiple comparisons test or by an Ordinary two-way ANOVA), or by Covariance (ANCOVA) with weight as the covariate. Significance was established at P < 0.05.

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are widely recognized for their role in translation. Here, we describe a previously unidentified function of tRNA as an assembly chaperone. During poxviral infection, tRNAGln/Arg lacking the anticodon mcm5s2U34 modification is specifically sequestered from the cellular tRNA pool to promote formation of a multisubunit poxviral RNA polymerase complex (vRNAP). Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of assembly intermediates illustrates how tRNAGln/Arg orchestrates the recruitment of transcription and mRNA processing factors to vRNAP where it controls the transition to the preinitiation complex. This is achieved by an induced fit mechanism that internalizes anticodon base G36 into the anticodon stem, creating a noncanonical tRNA structure and selecting a defined tRNA modification pattern. The role of tRNA as an assembly chaperone extends to the pathogenic Mpox virus, which features a similar vRNAP.

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are best known for their role in decoding mRNA codons and translating them into proteins1. However, certain tRNAs are also involved in a variety of noncanonical functions including nutrient sensing2, splicing3, transcription4, apoptosis5 and scaffolding6, as reviewed by Su et al.7. In these contexts, tRNAs or their fragments can act as antisense decoys, protein modulators, primers or sensors. Recently, human tRNAGln and, to a lesser extent, tRNAArg have been identified in a cellular context that is not consistent with any of the established functions of tRNAs. Specifically, these tRNAs (termed tRNAGln/Arg throughout this manuscript) were found to be a stoichiometric component of a macromolecular RNA polymerase complex, known as complete vRNAP, which forms in cells upon infection with the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia8.This virus belongs to the diverse group of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses, comprising double-stranded DNA viruses that express their genome within the cytoplasm of their host using their own gene expression machinery9,10. The megadalton complete vRNAP unit integrates the poxviral core RNA polymerase (core vRNAP), composed of eight Rpo subunits, with early transcription factors Rap94, VETF-s, VETF-l, NPH-I and E11, the capping enzyme dimer D1/D12 and host tRNAGln/Arg.

We showed previously that recruited tRNAGln/Arg is uncharged and tethers associated factors to vRNAP through interactions with Rap94, NPH-I and VETF-l (ref. 8). Consistent with its biochemical composition, complete vRNAP acts as an autonomous early transcription unit capable of generating m7G-capped transcripts8,11. Notably, tRNAGln/Arg, although part of this complex, is not directly involved in transcription and is absent from all DNA-bound transcription complexes identified to date. We, therefore, hypothesized that these tRNAs do not function as transcription factors but rather as chaperones that control the association of vRNAP with adjunct factors required for early transcription. Here, we combined a biochemical reconstitution system with structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the assembly pathway of complete vRNAP. Our study uncovers an unknown function of a specific tRNA as an assembly chaperone and reveals a unique induced fit mechanism that involves structural rearrangement of the tRNA, enabling complex formation.

To test whether tRNAGln/Arg acts as an assembly chaperone rather than a scaffold, we dissected the steps that lead to the formation of complete vRNAP. We isolated a minimal version of vRNAP, consisting of the eight Rpo subunits, only as a presumed starting point of assembly. This unit, along with recombinant transcription factors (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and tRNAGln/Arg isolated from complete vRNAP, was then used to study the formation of complete vRNAP in vitro (Fig. 1a). Cosedimentation and gel mobility shift experiments showed that [32P]tRNAGln/Arg alone failed to bind minimal vRNAP (Fig. 1b, bottom, gradient profiles 1–4) or any of the individual transcription factors (Fig. 1c, lanes 14–20). However, tRNAGln/Arg bound weakly to core vRNAP (minimal vRNAP associated with Rap94), forming the first detectable, albeit unstable, tRNA-associated vRNAP complex (I2*; Fig. 1b, bottom). Transition to specific and stable tRNAGln/Arg binding occurred only in the presence of Rap94, NPH-I and E11, as demonstrated by band shift assays (Fig. 1c, lane 9), whereas omission of any of the adjunct factors prevented complex formation (Fig. 1c, lanes 2–8,10 and 11). Of note, none of these factors bound stably to each other (Extended Data Fig. 1b) or to core vRNAP in the absence of tRNAGln/Arg (Extended Data Fig. 1c), illustrating its crucial role in assembly. However, weak background binding activity can be attributed to existent invariable contact surfaces involving these three components, as documented in the structure of complete vRNAP. Once tRNAGln/Arg was stably bound (Fig. 1c, lane 9), D1/D12 also readily associated with vRNAP (Fig. 1c, lanes 12 and 13) whereas the VETF-s/l heterodimer was not required for these assembly steps, as discussed below. The fully assembled complete vRNAP exhibited remarkable stability, as evidenced by its inability to bind or exchange [32P] tRNAGln/Arg (Fig. 1b, bottom, gradient profiles 3 and 4).

Minimal and core vRNAPs were isolated from infected cells by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography; factors D1/D12, E11 and NPH-I were expressed in E. coli and purified as described in the Methods. tRNAGln/Arg was obtained from purified complete vRNAP as described in the Methods. b, Top, silver-stained protein gel of fractions from a sucrose density gradient centrifugation of isolated vRNAP complexes. tRNAGln/Arg from purified vRNAP was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Bottom, [32P]tRNAGln/Arg was incubated with the indicated vRNAP complexes, separated by gradient centrifugation and analyzed by autoradiography. The experiment was performed in triplicate. c, Gel mobility shift assays of core vRNAP and recombinant factors in the presence of [32P]tRNAGln/Arg.

Source data

The simultaneous requirement of E11, NPH-I, Rap94 and tRNAGln/Arg for the formation of complete vRNAP suggested a complex binding mechanism, potentially involving conformational changes among interacting partners. Using our biochemical reconstitution system, we leveraged cryo-EM to decipher the mechanism of assembly by visualizing critical intermediates. Atomic structures of the intermediates (labeled I1–I5) were then used to propose an assembly cycle that configures complete vRNAP and enables its subsequent conversion into the preinitiation complex (PIC), ready to initiate transcription at an early promoter (Figs. 2 and 3).

Isosurface representations of cryo-EM structures are shown and crucial structural elements are labeled. The intermediates are labeled I3–I5 according to their occurrence in the presumed assembly cycle. The color code of the individual factors is identical to that of Figs. 1, 3 and 4. Each structure is shown in a standard view that corresponds to that used in Fig. 3 and an additional view with 40° rotation. Rpo30 is highlighted in ochre only for minimal vRNAP. Note that, in general, all bound factors occupy corresponding positions; therefore, the visualized structures document an incremental buildup, eventually yielding to complete vRNAP in the absence of major conformational reorganizations (full assembly cycle in Fig. 3).

A model of the tRNA-chaperoned assembly cycle was derived from biochemical and structural data of this study and is illustrated by solved and available atomic structures, the latter of which are labeled with their PDB codes. tRNA refers to tRNAGln/Arg. Assembly intermediates, shown as accessible molecular surface, are labeled according to their appearance during the assembly cycle: I1, core vRNAP (PDB 6RIC); I2*, metastable core vRNAP–tRNA (no experimental structure available); I3, core vRNAP–tRNAGln/Arg–E11–NPH-I; I4, complete vRNAP–VETF-s/l; I5, complete vRNAP lacking the capping enzyme (complete vRNAP–D1/D12). The starting point is minimal vRNAP and the endpoint is PIC on an early promoter (PDB 7AMV). *Transient intermediate that can be detected only by biochemical means (Fig. 1b, bottom, gradient profile 2). #Conformational change in the tRNA assembly chaperone.

We first determined the structure of minimal vRNAP (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Table 1). A comparison with the already known structure of core vRNAP (assembly intermediate I1)8 (Fig. 3) illustrates how the multidomain protein Rap94 wraps around minimal vRNAP during the first step of the assembly process. In doing so, Rap94 adopts a conformation that remains stable throughout the whole assembly cycle (Extended Data Fig. 3). In agreement with our biochemical experiments (Fig. 1b), binding of tRNAGln/Arg to core vRNAP (assembly intermediate I2*) turned out to be too transient for structural analysis. However, the stable assembly intermediate I3 was accessible for cryo-EM reconstruction, revealing how E11 connects with NPH-I and facilitates tRNA binding to core vRNAP (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 4). tRNAGln/Arg is anchored through extensive interactions of its D-arm and T-arm and the anticodon stem with Rap94. Upon NPH-I binding, its N-lobe squeezes the tRNAGln/Arg anticodon stem loop (ASL) into a strained conformation. Notably, the interface of Rap94 with tRNAGln/Arg does not depend on specific base contacts; instead, several bases in the ASL are specifically recognized by the NPH-I C-lobe, as discussed below.

Full stability of the vRNAP complex is achieved by independently recruiting the VETF-s/l and D1/D12 heterodimers, forming either complete vRNAP–VETF (I4; Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1) or complete vRNAP–D1/D12 (I5; Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1), depending on which factor binds first. It is noteworthy that I5 was found in native vRNAP preparations, whereas I4 was only observed during reconstitution studies in vitro. It stands to reason that both intermediates enable alternative pathways leading to the assembly of complete vRNAP (Figs. 3 and 4). Notably, complete vRNAP is characterized by exceptional stability because of a belt-like structure formed by E11, NPH-I, tRNAGln/Arg, VETF-s/I and D1/D12 on the surface of core vRNAP (Fig. 4).

The color code of the individual factors is identical to that of Figs. 2 and 3. b, A similar isosurface representation to a, overlaid with a 20-Å lowpass-filtered density depicted as a magenta isosurface. This density can be attributed to mobile VETF. c, Electrostatic potential mapped to the complete vRNAP solvent-accessible surface. The orientation of both views is identical to those depicted in b. The lowpass-filtered density overlay shown in b is not presented here.

As shown previously12, complete vRNAP can bind to early viral promoters and reconfigures under the elimination of E11, NPH-I, D1/D12 and tRNAGln/Arg into the PIC. The transition of complete vRNAP to the PIC is tightly regulated by tRNAGln/Arg, which adopts a pose in complete vRNAP that blocks the access of VETF-s/l to the cleft in the absence of a cognate promoter (Fig. 4b). The presence of a cognate promoter, by contrast, enables the displacement of tRNAGln/Arg and PIC formation as the endpoint of the assembly pathway. tRNAGln/Arg, hence, orchestrates an assembly pathway without being a component of complete vRNAP, the final product (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 1).

To explore the details of the tRNA–protein interactions enabling the assembly process, we generated a high-resolution cryo-EM dataset of complete vRNAP and rerefined our previous structural model (Figs. 4a and 5a, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Table 1). Upon superimposing the structure of tRNAGln as part of complete vRNAP with other known tRNA structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we identified notable deviations in the base-pairing pattern of the anticodon stem. These differences were associated with a strained backbone conformation and the coordination of a magnesium ion (Fig. 5a–c). Similar rearrangements are possible for tRNAArg (Extended Data Fig. 7), as discussed below.

Sequences of several other tRNA species are threaded into the scheme for the other depictions. Unfavorable base pairing is indicated by two red bars; canonical base pairs are shown in gray and nonconical base pairs are shown in red. If present, pictograms in insets symbolize the relaxed (unbound) or strained (bound) states (Supplementary Video 2). Please note that there is no high-confidence tRNAArg(GCG) sequence available in the database.

Because no other experimental structure for human tRNAGln(UUG) existed in the database, we modeled its ground state starting from the available structure of bacterial tRNAGln13 and performed energy minimization. In the ground state, the three anticodon bases (U34, U35 and G36) are turned outward and U33 pairs with A37, forming the most distal base pair of the anticodon stem (Fig. 5d–f). In comparison, the most notable feature of the strained ASL conformation is the inward rotation of the anticodon base G36, which forms a hydrogen bond with U33, causing A37 to bulge outward (Fig. 5a–c) into a pocket located in the N-lobe of NPH-I (Fig. 5g). Therefore, the strained ASL conformation in complete vRNAP sharply contrasts with the relaxed ASL conformation (ground state) of free tRNA (Fig. 5b–e).

Lastly, we examined the RNA–protein interactions that might induce this strained conformation. In tRNAGln(UUG), the anticodon sequence comprises the bases U34, U35 and G36 (asterisks in Fig. 5a–g). The anticodon and the distal region of the anticodon arm are closely associated with the N-lobe of NPH-I, whose surface acts as a template, shaping the unusual stem-loop conformation. Interestingly, there is no specific interaction between the protein and the nucleic acid bases in most tRNA regions, except for a selective pocket accommodating U35, which seems poorly suited for any base other than a pyrimidine (Fig. 5g). This observation suggests that the selectivity for tRNAGln (and tRNAArg, as discussed below) cannot be attributed to protein–tRNA interactions alone.

To understand the strict selectivity for tRNAGln/Arg for the assembly of complete vRNAP, we next investigated the internal interactions and sequence constraints within the bound tRNA. Three specific conditions must be met for this interaction to occur. First, a noncanonical base pair must form between bases 33 and 36 at the distal position of the anticodon stem. Here, the imino group (N1) of G36 acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, binding to the carbonyl oxygen atom at C2 of U33 (limitation 1; Fig. 5b,c, yellow arrow, Supplementary Video 2, Extended Data Fig. 8, and Supplementary Table 1). This interaction requires a cytosine as the first base of the corresponding codon, as only a guanine at the anticodon position provides the necessary hydrogen-bond donor (Fig. 5h, yellow background). Second, the anticodon base at position 35 fits into a hydrophobic pocket on NPH-I that can only accommodate a pyrimidine (limitation 2; Fig. 5g, green arrow), necessitating a purine in the codon sequence (Fig. 5h, green background). Lastly, a noncanonical base pair must form between C32 and A38 in the anticodon stem. This pairing is compatible with five ASL sequences found in tRNAGln(UUG/CAG) and tRNAArg(UCG/CCG/ACG) but not with those found in tRNAHis, tRNAPro or tRNALeu (condition 3; Fig. 5h,i, and red arrow and background). Notably, tRNAArg(CCG) isoforms 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 deviate in that they feature a canonical U32–A38 base pair (Fig. 5i). These constraints ensure that only tRNAGln and tRNAArg can act as assembly factors for complete vRNAP. Accordingly, these tRNA species are exclusively selected upon poxviral infection, determined by quantitative tRNA sequencing of isolated complete vRNAP, as discussed below. We conclude that complete vRNAP assembly occurs through a novel tRNA recognition mechanism, where anticodon readout is determined by internal base pairing.

tRNAs belong to the most extensively modified noncoding RNA species14,15 and it was a possibility that specific modifications of tRNAGln/Arg influence its role in assembling the complete vRNAP complex. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that unmodified tRNAGln produced by transcription in vitro was less effective in promoting vRNAP assembly compared to tRNAGln/Arg extracted from complete vRNAP (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 8).

RNA was subsequently phenol-extracted, resolved by denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis and visualized by radioautography. In lanes 15–18, total tRNA from infected cells was digested with increasing concentrations of γ-toxin (500 nM, 1 µM and 5 µM), followed by TRIzol extraction. tRNAs were separated on a 12% denaturing gel, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with a 5′-end-labeled DNA probe complementary to the 3′-end of the tRNAGln(UUG) anticodon region.

Using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS)16 we determined the modification spectrum of vRNAP-associated tRNAGln/Arg and found the common modifications m1A, m5C, Cm, m1G, Gm and pseudouridine (Fig. 6b). We then evaluated whether the modified nucleotides, positioned as predicted, were consistent with their chemical environment in the complete vRNAP model and the surrounding cryo-EM density. Two positions met these criteria. For nucleotide 57 in the tRNA elbow, m1A fit the observed cryo-EM density better than its unmodified counterpart (Fig. 7a). In the anticodon stem at C32, Cm aligned well with the density and occupied a hydrophobic pocket partially formed by Y144 of Rap94 (Fig. 7b). The mcm5s2U modification at the wobble position U34 is a prominent feature of tRNAGln (ref. 17). Interestingly, this modification was missing in tRNA extracted from complete vRNAP (Fig. 6b). However, it was present in tRNAs from both infected (Fig. 6c) and noninfected cells (Fig. 6d), although it was less prevalent in the latter. Consistent with the LC–MS results, no cryo-EM density corresponding to the mcm5 group at the U34 base was observed in complete vRNAP (Fig. 7c, red arrow). Indeed, the presence of the mcm5s2U34 modification would likely result in unfavorable interactions with the adjacent N-lobe of NPH-I (Fig. 7d, red arrow). We corroborated these results by showing that γ-toxin endonuclease from Kluyveromyces lactis18 failed to cleave complete vRNAP-associated tRNAGln/Arg (Fig. 6e). Therefore, a selective mechanism ensures that only tRNAGln/Arg lacking the mcm5s2 modification at base U34 can drive the assembly of complete vRNAP.

The model of mcm5s2U at position 34 of the complete vRNAP model produces a clash or unfavorable interaction with surrounding residues from Rap94 and NPH-I (red arrow).

The tRNAGln/Arg-mediated assembly of complete vRNAP ensures the integration of all early transcription and processing factors into one stable unit. We hypothesized that this mechanism evolved to equip virions with precisely those components needed to start transcription upon infection. To test this prediction, purified vaccinia virions were analyzed for their RNA and protein content using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and MS, respectively (Fig. 8a,b). The RNA content within the virion cores was of low complexity, with over 60% being tRNAGln and tRNAArg (that is, the tRNA species that facilitate the assembly of complete vRNAP) (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 2). Consistent with this, the proteomics analysis showed that all subunits of complete vRNAP were present in the virion with comparable stoichiometry (Fig. 8b, red dots), whereas intermediate and late transcription factors were either absent or greatly underrepresented (Fig. 8b, green dots, and Supplementary Table 1). Notably, the ratio of tRNAGln/Arg to the vRNAP core subunit Rpo132 was strikingly similar between isolated complete vRNAP and virion core (Extended Data Fig. 9). These findings strongly suggest that complete vRNAP is transferred en bloc into newly formed virions, ensuring that the viral progeny is fully equipped with the machinery needed for early transcription. This notion is further corroborated by the observation that repression of Rap94, which we identify as the initial tRNAGln/Arg-binding platform, results in production of virus particles devoid of vRNAP19.

The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Mpox virus (MPXV) is the causative agent of the zoonotic viral disease Mpox20. Interestingly, its vRNAP subunits are almost identical to their vaccinia counterparts and would allow a similar tRNA-binding modus to that described for vaccinia complete vRNAP. In accordance with this, we observed a massive enrichment of tRNAGln/Arg in purified MPXV virions (Fig. 8c). This suggests that the formation of a tRNAGln/Arg-induced early transcription unit and its subsequent packaging into virions represent a conserved mechanism among various poxviruses.

In this study, we dissected the entire assembly pathway of complete vRNAP through a combination of biochemical and structural (cryo-EM) approaches. Our findings identify tRNAGln/Arg as assembly chaperones for a macromolecular transcription and processing complex and, thus, add a novel aspect to the functional repertoire of tRNAs beyond their well-established role in translation.

Assembly chaperones are a heterogeneous group of factors that join components with otherwise little or no affinity to each other and typically undergo conformational changes during their action21. They have, however, no further role with respect to the function of the assembled unit and often dissociate from the assembled particle. Traditionally, assembly chaperones have been attributed solely to proteins; examples include RbcX and Raf1 in the assembly of the multimeric Rubisco enzyme22,23 and pICln in the biogenesis of spliceosomal Sm class U snRNPs24,25. To the best of our knowledge, tRNAGln/Arg represents the first nonprotein of this group.

We showed how an induced fit mechanism within the ASL facilitates the faithful assembly of a 16-component system. This generates an autonomous transcription unit, which is essential for the replication of poxviruses. Of note, the individual adjunct factors and vRNAP have little if any affinity to each other but essentially require the tRNA for joining. The emerging complete vRNAP complex is robust both in vivo and in vitro but will spontaneously convert to the PIC and initiate transcription when a cognate promoter is present. Remarkably, tRNAGln/Arg establishes a major checkpoint in this transition, impressing in the structure of complete vRNAP as a mechanical (Fig. 4b) and electrostatic (Fig. 4c) barrier for the transcription-factor-bound promoter DNA. Thus, tRNAGln/Arg fulfills all key criteria of an assembly chaperone by facilitating the formation of an otherwise instable active transcription complex without directly participating in its catalytical activity. This role is, hence, mechanistically different from the recently discovered scaffolding function of tRNAVal in the mitoribosome26 and the human cytomegalovirus virion capsid6.

The role of tRNAGln/Arg extends beyond the prototypical vaccinia virus to the related and pathologically highly relevant MPXV27. tRNAGln/Arg-mediated assembly of complete vRNAP may, hence, represent a widespread strategy among poxviruses for incorporating a transiently stalled form of the full early transcription machinery into the virion, thereby providing a convenient mechanism for an immediate initiation of transcription upon infection. It remains to be seen whether RNA chaperones have also evolved in the context of other systems.

Our data show that the modification status of tRNAGln/Arg affects its role in assembly, with m1A at position 57 and Cm at position 32 being stimulatory. Despite a global upregulation of the mcm5s2U modification in total tRNAs upon infection, tRNAGln(UUG) carrying this modification in the anticodon would be incompatible with its function in assembly (Fig. 7d). An intriguing question is how tRNAGln/Arg displaying a specific modification pattern (that is, absence of mcm5s2U34 and presence of m1A and Cm) is diverted from the host translation machinery into the vRNAP assembly pathway. In uninfected cells, tRNAs are predominantly associated with cellular factors such as their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and elongation factors (EFs). In particular, the extremely abundant translation factor EF1α would be expected to be an efficient binding competitor of vRNAP for charged tRNAGln/Arg. However, tRNAGln/Arg associated with vRNAP was shown to be uncharged and is, thus, presumably disengaged from active translation and interactions with the aforementioned cellular factors8. This raises the question of how tRNAGln/Arg can be ‘stolen' from the host for its activity in complete vRNAP assembly. As fully modified tRNAs are efficiently aminoacylated and likely sequestered by EF1α tRNAGln and tRNAArg lacking mcm5s2U may be less aminoacylated, as these hypomodified variants might avoid competition with EF1α and, thus, be preferentially used for vRNAP assembly. This might explain the observation that complete vRNAP contains exclusively uncharged tRNAGln/Arg. An alternative but not mutually exclusive scenario is that a local depletion of glutamine (and arginine) at viral replication sites may drive a shift from charged to uncharged tRNAs. Notably, such a situation may occur in the late phase of infection when complete vRNAP is formed for packaging and may provide a mechanism to link the metabolic status of the infected cell to the viral replication processes. In this regard, it is also noteworthy that glutamine is a crucial metabolite in viral energy metabolism28,29.

Complete and core vRNAP complexes were purified from Hela S3 cells infected with GLV-1h439 virus as described previously30. To obtain highly pure complete and core vRNAP samples, FLAG-purified total vRNAP fractions obtained from GLV-1h439-infected HeLa cells were concentrated and separated by a 10–30% sucrose gradient centrifugation step at 164,199g, 16 h and 4 °C. Core vRNAP sedimented under these conditions in fractions 10–13, while complete vRNAP sedimented in fractions 14–16 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c). The respective fractions were analyzed by denaturing SDS–PAGE, concentrated and used for biochemical and structural studies. For the purification of vaccinia virus minimal RNAP, 370 pmol of intermediate RNAP was mixed with 2.56 nmol of recombinantly expressed VITF-3. Adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, cytidine triphosphate and DTT were added to a final concentration of 10 mM each and the sample was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Then, 4 nmol of 70-bp G8R promoter DNA scaffold spanning positions −35 to +35 containing a G-less cassette starting at +8 was added and the sample was adjusted to 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the sample was applied on a 5–45% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged in a SW60Ti rotor at1 64,199g for 16 h at 4 °C. The gradient was isolated in 200-µl fractions; fractions 10–14 were pooled and concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 (100-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO); Satorius, VS0141) to 2.4 µg µl−1.

Isolated tRNAGln/Arg was 3′-end-labeled with [32P]pCp according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fischer Scientific, EL0021). Labeled RNA was separated by denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis (10%, 19:1, 8 M Urea, TBE), eluted from the gel in TBE and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA). For the vRNAP reconstitution assays shown in Fig. 1b, 40 pmol of minimal, core or complete vRNAP was incubated with 80 pmol of [32P]tRNA at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation mixtures were separated by density gradient centrifugation (10–30% sucrose gradient, 164,199g for 16 h, at 4 °C). Gradient fractions were collected manually and analyzed by SDS–PAGE and RNA gels. RNA was visualized by autoradiography and proteins were visualized by silver staining. For reconstitution of higher-order assembled intermediates (Fig. 1c), 1 pmol of [32P]pCp-labeled tRNAGln/Arg isolated from complete vRNAP was incubated with 2.4 pmol of core vRNAP in the presence of recombinant factors (D1/D12, E11 and NPH-I). After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, samples were analyzed by native electrophoresis (4% acrylamide, 0.13% bisacrylamide, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 25 mM boric acid and 0.5 mM EDTA). Native electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For large-scale reconstitution of assembly intermediate I3, 20 mg of core vRNAP (40 pmol) was incubated with 10 mg of tRNAGln/Arg (400 pmol), recombinant E11 (900 pmol) and NPH-I (900 pmol) for 30 min at 25 °C. Reconstituted I3 was purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. For cryo-EM analysis, FLAG peptide was removed by sample concentration using Vivaspin (Satorius, VS0101) with a 10-kDa MWCO.

To demonstrate that individual protein factors have no affinity to core vRNAP, recombinant NPH-I and D1/D12 or E11 were incubated with core vRNAP (molar ratio of 10:10:100:1) for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixture was subsequently separated by a 10–30% density gradient by centrifugation step (164,199g for 16 h and 4 °C). Sucrose fractions were collected manually and separated by 12% Bis–Tris gel electrophoresis30; proteins were visualized by silver staining. The interactions among recombinant factors (E11, NPH-I and D1/D12) were investigated by coimmunoprecipitation. Then, 10 μl of Dynabeads protein G was incubated with an affinity-purified monospecific anti-NPH-I antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. For control experiments, protein G beads were incubated with PBS buffer only. The beads were subsequently washed three times with PBS pH 7.5 and mixed with recombinant factors for 30 min at 25 °C in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. Beads were washed three times with buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS–PAGE.

tRNAGln/Arg was obtained from affinity-purified complete vRNAP by TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen, 15596026). For isolation of total tRNA, Hela S3 cells were either mock-infected or infected with GLV-1h439. Cells were harvested and TRIzol was directly added to cell pellets for lysis. The aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in TBE; total RNA was separated on denaturing RNA gels (8%, 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 8 M urea and TBE). tRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide and eluted from the gel in TBE buffer. Eluted tRNAs were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water or resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA). Total calf tRNA was obtained from (Roche, 83298320-63). Wild-type tRNAGln and a variant mutated at position U33G were synthetized by T7 transcription with a high-yield T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, K0441) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For the recombinant expression of vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1/D12 and early transcription termination factor NPH-I, the respective open reading frames were amplified from vaccinia virus genomic DNA and cloned into pET-Duet1 or pETM-11 vectors to generate pET-Duet1–D1-D12 and pETM-11-NPH-I, respectively. The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing and used for protein expression experiments. A plasmid allowing for the expression of GST–γ-toxin was kindly provided by R. Schaffrath and D. Scherf31. Expression and purification of E11 was performed as described previously8. For purification of the His–D1/D12 heterodimer and His–NPH-I, pETDuet-D1R-D12L or pETM-11-NPH-I was transformed into E. coli Iq cells (New England Biolabs, C3037l). E. coli was grown in SB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol for PETDuet-D1R-D12 or kanamycin and chloramphenicol in a case of pETM-11-NPH-I. At an optical density of 0.8, protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG for 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 15 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors. The cleared lysate was mixed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA beads (His60 Ni Superflow Resin; Takara, 635660) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 25 mM imidazole and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and proteins were eluted in washing buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The eluates were applied to a Superdex 200 (HiLoad 26/600 PG) column and analyzed by SDS–PAGE. Pure fractions eluting at the expected volume were collected, concentrated in Vivaspin 6 (10-kDa MWCO; Satorius, VS0101) to 3 µg µl−1 for NPH-I and 1.5 µg µl−1 for D1R/D12L and used for biochemical reconstitution assays (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c and Figs. 1c and 2).

GST–γ-toxin was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) pRARE strain. Expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (final concentration) for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were collected at 4,000g at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). After sonication, the lysate was cleared and the supernatant was incubated with 10 ml of glutathione Sepharose beads (Cytiva, 17513202). The column was washed three times with lysis buffer omitting lysozyme and the protein was eluted in the same buffer containing 20 mM glutathione. The elution was applied onto a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad 26/600 PG). GST–γ-toxin eluted as a single peak and was concentrated in Vivaspin 6 (10-kDa MWCO; Sartorious, VS0101) to 2.5 µg µl−1 before it was used for RNA cleavage assays.

To investigate the mcm5s2U34 modification of tRNA associated with complete vRNAP, a cleavage assay using γ-toxin was performed as described previously8. vRNAP-associated tRNA purified by TRIzol extraction and total calf tRNA were 3′-end-labeled with [32P]pCp and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Then, 100 ng of isolated tRNAs were incubated with buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT) or increasing amounts of γ-toxin in a total volume of 15 µl at 30 °C for 30 min. tRNA was subsequently TRIzol-extracted, separated by denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.

For analysis of tRNAs from Hela S3 cells infected with vaccinia virus, total tRNAs were purified as described above. Then, 100 ng of total tRNAs collected from infected cells were digested with an increasing amount of γ-toxin, followed by TRIzol extraction. Full-length tRNAs and digested fragments were separated on denaturing RNA gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (transfer at 72 mA for 1 h). The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe (5′-AGGTCCCACCGAGATTTGAACTCG-3′) complementary to the 3′-end of tRNAGln(UUG) at 42 °C for 12 h. The membrane was washed three times with NB washing buffer (2× SSC and 0.01% SDS) and bands were visualized by autoradiography.

For identification of tRNAGln/Arg in MPox and vaccinia virus, RNA was purified by TRIzol extractions from virions, precipitated and resuspended in RNAase-free water. For northern blot analysis, RNA was separated in a 12% denaturing RNA gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, RPN203B) at 72 mA for 1 h. After transfer, the membrane was hybridized at 42 °C with 5′-32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotides (5′-ACTCGGATCGCTGGATTCAAAGTCCAGAGTGCTAACCA-3′, 5′-ACCCTCAATCTTCTGATCCGGAATCAGACGCCTTATCCA-3′ or 5′-CGGGGAGACCCCATTGGATTTCGAGTCCAACGCCTTAACCACT-3′) complementary to the anticodon regions of tRNAGln(UUG), tRNAArg(CCG) and tRNASer (CGA), respectively. The membrane was washed three times with a washing buffer and visualized by autoradiography as described above.

The sucrose-gradient-purified vRNAP samples prepared as described above were diluted 1:50 and concentrated in a Vivaspin concentrator to a concentration of roughly 1 mg ml−1 to remove the sucrose, centrifuged for 2 h at 21,000g and diluted 1:1 in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Next, R 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil holey carbon grids (Jena Bioscience) were glow discharged for 90 s in a plasma cleaner (PDC-002, Harrick Plasma) at medium power and 3.5 ml of C2 sample was applied inside a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C and 100% relative humidity. The grids were blotted for 3 s with a blot force of 5 and plunged into liquid ethane. The cryo-EM datasets were collected with Titan Krios G3 equipped with a Falcon III or Falcon IV camera (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Data were acquired with EPU at 300 keV.

Datasets were processed with cryoSPARC32. Several cycles of two-dimensional classification and manual selection of classes based on the appearance of their class averages were applied for initial cleanup. Ab initio maps were created from a subset of 50,000 particles and the full set was subjected to a consensus three-dimensional refinement. The datasets were further classified as detailed in Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4–6. The classified particle sets were finally subjected to a nonuniform refinement step33 and the density was docked with initial models derived manually from the previously published complete vRNAP model (PDB 6RFL). In a first round, each model was manually refined including removal of some stretches of Rap94 that were not represented in the cryo-EM density. The models were then subjected to alternating rounds of automatic refinement with phenix.real_space_refine34 including an atomic displacement parameter refinement step and manual building with Coot35. During automated refinement, secondary-structure and mild Ramachandran restraints were imposed. A total of three cycles of manual inspection and automated refinement were performed for each model.

In-solution digestion: For the analysis of vRNAP and virion samples by MS, proteins were precipitated with 80% acetone at −20 °C for 2 h. Proteins were resolubilized in 8 M urea and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reach a concentration of 0.5 µg µl−1 followed by reduction with 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine dissolved in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (30 min at 56 °C) and alkylation of free thiol groups with 100 mM 2-chloracetamide and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (30 min at 37 °C). Urea concentration was adjusted to 2 M by adding 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, trypsin was added at a protease-to-protein ratio of 1:50 and samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Protein digestion was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) added at a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Peptides were dried in vacuo and stored at −80 °C until used for LC–MS analysis.

LC–MS analysis: Dried peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% (v/v) TFA and analyzed by reverse-phase LC–MS using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online to a Q Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The LC system was equipped with C18 precolumns (μPAC trapping column, PharmaFluidics) and a C18 endcapped analytical column (50-cm μPAC column, PharmaFluidics). Peptide separation and elution were performed at 40 °C using a binary solvent system composed of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) (solvent A) and 86% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) FA (solvent B). Peptide mixtures from RPO132 pulldown experiments were analyzed by LC–MS using a 3-h method. Peptides were loaded at 1% solvent B for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 µl min−1 and eluted by applying the following gradient: 5–22% B in 96 min, 22–42% B in 54 min, 4 min at 80% B and re-equilibration of the column for 19 min at 100% A. The flow rate for peptide elution was set to 0.3 µl min−1. The MS instrument, equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source and a stainless-steel emitter (Thermo Fischer Scientific), was externally calibrated using standard compounds. Parameters for MS measurements in data-dependent acquisition mode were as follows: MS full scan window of m/z 375–1,700, resolution of 70,000 (at m/z 200), automatic gain control (AGC) of 3 × 106 and maximum injection time (IT) of 60 ms. Multiply charged peptide ions were fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation applying a normalized collision energy of 28% and a dynamic exclusion time of 45 s. A TOP12 method was applied to analyze peptides with an MS2 resolution of 35,000, an AGC of 7 × 102 and a maximum IT of 120 ms.

MS data analysis: MS raw data were processed using MaxQuant/Andromeda (version 2.0.2.0)36 and the vaccinia virus (strain Western Reserve) reference proteome from UniProt (UP000000344; downloaded January 2022, containing 218 protein entries). Proteins were identified using MaxQuant default settings. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were considered as variable modifications, while carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as the fixed modification. The option ‘match between runs' was enabled.

Bioinformatic analysis: For the identification of proteins enriched in vaccinia virus virions, data were first normalized as follows. For each replicate, the summed MS intensity of all protein groups was shifted to the mean of the summed MS intensities determined across all three replicates. Subsequently, intensities were transformed by variance stabilizing data transformation37. Protein abundance ratios were determined and the linear models for microarray data (limma) approach, as implemented in the R package limma (version 3.60.4)38,39, was applied to calculate P values for the enrichment of proteins.

Extracted tRNAGln/Arg from the vRNAP complex was purified with an RNA clean and concentrator-5 (Zymo Research, lot 213186). Then, 400 pmol of tRNA was digested by 6.0 U of bacterial alkaline phosphatase and 1.0 U of snake venom phosphodiesterase in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl and 20 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5). After extracting the digested nucleosides mixture with 100 μl of chloroform, the aqueous layer was concentrated by lyophilization and the residue was dissolved in 70 μl of 10 mM ammonium acetate. The analysis was run with a gradient of 0–5% (0–15 min) and 5–72.5% (15–45 min) of solvent B, using an Synergi Fusion RP column (Phenomenex; 4 μm, 250 × 2 mm). Solvent A was 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.3), solvent B was acetonitrile and the flow rate was 0.2 ml min−1 at 25 °C with ultraviolet detection at 260 nm and online MS in a microTOF-Q III system in positive ion mode. The same experiment was also performed for in vitro transcription using tRNAGln as control and for total tRNA extracted from infected and noninfected cells.

Libraries were generated from the isolated RNA fraction following the Ion Torrent ion total RNA-seq kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4475936) protocol with some modifications. Briefly, 30 ng of the RNA was incubated with 5 U of RNase T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0541) at 20 °C for 35 min. The samples were then treated with 5 U of Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs, M0289) for 30 min at 37 °C. After heat inactivation at 65 °C, the RNA was phosphorylated with 20 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, M0201) for 60 min at 37 °C. Adaptor ligation was performed for 16 h at 16 °C. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using SuperScript III with incubations at 42 °C, 50 °C and 55 °C for 45, 15 and 10 min, respectively. The RT reactions were purified and the complementary DNA was amplified by Platinum PCR SuperMix high fidelity. The resulting libraries were sequenced using an Ion Proton (Ion Torrent TM) with Hi-Q.

(a) SDS-gel of affinity purified adjunct factors D1/D12, NPH-I and E11 obtained by E. coli overexpression and used for reconstitution assays. The arrow indicates an NPH-I degradation product. The experiment was performed in duplicates. (b) Minimal binding of E11, D1/D12 and NPH-I to each other. Recombinant NPH-I and E11 (lanes 1-4) or NPH-I, D1/D12 and E11 (lanes 5-8) were incubated with each other and immunoprecipitated by antisera against NPH-I or a non-immune serum. The immunoprecipitates (lanes 1, 2, 5, 6) and supernatants (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE; HC and LC indicate heavy and light chain of the co-eluted antibody, respectively. No co-immunoprecipitation was observed for NPH-I to E11, and only marginal binding of D1/D12 to NPH-I/E11 was detectable. The arrow indicates an NPH-I degradation product. (c) Sucrose density gradient of vRNAP affinity-purified from infected cells (upper panel). Fractions 11-13 contain core vRNAP that was used for reconstitution assays, fractions 15-18 contain complete vRNAP. Gradient centrifugation of core vRNAP (fractions 11-13) pre -incubated with a mixture of either recombinant NPH-I and E11 or D1/D12. None of the recombinant factors bound to a significant amount to the vRNAP (fractions 11-13) but remained at the top of the gradient (fractions 1-6). The arrow indicates an NPH-I degradation product. Asterisks indicate recombinant D1/D12, NPH-I and E11. Note that D12 and Rpo30 migrate at the same position in the gel. The experiment was performed in duplicates.

Comparison of the tRNAGln-UUG model with its associated cryo EM density as extracted from the complete vRNAP structure (left) to a model for the tRNAArg-CCG sequence, modelled manually into the complete vRNAP density (right). Both sequences fit the density well, except for the “extra” base G48 in the tRNAArg-CCG sequence.

Core vRNAP and the indicated recombinant transcription factors were incubated with [³²P]-labelled tRNAGln/Arg (isolated from complete vRNAP), in vitro-transcribed tRNAGln harbouring a U33G mutation, and in vitro-transcribed wild-type tRNAGln (WT). Samples were analysed by native gel electrophoresis and complexes were visualized by radioautography. Black circles indicate components that were added, while white circles indicate components that were omitted. The size of the circle reflects the relative amount of each recombinant factor included. The experiment was performed three independent times with similar results.

Picking strawberries may seem simple, but it has proven surprisingly difficult for even the most sophisticated of robots. Berries often ripen under a canopy of leaves, making it difficult for machines to detect and harvest them without damage. 

Now, researchers at Washington State University think they have a solution: an AI-guided robot that combines soft silicone grippers and a fan that blows leaves aside before plucking the fruit.

During field trials in Huizhou, China, the machine successfully picked nearly three out of every four ripe strawberries using its fan system — a 16% improvement compared to trials without the fan. Each berry took the robot approximately 20 seconds to identify and harvest.

The team, which includes scientists in China, published their results this summer in the journal Computers and Electronics in Agriculture.

“Right now, [the technology] won't totally replace manual labor,” said lead author Zixuan He, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark. “But it could be a very promising supplement when you don't have enough people in the field.”

Strawberry farming relies heavily on human labor, which is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. For years, researchers have tried to automate the harvest, but most systems were tested in greenhouses or on table-top plants, where fruit hangs below the canopy and is easier to reach. The berries are more typically grown in open fields in the U.S., making hidden fruit a significant obstacle for robots.

The WSU robot combines several innovations:

The WSU researchers' study is the first to demonstrate field-scale robotic strawberry harvesting using airflow instead of mechanically moving the leaves. By integrating AI with new hardware, the team demonstrated that intelligent algorithms can enhance the effectiveness of robots in complex, unpredictable environments.

The system is slower than human pickers, but researchers estimate that deploying 10 robots with four arms each could harvest about 300,000 strawberries in roughly 43 hours. The scientists said a similar approach could be applied to other crops, such as grapes.

While still in research mode, the strawberry-picking robot is part of a wave of agtech innovation emerging from the Pacific Northwest. Last month, a British Columbia startup offering mushroom-picking robots raised $40 million. Seattle-area companies Carbon Robotics and Aigen have field robots that can identify and kill weeds with lasers or blades, while Idaho's TerraClear developed machines that clear rocks from farmland. 

Other authors of the paper titled “Improving picking efficiency under occlusion: Design, development, and field evaluation of an innovative robotic strawberry harvester” are Zibo Liu and Zhiyan Zhou of South China Agricultural University Guangzhou; Manoj Karkee, formerly of WSU and now a professor at Cornell University; and Qin Zhang, WSU professor emeritus.

Stripe is funding a new blockchain company called Tempo, co-founder CEO Patrick Collison announced on Thursday. Tempo is aimed at high-volume processing of stablecoins — coins that help reduce crypto's notorious volatility because they are pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. That's not surprising given that Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge.

What is surprising is the eye-popping list of companies Stripe has already enlisted: Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa. So if the blockchain works well, these design partners should be queued up to use or offer it for everything from agentic payments to remittances.

Plus, Stripe board member Matt Huang, co-founder of one of the most prestigious crypto VC firms, Paradigm, has signed on to lead Tempo. Paradigm has also invested. Collison says Tempo will be run as an independent company.

The luxury membership platform Vivrelle, which allows customers to rent high-end goods, announced Thursday the launch of an AI personal styling tool called Ella as part of its partnership with fashion retailers Revolve and FWRD.

The launch is an example of how the fashion industry is leveraging AI technology to enhance customer experiences and is one of the first partnerships to see three retailers come together to offer a personalized AI experience. Revolve and FWRD let users shop designer clothing, while Revolve also has an option to shop pre-owned. 

The tool, Ella, provides recommendations to customers across the three retailers on what to purchase or rent to make an outfit come to life. For example, users can ask for “a bachelorette weekend outfit,” or “what to pack for a trip,” and the technology will search across the Vivrelle, FWRD, and Revolve shopping platforms to create outfit suggestions. Users can then check out in one cart on Vivrelle. 

In theory, the more one uses Ella, the better its suggestions become. It's the fashion equivalent of asking ChatGPT what to wear in Miami for a girl's weekend.

Blake Geffen, the CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle (which announced a $62 million Series C earlier this year), told TechCrunch that she hopes Ella can take the “stress out of packing for a vacation or everyday dressing.

“Ella has been in the works for quite some time,” she told TechCrunch, adding that it took about a year to build and release the product. 

This is actually the second AI tool from the three companies. The Vivrelle, Revolve, and FWRD partnership  earlier this year also launched Complete the Look, which offers last-minute fashion suggestions to complement what's in a customer's cart at checkout. Their latest tool, Ella, however, takes the fashion recommendation game to another level.

Fashion has been obsessed with trying to make personalized shopping happen for decades now. Even the 90s movie “Clueless” showed Cher picking outfits from her digitized wardrobe.

This current AI boom has led to rapid innovation and democratized access to AI technology, allowing many fashion companies to launch personalized AI fashion platforms and raise millions while doing so.

“With Ella, we're giving our members as much flexibility and options as possible to shop or borrow with ease, through seamless conversations that allow you to share as little or as much as you want, just like talking to a live stylist,” Geffen said. “We're excited to be the first brand to integrate rental, resale, and retail into one streamlined omnichannel experience.”

The United States Patent and Trademark Office has rejected Neuralink's attempt to trademark the product names Telepathy and Telekinesis, citing pending applications by another person for the same trademarks.

Neuralink, the brain implant company cofounded by Elon Musk, filed to trademark the names in March. But in letters sent to Neuralink in August, the trademark office is refusing to allow the applications to move forward. It says Wesley Berry, a computer scientist and a cofounder of the tech startup Prophetic, previously filed trademark applications for Telepathy in May 2023 and Telekinesis in August 2024. Prophetic is building a wearable headset to induce lucid dreaming, but only Berry is the author of the trademark applications, not Prophetic. (Berry declined to comment for this story.)

In response to Neuralink's application for Telepathy, the trademark office also references the existing trademark for Telepathy Labs, a Tampa-based company that provides interactive voice and chatbot technology to businesses.

Musk's Neuralink, meanwhile, is developing a brain-computer interface that involves a device, surgically implanted in the skull, that collects brain activity. The company has been using the name Telepathy to describe its first product, which is designed to allow paralyzed people the ability to operate their phones and computers with just their thoughts. Musk unveiled the Telepathy name in a January 2024 social media post, shortly after the company implanted its first volunteer with the technology. A total of nine people now have the Neuralink device, according to a July announcement. (Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment.)

Both Berry and Neuralink filed “intent-to-use” applications, which allow businesses and inventors to reserve trademark rights before using the mark in commerce. Berry's application for Telepathy was accepted in December 2024 and for Telekinesis in August 2025 but the trademarks aren't fully registered until he shows that he's actually using them in commerce. Berry has three years to do that from acceptance, otherwise his applications would be considered abandoned and Neuralink's application would take priority.

Berry has not marketed nor commercialized a product called Telepathy or Telekinesis, but in his trademark applications describes both as “software that analyzes EEG to decode internal dialogue to control computer or mobile devices.” EEG, or electroencephalogram, data refers to the electrical activity of the brain recorded through electrodes worn on the scalp.

The trademark office's letters to Neuralink are not final decisions. Neuralink filed a response letter on August 28 addressing the existing Telepathy Labs trademark, saying that Neuralink's Telepathy product is not likely to be confused with Telepathy Labs. Neuralink did not address Berry's applications in its response.

“The standard for likelihood of confusion is, if a random consumer encountered both of these products, would they think that they're coming from the same company?” says Heather Antoine, an intellectual property partner at Stoel Rives in Sacramento, California.

The trademark office will consider Neuralink's response and decide if there is a likelihood of confusion. But there's still the fact that Berry filed to register the Telepathy and Telekinesis marks first. If Berry succeeds in registering the marks, Neuralink would have a few options. It could attempt to buy the trademarks from Berry or negotiate a consent agreement, in which Berry could agree to allow Neuralink to also use the marks. These types of agreements are usually made when the trademarks are not likely to cause consumer confusion.

If Berry is successful in registering Telepathy, Neuralink could be sued if the company continues to use it.

Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP in Washington, DC, says it's difficult to know how things will shake out because there's a lot of nuance to a trademark claim. “Certainly at the moment, though, advantage goes to this other applicant,” he says, referring to Berry. “He could become a considerable thorn in the side of Neuralink in terms of these trademarks.”

This is problematic for SMTP/email, as you really need a trustworthy MX response and, unless you have MTA-STS, TLS validation is usually not performed. DNSSEC/DANE could help, but it depends on where DNSSEC validation occurs.It would, however, be a privacy concern as the attacker impersonating the DoH server would learn the queries and source IP addresses.

It's a weird misissuance from that perspective! Suggestive to me of something nonmalicious (nonmalicious misissuance is still a dealbreaker).

This happened in a high-profile way with the Zendesk situation (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41818459) and is not the first time:    1. Bug bounty report received from knowledgeable person who isn't a "celebrity" (top x performer on H1 leaderboard, social media influencer, H1 event invitee)

    2. with novel impact to the company, open source ecosystem, or wider Internet

    3. which doesn't fall neatly into an OWASP Top 10 (Web) box

    4. so Triage close it in the pre-queue before the company get eyes on it, replying with a zero-effort CR (Common Response aka Canned Response)

    5. the company doesn't see the report unless they go digging for it in the thousands of spam/bullshit/Acunetix copypaste reports that are also closed

Apple is hosting its new hardware event on September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. The company is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. 

As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model. More broadly, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that this will be the first of three planned years of major iPhone redesigns, with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.

The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. It's also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera.

It could come in new colors: purple and green.

The Pro's upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.

Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. 

The iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of around $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially include dark blue and copper.

The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,100. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options.

While the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event, a leak showed “TechWoven” iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap.

The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus. 

This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It'll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. 

This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.

While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the renders we've seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also rumors that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.

The battery life of the device is uncertain, but some believe it may be worse than that of previous models due to its thin design. Reports suggest that to compensate, an optional battery case may be sold separately.

Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold. However, a newer prediction from JPMorgan suggests the iPhone Air will cost around $899 to compensate for the absence of a second camera.

After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it's speculated that the watch will feature a larger display.

One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks.

Apple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn't mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement.

The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn't expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. 

Rumored prices for the watches are $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.

After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Another rumor claims the pairing button will be removed, and instead, you touch the case itself.

Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio.

This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

Fresh off the internal collapse of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's senior leadership, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. There, Kennedy deflected and denied any harmful impacts from the CDC's implosion, while repeatedly spouting misinformation about vaccines and other health issues.

The hearing comes after much of the CDC's leadership were fired or resigned in protest last week. Former CDC director Susan Monarez was fired last Tuesday for reportedly refusing to support Kennedy's vaccine agenda without review, and specifically, to follow the recommendations issued by an influential but independent vaccine advisory panel—the same panel that Kennedy recently purged and restocked with people who have criticized or voiced skepticism toward vaccines before.

The CDC Implosion Continues as Staff Stage Unprecedented Walkout

Kennedy, in both an opening statement and subsequent responses to Senate Finance Committee members, appeared to minimize the fallout from what happened at the CDC. He instead argued that the agency's track record, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic, merited a kind of reset, adding that it was “absolutely necessary” to wipe the slate clean.

“We are the sickest country in the world. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC,” Kennedy said.

It's worth noting, of course, that U.S. President Donald Trump oversaw the country's initial response to the covid-19 pandemic, which included the record-setting development and rollout of mRNA vaccines to combat the virus. At the same time, the Trump administration often ignored and undermined the CDC during that first year.

On the firing of Monarez, Kennedy implied that she was untrustworthy, rather than that she had refused to support his vaccine agenda.

Kennedy also rebuffed criticisms of the remade vaccine advisory panel.

Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) noted that several of Kennedy's picks received money from testifying in vaccine-related lawsuits, arguing that this history should be seen as a financial conflict of interest—the same rationale used by Kennedy to dismiss the old ACIP members. Kennedy disagreed entirely, instead claiming that this was merely evidence of them possibly having a bias.

Among the more egregious moments in the hearing happened during questioning by Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia). When pressed to acknowledge that at least one million Americans died from covid-19, Kennedy said in a heated exchange with Warner that he didn't know many Americans died from covid-19.

“I don't think anybody knows that,” Kennedy stated.

There are slightly varying estimates of the total deaths caused by the pandemic, but we know that the pandemic caused the deaths of more than 1.2 million Americans, and that figure is based on documented and confirmed covid-19 fatalities.

Kennedy also claimed to not know how many lives were saved from the covid-19 vaccines, another common talking point of the anti-vaccination movement. But numerous studies have shown that covid-19 vaccination saved at least millions of lives in the U.S. and worldwide, and that the vaccines are safe and effective. And Kennedy's suggestion that vaccine makers didn't produce a study showing the covid-19 jab was suitable for healthy children is also incorrect, as those studies have been done.

At one point in the hearing, Kennedy stated that he agreed with his handpicked ACIP member Retsef Levi's argument that the mRNA covid-19 vaccines caused serious harm, including death, to Americans, especially young people. While no vaccine or drug is without its side effects, the vast majority of studies have reaffirmed the overall safety of these vaccines, and that their overall benefits outweigh the risks.

Later, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) asked Kennedy if he was lying when he told Senators before his confirmation as health secretary that he wasn't “anti-vax.”

“When were you lying, sir?” Smith said. “When you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?”

“Both things are true,” Kennedy responded.

After recently being spotted testing a way to share longer text, Threads, Meta's X competitor, is now officially rolling out the feature that allows users to attach up to 10,000 characters of text to their post. The addition has been designed with the needs of creators in mind, as it supports linking out to content outside of Threads, like newsletters, blogs, podcasts, and more.

Before this update, Threads supported 500 characters — which is already far more than the 280 characters offered to X's unverified users. However, X in 2023 introduced a way for its paid subscribers to post up to 25,000 characters, in the hopes of encouraging creators to publish their content directly on its platform.

Meta, meanwhile, isn't going quite that far. Instead, the company says that the 10,000 characters give people more room to express themselves, but also allows them to promote their work and drive others to “wherever it lives,” even if not on Threads itself.

Ahead of the launch, Meta noticed that people were using screenshots to share longer content from books, articles, newsletters, podcast transcripts, and more, which inspired the feature's addition and design. 

The company saw that its users often wanted to point people to the original work or place to purchase their own work, after starting a conversation about the subject on Threads. For instance, authors may want to share text from an upcoming book to drive preorders, whereas journalists may want to promote one of their longer features.

On X, users have long worked around character count limitations by threading and numbering a series of linked posts to share longer thoughts, or by uploading screenshots from an app like Apple's Notes. Seeing this trend, X tried to capitalize on the demand for a longer character count by making it a paid feature.

Threads, however, is making its additional characters available for free. 

The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it doesn't have plans to monetize posts with text attachments at this time. Plus, Meta noted that text in the posts can be formatted with highlighting, bold or underlined text, strikethroughs, and italics. You can even add emojis.

The company says it's exploring additional enhancements based on community feedback, as well.

Notably, Meta says if creators link out to content outside of Threads, that link will be displayed “prominently” in the attachment for the audience to click. This is also a shot at X, which changed its user interface to downplay links' visibility, and often blocks links to outside services at owner Elon Musk's whim. 

There are some drawbacks to using Threads' longer text, though. 

The content in the text attachments won't be indexed by search engines like Google, and it won't be federated. The latter refers to how Threads supports the publication of its posts to the wider open social web, including decentralized services like Mastodon. This support allows Threads users to search for and follow users from other servers besides Threads, see who follows you and who liked your post from those servers, as well as see and like posts on Threads posted by users on other servers.

Meta says it's exploring how to federate the longer text attachments for future iterations.

Robot vacuums that can climb stairs are now officially a thing if IFA 2025 is any indication. At the Berlin tech show, Eufy announced the MarsWalker, a dang stair-climbing mech suit that your robot vacuum can wear. And Eufy plans to release it in the spring of next year, with pricing to be announced later.

Robot vacuum owners have been waiting years for a couple of things: a robot that actually does what you want with no compromises (we're not there yet) and the ability for them to actually get up and down your stairs without you (we're close!). A few companies have shown off stair-climbing robots before; consider the Migo Robotics Ascender, an ambitious project that can climb and clean your stairs, but that one hasn't made it to the world yet. The closest thing to it on the market right now is the , which, admittedly, can only handle tiny steps.

Eufy's new idea is one of the wilder—and somehow the most realistic—yet. Here's how it worked when I saw it at IFA: a compatible Eufy robot vac (in this case, the Eufy Omni S2) and the MarsWalker each leave their respective docks, then have a robotic meet-cute where the Eufy robot slips inside the MarsWalker and they start rolling towards the stairs. As they approach the stairs they're planning to ascend, robotic arms extend from the MarsWalker's front and the back, and reach for the first step. On contact, the front arms raise the MarsWalker and the treads drive it forward until they touch with the step, then it just cruises on up.

I watched the MarsWalker do this over and over again on a small set of wooden stairs that only went up in one direction. But Eufy says it works fine with stairs that reach a landing and turn, either at a right angle or back in the other direction. I asked a member of Eufy's research and development team who was on site, and he tells me the MarsWalker can potentially handle spiral staircases too, but they'd have to have a wide curve. If I get a chance to review it, I'll try it on the spiral stairs in my own home.

I asked Eufy's representative about the MarsWalker's future compatibility, and he said the company plans to make other robot vacs that work with it. The device won't be backward compatible. The rep said the company is attempting to make the Eufy Omni S1 Pro work with it as well, but it sounds like that's far from a given.

The MarsWalker has a way to go before it can truly conquer stairs—it doesn't clean the stairs themselves, after all. But if it works as Eufy hopes it will, this little robot can get from one floor to the next all by its onesie, saving you from having to carry your robot vacuum upstairs (which, if you're me, you just don't do) or buy separate vacuums for each floor. And really, it's probably a good thing for Eufy to try to master getting up and down the stairs first before moving onto the next thing. Baby steps.<

Eufy's robot vacuums, like many on the market today, can save multiple maps of your house so you can move them around, but with this new approach, it creates a full map of all of your floors without you having to initiate separate map-making runs for each floor.

The Omni S2 is a new robot, and a follow-up to its Omni S1 Pro self-cleaning robot vacuum with a great big tower of a cleaning base. Eufy says the Omni S2 is aimed at solving a number of issues that robot vacuums have, not just their inability to climb stairs. Those include the robots' inability to adapt to different floor surfaces, terrible carpet performance, tendency to get their filters clogged with dust and pet hair, and the fact that even the best mop-bots can't actually disinfect your floors.

The Omni S2, which Eufy expects to sell for $1,599 in the U.S. in January, will have 30,000Pa suction (that's higher than the Omni E28's 20,000Pa and way higher than the S1 Pro's 8,000Pa), a self-cleaning mop, and can rid floors of “99.999%” of bacteria and pathogens. As it cleans, it farts out pretty smells, with the company's presentation showing it diffusing scents like “Citrus and Basil,” “Bamboo and Sage,” and “Bergamot and Lychee.”

Also, those 3D maps I mentioned earlier? Eufy says the Omni S2, even without the MarsWalker, uses those to avoid obstacles and messes, adapting to your home as it cleans. Without the MarsWalker, the S2 can climb up to 5cm transitions to different floors. Like the S1's dock, Eufy says the S2's UniClean Station 2.0 can empty, wash, dry, and refill the S2 with cleaning solution for the next run.

While Interview With the Vampire fans will have to wait until 2026 to pick back up with that series—retitled The Vampire Lestat for its rock n' roll-infused third season—Anne Rice's world expands in just a few weeks with Talamasca: The Secret Order. AMC has just shared a full trailer after that teaser in July, and it teases supernatural secrets, psychic menace, and danger-filled dark rooms.

Talamasca runs just six episodes, but AMC is calling it a “first season,” so make of that what you will. And it won't just be focusing on vampires; the Talamasca keeps tabs on them, of course, but also witches and “other creatures” worldwide.

In addition to Justin Kirk and Eric Bogosian, who cross over as their Interview With the Vampire characters, Talamasca has a juicy guest star in Jason Schwartzman. The rest of the cast includes Nicholas Denton, Elizabeth McGovern, William Fichtner (merrily devouring the scenery in the above trailer), Maisie Richardson-Sellers, and Celine Buckens.

Here's AMC's full description of the series: “Denton stars as Guy Anatole; on the cusp of graduating law school, he is approached by a representative of the Talamasca, a secretive agency that monitors and protects us from the supernatural world. When Guy learns that the Talamasca has been tracking him since his childhood, he falls headlong into a world of secret agents and immortal beings who, up to now, have maintained a fragile balance with the mortal world.

McGovern portrays Helen, a seasoned veteran of the Talamasca, and the leader of its New York Motherhouse; Fichtner plays Jasper, a mysterious American who has quietly assumed control and influence over the Talamasca's London Motherhouse; Richardson-Sellers plays Olive, a beguiling and ambitious agent of the Talamasca; Buckens stars as Doris, strong-willed and with an old soul, she lives with a coven of witches on a houseboat; while Schwartzman portrays Burton, a charming, rakish vampire, leading a cloistered life in a luxurious Upper West Side penthouse, Bogosian plays Daniel Molloy, and Kirk is Talamasca agent Raglan James.”

Daniel Molloy's book gets a mention in the trailer, but since it doesn't make an appearance, here's a first-look photo of the author and his creation that AMC also released today:

Anne Rice's Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres October 26 on AMC and AMC+.

After six years of waiting, Team Cherry's long awaited Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, launched globally today at 10 am EDT. Unfortunately, fans may have to wait a little longer to play the action-adventure game. Online retailers such as the Xbox and PlayStation stores, Steam, and Nintendo eShop are rife with loading screens and error messages as people rush to buy it.

On Steam, players trying to add the game to their cart or complete their purchase are being met with the same message: an image of a frustrated blob with the caption “Something went wrong.” Switch players on Bluesky say the eShop hangs on loading screens or error messages. On the PlayStation store, the game appears to have disappeared entirely for some players, while it's not available to purchase for others. According to Verge reporter Tom Warren, fans trying to buy the game on Xbox Game Pass should remote-install it via the console's website.

In lieu of playing the game, many fans are turning to social media to vent their frustrations.

“STEAM, LET ME PLAY SILKSONG,” posted one Bluesky user. “First boss of #Silksong is really tough,” wrote another with a picture of Steam's error message. Twitch streamers trying to play the game for their viewers are running into similar problems. On X, user @HaydenSchiff posted a screenshot of many streamers encountering the same Steam error message.

Players who've successfully managed to buy the game, meanwhile, are gloating about their success. “God's favorite,” wrote one with a picture of Silksong on their Switch 2.

Silksong, announced in 2019, is the followup to Team Cherry's debut title, Hollow Knight. A winning combination of Dark Souls-like difficulty and cartoonish charm, Hollow Knight became an award-winning indie darling that sold over 15 million copies—an impressive feat for its tiny, Australia-based developer. While the team initially planned to release Silksong as downloadable content, the project eventually ballooned into a full-fledged title that took seven years to finish.

Despite years of few updates and little news, the Silksong fanbase has remained active. Some fan communities have even turned waiting into a game, while others dedicated their time to (mostly non-existent) daily news updates.

The weeks leading up to Silksong, available today for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, have been chaotic for both game makers and fans. After developers made a surprise announcement in August that the game would launch in two weeks, at least half a dozen fellow indie developers delayed their own games to make way. “Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks notice makes everyone freak out,” wrote Demonschool developer Necrosoft on Bluesky after announcing its own delay.

The game's popularity is undeniable. As of writing, Silksong is Steam's top-selling game; it already has more than 100,000 concurrent players on that platform alone. For those still trying to buy a copy, it turns out years of waiting may have been good practice for launch day.

U.S. health officials have issued several recalls of shrimp in recent weeks over concerns about radioactive material. And now a sitting U.S. Senator has taken the opportunity to warn people in the most dire terms possible. With help from a visual aide, of course.

Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, took to the Senate floor with a giant poster board featuring a screenshot from the classic 1979 film Alien on Wednesday. And he wants you to know that Americans are going to look like the chestburster from that movie if we're not careful.

Kennedy posted a video of his warning on his X account, though the senator's version of the video is just 3 minutes and 37 seconds long. The entire speech, which is available on the Forbes YouTube channel, is five and a half minutes.

“This is a photograph of the alien from the movie Alien,” Kennedy helpfully explained. “This is what you could end up looking like if you eat some of the raw frozen shrimp being sent to the United States by other countries.”

Kennedy went on to list some of the brands that have been recalled from places like Walmart. And he turned back to the posterboard and his dire warning. “If you eat it, how could you end up looking like alien in the Alien? Because the shrimp was radioactive. I kid you not.”

“It had a radioactive isotope in it called cesium-137. It'll kill you. Even if it doesn't turn you into the alien if you eat this stuff, I guarantee you'll grow an extra ear,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy's claim isn't really true, whether he's kidding or not. Obviously, nobody wants to be eating shrimp that could potentially contain radioactive substances. But it's not going to kill you without repeated exposure at a much higher dose.

The Cs-137 found by U.S. Customs and Border Protection near shrimp distributed by BMS Foods of Indonesia last month registered at 68 Bq/kg, well below the level for federal intervention, which is 1200 Bq/kg. The American Nuclear Society noted at the time that 68 Bq/kg is similar to the radiation levels found in bananas.

Cs-137 is not naturally occurring like the radiation in bananas. And nobody wants any level of radiation in their food. But there's no evidence that the radiation that could potentially be present in shrimp is going to kill you (at least not in the way that Kennedy suggests), and the FDA recall notices all mention that. It's not going to make you grow an extra ear. The concern around eating the recalled shrimp is purely long-term, involving repeated low-dose exposure, which can contribute to cancer.

Kennedy represents Louisiana, which is America's largest shrimp producer. So it makes sense that he would highlight the issue. But he clearly has an incentive to make foreign shrimp sound scary.

Kennedy's video clip on X didn't include almost two minutes of his remarks. The senator would go on to say that he wasn't picking on Indonesia, but then made another claim that seemed to suggest shrimp producers overseas were intentionally making the shrimp radioactive.

“This shrimp, and I'm not just picking on Indonesia, it's other countries,” Kennedy said. “This shrimp is grown in conditions that you can't possibly imagine. Dirty water. They shoot the shrimp full of antibiotics. I confess, I didn't know they were shooting them full of this radioactive isotope.”

There's no evidence that any shrimp producers are “shooting them full” of radiation. The most likely explanation is accidental contamination from some kind of industrial equipment. The average person would likely be surprised at how radioactive material is used in consumer products like smoke detectors. But we don't know how the shrimp may have been potentially contaminated at this point. There's just no logical reason to intentionally do it.

“Now, I'm biased,” Kennedy conceded in a portion of the remarks that he didn't tweet.

“I believe in homegrown Louisiana shrimp. Fresh, out of the Gulf, not radioactive. But I understand that some stores prefer to buy foreign shrimp because it's cheaper. Now we know why. The damn stuff's radioactive,” Kennedy continued.

“And NOAA needs to do a better job of inspecting the shrimp that is sold from other countries who don't abide by the same standards we do to the consumers in the United States and America.”

Should the company switch its trucks, cars, and vans to electric? It's a question that plenty of businesses operating fleets of vehicles—in industries like delivery, health care, cable companies, and utilities—are thinking through.

Eighty-seven percent of fleet operators polled by Cox Automotive last year said they were expecting to bring aboard some battery-powered vehicles in the next five years. Their top concerns weren't that different from everyday drivers': Businesses aren't sure how to keep EVs charged. When time spent charging up the battery—which can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours, depending on the vehicle and charger—is time not on the road making money, these decisions can be the difference between ending up in the red or the black.

For six months this year, Ford and an Atlanta-based utility called Southern Company experimented with custom software that could help alleviate these growing pains. The results suggested, the companies say, that just a bit of charging tech smarts could save businesses money by charging in exactly the moments when weather and other customers' electric grid usage conspires to make prices cheap and electricity most efficient.

Still, the experiment ended after May, and the Southern Company says it has no immediate plans to create a “managed charging” program for its own fleet of electric vehicles, or to offer one to commercial customers.

The experiment highlights the complexities of EV charging—and EV ownership—for businesses for whom time and reliability is money. Company EVs can cost less to own, operate, and maintain, especially as gas prices creep upwards. But the logistics of keeping them charged can seem daunting to managers used to dealing with gas, especially for fleets like Southern Company's that don't operate on strict schedules.

A Southern Company truck—this one for Georgia Power—juices up at a Ford Pro charger.

In the US, federal subsidies that offered tax breaks for businesses going electric made EVs a particularly appealing choice. But most of those incentive programs are being phased out by the middle of next year, after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill this summer. Fourteen percent of US fleets operated EVs last year, according to Cox Automotive.

The Southern Company didn't need this pilot to sell it on EVs. The firm—which operates Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, as well as other subsidiaries across six southern and midwestern states—has been using Ford electric vehicles since 2023. Its fleet now includes more than 200 F-150 Lightning trucks and 150 Ford Pro chargers. The company aims to electrify its entire fleet by 2030.

Now it wanted to see if it could use Ford Pro's charging software to ramp down its vehicles' and chargers' energy consumption during periods of high demand. (Ford Pro is the commercial fleet arm of the US automaker.) Such “managed charging” programs save fleet owners money by scheduling charging for times when utilities are charging less for electricity, and put less stress on the electric grid. Southern Company is particularly aware of that last point: With the AI boom, data centers are flooding into the US southeast.

“We're trying to figure out how we can save every kilowatt-hour that is out there to be saved, because we'll have a more constrained system in the future,” says Lea Clanton, who directs business development and innovation for Southern Company New Ventures.

The utility invested in over 200 F-150 Lightning trucks and 150 Ford Pro chargers for its fleet operations.

Ironically, the experiment's most exciting moments came when the two companies worked together to shut down all their chargers. By turning off the chargers for 30 minutes—something that might be suddenly necessary during very hot or cold days, or during an emergency—Southern Company and Ford say they were able to reduce the demand on the grid by 0.5 megawatts, immediately freeing up an amount of electricity equivalent to what's needed to power between 200 and 450 homes for a year.

One day, EV fleets like those operated by the Southern Company might use this sort of software to save money and electricity. But Clanton says the utility firm needs more information before it's ready to hook its EVs up to smarter chargers. It needs to guarantee that its drivers—especially those responding to electricity emergencies—always have charge when the unexpected happens.

“If we were to adopt something more permanent, we would need to take some time to better understand where our drivers need to be, how often they charge, and make sure that it's not going to impact our delivery of clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy to customers at all, 24 hours a day,” says Clanton.

Lines get blurred in tech all the time, and IFA 2025 has been no exception. You've got a projector that's also a party speaker, a party speaker that's also an amp, a washer and dryer that's also a dock for robo vacuums, and now… light bulbs that are also tiny motion-sensing surveillance machines.

Philips Hue took the wraps off a bunch of new products this week, and while there's a lot to sort through, one thing that jumped out to me is an update to its Hue Bridge—the $99 Hue Bridge Pro. According to Philips, with an update to its Hue smart home hub, almost all of your existing Hue smart lights can now be set up to detect motion and trigger your lights automatically. The company says the feature, called MotionAware, uses three to four lights in the same room to create an area that detects your movement. What's even more impressive is that it doesn't require a new bulb. Instead, the feature (as long as you buy the Hue Bridge Pro, which is capable of running the right algorithms) can be used retroactively with almost every Hue bulb, thanks to their use of radio frequencies, which double as motion sensors in this case.

It's an objectively clever use of preexisting hardware that Philips says will apply to all bulbs dating back to the second-gen Hue lights from 2014, and the capabilities apparently don't stop at turning your lights on and off. According to Philips, MotionAware also extends to its array of home security products (cameras and sensors) sold under the Hue Secure umbrella. As noted by a deeper dive from The Verge, when motion is detected, lights can be configured to flash red, and can also trigger Hue's new security bell and even send alerts to your phone with an additional option to call the police. Yep, that's right. It's 2025, and your lightbulbs are your new guard dog.

The Verge also notes that while MotionAware costs $1 per month (to cover cloud costs allegedly), you'll need to pay $40 per year to use security alerts, which is the cost of a Hue Secure subscription. Whether you want to turn your bulbs into a security narc or just program them to turn on when you walk into the room, the idea is pretty cool, and Philips says all of the motion data is kept locally on its Hue Bridge Pro, which is good because I'm not sure I want any company to know which room of my apartment I'm in and when. Even if none of that motion-sensing appeals to you, it may be worth buying a Bridge Pro since it supports 3x the amount of lights over the last generation and also works via Wi-Fi as opposed to having to connect to your router via Ethernet. If any of those capabilities sound attractive to you, you can buy the Huge Bridge Pro starting today.

Orchard Robotics, an agtech startup using artificial intelligence to deliver precise data on farm operations, has raised $22 million from investors. 

The company was founded by Seattle-based CEO Charlie Wu, a Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Cornell University to launch his business in 2022.

“Solving farming is a data problem, and data is the bedrock of every farming decision. But the lack of precise, actionable data is the bottleneck,” Wu said in a statement. “Orchard Robotics exists to help our farmers become more profitable and efficient, and this new funding accelerates our ability to deliver a sustainable future for agriculture.”

The startup has developed a system with cameras that are mounted on tractors and other equipment to gather images as they traverse a farm. The collected images are then analyzed by Orchard Robotics' AI to generate data on vines, trees and crops, which is then processed to track the growth, yield and health of crops. 

The technology was initially deployed on apple and grape farms, and has expanded into operations growing blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus and strawberries. 

Orchard Robotics is based in San Francisco and its team is largely split between Washington and California, according to LinkedIn data.

The Series A round was led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, with continued participation from General Catalyst, Contrary, Mythos, Valyrian and Ravelin. Other investors include Formula One driver Nico Rosberg and Yext & Roam Founder Howard Lerman. The startup has raised more than $25 million in total.

Washington is home to a wide variety of agtech startups. That includes other companies that collect and/or analyze data, such Loftus Labs, innov8.ag and FruitScout, as well as IUNU and Koidra, which are focused on greenhouse crops. 

Other agtech business in the Pacific Northwest are tackling field operations such as weed destroyers Carbon Robotics and Aigen; rock removing TerraClear; and irrigation startups FarmHQ and Verdi.

JetBlue plans to become the first airline to sign on with Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband service, promising faster and more reliable inflight Wi-Fi.

The airline announced Thursday that the technology will be introduced to a portion of its fleet starting in 2027, providing a boost to Fly-Fi, JetBlue's free, high-speed Wi-Fi program.

The news comes on the heels of a boast this week by Amazon executives, who showed the satellite constellation is capable of transmitting data at speeds in excess of a gigabit per second.

Project Kuiper is built around a constellation of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit — connected to each other by high-speed optical links that will create a mesh network in space — and linked to a global network of antennas, fiber, and internet connection points on the ground. 

Amazon has launched 102 Project Kuiper satellites so far, with another 27 due to go up as early as this month. The current schedule calls for half of the planned 3,232-satellite constellation to be deployed within the next year.

The tech giant said it intends to begin delivering satellite broadband services to customers by the end of this year. Eventually, it aims to offer high-speed internet access to millions of people around the globe.

JetBlue called the agreement with Project Kuiper “an exciting leap forward” in onboard connectivity.

“With Project Kuiper, we're working to ensure customers can enjoy fast, reliable internet wherever they are — at home or 35,000 feet in the air — and we're pumped to bring that to life with JetBlue,” Panos Panay, senior vice president of Amazon Devices & Services, said in a statement.

Project Kuiper will have to catch up to SpaceX's Starlink network, which currently dominates the market for broadband access via satellites, including on airlines. Seattle-based Alaska Airlines announced last month that it planned to launch an upgrade to its inflight Wi-Fi experience with Starlink.

In other sky-high Wi-Fi news, Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless carrier T-Mobile and Southwest Airlines announced a new partnership delivering free unlimited Wi-Fi for all Rapid Rewards members beginning Oct. 24.

Southwest said that with more than 800 aircraft, it will be the largest domestic airline to implement free Wi-Fi on every flight this year.

Many major airlines are beefing up their in-flight internet offerings by tapping SpaceX's Starlink satellites, but JetBlue is going in a different direction. Amazon and JetBlue announced Thursday a partnership under which the airline will instead use Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites to provide free in-flight connectivity starting in 2027.

The Kuiper terminals on JetBlue's planes will be capable of download speeds of up to 1Gbps from Amazon's low-Earth orbit satellites. That's more bandwidth than Starlink's current max of 250 Mbps, although Amazon is only planning to build a network of 3,226 satellites, while SpaceX has launched more than 8,000. While Amazon has previously claimed it is more focused on “unserved and underserved communities around the world,” that language has been removed from its website.

When the service goes live, JetBlue will be the first airline to use Kuiper satellites, which Amazon started launching to space in April. Amazon also announced earlier this year that it was integrating its satellite internet tech with Airbus planes.

Those contracts are big steps for Kuiper, which has been in the works for years. The project has been bogged down by production problems, although Amazon has said it will be able to hit the mid-2026 deadline imposed by the Federal Communications Commission to launch the first half of its network into orbit.

The price could be between $20,000 and $25,000

The Nvidia B30A, which the company is developing as its next-generation replacement for the China-market H20 AI chip, is expected to cost double the price of the earlier model. Reuters reports that the H20 currently sells between $10,000 and $12,000, meaning the B30A will likely be priced from $20,000 to $25,000. Despite this massive increase, many Chinese companies, like TikTok owner ByteDance, are keen on getting their hands on Nvidia's latest chips, with some sources saying that these chips are considered great deals.

It's estimated that the B30A will be six times more powerful than the H20, despite being a watered-down version of the full-fat B300 AI chip. Nvidia has reportedly already developed the B30A, but it's still waiting for approval from the U.S. government to proceed with the marketing and sale of the Blackwell-based GPU. In the meantime, many Chinese tech firms are still buying H20 chips despite Beijing's guidance to stop buying them.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously banned the sales of H20 chips, resulting in a $5.5-billion write-off for Nvidia. However, he reversed course in mid-July 2025, allowing the company to resume deliveries to Chinese customers. But instead of a blanket provision allowing it to sell the H20 to anyone, the U.S. instead started issuing export licenses to Nvidia, allowing it to ship its products.

Because of this, there's currently a massive license backlog at the U.S. Department of Commerce —the worst it has experienced in 30 years — turning the H20 taps into a trickle. The White House is also still ironing out the 15% deal that AMD and Nvidia signed, so that the companies can market their products to China. We've also seen reports that Nvidia is asking its suppliers to wind down H20-related production, with the company only telling Tom's Hardware, “We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.”

So, with all these delays, red tape, and rumors, many of Nvidia's Chinese customers are getting apprehensive and want assurance that their H20 orders are delivered. This shows that there is still massive demand for these powerful chips, thus turning it into a massive geopolitical tool to be wielded on the negotiating table by both the East and the West.

                              What happens here matters everywhere.

Lila Biologics, a startup that spun out of Nobel Laureate David Baker's lab at the University of Washington, announced a collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to develop therapies for treating solid tumors.

Lila has also launched two platforms powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning for creating new therapeutic proteins. One is focused on targeted radiotherapy, generating proteins that precisely bind to tumors and carry radioactive isotopes that zap cancerous cells. The other platform is used to build long-acting injectable drugs that gradually release medicine over weeks or months.

The 7-person startup is using its targeted radiotherapy tool in the partnership with Eli Lilly. It hopes to hand off a candidate protein within three to six months so the pharmaceutical company can take the drug through clinical trials.

The Eli Lilly collaboration “really proves we're ready for prime time,” CEO Jake Kraft told GeekWire. “We have something unique out there and we're ready to develop medicines.”

Kraft and Chief Scientist Anindya Roy co-founded Lila in 2023. The two worked as postdoctoral fellows in the UW's Institute for Protein Design, which is directed by Baker.

“With a world-class team and holistic approach to ML-driven protein design in place, Lila Biologics is uniquely suited to advance a new class of tumor-targeted radiotherapies and [long-acting injectable] medicines toward the clinic,” Baker said in a statement.

Baker, who won his Nobel last year in chemistry and is a Lila co-founder, helped create a technology that allows researchers to use AI and ML algorithms to engineer never-before-seen proteins designed to perform specific functions, such as drug delivery or destroying environmental pollutants.

The AI tools from the institute are increasingly successful at creating proteins that function as planned when tested in the lab, saving time and money. Researchers with the Institute for Protein Design in recent months have published papers in top scientific journals demonstrating the technology's capabilities. That includes creating de novo proteins that bind precise disease markers and others that grab hold of difficult-to-capture, shapeshifting molecules.

The institute has made its foundational AI technology free and publicly available to users worldwide.

In 2023, Lila raised a $10 million seed round led by WRF Capital, SilverArc Capital Management, and Sahsen Ventures, with participation from Boom Capital, Alexandria Venture Investments, Cooley, Pack Ventures, and other private investors, the company told GeekWire.

For the project with Eli Lilly, Lila scientists are going after harder-to-hit tumor targets than most other organizations have pursued.

The team is additionally working on its own pipeline of therapies, including a long-acting injectable to treat pulmonary disease. Lila scientists have candidate-stage drugs and are preparing for investigational new drug studies, which lead to human clinical trials.

“We want to bring medicines to patients,” Kraft said. “We don't want to just say we've designed a protein, but we actually want to be able to say we've saved lives.”

American buyers should be prioritized ahead of all others, according to U.S. legislators


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Update 9/4/2025 05:28 am PT: An Nvidia spokesperson has reached out and provided this comment.

"The AI Diffusion Rule was a self-defeating policy, based on doomer science fiction, and should not be revived. Our sales to customers worldwide do not deprive U.S. customers of anything — and in fact expand the market for many U.S. businesses and industries. The pundits feeding fake news to Congress about chip supply are attempting to overturn President Trump's AI Action Plan and surrender America's chance to lead in AI and computing worldwide."

Original Article

The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unveiled a preliminary version of the annual defense policy package that includes a requirement for American developers of AI processors to prioritize domestic orders for high-performance AI processors before supplying them to overseas buyers and explicitly calls to deny exports of highest-end AI GPUs. The legislators call their initiative the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (GAIN AI Act) and their goal is to ensure that American 'small businesses, start-ups, and universities' can lay their hands on the latest AI GPUs from AMD, Nvidia, etc before clients in other countries. However, if the bill becomes a law, it will hit American companies hard.

"Advanced AI chips are the jet engine that is going to enable the U.S. AI industry to lead for the next decade," said Brad Carson, president of Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI). "Globally, these chips are currently supply-constrained, which means that every advanced chip sold abroad is a chip the U.S. cannot use to accelerate American R&D and economic growth. As we compete to lead on this dual-use technology, including the GAIN AI Act in the NDAA would be a major win for U.S. economic competitiveness and national security."

This GAIN AI Act demands developers of AI processors, such as AMD or Nvidia, to give U.S. buyers first opportunity to purchase advanced AI hardware before selling to foreign nations, including allied nations like European countries or the U.K. and adversaries like China. To do so, the Act proposes to establish export controls on all 'advanced' GPUs (more on this later) to be shipped outside of the U.S. and deny export licenses on the 'most powerful chips.'

To get the export license, the exporter must confirm to certain conditions:

If one of the certifications is missing, the export request must be denied, according to the proposal.

What is perhaps no less important about the act is that it sets precise criteria of what U.S. legislators consider 'advanced integrated circuit,' or advanced AI GPU. To qualify as 'advanced', a processor has meet any one of the following criteria:

Essentially, the legislators plan to export control all fairly sophisticated processors, including Nvidia's HGX H20 (because of high memory bandwidth) or L2 PCIe (because of high performance density) that are now about two years old. As a result, if the proposed bill passes as a law and is signed by the President, then it will again restrict sales of AMD's Instinct MI308 or Nvidia's HGX H20 both to all customers outside of the U.S. Furthermore, GPUs with a TPP of 4800 or higher will be prohibited for exports, so Nvidia will be unable to sell its H100 and more advaced GPUs outside of the U.S. as even H100 has a TPP score of 16,000 (B300 has a TPP score of 60,000).

Coincidentally, Nvidia on Wednesday issued a statement claiming that shipments of its H20 to customers in China does not affect its ability to serve clients in the U.S.

"The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false — selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products," the statement reads.

Update 9/4/2025 05:28 am PT: An Nvidia spokesperson has reached out and provided this comment.

"The AI Diffusion Rule was a self-defeating policy, based on doomer science fiction, and should not be revived. Our sales to customers worldwide do not deprive U.S. customers of anything — and in fact expand the market for many U.S. businesses and industries. The pundits feeding fake news to Congress about chip supply are attempting to overturn President Trump's AI Action Plan and surrender America's chance to lead in AI and computing worldwide."

Original Article

The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unveiled a preliminary version of the annual defense policy package that includes a requirement for American developers of AI processors to prioritize domestic orders for high-performance AI processors before supplying them to overseas buyers and explicitly calls to deny exports of highest-end AI GPUs. The legislators call their initiative the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (GAIN AI Act) and their goal is to ensure that American 'small businesses, start-ups, and universities' can lay their hands on the latest AI GPUs from AMD, Nvidia, etc before clients in other countries. However, if the bill becomes a law, it will hit American companies hard.

The IronWolf Pro 30TB pushes the popular NAS hard drive series up to a new high capacity using laser-powered recording tech, so now you can have your favorite NAS drive with up to a whopping 30TB of storage without giving anything up. Seagate employs its new laser-powered heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology with this drive, a first for a mass-market hard drive.

The Mozaic 3+ technology platform enables an unprecedented amount of storage density by using a laser to heat a small area of the disk to 450°C (842°F) before recording data to it, thus allowing bits to be packed into a smaller area. For end users, there is no difference in use, performance, or reliability.

We would understand if the IronWolf Pro name is more recognizable and catchy to you than Exos, which is the enterprise counterpart for the Pro model. The former instills a certain sense of reliability, and this is backed by Seagate's health monitoring and complimentary data recovery services. The IronWolf Pro also often comes in at a lower price, which only sweetens the deal.

HAMR enables reaching a higher capacity ceiling without significantly increasing power consumption or heat production. That's a great selling point as the IronWolf Pro is best used with two or more drives in a NAS system. If your drives are idle a lot, you're also in good shape, as Seagate has specifically optimized for that condition. Performance also remains as expected, although Seagate has tuned the drive for mixed workloads and higher queue depths. What's not to love?

Well, for one, the drive's performance is not really breaking any new ground. This is expected, so it's not really worthy of a demerit. However, we can't shake the feeling that this drive is made for more serious workloads, which makes it less attractive to everyday users. Also expected, given the drive's high base price. Dropping over $1,000 for two of these even at 28TB is not something you would do lightly. The relative cost – $ per terabyte – isn't too bad, but many people could be better off going with older drives in the ~20TB range. This means this drive is meant for scenarios where data density is the number one priority.

The new Seagate IronWolf Pro adds 28TB and 30TB to its capacity offerings, both with the performant conventional magnetic recording (CMR) technology that doesn't involve performance tradeoffs like we see with cheaper shingled magnetic recording (SMR) hard drives. Seagate uses this same tech in its enterprise-focused Exos 30TB drive, though things diverge a bit as the Exos M has a 32TB CMR planned with SMR options up to at least 36TB. Still, these are very similar drives with almost identical specifications. The IronWolf Pro can hit up to 275 MB/s with sustained transfers, and it has 512MB of DRAM cache.

Currently, the 30TB IronWolf Pro is priced at $549.99 on Seagate's website, and the 28TB model is $529.99 on Amazon, although both prices are discounted. This makes it less expensive than the Exos M, which makes it not a bad deal at all.

As with the Exos M, the IronWolf Pro is warrantied for five years with a 550TB per year workload rate limit (WRL). In addition, the IronWolf Pro comes with three years of Rescue Data Recovery Services, which makes it more consumer-friendly versus the enterprise-focused Exos M. The drive is otherwise optimized for use in NAS.

Seagate has the same downloads for the IronWolf Pro that it does for the Exos M: SeaTools and DiscWizard. SeaTools is for diagnostics and drive monitoring and works in both Windows and Linux with graphical and command-line interfaces. DiscWizard is for formatting, partitioning, and preparing drives for use. The IronWolf Pro then diverges from the Exos M by having IronWolf Health Management (IHM) which is active protection for the drive to assist with maintaining the drive and its data in NAS use. This further emphasizes that the IronWolf Pro is intended for different environments than the Exos M.

The IronWolf Pro PCB looks very similar to the Exos M, the primary difference being that the DRAM is made by Nanya instead of Winbond. It is otherwise comparable. This is not unexpected, and we regularly see different brands of DRAM used on SSDs for metadata caching. The other main memory here is ICs of NAND and NOR flash memory for use by the drive controller.

The IronWolf Pro uses the same controllers as the Exos M, too. The SMOOTH Thor by STMicroelectronics is designed for power management and motor control, while Seagate's 12nm ASIC serves as the primary controller for drive and media operations. From the hardware side of things, the two drive lines are identical, although there are firmware and feature differences. The drive has also been certified compatible with certain NAS systems, such as QNAP, with a focus on AI use cases.

Privacy-focused consumer tech company DuckDuckGo launched a subscription plan last year that bundled a VPN service, personal information removal, and identity theft restoration. The company said Thursday that the subscription now gives users access to the latest AI models through Duck.ai without paying extra.

The Duck.ai chatbot is free to use, and users get access to models like Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku, Meta's Llama 4 Scout, Mistral AI's Mistral Small 3 24B, and OpenAI's GPT-4o mini.

With DuckDuckGo's $9.99 per month plan, users will be able to access newer models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, and Meta's Llama Maverick.

“These bigger models are better at following detailed instructions, maintaining context through extended chats, and delivering deeper, more nuanced responses. The DuckDuckGo subscription offers a way to use some of these models, but with more privacy,” the company said in a post.

This is a good opportunity for those who want to access the latest models without sticking to a single provider. Alternatively, Quora's Poe also offers access to a bouquet of models. You can buy Poe's subscription starting at $5 per month.

DuckDuckGo says that it will continue to add costlier plans to its paid product that offer “larger and more highly advanced models.” It didn't specify whether the current plan has any usage limits.

Originally, the show floor specs stated the cooler would launch in the first quarter of 2026, but an updated roadmap on Noctua's website now tells us that release is planned for Q2 2026.

The yet-to-be-named liquid cooler from Noctua is based on Asetek's flagship G8 V2 pump instead of an in-house solution. In lieu of that, the company has decided to focus on maximizing the performance possible from Asetek's design by developing its own 3-layer sound dampening system. According to Noctua, there's a "tuned-mass damper effect" to keep the whole operation quiet.

Moreover, Noctua is using its SecuFirm+ mounting system for the cooler so it's compatible with exisitng brackets while promising future socket support. If you already own one of their air coolers, it will make the installation that much easier. The AIO will be offered in three sizes: 240 mm, 360 mm, and 420 mm, covering all bases and ensuring everyone can throw a bit of beige in their systems.

Speaking of which, to match the cooler will be NF-A14x25 G2 (140mm) or NF-A12x25 G2 (120mm) fans that offer class-leading performance while keeping the decibels low. There's also an option for an extra 80 mm auxilary fan that can cool surrounding components like motherboard VRMs, M.2 SSDs, and RAM sticks.

 




Alongside the liquid cooler, the updated roadmap also sheds light on other Noctua products — all of which seem to be pushed back a bit. More importantly, Noctua's collaborations with other companies like Antec (case), Seasonic (power supply), and Pulsar (mouse) also get revised dates, so you can look forward to more brown and beige across your entire setup.

Pricing hasn't been revealed but there were murmurs of $300 USD at Computex which would put the AIO squarely in the premium category. Instead of fancy screens or a value-oriented package, Noctua will be competing purely on the basis of its cooling prowess while sticking to its nailing-the-basics formula. Only time will tell if it will be enough to cut through the market and carve out a space for itself.

The uncanny valley is narrowing. Are we ready for what comes next?

Earlier this summer, I walked through the glassy lobby of a fancy office in London, into an elevator, and then along a corridor into a clean, carpeted room. Natural light flooded in through its windows, and a large pair of umbrella-like lighting rigs made the room even brighter. I tried not to squint as I took my place in front of a tripod equipped with a large camera and a laptop displaying an autocue. I took a deep breath and started to read out the script.

I'm not a newsreader or an actor auditioning for a movie—I was visiting the AI company Synthesia to give it what it needed to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company's avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me. 

When Synthesia launched in 2017, its primary purpose was to match AI versions of real human faces—for example, the former footballer David Beckham—with dubbed voices speaking in different languages. A few years later, in 2020, it started giving the companies that signed up for its services the opportunity to make professional-level presentation videos starring either AI versions of staff members or consenting actors. But the technology wasn't perfect. The avatars' body movements could be jerky and unnatural, their accents sometimes slipped, and the emotions indicated by their voices didn't always match their facial expressions.

Now Synthesia's avatars have been updated with more natural mannerisms and movements, as well as expressive voices that better preserve the speaker's accent—making them appear more humanlike than ever before. For Synthesia's corporate clients, these avatars will make for slicker presenters of financial results, internal communications, or staff training videos.

I found the video demonstrating my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It's slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn't know me, you'd probably think that's exactly what it was. This demonstration shows how much harder it's becoming to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us?  

When my former colleague Melissa visited Synthesia's London studio to create an avatar of herself last year, she had to go through a long process of calibrating the system, reading out a script in different emotional states, and mouthing the sounds needed to help her avatar form vowels and consonants. As I stand in the brightly lit room 15 months later, I'm relieved to hear that the creation process has been significantly streamlined. Josh Baker-Mendoza, Synthesia's technical supervisor, encourages me to gesture and move my hands as I would during natural conversation, while simultaneously warning me not to move too much. I duly repeat an overly glowing script that's designed to encourage me to speak emotively and enthusiastically. The result is a bit as if if Steve Jobs had been resurrected as a blond British woman with a low, monotonous voice. 

It also has the unfortunate effect of making me sound like an employee of Synthesia.“I am so thrilled to be with you today to show off what we've been working on. We are on the edge of innovation, and the possibilities are endless,” I parrot eagerly, trying to sound lively rather than manic. “So get ready to be part of something that will make you go, ‘Wow!' This opportunity isn't just big—it's monumental.”

Just an hour later, the team has all the footage it needs. A couple of weeks later I receive two avatars of myself: one powered by the previous Express-1 model and the other made with the latest Express-2 technology. The latter, Synthesia claims, makes its synthetic humans more lifelike and true to the people they're modeled on, complete with more expressive hand gestures, facial movements, and speech. You can see the results for yourself below. 

Last year, Melissa found that her Express-1-powered avatar failed to match her transatlantic accent. Its range of emotions was also limited—when she asked her avatar to read a script angrily, it sounded more whiny than furious. In the months since, Synthesia has improved Express-1, but the version of my avatar made with the same technology blinks furiously and still struggles to synchronize body movements with speech.

By way of contrast, I'm struck by just how much my new Express-2 avatar looks like me: Its facial features mirror my own perfectly. Its voice is spookily accurate too, and although it gesticulates more than I do, its hand movements generally marry up with what I'm saying. 

But the tiny telltale signs of AI generation are still there if you know where to look. The palms of my hands are bright pink and as smooth as putty. Strands of hair hang stiffly around my shoulders instead of moving with me. Its eyes stare glassily ahead, rarely blinking. And although the voice is unmistakably mine, there's something slightly off about my digital clone's intonations and speech patterns. “This is great!” my avatar randomly declares, before slipping back into a saner register.

Synthesia's new technology is impressive but raises big questions about a world where we increasingly can't tell what's real.

Anna Eiserbeck, a postdoctoral psychology researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin who has studied how humans react to perceived deepfake faces, says she isn't sure she'd have been able to identify my avatar as a deepfake at first glance.

But she would eventually have noticed something amiss. It's not just the small details that give it away—my oddly static earring, the way my body sometimes moves in small, abrupt jerks. It's something that runs much deeper, she explains.

“Something seemed a bit empty. I know there's no actual emotion behind it— it's not a conscious being. It does not feel anything,” she says. Watching the video gave her “this kind of uncanny feeling.” 

My digital clone, and Eiserbeck's reaction to it, make me wonder how realistic these avatars really need to be. 

I realize that part of the reason I feel disconcerted by my avatar is that it behaves in a way I rarely have to. Its oddly upbeat register is completely at odds with how I normally speak; I'm a die-hard cynical Brit who finds it difficult to inject enthusiasm into my voice even when I'm genuinely thrilled or excited. It's just the way I am. Plus, watching the videos on a loop makes me question if I really do wave my hands about that way, or move my mouth in such a weird manner. If you thought being confronted with your own face on a Zoom call was humbling, wait until you're staring at a whole avatar of yourself. 

When Facebook was first taking off in the UK almost 20 years ago, my friends and I thought illicitly logging into each other's accounts and posting the most outrageous or rage-inducing status updates imaginable was the height of comedy. I wonder if the equivalent will soon be getting someone else's avatar to say something truly embarrassing: expressing support for a disgraced politician or (in my case) admitting to liking Ed Sheeran's music. 

Express-2 remodels every person it's presented with into a polished professional speaker with the body language of a hyperactive hype man. And while this makes perfect sense for a company focused on making glossy business videos, watching my avatar doesn't feel like watching me at all. It feels like something else entirely.

The real technical challenge these days has less to do with creating avatars that match our appearance than with getting them to replicate our behavior, says Björn Schuller, a professor of artificial intelligence at Imperial College London. “There's a lot to consider to get right; you have to have the right micro gesture, the right intonation, the sound of voice and the right word,” he says. “I don't want an AI [avatar] to frown at the wrong moment—that could send an entirely different message.”

To achieve an improved level of realism, Synthesia developed a number of new audio and video AI models. The team created a voice cloning model to preserve the human speaker's accent, intonation, and expressiveness—unlike other voice models, which can flatten speakers' distinctive accents into generically American-sounding voices.

To some people, digital clones are the future of influence and productivity—faces, voices, and personalities at infinite scale. My clone was underwhelming.

When a user uploads a script to Express-1, its system analyzes the words to infer the correct tone to use. That information is then fed into a diffusion model, which renders the avatar's facial expressions and movements to match the speech. 

Alongside the voice model, Express-2 uses three other models to create and animate the avatars. The first generates an avatar's gestures to accompany the speech fed into it by the Express-Voice model. A second evaluates how closely the input audio aligns with the multiple versions of the corresponding generated motion before selecting the best one. Then a final model renders the avatar with that chosen motion. 

This third rendering model is significantly more powerful than its Express-1 predecessor. Whereas the previous model had a few hundred million parameters, Express-2's rendering model's parameters number in the billions. This means it takes less time to create the avatar, says Youssef Alami Mejjati, Synthesia's head of research and development:

“With Express-1, it needed to first see someone expressing emotions to be able to render them. Now, because we've trained it on much more diverse data and much larger data sets, with much more compute, it just learns these associations automatically without needing to see them.” 



Although humanlike AI-generated avatars have been around for years, the recent boom in generative AI is making it increasingly easier and more affordable to create lifelike synthetic humans—and they're already being put to work. Synthesia isn't alone: AI avatar companies like Yuzu Labs, Creatify, Arcdads, and Vidyard give businesses the tools to quickly generate and edit videos starring either AI actors or artificial versions of members of staff, promising cost-effective ways to make compelling ads that audiences connect with. Similarly, AI-generated clones of livestreamers have exploded in popularity across China in recent years, partly because they can sell products 24/7 without getting tired or needing to be paid. 

For now at least, Synthesia is “laser focused” on the corporate sphere. But it's not ruling out expanding into new sectors such as entertainment or education, says Peter Hill, the company's chief technical officer. In an apparent step toward this, Synthesia recently partnered with Google to integrate Google's powerful new generative video model Veo 3 into its platform, allowing users to directly generate and embed clips into Synthesia's videos. It suggests that in the future, these hyperrealistic artificial humans could take up starring roles in detailed universes with ever-changeable backdrops. 

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

At present this could, for example, involve using Veo 3 to generate a video of meat-processing machinery, with a Synthesia avatar next to the machines talking about how to use them safely. But future versions of Synthesia's technology could result in educational videos customizable to an individual's level of knowledge, says Alex Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at Synthesia. For example, a video about the evolution of life on Earth could be tweaked for someone with a biology degree or someone with high-school-level knowledge. “It's going to be such a much more engaging and personalized way of delivering content that I'm really excited about,” he says. 

The next frontier, according to Synthesia, will be avatars that can talk back, “understanding” conversations with users and responding in real time Think ChatGPT, but with a lifelike digital human attached. 

Synthesia has already added an interactive element by letting users click through on-screen questions during quizzes presented by its avatars. But it's also exploring making them truly interactive: Future users could ask their avatar to pause and expand on a point, or ask it a question. “We really want to make the best learning experience, and that means through video that's entertaining but also personalized and interactive,” says Alami Mejjati. “This, for me, is the missing part in online learning experiences today. And I know we're very close to solving that.”

We already know that humans can—and do—form deep emotional bonds with AI systems, even with basic text-based chatbots. Combining agentic technology—which is already capable of navigating the web, coding, and playing video games unsupervised—with a realistic human face could usher in a whole new kind of AI addiction, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab.  

“If you make the system too realistic, people might start forming certain kinds of relationships with these characters,” he says. “We've seen many cases where AI companions have influenced dangerous behavior even when they are basically texting. If an avatar had a talking head, it would be even more addictive.”

Schuller agrees that avatars in the near future will be perfectly optimized to adjust their projected levels of emotion and charisma so that their human audiences will stay engaged for as long as possible. “It will be very hard [for humans] to compete with charismatic AI of the future; it's always present, always has an ear for you, and is always understanding,” he says. “Al will change that human-to-human connection.”

As I pause and replay my Express-2 avatar, I imagine holding conversations with it—this uncanny, permanently upbeat, perpetually available product of pixels and algorithms that looks like me and sounds like me, but fundamentally isn't me. Virtual Rhiannon has never laughed until she's cried, or fallen in love, or run a marathon, or watched the sun set in another country. 

But, I concede, she could deliver a damned good presentation about why Ed Sheeran is the greatest musician ever to come out of the UK. And only my closest friends and family would know that it's not the real me. 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. Here's how.

Vouched, the Seattle startup that uses AI to help companies verify identity, raised $17 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Spring Rock Ventures.

Vouched's software has traditionally worked by analyzing images of photo identity documents such as driver's licenses. The technology compares a user's selfie to confirm identity, while also looking for signs of tampering, examining addresses and checking everything against databases. The idea is to provide fraud detection of a person in real-time.

But CEO Peter Horadan said investor interest was driven by a “new future of identity” that he says is coming and will drive profound changes in the way that we all do business together.

The first is mobile driver's licenses — currently available in about 15 states (but not Washington). These licenses live on a person's smartphone and cryptographic material tied to the license is only given up by a person's biometrics, such as thumbprint or facial ID.

“For example, we could be online, and I could say, ‘Show me your ID.' The phone will ask for your biometric, and then it'll provide that ID,” Horadan said. “So now I have absolutely foolproof proof that this person is, in fact, who they say they are, and that they're here live right now.”

The second big identity verification need coming is because of AI agents. The personal digital assistants can make a reservation, do your banking, log into your work systems, and more.

“The problem is, you have to give it your username and password, which is a giant security risk,” Horadan said. “And so for the new agentic future, we've released our ‘Know Your Agent' platform, and it allows people to know what are good agents and what are bad agents, and which agents can [they] trust with that information.” 

Earlier this year, Vouched launched KnowThat.ai, an agent reputation directory, as part of the Know Your Agent (KYA) suite. Powered by AI to safeguard against AI, it's all designed to provide continuous monitoring of agent behavior and proactively detect anomalous or potentially malicious activity.

“We're seeing very strong growth and very strong demand for what we're doing,” Horadan said, adding that the company is above $10 million in annual recurring revenue.

Customers are across industries including healthcare and telemedicine, fintech, and auto. 

Founded in 2018, Vouched was spun out of Madrona Venture Labs, the onetime accelerator that was absorbed back into the Madrona venture firm in Seattle.

The startup raised $6.3 million in February 2023 and has raised $22 million to date. Vouched employs 40 people.

Horadan joined Vouched as CEO last year. He's a seasoned tech executive who spent two years at The Sage Group, which acquired Lockstep, an accounting software startup he co-founded in 2022. He was previously executive vice president of engineering and CTO at tax software giant Avalara, and also led teams at Microsoft and Concur. 

“What other people think of as boring, back-end business processes, they actually have tremendous value, because every business has to do them. And when you automate it, there's a real ROI that's created,” Horadan said. “It's interesting that Seattle is such a hub for these kind of plays.”

HBM may soon be edged out in some use cases

Memory startup d-Matrix is claiming its 3D stacked memory will be up to 10x faster and run at up to 10x greater speeds than HBM. d-Matrix's 3D digital in-memory compute (3DIMC) technology is the company's solution for a memory type purpose-built for AI inference.High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, has become an essential part of AI and high-performance computing. HBM memory stacks memory modules on top of each other to more efficiently connect memory dies and access higher memory performance. However, while its popularity and use continue to expand, HBM may not be the best solution for all computational tasks; where it is key for AI training, it can be outmatched in AI inference.To this end, d-Matrix has just brought its d-Matrix Pavehawk 3DIMC silicon online in the lab. Digital in-memory compute hardware currently looks like LPDDR5 memory dies with DIMC chiplets stacked on top, attached via an interposer. This setup allows the DIMC hardware to perform computations within the memory itself. The DIMC logic dies are tuned for matrix-vector multiplication, a common calculation used by transformer-based AI models in operation. "We believe the future of AI inference depends on rethinking not just compute, but memory itself," said Sid Sheth, founder and CEO of d-Matrix, in a recent LinkedIn post. "AI inference is bottlenecked by memory, not just FLOPs. Models are growing fast, and traditional HBM memory systems are getting very costly, power hungry, and bandwidth limited. 3DIMC changes the game. By stacking memory in three dimensions and bringing it into tighter integration with compute, we dramatically reduce latency, improve bandwidth, and unlock new efficiency gains."With Pavehawk currently running in d-Matrix's labs, the firm is already looking ahead to its next generation, Raptor. In a company blog post as well as Sheth's LinkedIn announcement, the firm claims that this next-gen, also built on a chiplet model, will be the one to outpace HBM by 10x in inference tasks while using 90% less power. The d-Matrix DIMC project follows a pattern we've seen in recent startups and from tech theorists: positing that specific computational tasks, such as AI training vs. inference, should have hardware specifically designed to efficiently handle just that task. d-Matrix holds that AI inference, which now makes up 50% of some hyperscalers' AI workloads, is a different-enough task than training that it deserves a memory type built for it.A replacement for HBM is also attractive from a financial standpoint. HBM is only produced by a handful of global companies, including SK hynix, Samsung, and Micron, and its prices are anything but cheap. SK hynix recently estimated that the HBM market will grow by 30% every year until 2030, with price tags rising to follow demand. An alternative to this giant may be attractive to thrifty AI buyers — though a memory made exclusively for certain workflows and calculations may also seem a bit too myopic for bubble-fearing potential clients.

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

On a spring day in 1954, Bell Labs researchers showed off the first practical solar panels at a press conference in Murray Hill, New Jersey, using sunlight to spin a toy Ferris wheel before a stunned crowd.

The solar future looked bright. But in the race to commercialize the technology it invented, the US would lose resoundingly. Last year, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels and modules, while America shipped just $69 million, according to the New York Times. It was a stunning forfeit of a huge technological lead. 

And now the US seems determined to repeat the mistake. In its quest to prop up aging fossil-fuel industries, the Trump administration has slashed federal support for the emerging cleantech sector, handing his nation's chief economic rival the most generous of gifts: an unobstructed path to locking in its control of emerging energy technologies, and a leg up in inventing the industries of the future.

China's dominance of solar was no accident. In the late 2000s, the government simply determined that the sector was a national priority. Then it leveraged deep subsidies, targeted policies, and price wars to scale up production, drive product improvements, and slash costs. It's made similar moves in batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. 

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has set to work unraveling hard-won clean-energy achievements in the US, snuffing out the gathering momentum to rebuild the nation's energy sector in cleaner, more sustainable ways.

The tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law in early July wound down the subsidies for solar and wind power contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation also cut off federal support for cleantech projects that rely too heavily on Chinese materials—a hamfisted bid to punish Chinese industries that will instead make many US projects financially unworkable.

From generous government subsidies to support for lithium batteries, here are the keys to understanding how China managed to build a world-leading industry in electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, the administration has slashed federal funding for science and attacked the financial foundations of premier research universities, pulling up the roots of future energy innovations and industries.

A driving motivation for many of these policies is the quest to protect the legacy energy industry based on coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which the US is geologically blessed with. But this strategy amounts to the innovator's dilemma playing out at a national scale—a country clinging to its declining industries rather than investing in the ones that will define the future.

It does not particularly matter whether Trump believes in or cares about climate change. The economic and international security imperatives to invest in modern, sustainable industries are every bit as indisputable as the chemistry of greenhouse gases.

Without sustained industrial policies that reward innovation, American entrepreneurs and investors won't risk money and time creating new businesses, developing new products, or building first-of-a-kind projects here. Indeed, venture capitalists have told me that numerous US climate-tech companies are already looking overseas, seeking markets where they can count on government support. Some fear that many other companies will fail in the coming months as subsidies disappear, developments stall, and funding flags. 

All of which will help China extend an already massive lead.

The nation has installed nearly three times as many wind turbines as the US, and it generates more than twice as much solar power. It boasts five of the 10 largest EV companies in the world, and the three largest wind turbine manufacturers. China absolutely dominates the battery market, producing the vast majority of the anodes, cathodes, and battery cells that increasingly power the world's vehicles, grids, and gadgets.

China harnessed the clean-energy transition to clean up its skies, upgrade its domestic industries, create jobs for its citizens, strengthen trade ties, and build new markets in emerging economies. In turn, it's using those business links to accrue soft power and extend its influence—all while the US turns it back on global institutions.

These widening relationships increasingly insulate China from external pressures, including those threatened by Trump's go-to tactic: igniting or inflaming trade wars. 

But stiff tariffs and tough talk aren't what built the world's largest economy and established the US as the global force in technology for more than a century. What did was deep, sustained federal investment into education, science, and research and development—the very budget items that Trump and his party have been so eager to eliminate. 

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to revoke the Obama-era “endangerment finding,” the legal foundation for regulating the nation's greenhouse-gas pollution. 

The agency's argument leans heavily on a report that rehashes decades-old climate-denial talking points to assert that rising emissions haven't produced the harms that scientists expected. It's a wild, Orwellian plea for you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears in a summer that saw record heat waves in the Midwest and East and is now blanketing the West in wildfire smoke.

Over the weekend, more than 85 scientists sent a point-by-point, 459-page rebuttal to the federal government, highlighting myriad ways in which the report “is biased, full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making,” as Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers, put it on Bluesky.

“The authors reached these flawed conclusions through selective filtering of evidence (‘cherry picking'), overemphasis of uncertainties, misquoting peer-reviewed research, and a general dismissal of the vast majority of decades of peer-reviewed research,” the dozens of reviewers found.The Trump administration handpicked researchers who would write the report it wanted to support its quarrel with thermometers and justify its preordained decision to rescind the endangerment finding. But it's legally bound to hear from others as well, notes Karen McKinnon, a climate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Luckily, there is time to take action,” McKinnon said in a statement. “Comment on the report, and contact your representatives to let them know we need to take action to bring back the tolerable summers of years past.”

Google may have given up on making Android tablets, but Samsung is putting along. Last week, Samsung announced a budget slate—the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite—but now it's time for flagship tablets. At IFA 2025, the tech exhibition in Berlin, the company announced the next-gen Galaxy Tab S11 series, comprising the Tab S11 and the Tab S11 Ultra. Also in tow is the Galaxy S25 FE (Fan Edition), a midrange Android phone that marks the fifth entry in the Galaxy S25 series.

The Galaxy Tab S11 costs $800, while the Tab S11 Ultra is $1,200, and the Galaxy S25 FE starts at $650. All of these devices are available for purchase today. Here's what you need to know.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra are the iPad Pro of the Android world, boasting flagship specs across the board. They can even match Apple's latest slate in one key metric: thickness. Apple highlighted the remarkable thinness of the M4-powered iPad Pro when it launched in 2024, and now the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra matches it—both Apple's and Samsung's top-tier tablets are a mere 0.20 inches thick (5.1 mm). The cheaper Tab S11 is 0.22 inches, which is a hair thicker than the 11-inch iPad Pro. Samsung's tablets are slightly heavier, though.

Unlike the prior generation Tab S10 series, there's no middle “Plus” model anymore. You have the 11-inch Tab S11 and the gargantuan 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra. Both run Android 16 out of the box, have 120-Hz AMOLED displays, and can hit a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. Samsung's S Pen stylus is bundled as usual, but it has been redesigned for the first time in years, with a hexagonal design for better grip and a cone-shaped tip for increased tilt angles and finer control. It magnetically sticks to the top edge of the slate for storage and charging.

Once again, Samsung employs a MediaTek processor, the Dimensity 9400+, which is competitive with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. They start with 12 GB of RAM, but the Ultra's 1-terabyte model bumps that up to 16 GB. (Storage is expandable via microSD.) The tablets are IP68-rated, have in-display fingerprint sensors, and support 45-watt charging speeds to fill the 8,400- and 11,600-mAh batteries, respectively.

Samsung is playing up the AI features on these tablets, which support Google's Gemini Live multimodal capabilities, so you can chat in real time with the assistant and even show it what you're seeing with the tablet's cameras. Then there's Galaxy AI features from Samsung's phones, like Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into AI-generated art, and Writing Assist, which can rephrase your words into a different tone.

None of this is new, but there are some upgrades to Samsung's DeX platform, which converts the tablet OS into a traditional desktop-like user interface, with windowed apps and a dock. A new Extended Mode lets you convert the Tab S11 tablets into an external monitor, running DeX across the tablet and a paired display for dual-screen multitasking. You can even drag and drop apps and content between the two screens. DeX also now supports up to four workspaces, so you can create four desktops catered to specific tasks and cycle between them. These tablets support Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard Slim, a keyboard cover that brings them closer in design to a 2-in-1 detachable laptop.

Outside of the screen and battery sizes, the Tab S11 Ultra has a few extra perks over the Tab S11. It has Wi-Fi 7 support versus Wi-Fi 6E, making it a little more future-proof (you need a Wi-Fi 7 router to take advantage). It has an extra 8-MP ultrawide camera on the rear, and the base model starts with 256 GB instead of 128.

The Ultra is a rare beast—one of the only Android tablets you can find at this size. But once you add the Book Cover Keyboard Slim, you're looking at a $1,410 package. You can buy a MacBook Air for under $1,000 these days, and prior experience with older Tab Ultra models has proven that it's difficult to wield as a tablet due to its massive size.

It's a good thing these slates will be supported for seven years; they'll continue getting new features and security patches over that time, giving you more bang for your buck.

The year began with the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphones—Samsung's flagship trio. Then in the spring, Samsung debuted the first-ever Galaxy S25 Edge, an ultra-thin and lightweight version of the Galaxy S25 phones, with a mix of features between the S25+ and S25 Ultra (plus lackluster battery life). Now, the final device to round out the series is the Galaxy S25 FE, which stands for Fan Edition. It's what the company typically uses to denote midrange or budget versions of its products.

The Galaxy S25 FE offers a very similar experience to the Galaxy S25+ but with lesser specs. It retains the 6.7-inch screen size, for example, but with an adaptive refresh rate that switches from 60 to 120 Hz depending on what's on the screen. (The S25+ can drop as low as 1 Hz for more battery savings.) The screen also doesn't get as bright.

It's powered by Samsung's Exynos 2400 chipset, the same chipset inside the Galaxy Z Fold7 FE, with 8 GB of RAM. This is a nearly identical chipset used in last year's Galaxy S24 FE, but with slightly faster clock speeds, so you can expect a marginal performance boost. You get 128 GB of storage, with the option to upgrade to 256 GB. (No microSD card slot here.)

Compared to the S24 FE, Samsung says it has upped the size of the vapor chamber cooling system by 10 percent. Better cooling means better sustained performance during intensive tasks, like gaming. It manages this despite being 8 percent slimmer, measuring just 7.4 mm.

It boasts the same 4,900-mAh battery capacity, and the FE supports 45-watt fast-charging. If you use the right charging adapter, that'll net you up to 65 percent in 30 minutes. There's wireless charging too, and it's the Qi2 Ready flavor like the rest of the Galaxy S25 series. That means, unlike the latest Google Pixel 10 phones, there are no native magnets inside; you'll have to use a magnetic Qi2 case to achieve Qi2 wireless charging speeds and efficiency.

You still get a triple-camera system, with a 50-MP main sensor, 8-MP telephoto (3X zoom), and 12-MP ultrawide, plus a 12-MP selfie camera. Many of the same AI features from the flagships are available here, like Instant Slow-Mo, which lets you add slow-motion to existing videoclips, and Audio Eraser, which can cut specific sounds from your footage, like wind noise, crowd, or music.

The newly announced Galaxy S25 FE and Galaxy Tab S11 series are available today, but it's also the launch day for the previously announced Galaxy Tab S10 Lite ($350) and Galaxy Buds3 FE earbuds ($150). Stay tuned for our reviews.

Year after year, humans pump more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere than nature can remove, fueling global warming. As the need to mitigate climate change becomes increasingly urgent, scientists are developing ways to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere in addition to cutting emissions.

One of the biggest hurdles to scaling current carbon capture technologies is the vast amount of energy they consume, but what if there was an alternative that uses an abundant, cheap power source? A team of researchers at Harvard University recently took a major step toward that goal. Their technique, outlined in a Nature Chemistry study published August 13, harnesses sunlight to efficiently trap CO2.

They're not talking about slapping solar panels on direct air capture systems that run on heat and electricity. This approach is based on specially designed molecules that use light to change their chemical state and reversibly trap CO2.

The methodology the researchers developed is a significant departure from leading direct air capture technologies. These systems tend to rely on chemical solvents or porous sorbents that readily bond to CO2, pulling it out of the air. But the ability to reuse those materials—and harness the carbon for practical use—requires a huge input of energy (usually heat) to release the trapped carbon into a container.

“If you want a practical way to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and then release it into a tank where you can use it, you need the solution—or whatever medium you're going to use—to be able to both capture and release. That's the key,” co-author Richard Liu, an assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard, told Gizmodo.

“Our innovation here is that we began thinking about whether you could use light directly to do that,” he explained.

To that end, Liu's team synthesized organic molecules called “fluorenyl photobases” that do exactly that. When exposed to sunlight, they rapidly release hydroxide ions that capture CO2 from ambient air by chemically binding to it. In the absence of light, the reaction reverses, releasing the trapped CO2 and reverting the photobase back to its original state.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers determined that the most effective fluorenyl photobase for CO2 capture was PBMeOH. This molecule showed no CO2 capture in the dark but the highest capture rate when exposed to light. What's more, testing showed that a PBMeOH-based carbon capture system is stable and can complete many cycles with minimal loss of efficiency.

“They only fade about 1% per cycle, so you could imagine only replenishing every 100 cycles,” Liu explained.

This work demonstrates a reversible system for carbon capture that relies solely on sunlight as the direct energy input, highlighting photobases as a promising alternative to traditional sorbents.

The results are encouraging, but Liu and his colleagues will need to clear several hurdles before they can turn their framework into real-world technologies. They're already working to address several challenges, such as the engineering aspects of how the system will expose these compounds to light and dark.

While the “best” approach is still unknown, photochemical systems present some key advantages over existing technologies, Liu said. Exploring new ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is more urgent than ever before. “Because we can't get rid of every source in the short term, carbon capture from the atmosphere—and from point sources, especially—is going to be an important part of the solution.”

Salesforce is laying off 93 workers in Washington, according to a notification filed Wednesday with the state's Employment Security Department. 

The San Francisco-based company has offices in Seattle and Bellevue. A Salesforce spokesperson did not provide details about which roles were impacted.

“We continuously assess our structure and rebalance as needed to best serve our customers and fuel growth areas,” a spokesperson said by email.  

Salesforce has more than 3,000 employees in the Seattle area, according to LinkedIn data. The company provides cloud-based software that includes customer relationship management tools.

In 2019, Salesforce acquired Seattle-based Tableau for $15.7 billion. It has significantly reduced Tableau's footprint in the city, exiting office space in the Fremont neighborhood. The company laid off roughly 10% of its workforce in the region in January 2023. 

In an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company had cut 4,000 of its customer support roles from a previous headcount of 9,000 thanks to new efficiencies gained through AI. 

It's not clear if the layoffs in Seattle and Bellevue are related to the customer support cutbacks.

Earlier this summer, Benioff announced that up to half of the company's work is now being done with AI tools. 

Benioff this year has also taken shots at Microsoft, the company's Seattle-area rival, criticizing the artificial intelligence initiatives offered by the competition while rolling out its own Agentforce platform.

Salesforce reported revenue growth of 10%, to $10.2 billion, in its fiscal second quarter earnings released Wednesday. The company's stock fell 5% in after-hours trading on weak revenue guidance.

Other tech companies including Oracle, Rec Room, F5, Microsoft, and T-Mobile have laid off staff this summer in the Seattle region.

Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his NBA team, the Los Angeles Clippers, are disputing a report alleging the team funneled $28 million to star player Kawhi Leonard through an endorsement deal designed to circumvent NBA salary cap rules.

A new investigation from former ESPN reporter Pablo Torre focuses on a $28 million endorsement deal in 2022 between Leonard, one of the NBA's biggest stars, and Aspiration, a sustainability company that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Torre, who interviewed former Aspiration employees, reported that the deal helped the Clippers evade the NBA's salary cap. 

The arrangement between Leonard and Aspiration was allegedly a “no-show job” contract, Torre reported.

One month after the Clippers signed Leonard to a $176.3 million extension in August 2021, Ballmer personally invested $50 million into Aspiration, according to Torre. That same September, Aspiration also announced a $300 million sponsorship deal with the team.

The NBA said it is investigating the matter.  

In a statement to GeekWire, the Clippers and Steve Ballmer denied the allegations. Here's the statement in full:

“Neither the Clippers nor Steve Ballmer circumvented the salary cap. The notion that Steve invested in Aspiration in order to funnel money to Kawhi Leonard is absurd. Steve invested because Aspiration's co-founders presented themselves as committed to doing right by their customers while protecting the environment. 

After a long campaign of market manipulation, which defrauded not only Steve but numerous other investors and sports teams, Aspiration filed for bankruptcy. Its co-founder, Joseph Sanberg, recently pleaded guilty to a $243 million fraud. Neither Steve nor the Clippers had knowledge of any improper activity by Aspiration or its co-founder until after the government initiated its investigation. Aspiration was a team sponsor for the 2021- 2022 and 2022- 2023 seasons before defaulting on its contract.  

There is nothing unusual or untoward about team sponsors doing endorsement deals with players on the same team. Neither Steve nor the Clippers organization had any oversight of Kawhi's independent endorsement agreement with Aspiration. To say otherwise is flat-out wrong.

The Clippers take NBA compliance extremely seriously, fully respect the league's rules, and welcome its investigation related to Aspiration. The Clippers will also continue to cooperate with law enforcement in its investigation into Aspiration's blatantly fraudulent activity.”

Aspiration, which offered banking and other services for sustainability-related initiatives, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. The company's co-founder, Joseph Sanberg, was charged last month and agreed to plead guilty to defrauding investors and lenders.

Potential penalties for skirting NBA salary cap rules can involve fines, loss of future draft picks, or even voiding contracts, as seen in the league's 2000 punishment of the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The NBA previously investigated complaints involving Leonard and improper benefits.

Ballmer, who led Microsoft as CEO from 2000 to 2014, bought the Clippers in 2014 for $2 billion, which was a record at the time. The team is now worth $5.4 billion, the eighth-most valuable NBA franchise, according to CNBC. Ballmer's net worth is more than $174 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. People just adore their reMarkable devices. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display.

See reMarkable Paper Pro at Amazon

Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately.

It's a handsome device that works exactly like a smaller version of the Paper Pro. About the only thing that I find a turnoff is the thick, inch-ish tall bezel on the bottom of the 1,696 x 954 color E Ink display. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. On the plus side, the density of the pixels is higher compared to the Paper Pro—264 PPI versus 229 PPI—which means content does appear just a smidge sharper. reMarkable says the Paper Pro Move can render the same 20,000 colors as the Paper Pro.

I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital.

The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. The handwriting-to-text recognition is also hit or miss—even AI can't perfectly convert the worst chicken scratch. Sorry, doctors, your unreadable handwriting is probably still unreadable to artificial intelligence.

 

The Paper Pro Move comes with 64GB of storage, which is good for up to 810 digital notebooks, and is the same amount you get in the Paper Pro. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.”

Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. It's not going to be for everyone—get an iPad if you want a multipurpose tablet that does messaging, videos, games, music, and more—but it's definitely for somebody who wants a focused device for jotting stuff down and will pay for it. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. The Paper Pro Move with Marker costs $449, but there's also a bundle that includes the Marker Plus, which comes with an eraser on the end, for $499. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

Nearly six decades after its invention, the design of the computer mouse has remained largely unchanged - with serious consequences for users.

A new study led by Jose Berengueres, Associate Professor at the School of Engineering and Digital Sciences of Nazarbayev University (NU), Kazakhstan, together with Tony Yu from the University of Melbourne, emphasizes the urgent need for ergonomic redesigns that better fit the human hand and prevent long-term injury.

Key findings: nearly 20% of users suffer from chronic disorders related to mouse use. Tests with students at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) revealed high levels of discomfort, especially among gamers under 30.

Professor Berengueres tested two prototypes:

Fleximouse - a squeezable mesh-body device that encouraged a natural palmar grasp.

A-frame hinge mouse - developed with Tony Yu, University of Melbourne, offering vertical orientation, fewer moving parts, and lower production cost.

A critical insight emerged: fit matters. Even a 1 cm difference in hand size strongly affected comfort and usability.

With new tools such as 3D printing, flexible electronics, and advanced materials, researchers see an opportunity to finally re-engineer one of the most widely used digital tools.

The mouse is long overdue for reinvention. Done right, it could make computing healthier and more comfortable for millions."

Jose Berengueres, Associate Professor, School of Engineering and Digital Sciences, Nazarbayev University (NU), Kazakhstan

Repetitive strain injuries are a growing concern worldwide, especially for young people who spend long hours at computers or gaming. Healthier device design could improve wellbeing, reduce medical costs, and boost productivity across industries.

With 3D printing, flexible electronics, and advanced materials, researchers see an opportunity to create customizable mice that adapt to hand size and movement.

"The mouse is long overdue for reinvention," says Prof. Berengueres. "Done right, it could make computing healthier and more comfortable for millions."

The research group led by Drs. Mitsuru Arase, Mari Murakami, and Prof. Kiyoshi Takeda (Graduate School of Medicine/ Immunology Frontier Research Center at The University of Osaka) revealed that transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40 play crucial roles in inducing T cells involved in Crohn's disease.

Crohn's disease is an intractable disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which persist in long-term in the intestinal mucosa, have been implicated in disease pathogenesis, but it has not been clear how these cells are induced.In this study, though comprehensive single-cell analysis of gut T cells from Crohn's disease patients, the research group identified the accumulation of TRM with high expression of transcription factors RUNX2 and BHLHE40. RUNX2 is known as a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation and maturation; however, a different RUNX2 variant was expressed in Crohn's disease TRM, distinct from that found in bone.Overexpression of RUNX2 and BHLHE40 in blood-derived T cells from healthy individuals enhanced the production of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (GZMB), and promoted tissue-retentive properties. Conversely, repression of these factors in patient-derived gut T cells reduced their inflammatory and tissue-retaining characteristics.These findings indicate that RUNX2 and BHLHE40 drive pathogenic TRM differentiation and may represent novel therapeutic targets for chronic inflammation and relapse in Crohn's disease.

In this research, we successfully identified a factor that induces T cells involved in the symptoms of Crohn's disease. We sincerely hope that the results of this study will contribute to the development of new diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for Crohn's disease. We extend our deepest gratitude to all collaborators and to the patients who generously provided samples for this study."

Is it possible to treat obesity without reducing food intake? A new study co-led by Dr. Antonio Zorzano and Dr. Manuela Sánchez-Feutrie at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) suggests that this might be a possibility, at least in animal models. Published in Nature Communications, the research identifies a key role for Neuritin 1, a protein previously linked to the nervous system, which is also produced in brown adipose tissue, where it acts as a powerful driver of energy expenditure and metabolic health.

Unlike current anti-obesity and antidiabetic drugs, such as Ozempic or tirzepatide, which work by suppressing appetite, Neuritin 1 boosts energy burning without affecting food intake.

By increasing the levels of Neuritin 1 specifically in brown fat, we observed that the animals burned more energy, which helped prevent fat accumulation."

Dr. Antonio Zorzano, professor at the University of Barcelona and researcher at CIBERDEM

This metabolic boost led to significant improvements in several health indicators, including reduced weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower liver inflammation, even in animals fed high-calorie diets.

Previously described for its role in neuronal plasticity, Neuritin 1 is now shown to have a metabolic function in brown fat, a type of fat specialised in generating heat through a process known as thermogenesis. This process involves burning energy to maintain body temperature, particularly in response to cold. In this context, Neuritin 1 stimulates mitochondrial activity and promotes the expression of thermogenic genes.

To trigger its expression, the researchers used a viral vector that drives Neuritin 1 overexpression exclusively in thermogenic fat cells. The result was a sustained increase in metabolic activity, without affecting food consumption or physical activity in the animals.

"These findings point to Neuritin 1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating obesity and its associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, through a mechanism that differs from current approaches," highlights Dr. Sánchez-Feutrie.

Beyond the animal model results, genetic data in humans also show a correlation between Neuritin 1 and susceptibility to obesity, reinforcing the potential relevance of the discovery. The team is currently exploring ways to translate these findings into a future therapeutic strategy.

The study was made possible thanks to the contributions of several IRB Barcelona core facilities, including Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Functional Genomics, Protein Expression, and Histopathology. It also involved collaborators from international institutions such as the CNRS (France), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), and the University of Houston (USA).

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer offers an accurate, non-invasive way to assess microbiome function through breath analysis.

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer is a handheld sensor system designed for at-home collection and analysis of hydrogen and methane gases produced by the fermentation of undigested sugars by the gut microbiome. This portable device provides accurate, on-demand breath testing, making it a practical tool for both clinical trials and research applications.

Paired with a user-friendly smartphone app, the Breath Analyzer allows individuals to log food intake and symptoms alongside their breath readings. This integrated data can then be accessed by researchers for longitudinal monitoring of gut microbiome responses across a range of clinical study designs.

To ensure accuracy comparable to in-clinic hydrogen methane breath tests (HMBT), the OMED Health team conducted extensive validation. This included building an in-house synthetic breath rig and benchmarking the device against a clinically established HMBT system.

The OMED Health Breath Analyzer leverages MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) sensor technology to measure hydrogen and methane levels in exhaled breath. To ensure accuracy, a diffusion membrane filters the breath sample, minimizing the influence of interfering compounds on sensor performance. Additionally, a protective mesh prevents moisture condensation on the sensors, helping to maintain a stable baseline.

New research reveals that even highly trained esports athletes can't escape wrist fatigue during marathon sessions, with short breaks offering no relief and game genre shaping the strain.

Study: Wrist extensor fatigue and game-genre-specific kinematic changes in esports athletes: a quasi-experimental study. Image credit: Prostock-studio/Shutterstock.com

Electronic sports (esports) or competitive gaming for long periods can cause long-term musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Muscular fatigue reduces performance, endangers safety, and is a health hazard in sports and daily activities. A recent paper published in BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation explores this aspect relative to wrist movement across various video games.

Esports are watched by millions and played by thousands worldwide, especially young people. Esports athletes train 4-10 hours/day to perform at the highest levels to compete in regulated tournaments. The duration of practice varies with the skill level and the game genre.

Esports combine musculoskeletal loading of certain muscle groups, high cognitive-process demands, and long sitting times, which are linked to poor health outcomes. Thus, these demands are comparable to those in computer work, piano playing, and air traffic control, where MSD risks are elevated. High-performing esports players use repetitive movements (mouse clicks and keystrokes) with high frequencies of actions per minute, over 500 in some game genres. Without proper breaks, this can cause muscular fatigue, potentially leading to overuse injuries or MSD.

Muscular fatigue is “a reduction in maximal force or power production in response to contractile activity”. It can be peripheral or central, depending on whether it affects the neuromuscular junction or the brain, respectively.

Not much research has been conducted on these aspects of esports, though mobile phone gaming may cause more muscular fatigue in non-professional gamers. Compared to amateurs, professionals have smoother, more accurate, and faster movements related to their games.

The game genre also modifies the player's kinematics. First-person shooters (FPS) and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) players have faster hand acceleration, more repetitive movements, and a longer cumulative hand movement distance than those who play adventure video games.

The current study aimed to cover research gaps in this field, such as how esports affect muscular fatigue and wrist kinematics.

The study included 32 healthy male esports athletes, with a mean age of 24. They had an average body mass index (BMI) of 24.8 kg/m2. Physical activity was, on average, ~308 minutes a week. The mean game experience was 12 years, with gaming occupying a mean of 3.6 hours a day.

Nearly 70% were MOBA players, likelier to play at highly competitive levels than FPS players. They participated in two competitive video gaming sessions lasting 90-120 minutes. The sessions were separated by a 10-minute passive sitting break during which the participants sat and rested.

Muscle activity and wrist kinematics were recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) of the upper trapezius and wrist extensors. These showed increasing muscle fatigue over time, signaled by a reduction in the frequency spectrum of the EMG.

This was demonstrated by the significantly lower median frequency (MDF) of both left and right wrist extensors (by about 3%-4%) with time. Only the right side showed a decrease for the upper trapezius, but this was not confirmed in post-hoc analysis. No significant change occurred in the trapezius, perhaps because the hands are more involved in such sports, or because of greater inter-individual variability in trapezius measures.

Unexpectedly, the root mean square (RMS) also decreased over time. This finding may be explained by the behavior of motor units during low-intensity intermittent motor tasks like competitive gaming. It could also be due to the unpredictable duration of individual gaming sessions, which allows partial muscle recovery and reduces the continuity of neuromuscular loading. This might account for the atypical EMG fatigue patterns compared to conventional constant-load tasks. This offers a field for further study.

Over 95% of the time, the wrist joint position was in the neutral zone, though this was less for FPS players than for MOBA players. The video game genre was associated with differences in the wrist kinematics, but these parameters did not significantly change over time. While FPS players' cumulative distances decreased across sessions and MOBA players showed a decrease followed by an increase, the study emphasized that these were not statistically significant effects.

The area of displacement increased, while zero-crossings decreased over time for both FPS and MOBA players. However, zero-crossings increased at the fourth measurement for both, reaching or crossing the baseline.

These group differences could be due to the greater precision required for FPS games, which involve more upper extremity use and strategically lowered mouse sensitivity settings. The game genre and mouse settings contribute to greater hand movement to increase performance levels.

Finally, there was no reduction in the physical load after the 10-minute passive break. Preventive interventions should include more physically active breaks between games to reduce muscle fatigue and improve cognitive function. Moreover, regular exercise should be incorporated into the daily routine to improve muscle health and prevent premature muscle fatigue and MSD. The authors also note that short in-game pauses, such as respawns or matchmaking, may allow partial recovery, potentially influencing fatigue patterns.

The study indicates that wrist extensor fatigue increases over 3-4 hours of esports, across all video game genres. In contrast, the effect on wrist kinematics depends on the type of game (FPS > MOBA) but does not significantly change over time.

Cumulative muscular fatigue is likely with such games since the break did not bring about any observable neuromuscular recovery. This indicates that a higher MSD risk is possible with repetitive loading.

“Implementing preventive training strategies and regular active breaks may help mitigate these effects in esports athletes.”

The authors also caution that the study was limited to male players, had more MOBA than FPS participants, and lacked a control group, factors that may affect generalizability.

Scientists have found that the diabetes/weight loss drug Semaglutide, sold commercially under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, significantly reduces cocaine-seeking behaviour in rats. This work needs to be confirmed in humans, but it suggests that Semaglutide is a candidate to be developed as a treatment for cocaine dependency; at the moment there is no effective pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependency. The work is published in the September edition of the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology.

Cocaine is the second most popular illegal drug used in Europe. The European Drug Agency reports that around 2.7 million young adults (between the age of 15-34) use cocaine regularly, representing around 2.5% of the population in that age group. Cocaine use in the UK is the second highest in the world, with around 2.7% of adults using the drug (see notes). There is, to date, no effective pharmacological treatment for problematic cocaine use.

Scientists from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and the University of Pennsylvania, led by Professor Elisabet Jerlhag (University of Gothenburg), gave male rats access to directly-injected cocaine, which they could dispense by pressing a lever in the cage. Then an experimental group of 10 of these animals were treated with semaglutide before being given access to the cocaine dispenser.

Elisabet Jerlhag said:

"We found that in comparison to the control animals, self-administration of cocaine use dropped by 26% in those animals which had been given semaglutide. Previous results, both from our group and from other groups, have found that semaglutide can reduce alcohol consumption and craving in both humans and animals, and this work on cocaine seems to reflect these previous findings on alcohol use. This is the first trial showing Semaglutide's potential as a drug for cocaine dependence. 

Importantly, we also found that after a period of abstinence, there was a 62% drop in cocaine seeking in those animals which had taken semaglutide and the motivation (work undertaken to attain the drug) was lowered by 52%. 

This is animal work, so at the moment, we can't say that we have anywhere near a viable treatment for human cocaine dependency. We need a bigger study to confirm these results, and then we need to see if the findings also apply to humans. However, these results are very promising, underlining the need for human studies, especially since there are no existing pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependency".

Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 inhibitors. These drugs (along with the similar drug Mounjaro) have revolutionised the treatment of excess weight, and are now showing promise in the treatment of mental health problems.

Commenting, Professor Christian Hendershot (of the Institute for Addiction at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles) said:

"This is a carefully conducted study that provides additional evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists can reduce cocaine reinforcement. These findings have clinical implications given the challenges identifying medications for stimulant use disorder, and the increasing clinical use of semaglutide in many areas of the world. These findings should encourage clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists for stimulant use disorder".

Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a Danaher company and global leader in laboratory automation and innovation, is redefining nucleic acid quantification through a strategic collaboration with Hombrechtikon Systems Engineering•AG (HSE•AG), a Swiss provider of customized automation and engineering solutions for the life sciences and diagnostics sectors.



This partnership updates and miniaturizes traditional nucleic acid quantification, powered by an automation-first approach that integrates high-throughput liquid handling directly into molecular biology workflows. By streamlining critical processes—from normalization to yield characterization—it bridges existing workflow gaps and empowers real-time, data-driven decision-making within a unified platform. Automated pipetting is seamlessly embedded as a functional extension of the system's ecosystem, driving efficiency and precision at scale.

Integrating the HSE eviDense UV Photometer directly onto the deck of Biomek i-Series automated workstations from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences enables real-time absorbance measurements seamlessly within the liquid handling process to deliver faster, more efficient results while eliminating manual intervention. This technique precisely measures nucleic acid concentration and purity at 260/280 and 260/230 nanometer ratios. The non-destructive analysis allows valuable sample volume to be immediately recovered or advanced through the workflow based on user needs. Designed as a drop-in replacement, the instrument integrates effortlessly into established workflows and protocols, using proven methods to automate and close existing process gaps.

Time is the most critical facet in the laboratory today, and we're always examining workflows to see how we can help laboratories achieve results faster with greater accuracy,

This collaboration is a major step forward in advancing nucleic acid quantification. By enabling this workflow to be executed through a liquid handler, we're uniquely able to help laboratories maximize walk-away time for both extraction and NGS library preparation, empowering researchers to get the answers they seek faster.”

Ewan Grant, Senior Director of the Biotech Business Unit, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences

The partnership also simplifies fluorometric analysis of nucleic acid quantification, delivering results in as little as 20 minutes for 96 samples. By integrating the HSE eviFluor Duo microcuvette-based fluorometer on the deck of a Biomek i-Series Automated Workstation from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, laboratories gain access to a fully automated, end-to-end sample preparation solution. This system enables real-time data generation for immediate, decision-based pipetting—dramatically increasing speed and precision while eliminating manual, error-prone and time-consuming steps.

“The collaboration between Beckman Coulter Life Sciences and HSE marks a significant advancement in lab automation,” said Konstantin Lutze, Chief Technology Officer at HSE. “With the integration of the eviDense UV Photometer and the eviFluor Duo Fluorometer into the Biomek i5 and i7 workstations, both absorbance and fluorescence measurements are performed fully automatically within the liquid handling workflow. This enables highly efficient nucleic acid quantification while enhancing data integrity and measurement consistency. By eliminating manual interactions, the risk of user-induced errors is minimized. Together, we support laboratories in achieving greater efficiency, reliability, and scalability through fully integrated, automated workflows.”

These two innovations empower research laboratories to accelerate drug discovery, reduce manual workload, and improve data reliability across genomic workflows, bringing researchers one step closer to the answers that matter most.

A protein particle hidden within the SARS-CoV-2 virus could lead to longer-lasting, more protective vaccines for COVID-19. 

Scientists from La Trobe University and Kumamoto University in Japan have discovered that the body's immune system strongly reacts to an internal protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which mutates less frequently than the surface-spike protein currently targeted by vaccines.

New research published in Nature Communications shows that these protein particles, known as peptides, appear on the surface of infected cells via an immune molecule called HLA-C, which killer T cells then use to identify and eliminate infection. 

La Trobe University lead researcher Distinguished Professor Stephanie Gras, Deputy Director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS), said the discovery could open the way for the development of new vaccines and treatments that offered protection across multiple strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Currently, vaccines target the spike proteins that decorate the surface of the virus – but they mutate frequently as they are constantly under pressure by our immune cells, which means we might need a new vaccine for each new variant.

We found that the killer T cells, which also fight infection, can be activated by a protein that forms a part of the shell that protects the virus's genetic material, like the yolk of an egg. 

Because this protein is inside the virus, it mutates much less frequently – knowledge which could guide the development of vaccines and therapeutics that are still effective as the virus evolves." 

Stephanie Gras, Deputy Director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS)

Professor Gras said the development of a longer-lasting vaccine could mean that people would need fewer booster vaccines to fight COVID, and help protect against the development of Long COVID.

"The more people get vaccinated, the more we're protecting the population, which helps to reduce the virus's death toll and the impact of the infection itself," Professor Gras said. 

"But there is more than just COVID – we now know that about 10 per cent of the population is impacted by Long COVID and the more you catch the virus, the more likely you can develop Long COVID."

Professor Gras, Dr Demetra Chatzileontiadou, Dr Janesha Maddumage, and PhD candidate You Min Ahn led the research team at LIMS and La Trobe University's School of Biomedicine, Agriculture and Environment (SABE).

It was funded through Professor Gras's National Health and Medical Research Centre (NHMRC) Leadership Investigator Grant (L2) and her Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant to investigate COVID. 

The research was done in collaboration with Associate Professor Chihiro Motozono and Yoshihiko Goto from the Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection at Kumamoto University in Japan, with data collection by the Australian Synchrotron. 

Professor Gras will also lead a new research centre at La Trobe University which aims to uncover the cause of Long COVID and other life-limiting post-viral infections such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). 

The Post-Acute Viral Infection diseases Group (PAVING) Centre of Research Excellence has received $3 million in Federal funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Researchers at McMaster University have discovered that a rare but dangerous reaction to a widely used blood thinner is caused by a single antibody – overturning decades of medical misunderstanding and opening the door to more precise ways of diagnosing and treating this medical complication.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 3, 2025, focused on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious immune complication that affects approximately one per cent of hospitalized patients treated with the blood thinner heparin. Nearly half of those who develop HIT experience life-threatening blood clots, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, amputations, and even death, making early detection and treatment critically important.

Until now, scientists believed that the immune response causing HIT involved many different types of antibodies working together. But this research has revealed something surprising: in every patient studied, only one antibody was causing the disease, while the rest created what the researchers describe as a kind of "smokescreen," making it harder to identify the true culprit. This discovery helps pinpoint the exact source of the problem, opening the door to more accurate diagnosis and better-targeted treatments.

This study not only challenges our existing understanding of HIT but also revolutionizes how we think about the immune response overall."

Ishac Nazy, senior author of the study and scientific director of the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory and co-director of the Michael G. DeGroote Center for Transfusion Research (MCTR)

"This work corrects decades of misunderstanding in HIT. This status quo was a key reason behind the high rate of false-positive test results and frequent misdiagnoses in HIT, which can lead to severe consequences for patients, including unnecessary treatment or avoidable complications. Our findings lay the groundwork for more accurate diagnostics and targeted treatments," said Nazy, a professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster.

The research team was comprised of scientists from the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory (MPIL) within MCTR as well as collaborators from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

They analyzed blood samples from nine patients diagnosed with HIT. In each case, they found that the antibodies targeting platelet factor 4 (PF4) – a protein involved in blood clotting – were monoclonal. This suggests that HIT may be driven by a highly specific immune reaction, rather than a generalized one.

"This discovery could reshape how we diagnose HIT and eventually how we treat it," said Jared Treverton, first author of the study and a PhD candidate at McMaster. "Knowing that HIT is caused by a monoclonal antibody will allow us to develop improved tests specific to patients with this disorder and design better targeted therapies. This is a major step towards making diagnostics more accurate and treatments much safer."

The findings are expected to have immediate relevance for hematologists, laboratory specialists, and researchers in immunology, as well as for patients receiving heparin in hospitals across Canada and around the world.

"This is a major step forward in understanding a condition that can have devastating consequences for patients. It also highlights the importance of basic science in driving clinical innovation," said co-author Donald Arnold, co-director of the MCTR and professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster.

The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Institutes of Health and the Marta & Owen Boris Foundation.

"This discovery is a testament to the power of scientific curiosity and collaboration. We are profoundly grateful to the Marta and Owen Boris Foundation and our funding partners for their support, which made this breakthrough possible. Their generosity is helping us change the way we understand and treat serious medical conditions like HIT," said co-author John Kelton, co-medical director of the MPIL and executive director of the Marnix E. Heersink School of Biomedical Innovation & Entrepreneurship at McMaster.

A new UCLA Health study found that taking an 8-strain probiotic daily may reduce the risk of pouchitis, a common inflammatory condition that occurs after colon removal surgery for ulcerative colitis, but the treatment may not be worth the cost depending on a patient's likelihood of flare-ups.

The study, published in the journal Gastro Hep Advances, is the first to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the probiotic treatment, which was shown in previous studies to be effective at preventing the initial onset of and the reoccurrence of pouchitis. The UCLA study affirmed that the probiotic formulation was effective at preventing pouchitis compared to patients taking no probiotics but found that the cost to third-party payers may outweigh those benefits in most cases unless the cost of the probiotic formulation is lowered.

Our findings highlight that while probiotic treatments can reduce the risk of this complication, their high costs limit their overall value for most patients. Our analysis can help guide shared decision-making between patients, clinicians and payers to ensure resources are used where they can provide the most benefit."

Dr. Gaurav Syal, study lead author and inflammatory bowel disease gastroenterologist at UCLA

Pouchitis is a common complication experienced by patients who have had their colon and rectum removed due to ulcerative colitis. Surgeons replace the rectum with a pouch made of the patient's small intestine. The procedure allows patients to go to the bathroom in a mostly normal way rather than having to connect their small intestine to an external bag to excrete waste.

Pouchitis can develop if this internal pouch becomes inflamed, leading to several uncomfortable symptoms such as frequent and urgent bowel movements, bloody stools and abdominal pain among others. This condition is typically treated with a short course of antibiotics. Some patients can experience recurring pouchitis.

The UCLA study sought to determine whether a daily probiotic treatment using 8-strains of bacteria to prevent the development of pouchitis is worth the cost to third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.

Using a computer model that assessed the risk of initial development and reoccurrence of pouchitis over a two-year period, the study found that the daily probiotic treatment was only cost-effective for patients who have frequent relapses of pouchitis (two or more incidents per year) but was not cost effective for patients with infrequent relapse or for preventing the first onset of this complication compared to patients who do not undergo the probiotic treatment.

Over the two-year period, the model found:

Dr. Syal said the findings can help clinicians determine treatment options with patients as well as inform policymakers and third-party payers to determine how best to allocate healthcare funding.

Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that a single injection of the antibiotic benzathine penicillin G (BPG) successfully treated early syphilis just as well as the three-injection regimen used by many clinicians in the United States and elsewhere. These findings from a late-stage clinical trial suggest the second and third doses of conventional BPG therapy do not provide a health benefit. The results were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective against syphilis, but the three-dose regimen can be burdensome and deter people from attending follow-up visits with their healthcare providers. The new findings offer welcome evidence for potentially simplifying treatment with an equally effective one-dose regimen, particularly while syphilis rates remain alarmingly high."

Carolyn Deal, Ph.D., chief of the enteric and sexually transmitted infections branch of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)

Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The United States reported 209,253 total syphilis cases and 3,882 congenital syphilis cases in 2023, representing 61% and 108% increases over 2019 numbers, respectively. Without treatment, syphilis can result in neurological and organ damage as well as severe pregnancy complications and congenital abnormalities. Syphilis can also increase a person's likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

BPG is one of the few antibiotics known to effectively treat syphilis, and stockouts are common worldwide. The antibiotic is currently being imported to the United States to resolve a nationwide shortage.

The study was conducted at ten U.S. sites and enrolled 249 participants with early syphilis, which encompasses the primary, secondary, and early latent stages of disease. Sixty-one percent of participants were living with HIV and 97% were men. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular (IM) injection of BPG 2.4 million units (MU) or a series of three IM injections of BPG 2.4 MU at weekly intervals. All participants were monitored for safety. Biological markers of successful treatment in the blood-known as the serologic response to therapy-were examined at six months following treatment.

Seventy-six percent of participants in the single-dose group had a serologic response to treatment compared to 70% of participants in the three-dose group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant, even when participants were stratified by HIV status. One participant developed signs of neurosyphilis three days after starting BPG therapy and was excluded from the analysis. Three serious adverse events were reported but were not related to BPG.

"Syphilis has been studied and treated for more than a century, and BPG has been in use for more than 50 years, yet we are still acquiring knowledge to help us optimize treatment," said Principal Investigator Edward W. Hook III, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "We hope these promising results will be complemented by scientific advances in syphilis prevention and diagnosis."

According to the study authors, the results from this trial provide substantial evidence that single-dose BPG 2.4 MU is as effective as three doses in treating early syphilis. More research is needed to understand the full potential of this abbreviated treatment strategy and to evaluate therapeutic approaches for all stages of syphilis, including late syphilis, latent syphilis of unknown duration, and clinical neurosyphilis.

The study was conducted through the NIAID-funded Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinical Trials Group.

UCLA Health has received a $7.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to expand research into a newer form of psychotherapy that has been shown to more significantly alleviate chronic pain among older adults compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. 

The planned five-year clinical trial will work with nearly 700 war veterans at seven U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs centers throughout the country to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy, known as emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET). Developed in the 2010s, EAET aims to show patients that the brain's perception of pain is strongly influenced by stress-related emotions. Patients are helped to emotionally process stressful interactions, from anything as mundane as being cut off by a driver to severe traumas such as sexual assault, with the goal of changing brain circuits dealing with both pain and emotion to reduce or eliminate chronic pain. 

The trial will be led by Dr. Brandon Yarns, assistant professor at UCLA Health's Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. 

Previous research by Yarns found that nearly four times as many veterans experienced significant pain relief with EAET compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (63% vs 17%). 

That study, including 126 patients, was the first full-scale clinical trial of EAET among older adults, older men and veterans, with past studies being largely made up of younger, female participants, Yarns said. 

The new five-year trial will be a pragmatic trial to test the therapy's effectiveness in real-world clinical sites for potential widespread adoption. The trial will scale up the treatment to 672 older veterans across seven Veterans Affairs locations throughout the U.S. The first year will be used prepare the sites, train clinicians and interview veterans who will be participating, with treatment occurring in the following four years.

Deep in the Bolivian Amazon exists a forager-horticultural community called the Tsimane. Researchers look to them for insights on how the human body functioned prior to modern technologies, as their lifestyles remain the closest to that of our ancestors. Oftentimes researchers find how we have navigated away from our evolutionary path, such as the Tsimane having the lowest rates of dementia, the healthiest hearts, and low late-age inflammation than those living in industrialized nations. But, new research from Arizona State University, has discovered a universal experience – post-menopausal women experiencing increased blood lipid levels, such as cholesterol. 

Published today in the Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health, "Higher blood lipid levels after transition to menopause in two forager-horticulturalist populations," looked at several blood lipids, like cholesterol, that are major contributing factors to heart disease. In industrialized nations, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, women notably experience an increased risk of heart disease post-menopause, including an increase in those blood lipids. 

While we have good data from industrialized populations, to our knowledge, nobody had looked at this relationship in a non-industrial, highly active population like the Tsimane before."

Madeleine Getz, PhD student studying global health in ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, and lead author on the study

The results of the study found that for the Tsimane, five of the six factors – including triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – were higher after menopause.

"While the difference varied by marker, they were between 1.5 to 11% higher after menopause. To see these risk factors increase after menopause in this population, despite their incredibly low levels of heart disease, was unexpected," Getz said, who is also an affiliated graduate student with ASU's Center for Evolution and Medicine and the Institute of Human Origins. 

Despite this increase being two to seven times lower than those documented in populations in the U.S and the U.K., the marked increase in post-menopausal lipid biomarkers for the Tsimane makes for a similar pattern despite vastly different lifestyles and diets. 

"This suggests that these increases in cholesterol around menopause may be a human universal, no matter how or where we live," Getz said.

Living a traditional hunter-farmer lifestyle, the Tsimane follow a diet free of processed foods and maintain high levels of physical activity, averaging around 15-20,000 steps per day. Their way of life closely mirrors that of early human societies, providing valuable insights into how modern environments influence disease and aging. 

Benjamin Trumble, senior author on the study and professor in ASU's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, serves as the co-director of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project. The group has a longstanding relationship with the Tsimane to collect demographic and biomedical data, as well as helps to provide medical care for the community – a relationship that has been in effect for more than 20 years. 

"Working with populations like the Tsimane allows us to global variation in both menopause, as well as human health and disease" said Trumble. "The findings here suggest that menopause is associated with increased risk factors for heart disease, even in the population with the healthiest hearts in the world. That suggests that post-menopausal increases in heart disease may be a human universal, and part of our underlying physiology regardless of lifestyle choices."

We're less than a year out from the 2026 FIFA World Cup and there are still questions surrounding the United States men's national team — and, certainly, the roster for the September international window.

Without household names like Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah left at home for these upcoming matches, there are a handful of new names at practically every position, as well as some returning faces that are hoping to re-enter the fold.

Here are five questions I have entering a crucial time for the USMNT:

1. Can Josh Sargent recreate his club form with the United States?

Josh Sargent has been red-hot for Norwich City to start the season — again — and has consistently been one of the best strikers in the English Championship for two seasons now. It was rumored he was very close to a summer move, but Sargent opted to stay and has been scoring a wide variety of goals, including a screamer this past weekend.

But get this: Sargent's last goal for the U.S. was November 20th, 2019 — yes, almost six years ago. He only has five goals in 28 appearances for the United States, and after being left off this summer's Gold Cup roster, this could be his last chance to leave a good impression on manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Former U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter used the No. 9 position as more of a hold up/false 9 role to get players running in behind the backline, and we wouldn't often see Sargent in front of goal finishing off plays. Pochettino used Patrick Agyemang all throughout the Gold Cup as a player that would run in behind to stretch defenses and also take part in the build-up, but had a lot of good looks in front of the goal. Agyemang was very inconsistent in his finishing, which has been a theme for the No. 9 players as of late.

Sargent started vs. Panama in March in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and didn't see minutes against Canada in the 3rd/4th place match. This is a second chance to prove to Pochettino he can be the guy up front.

2. Is experimentation in the backline good?

(Photo by John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images) 

There are a few new faces in the backline for this window — most notably Vancouver Whitecaps veteran Tristan Blackmon and 18-year-old Augsburg prospect Noahkai Banks.

We are 282 days until the World Cup, and if it was to start tomorrow, I'd predict the back line would be: Sergiño Dest, Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson. That's a pretty solid backline – especially if you consider the huge growth as a leader from Richards over the past year.

Ream, however, turns 38 in October. From a center-back perspective, what's been worrisome for the USMNT is that there is nobody even close to him in terms of level of play, experience, and who can comfortably start play/pass out of the back. As much as I feel comfortable with Ream in that position, it would be great if someone else could develop over the next 8–10 months and be another dependable option.

I've long since felt that the USMNT would be best with a back 3 — which could allow Ream or Richards to slide into the middle and add another option for this team. Some continued food for thought for Pochettino.

3. Will we see a motivated Christian Pulisic after this summer?

Christian Pulisic heard all the noise about his absence over the summer and I believe he will have a point to prove to those that questioned his commitment.

The team missed a player of his quality in the Gold Cup final vs. Mexico, so his return to the USMNT attack bodes well. A good set of performances in these two matches will go a long way with the USMNT fan base, with whom the relationship has been a little tense since the summer.

He came off the bench to score over the weekend for AC Milan, after pushing through a bit of an ankle knock. I'll be interested to see how he is used by Pochettino in this window and what types of performances he'll put together because, as always, all eyes are on him to be the difference-maker for this team.

4. Will the players not at camp be noticed?

(Photo by Christian Verheyen/Borussia Moenchengladbach via Getty Images) 

One of the big questions throughout the Gold Cup was: Could anyone from this group push themselves into a more prominent role with the "A" Group?

We saw some important contributions from the likes of Sebastian Berhalter, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna, Jack McGlynn, Alex Freeman, and Matt Freese that have propelled them to call-ups in this window. Tillman was an excused absence as he continues to work back from injury and integrate into life with Bayer Leverkusen (he opened his account with a goal last weekend), but for the rest, this camp presents another opportunity to show they can "level up".

The midfield will be a fascinating topic of discussion for the next 10 months. Tyler Adams will look to continue in his role at the No. 6. At the Gold Cup we saw him in a combination of two holding midfielders and, at times, as the lone No. 6 with two advanced midfielders in front. With no McKennie, Johnny Cardoso, or Yunus Musah in camp, where does Pochettino opt to go with in these games? And, how does he foresee his midfield looking in future camps?

I think these games will tell us a lot about where he is leaning, but again, with players left out for various reasons, Pochettino's hope after the Gold Cup was that nobody was "guaranteed" a position — or at least that they felt that way. I felt the pool advanced, but it's certainly not at the level I'd hope we are heading into the World Cup with.

5. Is the No. 1 spot now Matt Freese's to lose?

And so begins the … Matt Freese era? Let's see.

It was the 2021 Gold Cup where Matt Turner jumped Zack Steffen into a starting position for the USMNT. Has Freese now "Turnered" Matt Turner? All things considered, Freese had a very solid Gold Cup, with the standout moment being the three penalty saves against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals.

We also saw a few shaky moments on crosses and the back-pass against Haiti, but what was impressive was how quickly he rebounded from that. The other two keepers on the roster — Roman Celentano and Jonathan Klinsmann — are both uncapped, so it would be a safe bet to assume that Freese will once again get the nod in goal.

Pochettino knows what he has in Steffen and Turner, who I would guess currently round out the three keepers. But with Freese set to get two more games, strong and commanding performances in both could truly start to separate him as the nailed-on starter for the USMNT.

Brazil is set to take on Chile in this 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday at Maracanã Stadium.

Brazil, under coach Carlo Ancelotti, has already secured its spot in the 2026 World Cup and is set to conclude its qualifying campaign with a home match against Chile. Despite missing key players like Neymar, Joelinton, and Alex Sandro due to injuries, the squad remains formidable, featuring talents such as Alisson, Marquinhos, Casemiro, and emerging stars like João Pedro, Andrey Santos, and Estêvão. Ancelotti has emphasized evaluating potential future contributors, making this match an opportunity for these players to showcase their abilities.

Chile, managed by Nicolás Córdova, faces a challenging task as it aims to secure a positive result to keep its World Cup hopes alive. The team will be without key players, including Alexis Sánchez and Benjamín Kuscevic, due to injuries. Despite these setbacks, Chile will rely on players like Eduardo Vargas and Darío Osorio to lead their attack. However, their recent form has been concerning, with only one win in their last five matches, and they have struggled to score goals in recent outings.

Historically, Brazil has dominated this fixture, winning its last four encounters against Chile, all while keeping clean sheets. Given the current form and squad depth, Brazil is favored to secure a comfortable victory in this match.

This is a great World Cup 2026 qualifying match that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

Two-time Women's World Cup winner Alex Morgan looked back at the U.S. women's national team's equal pay battle, saying the group "never knew if it was going to ever happen" as they faced years of opposition before successfully reaching a settlement with the U.S. Soccer Federation. Morgan said that U.S. Soccer essentially argued "women are inherently inferior" and that the men have more responsibility.

Morgan was one of five players who filed a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016, months after the USWNT won their first World Cup in more than a decade and was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit filed by the entire team months before they won the 2019 World Cup. The legal battle played out for several years before the parties reached a settlement in 2022 that guaranteed equal pay and included $22 million in backpay.

"We won the World Cup first time in 16 years," Morgan said on a recent episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast. "All of a sudden, had sold out stadiums. We were seeing revenue. We were generating revenue for U.S. Soccer like never before. We were getting sponsors coming to U.S. Soccer saying, 'We want to work with the women.' U.S. Soccer doesn't do sponsors for only the women's or men's team. They bundle them together. U.S. Soccer is like one umbrella. Sponsors come and they get everything, so we were seeing this. The books are open. U.S. Soccer Federation is a company. You can see the taxes. You can see the returns at the end of the year, so you're like, 'Okay, I know what you're making. I know what we're generating. This isn't adding up.' So, 2016 comes around. We file a motion with the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and it goes nowhere. It sits, sits, sits.

"Three years go by and we know that we are bringing money into U.S. Soccer. However, we are getting paid, for example, like per game, $1,500 for a win. Zero for a tie, zero for a loss. The men, I'm throwing this out there, but I think it's almost accurate. $12,000 for a win. It was astronomically different. At the end of the year, we were making, if you played in every single game, you're making maybe like $85, $90,000. Men, if they were to play the same amount of games as us, win the same amount of times as us, like 400-plus thousand dollars. It was so different. There was such a gap, and then we were seeing what we were generating, like the revenue we were generating for them, and we're like, 'This doesn't make sense in terms of what we're bringing in, but also we're doing the same job for the same company as the men, but getting paid vastly different and getting treated vastly different.' We're sitting in 27B and the men are in 2A, so we're like, 'This is not adding up at all.' And don't get me started also on FIFA and how we had to also, and they've come a long way, but back in 2015, there was a lot of challenges also on that front. So, we went to U.S. Soccer and we filed a lawsuit. We sued them."

Though the USWNT received plenty of public support after they filed their lawsuit, the reception was different inside the federation.

"I remember specifically going to the U.S. Soccer annual board because I was on the Athletes Council, and you get a chance to speak at the end if you want," Morgan said. "There's a microphone, like a hot mic. And one of the board members from another board, it's like there's like 300 people in the room. He gets on the mic and he goes, 'Our women's team is so disappointing. They disgust me. They don't deserve to be paid what they're asking for. They don't even deserve what they're getting now.' He goes on and on for five minutes and after you hear people in the room clapping, like at the U.S. Soccer annual board meeting and us athletes were mortified, like embarrassed on his behalf, but also like this is who's making the decisions in this room. Okay, we have a lot of work to do."

The federation's pushback, though, was most visible in the court documents that came to light in early 2020 and later forced the resignation of president Carlos Cordeiro.

"We had to submit court documents … basically saying why we deserve equal pay and U.S. Soccer saying why we didn't," Morgan said. "Their main argument was that the man bears more responsibility because they, what was it? They bear more responsibility because they are inherently faster and stronger because it takes more strength and speed by a man and so the responsibility is greater. So basically saying women are inherently inferior. We dragged them. They retracted that statement later."

Morgan pointed to the leadership change after Cordeiro's resignation as a turning point in the legal battle, with retired USWNT player Cindy Parlow Cone being promoted to the role after serving as the federation's vice president.

"US Soccer hired Cindy Parlow Cone, who was a women's national team player, scored many goals, very good player," Morgan said. "She became U.S. Soccer president. Also, that was a voluntary position. You did not get paid to do that, so when she came in charge of that, we were like, "Okay, we got one on the inside. We got this. Still got to convince that board, but we got this," and when we settled and achieved equal pay and millions, over $20 million back pay, I was holding my daughter when we signed it. My daughter was three years old, two and a half, three years old, and it was a really special moment because it was, I mean, you got to think, over 500 hours of our own time put into something that you never knew if it was going to ever happen. You didn't know how you were going to be seen as. You didn't know if this was going to work out. You didn't know what kind of effect this could possibly even have in sports."

Argentina is set to take on Venezuela in this 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday at Estadio Monumental.

Argentina, under coach Lionel Scaloni, has already secured its spot in the 2026 World Cup and is poised to extend its unbeaten streak. With a record of 11 wins, 2 draws, and only three losses, they lead the CONMEBOL standings. The squad features stalwarts like Lionel Messi, Lautaro Martínez, and Nicolás Otamendi, alongside emerging talents such as Franco Mastantuono and Claudio Echeverri. Despite the absence of Enzo Fernández due to suspension, the team remains formidable. This match is particularly poignant as it could be Messi's final World Cup qualifier on Argentine soil, adding emotional weight to the fixture.

Venezuela, managed by Fernando Batista, is in a critical position, currently holding the intercontinental playoff spot in seventh place. With 18 points from 16 matches, they are just one point ahead of Bolivia and must secure a positive result to maintain their playoff hopes. The team faces challenges with key midfielders Yangel Herrera and José Martínez, along with forward Jhonder Cádiz, all unavailable due to injury. Despite the setbacks, Salomón Rondón remains a pivotal figure in their attack. Historically, Venezuela has struggled in Buenos Aires, with Argentina winning four of the last five encounters.

This is a great World Cup 2026 qualifying match that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.

That was depressing to watch.

In the opening match of the World Cup qualifiers, Germany was stunned in a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Slovakia. Historically, the loss will be remembered as Germany's first away loss in a World Cup qualifier. Germany controlled possession early, but struggled mightily with Slovakia's quick dribbling and movement, especially in 1v1 situations. In the 42nd minute, left back Dávid Hancko flew forward and was on the receiving end of a cross from Dávid Strelec. In the 55th minute, Strelec followed up his first half heroics with an impressive curler to put the game on ice.

Earlier this week, Strelec was a £6.5M deadline transfer to Middlesbrough from Slovan Bratislava. Today, he was the national hero, getting behind Antonio Rüdiger for the game-winning assist and breaking the defender's ankles to put the game out of reach with a beautiful goal in the second half. Strelec's fearless attitude resonated throughout the Slovakian squad and they were rewarded with an impressive upset victory.

Baumann's two big saves in the first half kept the match close, but the Hoffenheim goalkeeper was unable to prevent two goals from screaming past him and he was still outplayed by his Slovakian counterpart, Martin Dúbravka, who produced the five saves necessary to hold the clean sheet.

Kimmich spent a lot of the first half trying to find a forward pass but there was zero movement, possibly by design. He still managed a 97% passing rate, went three-for-three on long balls, and was a force on the defensive end. Ultimately, Kimmich can do all of these same things from the right back position if that introduces a better midfielder or attacker onto the starting XI.

The entire offense was a non-factor for most of this game. After a quiet first half, Wirtz picked up the pace a little bit and brought some creativity to the game. It would have been nice to see Germany recover at least one goal late in the game but never really found a decent opportunity.

Wirtz is better suited to roam the central midfield but Julian Nagelsmann is severely limited in his options at winger. This would potentially open up some space for Nick Woltemade to make things happen as well.

The rest of the defense was absolutely abysmal. The Slovakians abused Germany's right flank in the first half and could have scored even more goals. David Raum replaced a struggling Nnamdi Collins, switching Mittelstädt to the right side. Unfortunately, Slovakia just started attacking Germany's left flank instead. Mittelstädt finished the match with four clearances, two tackles, a blocked shot, an interception, and won three ground duels. It is very depressing that Mittelstädt was the best German player tonight.

Lionel Messi is still one of soccer's present-day fixtures, commanding the type of spotlight that befits a star who still produces highlight-reel-worthy moments on the regular. At 38 years old, though, Messi is slowly collecting a list of lasts ahead of what is likely to be his final World Cup. One of those lasts could come as soon as Thursday, when Argentina host Venezuela in Buenos Aires.

The match kicks off the penultimate round of World Cup qualifying in South America, Messi making the trip once again for the world champions' games this month. While the hard work of qualification is already behind them — Argentina booked their spot at the 2026 World Cup back in March — this may not be a routine outing for the national team. In fact, it may be Messi's final competitive match in Argentina.

The legend has not announced his retirement yet and at this point, he is likely to stick by the national team through the World Cup. His plans afterwards, though, are entirely unclear. Messi's Inter Miami contract expires this year and there is reporting to suggest he will sign a new deal that will see him play for the South Florida club for at least one more season, which could determine his national team future. No matter how one looks at it, Messi is running out of competitive games to play with the national team — Argentina is a potential host for the next Copa America, but that would not be until 2028. Next cycle's World Cup qualification schedule is understandably not set yet, but if the 2026 cycle is anything to go by, competitive games could be on the calendar by September 2027. Messi will have celebrated his 40th birthday by then, though.

A commemorative mood is in store on Thursday, though reflecting on Messi's legacy will not be the only business of the day. Venezuela will have to combat that uphill battle while hoping to book their own spot at next year's World Cup, doing so as one of three teams competing for one remaining guaranteed berth in the North America-set tournament.

Here's what you need to know before tuning in.

Questions over Messi's future have loomed large over this match, and just like the player, Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni has not offered much in terms of answers.

"Messi still makes the difference, cracks are like that," Scaloni said in a recent interview. "Messi has won the right to decide when he retires. Let's enjoy Messi while we have him."

Messi mania is persistent in Argentina, but this week in Buenos Aires, fans seem to be coalescing around the player because of his potentially impending retirement. He was greeted by flocks of fans after leaving a theatre for a production of "Rocky," which is inspired by the 1976 film starring Sylvester Stallone and features his longtime friend Nicolas Vazquez. Messi said his whole family made the trip this week, the player saying on stage after the show that it is "not often that my whole family is here in Buenos Aires."

The player has also previously said that Thursday's game will "be a very, very special match for me," creating a sentimental vibe around the whole affair, even if there is no confirmation one way or another on what the vibe should actually be.

While many of CONMEBOL's World Cup qualifying spots are booked, there is still one guaranteed spot up for grabs and another berth in the intercontinental playoff to be claimed. Venezuela are one of three teams in the mix alongside Colombia and Bolivia and though a guaranteed spot is not out of the question, getting there will be easier said than done.

Venezuela are four points behind Colombia, who currently occupy the last guaranteed berth and can book their spot at the World Cup with a win over Bolivia on Thursday. The visitors will need Colombia to drop points and manage a win at Argentina to have any shot at overtaking Los Cafeteros but their World Cup hopes will not be completely dashed if that does not happen. They enter the penultimate round of qualifying with a one point advantage over Bolivia and will need to maintain that lead on Tuesday, when they host Colombia and Bolivia welcome Brazil.

If they manage to clinch a spot at the World Cup, it would be the first time Venezuela would take part in the competition.

In recent months, several players have voiced frustration over the congested schedule created by international federations and the number of matches crammed into each season. But ahead of France's upcoming UEFA World Cup qualifiers, star forward Kylian Mbappe made a surprising statement on the matter: “We aren't playing too much.”

The 2024-25 campaign was marked by the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, held in June and July—right in the middle of what should have been players' offseason break. For 2025-26, the calendar ends with the 2026 World Cup, raising concerns that many Europe-based stars will be running on fumes by the time the tournament kicks off.

Ahead of France's clash with Ukraine for the World Cup qualifiers, Mbappe was asked if he had learned to prepare differently for such a long season after last year's grind. His response was candid: “I don't know if you can ever really be ready to play a 60-game season. From my experience, from what I've seen, I can't remember a player performing at a high level across 60 matches. Physically, yes, you can be ready—but in terms of performance level, it's just not possible. There will be times when you're not at your best.”

The Real Madrid forward then delivered the line that caught everyone's attention. “Are we playing too much? No. I used to think so, but not necessarily anymore. What we really need is just a bit more rest during vacation, to allow the body to recover and try to come back fresh,” he said, shifting the debate from the number of games to the lack of recovery time players are given.

“The counterargument is always: ‘You earn a lot of money, so play.' If we stop there, the debate will never end. When I saw teams playing friendlies before the season had even ended, that wasn't normal. I don't want players to get to a point where they're thinking they don't want to play certain matches,” Mbappe added, highlighting how the calendar has become overwhelming.

With competitions like the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup adding even more fixtures to the calendar, the conversation has long focused on match volume. But Mbappé's stance reframes the issue—arguing that recovery time, not the number of games, is the key factor in maintaining peak performance.

Last season was a landmark one for Mbappe, his first at Real Madrid following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain. He featured in seven different competitions—La Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey, Club World Cup, Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Intercontinental Cup.

Across those tournaments, Mbappe played 59 matches, scored 44 goals, and added five assists, missing only nine games. That included three Club World Cup fixtures he sat out with acute gastroenteritis, while the others were due to minor muscle strains or coach's decisions to rest him between matches.

On top of his club duties, he also featured in six matches for France, including the Nations League Final Four, while missing four others during his public dispute with coach Didier Deschamps. In total, Mbappe played 65 matches in the 2024-25 season—a staggering workload that makes his refusal to complain about the number of games all the more striking.

Argentina return to action at River Plate's Estadio Mâs Monumental, hosting Venezuela in their final home game of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

La Albiceleste secured their place in next summer's World Cup already and are looking ahead to defend their crown. However, the game against Venezuela will be a momentous occasion regardless.

Lionel Messi will likely play his final official home game with La Albiceleste against La Vinotinto, as Messi himself admitted. The iconic Monumental will be rocking as thousands upon thousands of Argentina fans cram the stadium to celebrate their hero.

For Venezuela, though, this game is of massive importance. La Vinotinto currently holds the final spot for an intercontinental playoff berth. Fernando Batista's side have a one point lead over Bolivia and the next two games will determine if they get a chance to play for their first-ever World Cup appearance.

Netherlands host Poland in a FIFA World Cup 2026 European Qualifiers Group G clash, both on six points but the Dutch ahead with a game in hand and +10 goal difference

Koeman's side beat Finland and Malta; Poland beat Lithuania and Malta but lost to Finland

Netherlands reached three World Cup finals; Poland's best is third place in 1974 and 1982

The Netherlands welcome Poland to the iconic De Kuip, Rotterdam, for their Group G clash in the FIFA World Cup 2026 European Qualifiers on Thursday (September 4, 2025). Watch the Netherlands vs Poland football match live tonight.

Both teams are level on six points, but the Dutch sit second with a game in hand and also enjoy a superior goal difference, +10. Poland are a string below after three matches. They have a goal difference of +2.

Both sides have six points each, but the Netherlands hold the edge -- second in the group standings with a game in hand and a commanding +10 goal difference. Poland trail just behind, having played one match more and a modest +2 goal difference.

Heading into this match, Finland lead Group G with seven points from four games, followed by the Netherlands with six from two, and Poland also on six but from three matches. Lithuania and Malta trail behind with two and one point, respectively.

Ronald Koeman's Oranje are on a strong run, winning both of their qualifiers so far, and handsomely: 2-0 against Finland and 8-0 against Malta. And mercurial Robert Lewandowski is back to lead the Dutch attack following the departure of Michal Probierz.

Jan Urban's Poland started with wins over lowly Lithuania and Malta but lost 1-2 to Finland in their last qualifying outing, and tonight the Eagles face their biggest test yet.

The Netherlands have qualified eleven times for the World Cup Finals and reached the final three times (1974, 1978, 2010), but never lifted the trophy. In the 2022 edition, they lost to eventual champions Argentina in the quarter-finals, on penalties. Poland have qualified nine times, finishing third in 1974 and 1982. They also reached the Round of 16 in 2022.

This marks their 21st meeting, and the Netherlands lead Poland 10-3 in the all-time head-to-head record. Seven matches have ended in draws. Poland's last win dates back to May 1979.

In their most recent meeting, the Netherlands overturned an early setback as Adam Buksa's 16th-minute header gave Poland the lead during their UEFA European Championship 2024 group match. But Cody Gakpo's deflected equalizer and sub Wout Weghorst's late strike sealed a 2-1 comeback victory for the Dutch in Hamburg, Germany.

World Cup

Tickets to the 2026 World Cup are not yet on general sale, but soon, the yearslong wait will end.

After months of confusion and silence, FIFA on Wednesday revealed timelines, basic ticketing details and some initial prices for the tournament, which begins next June in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The opening of a presale application window on Sept. 10 will mark the start of a multi-phase process that is now more defined, but still requires lots of explanation.

So, the following is an attempt to explain it.

There are multiple avenues to World Cup tickets. They come with varying degrees of certainty and cost. They are:

The “Visa Presale Draw” opens at 11 a.m. ET on Sept. 10, but you do not need to rush to your computer or smartphone that day. You can enter anytime between then and Sept. 19. No preference will be given to earlier applicants, FIFA says.

The first official purchases of tickets, by the successful applicants, will then happen in October.

For non-Visa cardholders, a nearly identical phase will open on or around Oct. 27, with purchasing time slots in November and early December.

Somewhat soon after the World Cup draw — after which we'll learn the teams, dates, times and locations for all 72 group-stage games — will be your first opportunity to secure seats for a specific matchup.

Until then, you are buying tickets for a game between unknown opponents (with the exception of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who, as co-hosts, already know when and where they'll be playing).

To receive updates directly from FIFA, you can “register your interest.”

You can also create a “FIFA ID,” an account that you'll need to eventually buy tickets on the official platform.

And if you don't have a Visa credit or debit card, but would like to enter this first lottery, you could buy a Visa prepaid card, which, according to the company, will make you eligible.

Yes. (Visa is a FIFA sponsor, hence the scheme.)

A FIFA official said Tuesday that the ticketing system will process a $0.00 charge to the card of any applicant, to ensure that only Visa cardholders get access.

But in all subsequent phases, you can use other cards or payment methods.

FIFA officials say you can buy up to four apiece for up to 10 matches — so, 40 tickets in total per person.

If you'd like to go to a game with a larger group, you'll need to have multiple people register, apply, and buy tickets with distinct FIFA IDs.

You'll have three options, per FIFA:

You won't have to choose between these options until October. When you apply, you're merely applying for a place in line — for a time slot. During the application process, you'll be asked about your ticket preferences, but these won't impact the lottery, FIFA says.

The cheapest tickets to group games will start at $60. Most tickets, though, will be more expensive, and probably much more expensive. FIFA hasn't yet revealed a full set of prices.

And all of those prices could change. FIFA will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said. By December, prices for popular teams like Argentina will almost certainly rise, while prices for games that aren't selling well could fall, like they did for a majority of Club World Cup matches this past spring and summer.

The highest price for the 2026 World Cup final will start at $6,730, FIFA said Wednesday. That's more than four times the price of a Category 1 ticket to the 2022 World Cup final, which cost $1,605.

In general at the Qatar World Cup, the most expensive to date, Category 1 tickets for group matches were roughly $220; Category 2 tickets were roughly $165; Category 3 seats, the cheapest available to international fans, were roughly $69.

The 2026 prices will almost certainly surpass those, perhaps by significant margins.

U.S. sports fans are accustomed to buying specific seats in a specific row and section.

For major international soccer tournaments like the World Cup, though, tickets are typically divided into three or four categories, and fans must buy them without knowing the exact location of their seats.

A Category 1 ticket, for example, might be in the 20th row of the lower bowl in a sideline section level with the penalty box; or it might be on the second deck closer to midfield.

Category 2 and 3 tickets are usually in the corners or behind one goal, but FIFA has adjusted its categorizations to align with what it says are American preferences. “Fans value the front-row seat much higher,” an official said, “than the seats that have a technical view of the pitch.” So, rather than sideline vs. endline, the delineation will generally be lower level (Category 1), second deck (Category 2) and upper deck (Category 3 and 4).

FIFA will release maps of each stadium showing which sections belong to which categories, like it did for Qatar 2022.

In the U.S., most single-game tickets to an NFL or NBA game are sold on a “first come first served” basis. If, say, you'd like to go to the Dec. 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, you go to Ticketmaster, the NFL's “official ticketing partner”; you see a variety of tickets available, both “verified tickets from Atlanta Falcons” and “verified resale tickets”; you pay for them (including taxes and a fee to Ticketmaster); and the tickets show up, digitally, in your Ticketmaster account and mobile app.

Or, alternatively, you could go to resale sites like StubHub and find hundreds of similarly priced tickets. The main difference there is that the transfer of tickets into your account and app depends on the seller, and isn't always immediate. (More on that below.)

For the 2026 World Cup, it's unclear how FIFA will list and distribute tickets, but one strategy might surprise American fans: there'll be a lag time between purchase and distribution. FIFA and other international soccer organizers typically won't deliver your actual tickets until closer to gameday, in part to prevent illegal duplication and creation of fake tickets, in part to restrict the resale market.

“You will get your ticket in the app at a later stage, not at the moment of the purchase,” Jean-Marie Tardy, a FIFA ticketing manager, said of the system generally on a TicketCo podcast in 2023. “And once the ticket is loaded into your app … you've got all the information about all your tickets — the seat category, the stadium, the match, even the seat details — but you don't get anything that can get scanned at that moment.”

FIFA can't fully stop resale sites from accepting and advertising World Cup tickets. And many sites are already doing that. StubHub, SeatGeek, TickPick, Vivid Seats and others show tickets available for “TBD vs. TBD” on June 13 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and for most, if not all, of the 104 matches.

FIFA, rather than battling those sites technologically or legally, has essentially decided to match their offering. It will operate its own resale platform, which won't cap markups (except for fans in Mexico). The reason, World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

So, there will still be StubHub listings, but buying on a third-party site carries some degree of uncertainty. Those sites, and the sellers, can't 100% guarantee that you'll actually get your tickets. FIFA can.

FIFA, in statements over the past year, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.”

Those sites don't require a seller to upload the digital ticket to list it.

They threaten to impose penalties on the seller if a re-sold ticket ultimately isn't delivered to the buyer, and promise to compensate the buyer in a variety of ways if that happens. But nothing prevents a fan or speculator from selling tickets that they don't yet have.

So, there are tickets available on several resale sites, often for upward of $1,000. And there are four main theories about what, exactly, those “tickets” are:

That remains up in the air. A World Cup official said there have been discussions about sales phases that would specifically incentivize fans from the three co-host countries, but those discussions remain ongoing.

At previous World Cups, there were “Category 4” allotments reserved for residents of the host country at lower price points. But in those countries, the average citizen had less purchasing power than the typical World Cup tourist. Here, FIFA won't need to give Americans a discount. It might, though, offer some sort of priority access in a later phase.

No. FIFA has always clarified: “A match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country.”

The U.S. government has no known plans to ease its visa application process or entry requirements for World Cup fans.

The Visa presale draw opens Sept. 10. Fans will learn whether their applications were successful by Sept. 29. It's unclear if we'll get more information between now and then. A full price list likely won't be revealed until the first sales slot opens on Oct. 1.

World Cup

FIFA said Wednesday that ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup will start at $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats and range to $6,730 for the most expensive tickets to the final – but all of that is subject to change once sales begin in October.

A FIFA official, speaking to reporters on a Zoom call Tuesday, confirmed that organizers will use “variable pricing,” also known as dynamic pricing, for World Cup tickets.

This means that prices may – and probably will – change before and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when group-stage matchups, dates and locations will be set.

“We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” the FIFA official said.

An initial ticket phase, featuring a lottery, will open Sept. 10. Fans will apply for the chance to purchase tickets (using a Visa card); and if randomly selected, they'll get the opportunity to buy up to 40 — up to four per match, for up to 10 matches — in a specific time slot in October.

A similar second phase, which will not include the Visa card requirement, will run from late October through early December. There will then be another lottery phase, followed by a first-come-first-served phase, after the World Cup draw.

FIFA officials said they had not yet determined all of the initial prices. They will divide tickets into four categories — with Category 1 being the most expensive and Category 4 the least expensive — but when asked about the prices for Category 1, 2 and 3 tickets to group-stage matches, one official said that those numbers weren't set.

He also would not say how many of the $60 tickets will be available, nor what percentage of a given stadium will be considered “Category 4” seats, though he did say that percentage will “not be insignificant.”

In general, the lower bowl of stadiums will be Category 1; the second deck will be Category 2; and the upper deck will be Category 3 and 4. In most of the sales phases, fans will purchase tickets in these categories without knowing what section or row they'll be assigned; they will not be able to choose specific seats.

The initial $6,730 maximum price for the final is not a hospitality ticket — those are already on sale, and range from $3,500 to $73,200 per person across the tournament.

The regular-ticket maximum is more than four times the price of Category 1 tickets to the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, which cost $1,605. (Category 2 was $1,002, and Category 3 was $604.)

The FIFA official said Tuesday that organizers had “committed to the $60” as a starting point, but that “we will apply variable pricing from Day 1 of the process.” That means prices could rise or fall during the presale phase, which will run through Oct. 21. (Sept. 19 is the deadline to apply.)

Although dynamic pricing is typically associated with price increases, the opposite happened ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. Months after FIFA overestimated demand with its initial prices, the cost of tickets plummeted as FIFA scrambled to fill otherwise-empty seats.

The expectation, though, is that demand for the 2026 World Cup, which will feature 104 matches in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will be much higher, and prices could rise.

“We do not intend at all to change prices every five minutes,” the official clarified, but he acknowledged that part of the process would involve automation.

To justify the “variable pricing” approach, he and another World Cup official said that it would allow FIFA to maximize revenues and attendance. Soccer's global governing body, which runs the World Cup, expects to make over $3 billion from hospitality and ticket sales. It also expects to smash the previous World Cup attendance record, which is still held by the 1994 edition, a 24-team tournament in the U.S.

The FIFA official also cited local customs. “What FIFA is doing is adapting to the domestic market,” he said. “And it's a reality in the U.S. and Canada that events are being priced as per the demand that is coming in for that event.”

FIFA will also adapt its resale strategy to North America. When ticket sales begin, it will launch its own resale platform. In the past, it has capped prices on these secondary sales, to prevent fans and scalpers from reselling for profit. But in 2026, for ticket buyers in the U.S. and Canada, there will be no cap, according to World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi.

The reason, Schirgi explained, is that if there were a cap, “people would go to other resale platforms, and would try to find other ways of reselling the ticket, which obviously is something we don't want. We want to keep a safe and secure and regulated environment for fans to be able to resell their tickets.”

The exception is for Mexico, where resale laws are stricter. After extensive discussions with the Mexican government, FIFA agreed to create a separate, dedicated resale platform for Mexicans fans, who will only be allowed to post their tickets for resale at face value. It will function more like a ticket exchange than a resale market.

When asked what fees or cut of resales FIFA would take on its official platform, a spokesman said that would be finalized at a later date.

FIFA officials said that around 1 million tickets would likely be available in the first Visa presale phase — out of roughly 6 million in total for the tournament.

One official mentioned that 8.5 million people had officially “registered their interest” in tickets since FIFA began asking fans to do so.

The World Cup is slated to begin June 11 in Mexico City and conclude with the final July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

For event organizers like FIFA, dynamic pricing comes with dual benefits.

It allows them to raise prices if and when they sense they can make more money on tickets.

It also allows them to set high initial prices, knowing they can eventually lower those prices if sales are slow. (This is precisely what happened with the Club World Cup.)

The argument against dynamic pricing, of course, is that a lower fixed price would allow fans with less money to experience the World Cup.

The argument for dynamic pricing, essentially, is that a lower fixed price also incentivizes scalping. The scalpers then resell for profits, and the outcome for most consumers is the same — prices on the secondary market end up just as high as, if not higher than, the dynamic prices FIFA could charge. The only difference is that the money ends up in the hands of the scalpers — some of them Average Joes, some of them slimy profiteers — rather than FIFA.

Some would argue that's a good thing. FIFA would argue that the money should go into its coffers and then out into the world to fund football development.

And because FIFA controls the World Cup, FIFA's argument wins.

Gianluigi Donnarumma is entering a new phase of his career as the Italy goalkeeper prepares for 2026 World Cup qualifiers under new coach Gennaro Gattuso before taking his place at Manchester City.

The giant goalkeeper will move to England after Italy's Group I clashes with Estonia and Israel after he was abruptly frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain by coach Luis Henrique.

"I really felt at home during my four years in Paris, I'll never forget them," Donnarumma told journalists.

Donnarumma insists he holds no ill will about the way he was dumped down the pecking order at PSG in favour of French youngster Lucas Chevalier so soon after his performances helped win the capital club's first Champions League.

"I've always had an excellent relationship with the coach. I appreciated his directness with me, right from the first day of training," he said.

"I don't know what the reason was (for being replaced), I don't even want to know. I always try to do what my coach asks me to do, to help my team.

"You can always improve, but I've accomplished great things since I made my Serie A debut at 16 years old."

Just as he did when he moved to PSG, Donnarumma signed his City contract at Italy's Coverciano training camp during an international break.

"It brought me some luck," said Donnarumma, who was also key to Italy being crowned European champions in 2021, just before he signed for PSG.

"When a club like City wants you it means that you're doing a good job. Being wanted by one of the best coaches in the world like Pep Guardiola is a indescribable feeling."

- Italy struggles -

But before joining Guardiola in Manchester Donnarumma has a big task on his hands with Italy, who are at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup.

Donnarumma has maintained the captain's armband under Gattuso, who replaced Luciano Spalletti in June after a troubled start to Italy's qualifying campaign which included a 3-0 thumping at the hands of group leaders Norway.

The 26-year-old played under Gattuso, who won the World Cup as a player with Italy in 2006, at AC Milan when still a teenager.

"I know the man, I know what he can bring," said Donnarumma.

"He's started strongly. He'll give everything and we'll give everything to take Italy back to the top. But we have to take things step by step."

Donnarumma said that he wants to "take Italy back to where we belong" which is not small feat given where they find themselves after two qualifying matches.

Italy are nine points behind Norway, albeit having played two games fewer, and have a slim chance of taking the spot which offers the only direct place in next year's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

As well as the significant points gap Italy have a goal difference which is 12 worse than Norway, meaning that the play-offs, from which they failed to reach the last two tournaments, are the more realistic route for qualification.

How would you describe it when a soccer team is clicking? Do you refer to it as "camaraderie" or "a good locker room"? 

Perhaps it's, as you hear players and coaches call it, a "tight-knit group." Or maybe it's what the younger folk today may refer to as "vibes." 

Whatever the term, some think it isn't nearly as important as just assembling a team with the players possible. The cream, they argue, will inevitably rise to the top. For the most part, they aren't wrong. Only eight countries have ever won a men's FIFA World Cup. The last four winners of the UEFA Champions League — Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea — are among the wealthiest, most valuable brands in all of global sports. 

But when players bond and sacrifice for a common goal, they become greater than the sum of their parts. That's how Leicester City overcame 5000-1 odds to win the Premier League in 2016, or how Greece stunned host Portugal to win the 2004 European Championship. 

How crucial is that sense of togetherness? Take it from the most capped player in U.S. men's national team history.

"It's probably the most important thing," said three-time World Cup veteran and first-ballot National Soccer Hall of Famer Cobi Jones.

I caught up with Jones, who'll debut his Cobi Club podcast in 2026, to break down the notion and importance of vibes – especially ahead of next year's World Cup. 

U.S. great Cobi Jones, right, hopes that Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino can get back on the same wavelength ahead of the World Cup. 

USMNT supporters on both sides of the vibes debate have been going back and forth on the topic since the spring. In March, a full-strength American side featuring Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Antonee "Jedi" Robinson lost a competitive match to Panama for the second time in a year, snapping its four-year dominance of the Concacaf Nations League.

Four months later, with several of those first-choice players missing, a skeleton squad rounded out primarily by inexperienced MLSers exceeded expectations by reaching the Gold Cup final. That team lost, though, to blood rival Mexico in a match in which El Tri was clearly superior.

The vibes discussion has picked up again, when U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino called Pulisic back, but left out McKennie and several other mainstays to his 23-man roster for the upcoming matches against Korea Republic and Japan.

Jones knows why teams succeed, and why they fail. He was perhaps the best player on the 1998 U.S. team that finished dead last at that World Cup in part because of the poisonous environment that had taken root under then-coach Steve Sampson. The Americans, fielding many of the same players, reached the quarterfinals at the 2002 World Cup under Bruce Arena, who was renowned for his team-building skills. Fifteen years later, Arena was unable to fix the broken culture he inherited from Jürgen Klinsmann. The Americans finished behind Honduras and Panama in 2018 World Cup qualifying and missed the main event for the first time in 32 years. 

"You can have world-class talent and do terrible, because the vibe isn't there. People really have to understand: you're going into camp like a month before the World Cup even starts," Jones told me. "That means you're living together, day in and day out for an extended period. You've got to have a good vibe or there's going to be some issues."

The last of Jones' 164 international appearances came more than two decades ago now. It's a USMNT record — he has seven on Landon Donovan and 13 more than Michael Bradley that might never be broken. Now 55, the Detroit-born, Southern California-raised former winger spent 12 seasons with his hometown LA Galaxy after stints in the Premier League and in Brazil. He did a ton of winning along the way, including two MLS Cups, two U.S. Open Cups and a Concacaf title with the Galaxy, the 2002 Gold Cup with the U.S. and an NCAA crown after walking on at UCLA.

Cobi Jones was part of the 1994 World Cup squad that exceeded expectations and the 1998 team that largely faltered.  

Pochettino surely knows that he'll need all of his best players if the Americans are to make a historic run at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Successful teams need talent and vibes. Having one will never be enough.

"We always say this team is the most talented U.S. team. And I think they are," Jones said. "You look at where these young men are playing, at the opportunities they had when they were kids to be trained at the highest levels. The ability is there. It's about, can they come together as a unit?"

Jones — for whom the Galaxy will unveil a statue next spring at their stadium in Carson, Caifornia — will have a front-row seat. Two of the USMNT's three World Cup group stage contests are at SoFi Stadium at nearby Inglewood. For U.S. backers worried about how the national team will fare next June and July, Jones has another message.

"To do something special, timing is everything. A lot of things that have to gel," he added. "I always look at the 1998 World Cup, which France won. They didn't score a goal four years later. Were they not good? Of course they were. Their players were still amazing. That proves that a lot of things have to come together to have a good performance as a team.

"I think these guys, they'll find a way."

U.S. men's national team boss Mauricio Pochettino revealed he once had the opportunity to manage Real Madrid, but Spurs ex-chairman Daniel Levy blocked the potential move.

Pochettino is back in the spotlight as the USMNT gears up for two international friendlies during the September international break. The pressure is on the 53-year-old to get the Stars and Stripes as prepared as possible for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a different challenge to those he faced as a manager at various clubs across Europe. 

While he led the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, Pochettino never managed a top club in Spain before he made the switch to international football. Real Madrid were apparently eyeing the Argentine, though, as Zinedine Zidane's successor back in 2018, but Levy prevented the move.

“Zidane leaves Madrid and naturally the possibility arises,” Pochettino said on El Chiringuito TV. “I had given my word to Levy that I would stay [at Tottenham] until the [new] stadium was finished. 

“At that moment, I said I would go to Madrid if Levy gave the green light. I don't know what happened afterwards, but surely he didn't give the OK,” Pochettino revealed.

After Zidane led Los Blancos to a historic Champions League threepeat, the Frenchman left the club along with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of the 2018–2019 season. At the time, Pochettino was still under contract with Tottenham and in no position to facilitate a grand move to the Spanish capital without Levy's support.

“I don't know how Florentino Pérez took it, but it wasn't my fault. I wasn't a free agent. Football is like that, sometimes opportunities slip away,” Pochettino said. 

Real Madrid ultimately appointed Julen Lopetegui, who only lasted three months into their 2018–2019 campaign. Santiago Solari then took over until March before Zidane came back. All the while, Pochettino remained in north London. 

Fast forward six years and now the former Spurs boss is hoping to elevate the USMNT. Pochettino's early tenure in charge of the Stars and Stripes has not gone to plan; the team failed to defend their Concacaf Nations League title and then finished as the runners-up in the Gold Cup.

With most of his superstars, including Christian Pulisic, back available to play in September, Pochettino will be eager to turn the page on a tumultuous summer.

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams returns to Harrison, N.J. for the first time he left the New York Red Bulls in 2019, and he had something to say about the venue at which he forged a reputation.

The USA will host the Korea Republic at Sports Illustrated Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 6 at 5 p.m.

Listen to what he had to say about the venue and his comedic exchange with USMNT teammate and friend Tim Weah.

“A lot of people coming into the game this weekend,” said Adams, who hails from Wappingers Falls, N.Y. “It's always nice to play at the old stomping grounds. I'm always going to call it Red Bull Arena. So never, never Sports Illustrated, whatever it is. But yeah, it's gonna be fun to play there, because it's the first time since I left.”

Then Weah, who grew up in Queens, N.Y. and played for B.W. Gottschee in the Cosmopolitan Junior Soccer League when it competed in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, weighed in on the Red Bulls and started that exchange.

Weah: “A lot of people don't know Tyler is the one that brought me to the Red Bulls.”

Adams: “I'm a scout. Yeah, Tyler.”

Weah: “Tyler, well, I was playing at Gottschee at the time.”

Adams: “And smacked them.”

Weah: “No, no, no, no.”

Adams: “Come to the good team.”

Weah: “We used to kill Red Bulls. And Tyler one day, I don't even remember, after a game. I think it was at Aviator [Field in Brooklyn], and Tyler was just like, come over to Red Bulls. And Red Bulls, at that time, [were] building a really good team … Omir Fernandez. Kyle [Duncan], my cousin who currently plays there now. So yeah, the rebel days were fun. So, it's a squad I've always dreamed of playing in Red Bull Arena. So it's finally, it's finally happening, so I'm happy.”

In 2013, Weah joined the Red Bulls Academy.

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams returns to Harrison, N.J. for the first time he left the New York Red Bulls in 2019, and he had something to say about the venue at which he forged a reputation.

The USA will host the Korea Republic at Sports Illustrated Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 6 at 5 p.m.

Listen to what he had to say about the venue and his comedic exchange with USMNT teammate and friend Tim Weah.

“A lot of people coming into the game this weekend,” said Adams, who hails from Wappingers Falls, N.Y. “It's always nice to play at the old stomping grounds. I'm always going to call it Red Bull Arena. So never, never Sports Illustrated, whatever it is. But yeah, it's gonna be fun to play there, because it's the first time since I left.”

Then Weah, who grew up in Queens, N.Y. and played for B.W. Gottschee in the Cosmopolitan Junior Soccer League when it competed in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, weighed in on the Red Bulls and started that exchange.

Weah: “A lot of people don't know Tyler is the one that brought me to the Red Bulls.”

Adams: “I'm a scout. Yeah, Tyler.”

Weah: “Tyler, well, I was playing at Gottschee at the time.”

Adams: “And smacked them.”

Weah: “No, no, no, no.”

Adams: “Come to the good team.”

Weah: “We used to kill Red Bulls. And Tyler one day, I don't even remember, after a game. I think it was at Aviator [Field in Brooklyn], and Tyler was just like, come over to Red Bulls. And Red Bulls, at that time, [were] building a really good team … Omir Fernandez. Kyle [Duncan], my cousin who currently plays there now. So yeah, the rebel days were fun. So, it's a squad I've always dreamed of playing in Red Bull Arena. So it's finally, it's finally happening, so I'm happy.”

In 2013, Weah joined the Red Bulls Academy.

Argentina have already booked their place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup and currently leads the way in CONMEBOL qualifying.

Lionel Scaloni's side will finish top of the pile, and it remains to be seen what kind of team the reigning holders will field against Venezuela in their first of two qualifying matches in September.

Venezuela still have an outside chance of booking their place in next year's tournament, and they could climb into the top six places should they win both of their upcoming games. Toppling Argentina may be tough, given their last win over La Albiceleste was back in March 2019.

For Argentina, the job is done and the 2022 World Cup winners can almost coast through these final two games in September, safe in the knowledge their place at the 2026 edition is already confirmed.

Their 31-man squad for the matches includes young talents like Real Madrid's starboy Franco Mastantuono and Manchester City's Claudio Echeverri, as well as Bournemouth defender Julio Soler.

Chelsea forward Alejandro Garnacho misses out, given he has not played any football this season, following his recent move from Manchester United to Stamford Bridge.

FEATURE: Who are the biggest clubs in South America

Venezuela have a tough job on their hands and require two vital wins to help them in their quest for qualification. With table-toppers Argentina to come first, the task at hand looks difficult.

Top scorer Salomon Rondon has five goals to his name in qualifying and the Real Oviedo man will be hoping to play a huge part in this contest. Austin FC midfielder Dani Pereira is also one to watch given his strong showings in the MLS so far this season.

Argentina 2-0 Venezuela

Mauricio Pochettino's surprising United States men's national team roster gets to test itself agains two terrific Asian foes starting with South Korea on Saturday in Harrison, New Jersey.

Pochettino opted against calling in a number of big-name players, as Weston McKennie again misses out and is joining in exclusion by recently-transferred USMNT stars Giovanni Reyna, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso. Just-healthy Antonee Robinson and Ricardo Pepi are also given breaks, and that gives big chances to some lesser-known names against these strong visitors.

MORE — How will USMNT line up versus South Korea?

South Korea have lost just once in the last 19 months, and it was last time out against Japan — a solid team and the Yanks' next opponent. The Taegeuk Warriors boast an 11W-5D-1L record in that period, and national team legend Myung-bo Hong is at the wheel.

Led by Heung-min Son, South Korea (or Korea Republic) are ranked 23rd by FIFA and 34th by Elo Ratings. The Americans are 15th and 44th by the same metrics, and this match as well as the next versus Japan (17th and t-13th) are their first chances to show out against top non-CONCACAF opponents since dispiriting friendly losses to Turkiye and Switzerland in June.

And that matters. Players like Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman were very good at the Gold Cup, much better than their displays against Turkiye and Switzerland. Pochettino knows this group can do great in CONCACAF, but the World Cup's raised stakes will be closer to the level of South Korea (and Japan) more often than not.



Kickoff: 5pm ET Saturday (Pregame coverage at 4:30pm)Stadium: Sports Illustrated Stadium — Harrison, New JerseyTV Channel: Telemundo, UniversoStreaming: Peacock (en Espanol)



The names on Pochettino's 24-man roster are anything but predictable, but there's a big-time in-form player in Josh Sargent and a number of North America-based players with huge opportunities to impress the boss.

How much will we see of Nathan Harriel, Tristan Blackmon, Sean Zawadzki, and Alex Zendejas? And is there any chance we see Roman Celentano or Jonathan Klinsmann, or is this Matt Freese's 18-yard box for the duration of the international break?

The team's strength is showcased by the stiff test they'll present despite players excluded from the squad, Wolves' Hee-chan Hwang, and Feyenoord's In-beom Hwang perhaps chief among them.

LAFC's Heung-min Son and PSG's Kang-in Lee will get a lot of the focus, but the Taegeuk Warriors are deep and dangerous. Bayern Munich center back Min-jae Kim is a handful for attackers and Mainz midfielder Jae-sung Lee is one to watch.

South Korea are more familiar and complete at this point, but home soil and the fitness of Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun, and Timothy Weah should be enough to produce a number of chances for the USMNT. Can they convert enough? USMNT 1-1 South Korea.

...

Mauricio Pochettino has precious few chances to ready his United States men's national team for next summer's World Cup and Saturday's meeting with South Korea in New Jersey sees some big opportunities for the player pool.

The 24-man roster has more than a few surprises, as Pochettino has called upon a number of lesser-known domestic players over more familiar names like Weston McKennie, Giovanni Reyna, and Haji Wright.

Several others were left off after summer transfers, as Yunus Musah, Malik Tillman, and Johnny Cardoso remain with their clubs while Ricardo Pepi and Antonee Robinson are still rebuilding his fitness and form after a long-term injury and Patrick Agyemang is current out of action.

Got all that? Phew.

So how will Pochettino use his players against South Korea and Japan as two very difficult visitors this week on American soil?

This one's straight-forward, as Matt Freese seems likely to get every chance to improve his standing atop the goalkeeper list following a terrific summer. FC Cincinnati backstop Roman Celentano and Serie B goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena) are also in camp.

The simple solution here is to play Tim Ream and Chris Richards at center back, though 18-year-old Augsburg back Noahkai Banks would love a look (and USMNT fans would love to see him).

Sergino Dest is back and we know he can play left back in addition to right back, so it's not as simple as assuming it'll be Max Arfsten on the left and Dest on the right. Alex Freeman also drew solid reviews this summer.

Tyler Adams should be nailed-on at the No. 6 spot, but will Pochettino opt for Sebastian Berhalter or Luca de la Torre next to him. Cristian Roldan is a late addition to the roster, while Sean Zawadzki is also an option.

Christian Pulisic will be on one wing and Diego Luna seems likely to get a run on either the other wing or in the middle of the three players underneath the center forward. Probably the former.

Timothy Weah will get the other wing, while Alex Zendejas, Jack McGlynn, and others wait for their turn.

There are three center forwards in camp, only one of whom was with Pochettino in recent windows. Oddly enough, Damion Downs is the least likely to start in our opinion. Josh Sargent is in great form for Norwich City but finally-healthy Folarin Balogun was a high-profile recruit aimed at the 2026 World Cup.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino shares an update on Christian Pulisic's return to the squad ahead of upcoming friendlies. (1:04)

Mauricio Pochettino and Christian Pulisic are back together, with head coach and player taking part in the U.S. men's national team training camp ahead of this month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan.

Just how "together" they are will be revealed over the next week and beyond, but make no mistake: they need to be on the same page if the U.S. is to reach its stated aim of making a deep run at next summer's World Cup.

This isn't to say that the two have had a falling out, nor do they need to be best friends and have regular dinners together. But there has been a disconnect.

- USMNT players on risks, rewards of World Cup year transfers
- USMNT roster omissions might hamper World Cup preparations

Pulisic waved off an attempt by Pochettino to sub him out of the third-place game at the Concacaf Nations League last March. He missed out on the recent Gold Cup two months later, and while USSF sporting director Matt Crocker said at the time, "We made the collective decision that this is the right moment for [Pulisic] to get the rest he needs," the public backlash was intense, with former USMNT players, among them Landon Donovan, questioning the player's commitment.

Pulisic's response, in part, was to state in an interview with CBS Sports that he had offered to play in two pre-Gold Cup friendlies, but that Pochettino had turned him down. Pulisic later said in the interview that he didn't understand the decision even as the manager explained he wanted just one roster for the entire Gold Cup program.

While Pulisic's impulse to defend himself is understandable, divulging some of the deliberations about his Gold Cup participation was a mistake and only served to annoy Pochettino. The U.S. manager responded, stating that he is "not a mannequin" and that he alone would decide who plays for the USMNT and when.

When the roster for the upcoming friendlies was announced last week, Pochettino said he hadn't spoken with Pulisic since the Gold Cup, adding, "I think everything is behind us, all that happened in summer, and I think now we need to look forward."

Left unsaid is how effective that approach will be if there hasn't been any communication.

To be clear, success at the World Cup doesn't rest solely on Pulisic, as numerous moving parts need to align for a deep run to occur. The U.S. needs to sort out its goalkeeping situation. Right back Sergiño Dest has to be healthy, the better to augment the attack with his ability to deliver the unexpected. The same is true for Antonee Robinson on the opposite flank. Holding midfielder Tyler Adams needs to be at his ball-hawking best. One of the available strikers -- be it Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent, Haji Wright, etc. -- needs to hit top form ahead of the tournament.

But Pulisic's combination of talent, creativity and experience remains a critical piece of the attack. When Pulisic plays well and is in full flow, the team usually follows suit. Scoring goals is the most difficult part of the game, and Pulisic remains a vital contributor to that aspect of the cause. Pochettino and Pulisic need each other for the team to succeed.

Part of what's at issue between Pulisic and Pochettino is that the U.S. manager is in the middle of attempting a cultural reset. That goes for everyone, from the biggest stars down to uncapped players who get called in. Pochettino is demanding total commitment, at least as he defines it. As fatigued as Pulisic was after playing over 50 games a season at AC Milan the last two years, his decision to sit out the Gold Cup, while offering to play in the two friendlies before the tournament, sent Pochettino a different kind of message.

"If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" Pochettino said last May. "No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the most important day."

The adjustment from the players -- including Pulisic -- to Pochettino's approach has taken some time. Defender Tim Ream admitted after the Gold Cup that it had taken too long. At Tuesday's media availability, Ream said that with players just arriving, there hadn't been a team-wide meeting yet to discuss expectations, though coaches had been pulling players in for individual meetings.

"We'll sit down I'm sure [Tuesday] and have a discussion," he said.

"But for us, it is just the guys who were here during the Gold Cup ... We kind of know what the standard needs to be and what it is going forward and just making sure that everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, helping each other, and making sure that we all know that we're on the same page, we're on the same team."

Pochettino was a top-flight manager for 15 years -- with stops at Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea -- before taking up with the USMNT. If there is to be movement in any direction, that will fall on Pulisic, because Pochettino won't be changing his ways. The U.S. manager has made it clear that no one's spot is secure. Weston McKennie was left off the current roster, and while Pochettino blamed his absence on a lack of rest due to participation in the Club World Cup, Tim Weah had a similar workload, yet was included in this camp.

Relationships between players and coaches can be fluid, going through difficulties. Pulisic's rapport with former U.S. manager Gregg Berhalter experienced some rough patches before the two found alignment ahead of the 2022 World Cup, in which Pulisic played a critical role in the U.S. reaching the round of 16.

That could very well be the case with Pochettino and Pulisic. However, Pulisic and the rest of the team will need to adapt to Pochettino's ways.

At one point not long ago, the world governing body at least tried to look like it cared about growing the game worldwide. Not any more

If there's the tiniest sliver of an upside to the latest news about ticketing for the 2026 World Cup, it's that we can finally dispense with the pretense that Fifa is interested in growing the game any more.

Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time, use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. While tickets will initially range from $60 for the cheap seats in some group-stage matches to $6,730 for the best vantage point at the final, those prices will then be algorithmically handed over to the market to respond to demand, which will probably cause them to skyrocket. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply.

Effectively, Fifa has absorbed the secondary market of ticket sales – the bit of the ticket hustle that arbitrages the market – in the name of protecting the fans, while subjecting fans to the exact same extortion. But rather than being a lone tout loitering outside a stadium, hoping to scalp a few tickets for a profit, it's Fifa itself making the deals.

Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world's most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you're-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa.

The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport's expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. It went to South Africa in 2010 and Brazil in 2014 not because they were the most moneyed markets, but to spread the sport around the globe. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup.

This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. And Fifa will help itself to as much of it as it can.

“It's key to highlight Fifa's mission and Fifa's objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it's always a balance between different factors.”

It claims to do so out of a kind of fiduciary duty to its member federations, but to further constrain attendance at the sport's signature event to the lucky few who can afford it gives the lie to serving the best interests of the sport writ large.

Fifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky – a YouGov poll shows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it's worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events.

After widespread anger erupted at the dynamic pricing that more than doubled the cost of some Oasis reunion tour tickets in the United Kingdom, the band ditched the model for its US dates. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. “She didn't want to do that to her fans,” an AEG executive explained in an interview. Even Wendy's faced ferocious backlash when it announced that it would introduce dynamic pricing in its fast-food restaurants, before it backed down.

The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it's also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-final tumbled from almost $500 to just $13 in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue.

Fifa is doing nothing illegal. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn't violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislators have taken an interest and Australia has moved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure.

It is also legal to use the data you have on your customers – a browsing history suggesting, for instance, a desperation to snag tickets to a particular game – to set prices, which is known as “surveillance pricing”. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquiry was swiftly abandoned by the Trump administration.

Fifa, then, isn't breaking any rules. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.

Lionel Messi is expected to play in what could be his last match in his home country with the Argentine national team on Thursday, Sept. 4.

Argentina will host Venezuela in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match, which is the defending World Cup champions' last scheduled home match in the foreseeable future.

Messi, 38, acknowledged the significance of the occasion in a recent postgame interview with Inter Miami last week.

“It's going to be a very special game for me because it's the last one in the qualifying round I don't know if there will be friendlies or more games after that,” Messi said during a postgame interview with Apple TV after Inter Miami's win against Orlando City in the Leagues Cup semifinals on Aug. 27.

“It's a very special game, which is why my family will be there with me – my wife, my children, my parents, my siblings, and everyone else that can, including my wife's whole family. And that's how we're going to experience it.”

“After that, as I said, I don't know what will happen, but that's our intention,” Messi added.

Argentina has already qualified for the 2026 World Cup to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, but Messi has yet to officially declare he will play in the tournament for the sixth time in his career.

Messi is under contract with Inter Miami through the end of the 2025 MLS season, with reported ongoing negotiations to sign an extension with the club.

Argentine national team coach Lionel Scaloni acknowledged the occasion during a press conference Wednesday, while adding the club would look to plan another match for Messi in Argentina when the time is right.

"[Thursday] will be a beautiful, exciting game. Surely, it won't be his last game in Argentina, and I saw that from the point of view that, if he decides it will be his last, we'll make sure he gets to play another one," Scaloni said regarding Messi. "We'll find the right moment, because he deserves it."

The match begins at 7:30 p.m. ET (8:30 p.m. in Argentina) at Mâs Monumental in Buenos Aires.

The match will be broadcast on Universo and can be streamed on Fubo.

For the reasons listed above, it appears very likely Messi will play with Argentina against Venezuela.

Argentina will visit Ecuador on Sept. 9 to conclude Conmebol World Cup qualifying, but it's possible Messi will return to South Florida as Inter Miami prepares for the last stretch of the 2025 MLS season.

Messi could potentially participate in four more Argentina friendly matches later this year.

Argentina is planning to play two friendly matches in the United States between October 6-14 with locations and opponents to be determined. These friendlies would coincide with Inter Miami's MLS season, potentially creating a scheduling conflict for Messi.

Argentina will also play two friendly matches between Nov. 10-18 in in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India with opponents to be determined. These friendlies would fall under a FIFA international window.

The Futbol W crew discuss how important this season could be for Naomi Girma at Chelsea. (2:20)

LONDON -- Plenty runs through the minds of players when they uproot their lives and move thousands of miles away; a new country brings new teammates, a new culture and countless small adjustments. Yet for Chelsea defender Naomi Girma, one challenge when she landed in London from NWSL side San Diego Wave in a world-record $1.1 million transfer in January wasn't about football at all; it was about using roundabouts.

A staple of British roads but a rarity across the United States, the circular junctions became an unexpected hurdle when the 24-year-old USWNT international was learning to get around her new country, and she enlisted the help of teammate Catarina Macario.

"She taught me how to drive through roundabouts, when to exit," she told ESPN, breaking into a fit of giggles as she sat next to her compatriot while recalling the whirlwind of her first six months in England. "Cat's been so helpful. And yeah, I think now I've come back I feel really settled, found my footing and have a place, have a car, know where I'm going. That's been really nice to come back and feel like I'm settled."

The memory sparked a wave of laughter between the pair. "I definitely told her just to follow the flow of traffic. [It's] not that hard to follow the flow, which is true," Macario said. "See where the cars are going, let's follow them ... I guess you weren't prepared for the roundabouts, my bad."

Having been in London since signing for Chelsea from Lyon in 2023, Macario offered Girma lots of advice when she first touched down, but it wasn't the usual clichés of "don't forget your boots" or recommendations to try a Greggs steak bake; this was far more practical. "I just hit her with a Uniqlo [clothing store] link-up; this is what need from Uniqlo to survive the winter," Macario explained with a grin. "That was very important."

Those early weeks of mastering British traffic -- the roundabouts, narrow country lanes and confusing motorway exits -- became their own crash course in adaptation. But of course, no matter how settled London life might feel now, there are some creature comforts that England simply can't deliver.

"A really good, iced-vanilla latte," Girma and Macario blurted out in perfect unison, when asked what they missed most about America, before bursting into laughter again. The speed of the reply made it clear this wasn't a new complaint, more of a running theme.

Girma admitted she has aired her frustrations plenty of times that the iced coffees back in California are leagues ahead of the questionable versions she has been handed in England. And then there's the hot sauce situation. Unwilling to compromise, Girma enlisted her brother as a personal supplier, bringing over bottles of her favorite brand from America. One such bottle now lives in the Chelsea canteen, shared generously with teammates; the other is kept at home, very much off-limits to anyone but her.

With no international tournament on the schedule this summer, the USWNT's stars were able to enjoy a rare stretch of extended downtime, with manager Emma Hayes granting many of her European-based players additional leave between training camps. And, although friendly games filled the calendar for some, Girma and Macario were among those given the chance to properly recharge.

For Macario, the break was a chance to reconnect with home. After trips to Spain and France -- where she celebrated the wedding of teammate Ellie Carpenter to former Lyon teammate Daniëlle van de Donk, now of London City -- she returned to San Diego to spend time with family and friends.

Girma followed a similar path, crisscrossing the country before a few stops abroad. She began in San Jose, California, her hometown, before heading to New York to see family, then returning west to Los Angeles and San Diego. The 24-year-old even carved out time for a getaway in Cabo, Mexico, a welcome slice of sunshine before the grind of preseason resumed.

"We had two camps, so I guess we weren't fully off," she said. "But it was nice to just get to travel, see family, see friends, create your own schedule, train when you want, and I think it's just made me more excited to be back."

Emily Keogh believes Emily Fox is "getting better" as Arsenal prepare for the new WSL season vs. London City Lionesses.

USWNT and Arsenal defender Emily Fox, meanwhile, embraced her downtime in a slightly different way. A self-proclaimed bookworm, she admitted to going "rogue" this summer, swapping her usual diet of sprawling sci-fi and fantasy sagas for standalones and historical fiction.

"I think there's been a lot of talk over the last few years of player welfare, being able to have a little bit of off-time amid the crazy seasons," she told ESPN at Arsenal's training center. "Being able to represent club and country, you do kind of find yourself just playing all year round, which is great, but I definitely think player welfare, mental well-being, and then physical recovery is so important.

"It was great to be able to have that this year and get that break, even just be home, be with your family, go on a vacation, little things like that. So it was really great to be able to recharge. Then we've had a very gradual, pretty long preseason, so that's also been nice and rare. I feel like I've been trying to kind of soak it up and use it to my advantage."

Fox's summer family time came early, as her parents made the journey from America to Lisbon to cheer her on in the UEFA Women's Champions League final against Barcelona -- which turned out to be a successful trip as Arsenal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.

The Virginia native, who started playing soccer when she was 5 before becoming the first pick in the 2021 NWSL draft after starring for the University of North Carolina, felt it could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her parents to experience the atmosphere of the biggest game in club soccer.

"Coming from the U.S. and growing up, soccer wasn't everything for my family, in the sense that my parents didn't play," she said. "So I think now I feel like they've really invested and just love watching games.

"[It was] such an amazing experience [for them], both obviously coming to watch us and then just exploring a new city and getting to be with the families, getting to celebrate with us afterwards. The stadium was amazing. A lot of it was Barcelona fans and had that away-crowd feeling. But [it was incredible to have my family] able to come on the pitch with us after."

Although the comforts of familiar surroundings were grounding for the USWNT trio over the summer, they ultimately reignited a hunger for the season ahead.

The Futbol W crew discuss how Catarina Macario's form last season will play a huge part in nailing down a starting place in Chelsea's midfield.

Preseason training camps are one of the few chances players get to enjoy the lighter moments with teammates before the chaos of competition begins, and everyone makes the most of them in their own way. But neither Girma nor Macario was prepared for what manager Sonia Bompastor had in store for them when they returned.

Forget the well-worn classics of trust falls, beach volleyball or a trip to "Go Ape." The French coach instead took the team to the Dutch countryside for something truly unique: sheepherding. The task? Work together to maneuver a herd of sheep across a field, a scene that prompted as many raised eyebrows as it did bursts of laughter.

"Sonia did say that it was going to be something that no one had ever done before," Macario recalled, still incredulous. "I think someone gave her a mix of options in terms of team-bonding exercises, and sure enough she was like: 'Yeah, herd some sheep.'"

Clips from the outing quickly made their way online, revealing a string of hilarious moments: players darting after runaway sheep, huddling in tight circles to draw up game plans, and even pausing for exaggerated deep-breathing exercises as if preparing for a final.

Girma couldn't keep a straight face -- when asked if she was doing all right, she burst into laughter before shouting "slowly!" in a desperate attempt to keep her composure while guiding the flock. Chelsea captain Millie Bright leaned into the chaos with a memorable mantra: "Think like a sheep, act like a sheep." Erin Cuthbert, ever the realist, summed up the spectacle perfectly: "The plan ... there is no plan."

As bizarre as it sounds, the session worked, and what began as a slightly surreal outing turned into the kind of memory that can weld a squad together amid laughter, confusion and wool. Chelsea's U.S. contingent can certainly add another string to their bow in terms of adaptation to the British way of life, but it remains to be seen how it will help them on their path toward a seventh successive WSL title.

In a rematch of last year's US Open final, Aryna Sabalenka -- who advanced via walkover on Tuesday -- takes on Jessica Pegula in the semifinals. Which star player has the edge? We break it down.

NEW YORK -- Just a few hours before she was to meet World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a US Open quarterfinal match, Marketa Vondrousova withdrew with a knee injury.

That sent Sabalenka into a Thursday semifinal against No. 4-seeded Jessica Pegula, who earlier defeated Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-3.

It's a rematch of last year's US Open final, won by Sabalenka in straight sets. We make the case for each player left in the draw's top half.

Head-to-head: 7-2, Sabalenka, including the last three in a row -- all on North American hard courts.

In the dizzying daily flood of numbers-crunching statistics, this one stands out:

Sabalenka is only the fifth woman in 35 years to reach all four Grand Slam semifinals in a single year. The others are named Graf, Seles, Hingis and Serena, a Who's Who of tennis greatness.

The catch is that Sabalenka has yet to win one in 2025 -- thanks to three Americans -- a development that suggests she wants to defend her title here very, very badly.

It was Madison Keys who beat her in the Australian Open final, Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros championship match and Amanda Anisimova in a stunning upset in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Going in, with the exception of Roland Garros, Sabalenka went in as the favorite.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

She'll be the favorite here, based on that decisive head-to-head advantage.

After she got word that Vondrousova was granting her the walkover, Sabalenka immediately headed for the practice court. She'll be exceedingly fresh for Thursday's match with an extra day off, and after winning her first four matches in straight sets.

You can be sure that Sabalenka, who was stung by those missed opportunities in Melbourne, Paris and London, will throw everything into this one.

Last year was a watershed year for Pegula: She turned 30, shook up her coaching staff and advanced to her first major final.

And now Pegula has the opportunity to beat the very player that denied her the title. On a court that's become her favorite in all the world. Pegula, an American in the only American Grand Slam, is now 15-4 in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Thursday's crowd will be almost completely behind her.

“It would be cool to be able to get revenge, obviously,” Pegula told reporters. “It's going to be a tough challenge. But at the end of a Slam, you expect that to happen, and you expect people to be playing their best tennis and to be playing the best players, because those are the players that are playing the best.”

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

After a disappointing summer, Pegula has caught fire at just the right time. And while none of her five victories have come against seeded players, she's been exceedingly sharp. She converted five of nine break-point opportunities against Krejcikova and was broken only twice herself.

Pegula knows just how close she was, losing that US Open final 7-5, 7-5.

"I was like, 'Wow, I was right there,'" Pegula marveled. "This year I've come back with a different perspective, knowing that I wasn't playing well, to really enjoy the fact that this is pretty cool.

"I would probably have that mentality, instead of maybe being so focused on what I have to do so strongly ... and enjoying the crowd a little bit more, and enjoying the fact that I'm in this position again to possibly be in another final and I'm playing the best player in the world."

When JJ Tracy was going through the process of figuring out which university he would attend, the product of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Hilton Head, South Carolina visited Ohio State University. His host on the trip was Robert Cash, whom he had crossed paths with in the juniors but never played against or with.

“Usually because I wouldn't make it that far in the tournaments,” Tracy said.

“No, he's not giving himself credit,” Cash, from New Albany, Ohio, quickly added.

Both Americans laughed. Today, they are close friends and doubles partners on the ATP Tour who are into the semi-finals of the US Open, trying to become the only All-American men's doubles team to claim the title this century besides twins Bob and Mike Bryan.

But the former Buckeyes' bond truly began to form on that visit before they were teammates.

“I just realised how down to earth JJ was. It's kind of rare in tennis,” Cash said. “I felt like we had a connection off the rip. We were very similar in a lot of ways. He was very cool, very funny, meshed with the team extremely well on his visit and then when he started school, he worked harder than everybody else and that's what I really admired about him. 

“He tried so hard on the court and was an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable friend. I just think that we get along so well off court and on court, and it helps us both ways.”

Cash's longtime dream has been to go to medical school and eventually become a surgeon and his partner, Tracy, studied finance at Ohio State. 

“Never really got to get a big head about any special finance major because we had a couple doctors on the team,” Tracy joked. 

The pair's professional journey nearly was over before it began. In the 2024 NCAA Doubles Championship, Cash and Tracy faced two match points in the semi-finals. Had they let slip one of those points, Cash would have fully focused on medical school applications and Cash would have put his energy into singles.

Instead, they won the tournament and earned a US Open wild card. They also were awarded a wild card into the Hall of Fame Open, reaching their first ATP Tour final there. The Americans made enough progress on the ATP Challenger Tour at the end of the season that they decided to forge forward together and Cash put his dream of becoming a surgeon on pause.

This year they won their first tour-level title in Los Cabos and with their semi-final run in New York are 11th in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

“It's unbelievable. I was playing singles back then, but never in a million years would I go play a 15K or a Challenger in singles and trade it for this. I mean, this is unbelievable,” Tracy said. “It's been super special to see us climb the ranks, from winning our first Challenger tournament to stringing a few of them together, making our first ATP appearance and Los Cabos, getting our first title. 

“We were getting interviewed some in Los Cabos and I kept saying that our goal is to win one of every level of tournament. We've knocked out everything except 500, 1,000 and this, so this would be a good one to knock off.”



A clear reason behind the Americans' success is how well they get along and work together. They don't just merge together well in terms of their games, but also their personalities.

“He's just really easy to be around. He's always got a good attitude, great energy,” Cash said. “People feed off of him, and nothing really brings him down, so he's always got a smile on his face, bringing people, putting smiles on people's faces around him, and such an easy guy to be around.” 

Tracy said: “[He is a] very good leader off the court, on the court. There's been times in my life I was down, there are times I'm down, he's always knocking on my door saying, ‘What's the deal, dude? What's good?' He's always trying to pick me back up. He led all through college as a teammate, as a friend.” 

When Cash and Tracy advanced to the last four on Wednesday evening, countryman Ben Shelton posted his congratulations on Instagram Stories: “Hype for these boys”. They were all in college at the same time.

“I thought it was very nice of him, the college crew kind of sticks together. That guy absolutely is crushing it. He hit the ground running. He's a super, super nice guy off court. Very humble, very grounded, and he's been nothing but supportive and nice to JJ and I off the court,” Cash said. “He didn't have to do that. He's Top 10 in the world in singles. He doesn't have to give us the time of day, but he's such a nice guy off the court, and we're really appreciative of that.” 

The former college standouts know their job is not yet done. Cash and Tracy return to the court Thursday to face this year's Roland Garros champions Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos for a place in the final.

“Our coach has been on us all the time about it off the court. He tells us to stay in the dirt. Stay in the dirt, just don't go too far in the clouds, look too far in advance,” Cash said. “We've got to take it one step at a time. There's still matches to be played, matches to be won. The job's not finished, so we need to be happy, celebrate the win tonight. But we've got to focus and put all our energy and effort towards the match tomorrow.”

Amanda Anisimova, into the US Open semifinals, called her win over six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek the most meaningful of her life. Anisimova won 6-4, 6-3 on Wednesday night, and she'll play Naomi Osaka for a spot in the final.

NEW YORK -- Amanda Anisimova has won 199 matches over the course of her nine-year career on the Hologic WTA Tour, and she can safely say that this one rises above the rest.

"Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I've had in my life," the 24-year-old said on Wednesday night.

She was, of course, referring to her 6-4, 6-3 upset of World No. 2 Iga Swiatek in a packed and raucous Arthur Ashe Stadium to reach her first-ever US Open semifinal.

The win was meaningful for so many reasons, not the least of which was getting revenge -- and peace of mind -- after Swiatek drubbed her 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon final earlier this summer.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

But it was extra special on this court, at this tournament, in front of these fans.

Ahead of this match, the world No. 9 focused on staying mindful and playing without fear She also worked to stay positive, something she felt was missing in the championship match at Wimbledon.

"I think that was the most important part of today, is really lifting myself up and trying to pump myself up with positive affirmations," the New Jersey native said after the match. "I think that was something I was really lacking in the Wimbledon final. I wasn't really showing much, or my attitude and my presence wasn't really there. So I think that's also something that I learned that I need to do better of.

"...I feel like I was really supporting myself, which in turn also helped me play better."

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

The night before the match, Anisimova actually watched the Wimbledon final to get a better sense of what went wrong in that first meeting. She then followed that up with some highlights of successes (again, positive affirmations). In rewatching it, she noticed that "I was slow as hell." She certainly wasn't slow as hell on this day, and dictated play with her power -- 23 winners to Swiatek's 13 -- and strong return game (four of nine break points converted). 

She admitted she felt some stress out of the gate, after getting broken in the first game -- "OK, here we go" --  but promptly broke back and felt the stress melt away as she got into a groove. 

And as the match continued, she kept her foot on the gas, never letting up and never giving the six-time Grand Slam champion an inch.

"I think when I started the tournament, I was kind of going into the matches with a little bit of fear and maybe holding back a bit," she said. "As I've been progressing and playing more and more, I told myself you can't go into the match with any fear, especially if I'm playing against top players.

"It's just not a negotiable for me, because if I want to win the match, I'm going to have to play really brave and strong tennis. Today I really came out there with not an ounce of fear."

Anisimova will play Naomi Osaka, who defeated Karolina Muchova on Wednesday evening, on Thursday for a spot in the final. The American has won each of her two meetings against Osaka, though they haven't played since the 2022 French Open.

Will the fourth time be a charm?There are a couple of reasons for Djokovic and his fans to believe this one will be different.First and most important, he appears to be healthy. He has called the trainer out on a couple of occasions at this Open, but the problems proved to be passing. He did just survive a tough four-setter against Taylor Fritz that didn't end until late Tuesday night, and at times during that match he did look weary. But he wasn't pushed to the brink. A recovery in two days seems plausible.“I definitely am not going with a white flag on the court,” Djokovic says. “The next couple of days is really key for me to really get my body in shape and ready to battle five sets if it's needed.”The second positive is that instead of Sinner, he'll face Carlos Alcaraz. That might sound like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but it's a fire that Djokovic has endured recently. He has a 5-3 record against Alcaraz, and he's 3-0 on hard courts. He also won their only meeting of 2025, in four sets, in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

Djokovic has been at his savviest against Alcaraz, surprising the Spaniard with his early aggressiveness, and holding up better in the clutch. He has had more success imposing his game on him than he has on Sinner.“Would love to be fit enough to play and to play, you know, potentially five sets with Carlos,” Djokovic says. “I know that my best tennis is going to be required, but I'd rise to the occasion.”Does Djokovic sound a little pessimistic for a guy with winning record against his opponent? Looking at Alcaraz's form since the spring, he has a right to be. He has won five titles on three surfaces, and hasn't dropped a set so far in New York.“I think today I just played a really—or almost perfect match, I would say,” Alcaraz said after seeing off Jiri Lehecka on Tuesday. “So playing a quarterfinal of a Grand Slam, I'm feeling that way. It seems like, OK, just two more steps to do, and let's see what happens.”

Lehecka is one thing, obviously, Djokovic quite another. Up until now, Alcaraz hasn't been able to shed his sense of awe at the Serb, a mindset that may have contributed to his recent defeats. We'll see if that's still the case, or if his excellent run of play this spring and summer—he has won 43 of his last 45 matches—will finally take him to a place where Djokovic can no longer keep up.“We all know Novak's game,” Alcaraz says. “It doesn't matter that he has been out of the tour since Wimbledon. Playing great matches here. I know he's hungry. I know his ambition for more, so let's see.”Let's see, indeed: This is a tough pick. Djokovic may still have the mental and tactical edge over his younger opponent. But will Alcaraz's youth, athleticism, shot-making, and self-assurance render that moot?

I'm going to take my cue from Djokovic, who, like I mentioned above, sounded surprisingly skeptical about his chances on Tuesday night.“It's just that I'm not really sure how the body is going to feel in the next few days,” the 38-year-old said. “But I'm going to do my very best with my team to be fit for that.“There's going to be a lot of running involved, that's for sure.”In other words, the road ahead isn't going to get easier. Winner: Alcaraz

Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Wednesday night to advance to the US Open semifinals for the first time since becoming a mother.

Since returning to tennis, Naomi Osaka has often faced stacked Grand Slam draws as an unseeded player -- a recurring challenge that's left her frustrated.

But after reaching the final in Montreal in late July, Osaka arrived in New York seeded at a major for the first time since her comeback. 

Now, she's back in a Grand Slam semifinal.

The two-time US Open champion defeated No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3), Wednesday night to advance to her third semifinal in New York and fifth overall at a major.

This one, though, carries added significance: It's her first Grand Slam semifinal since becoming a mother.

“I'm really inspired by all the moms on tour,” Osaka said after the match. “But I also have this feeling like I'm not doing good enough or that I'm being left behind. And I think when all the moms came back and they did well off the bat, I sort of felt like something was wrong with me. I know that Belinda [Bencic] made the semis of Wimbledon, so I just really felt like I was losing a race in some sort of weird way.

“So yeah, that was on my mind, but now I'm here and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.”

Watching her fire winner after winner in front of a roaring Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd, it was clear that Osaka had something to prove -- and she delivered.

The opening set was tightly contested; with both players holding serve through the first nine games. The only break point in that span came in the very first game, when Muchova threatened early. Osaka erased it with a forehand winner -- one of many she unleashed throughout the night.

Then, almost out of nowhere, Osaka broke Muchova in the final game of the set, forcing the Czech -- who had reached the US Open semifinals each of the past two years -- into a trio of uncharacteristic errors.

After the match, Osaka likened the play as you get deeper into a Grand Slam to boxing -- “but with a tennis ball, obviously.”

To understand what she meant, all you had to do was watch the second set.

Following an off-court visit with the physio between sets, Muchova returned with renewed energy and broke Osaka to begin the second set. It snapped a streak of 18 consecutive service holds for Osaka.

But Osaka, showing the grit of a four-time Grand Slam champion and the resilience of a mother, broke right back.

And when Muchova broke again at 4-all, setting herself up to serve for the second set, Osaka responded with a forehand smash winner to break at love.

Locked into the moment, Osaka said she couldn't recall what was going through her mind at that stage of the match.

“I honestly don't even remember it,” Osaka said. “But she's one of the toughest players that I'm able to play and I've played her so many times. She's beaten me a couple of times and she beat me here last year, so I knew it was going to be a really tough match.”

After saving two break points, Osaka and Muchova traded holds to send the second set to a tiebreak. Before you could blink, Osaka raced out to a 6-2 lead. Two match points later, she sealed her place in the semifinals.

Among players who began their careers in the Open era, Osaka is the third woman to win each of her first five Grand Slam quarterfinals, joining Chris Evert and Aryna Sabalenka.

Speaking of Sabalenka, she'll face Jessica Pegula in the first semifinal Thursday night. Meanwhile, Osaka will meet Amanda Anisimova with a spot in the US Open final on the line.

Anisimova holds a 2-0 record against Osaka at the WTA level, having won both of their previous meetings at Grand Slams in 2022 -- first at the Australian Open, then again at Roland Garros.

Osaka anticipates a challenge as she looks for her first win against the American.

“It's definitely going to be really tough,” Osaka said. “I've played her twice and I've lost both times. She's so talented and she's able to hit a winner from anywhere. So, I know it's going to be tough, and I really like her as a person too, so I'm cheering for her.”

She smiled and clarified: “I'm not cheering for her against me, but yeah, it's going to be fun. Plus, she's American, and you know, this tournament means a lot to her as well.”

Naomi Osaka improved her record to 5-0 in Grand Slam quarterfinals, defeating No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Wednesday night to advance to the US Open semifinals for the first time since becoming a mother.

NEW YORK—Everything is coming up roses for Naomi Osaka at the 2025 US Open except, oddly enough, her rose-themed Nike dress, which the two-time champion has kept in her closet since her first-round win.Typically debuting different outfits depending on whether she is scheduled to play during the day or at night, Osaka has won her last four matches in a glittering purple ensemble—a streak that continued into Wednesday evening, when she avenged a 2024 US Open loss to Karolina Muchova in the quarterfinals.When I asked Osaka where the ruby-rose outfit had gone, the former world No. 1 sheepishly told me she preferred to keep the same kit after a series of strong wins in Flushing Meadows.

“I'm sadly a little superstitious, which is weird, because I did win in the red,” she said in her post-match press conference.“But I feel like the purple looks better on my skin tone too. I took a poll, and apparently some people like the red roses more.”Osaka will be back under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights on Thursday to face Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova, but was unsure if the roses would return.“I would say I want to bring it back, but I can't promise you.”The four-time Grand Slam champion has turned heads with increasingly audacious fashions since returning to action from maternity leave in 2024, wearing (among others) a harajuku/Sailor Moon themed outfit at last year's US Open and floral space buns at Roland Garros in the spring.Her 2025 fashion campaign has been highlighted by, in addition to the varied florals, a growing army of Labubus named in tribute to tennis trailblazers like Althea Gibson, Billie Jean King, and Arthur Ashe.

“I didn't know that,” she said when told she was a fashion icon in press. “Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that if you look good, you can feel good, but I'm also the type of person that thinks wearing different clothes kind of changes you into different characters kind of.“Sometimes I feel like a different person if I wear something. Yeah, for me I just feel like it's really fun. I tell literally everyone this, but I grew up in the, like, Serena, Venus, Sharapova, grand reveal era, and it's just fun to continue that.”The US Open crowd has certainly given Osaka her flowers through five impressive wins, but can she grab the whole bouquet by winning a fifth major title on Saturday?

Rajeev Ram is taking the high road after fellow American Mardy Fish took shots at him on social media during the build-up to the US Open.It all started two weeks ago, when Jannik Sinner retired mid-match from the Cincinnati Open final due to illness, and then withdrew from US Open mixed doubles with Katerina Siniakova—leaving a spot open in the new 16-team draw.Read More: US Open forges new world with revamped mixed doubles tournamentTennis Channel's Jon Wertheim suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that 41-year-old Ram should replace him as a wild card, but many were surprised to see a sharp rebuke from Fish, 43:“How bout another actual tennis player?” Fish wrote.The comment sparked backlash, with many questioning the animosity and pointing out the irony given Fish's 2021 Netflix documentary Breaking Point, in which he opened up about his own mental health struggles in sports.

How bout another actual tennis player

Speaking on an episode of The Changeover Podcast, Ram admitted he was “shocked” by the comments and called out what he saw as hypocrisy.“It is really strange… I mean, the guy that positioned himself as the mental health advocate, and rightfully so, is taking shots at another player—as you said, a compatriot—from behind a keyboard,” Ram said.“No matter what I might think about somebody personally, I could never see myself doing that in a million years.”Ram also expressed concern for Fish's wellbeing: “I mean, I hope he's okay. I don't think he's okay, if he's doing that kind of thing, but I hope he finds a way to get better from that.”He reflected on their strained relationship, but stopped short of revealing details.“He's actually somebody I looked up to for a really long time,” Ram said. “He's a couple years older than me… He had a great career, was a Top 10 player, was our Davis Cup captain for a while.“We haven't spoken to each other in three years, since… summer or fall of 2022.”

It was in the fall 2022 when Fish, as Davis Cup captain, controversially left Ram—then the world No. 1 in doubles—off the U.S. team. Fish instead selected Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul, along with Jack Sock as the doubles specialist. The decision backfired when the U.S. crashed out in the quarterfinals—losing the deciding doubles rubber against Italy.Moments after the loss, which came on Thanksgiving Day, Ram seemed to add salt to the wound with an X post: “How's everyone's Thanksgiving going?”Read More: Happy Thanksgiving... or not?

Fish, who reached three Grand Slam quarterfinals and peaked at No. 7 in the world in the early 2000s, retired in 2015 after a years-long battle with anxiety and depression. He served as U.S. Davis Cup captain for three years before stepping down in January 2023.Ram is a six-time Grand Slam champion, winning four titles in men's doubles with Joe Salisbury—including three straight at the US Open (2021-2023), along with two mixed doubles titles with Barbora Krejcikova.On Wednesday, Ram and Nikola Mektic, the No. 11 seeds, were eliminated from the US Open men's doubles after falling to No. 14 seeds Michael Venus and Yuki Bhambri, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3.

NEW YORK—Revenge is not only sweet, it also means a US Open semifinal for Naomi Osaka, the two-time champion avenging a 2024 defeat to Karolina Muchova, 6-4, 7-6 (3) for her best Grand Slam finish in nearly five years.A former world No. 1, Osaka lost to Muchova in the second round of this very tournament 12 months ago. After winning their initial rematch at the Australian Open in January, the No. 23 seed scored her biggest major win since the 2021 Australian Open in one hour and 49 minutes over the No. 11 seed on Arthur Ashe Stadium Wednesday evening."I learned I loved tennis way more than I thought I did," Osaka said after the match, "and I learned that, you know, I actually really love challenges. You know, it's like a video game. You pick it up, and even if you lose a level, you kind of just restart and keep going until you eventually win. I think it's a little tough at some times, but I wouldn't trade it for the world."Osaka improved to 13-0 past the quarterfinal stage at major tournaments and will face Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova—who avenged her SW19 loss to No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek—for her fifth career Grand Slam final on Thursday.

The four-time Grand Slam champion has been in the midst of a summer renaissance since hiring coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, reaching her first WTA 1000 final since 2022 at the Omnium Banque Nationale and clinching her first Grand Slam seed since becoming a mother in 2023.The 27-year-old Osaka lost just one set through the first week and kicked off the second with a statement victory over No. 3 seed Coco Gauff to book the Muchova rematch in the last eight.Muchova came to Flushing Meadows in hot pursuit of a third straight US Open semifinal, having navigated injuries to once again play her best tennis at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.Where Osaka—flanked by a growing army of Labubus—cruised, Muchova battled. The Czech veteran needed to win four three-set matches—including one over a 45-year-old Venus Williams in the first round—to book a sixth career major quarterfinal.

With their five-year rivalry split at two wins apiece, Osaka began the match in confident fashion, serving her way to a 5-4 lead and clinching the first break of the match to claim the opening set in just over 40 minutes.Muchova left the court for a medical timeout but nonetheless gained momentum by breaking serve to open the second set. Osaka responded with aplomb, hitting through the Czech's famed cat-and-mouse craft to break straight back and hold serve with her 16th winner of the match.Muchova dug out of a 15-30 deficit in the eighth game and found an opening of her own, increasingly matching Osaka's weight of shot. Osaka saved one break point with a forehand winner but narrowly missed a backhand on the second, giving Muchova the chance to serve out the set.Osaka dialed back in on the brink of a decider, claiming a love-break for 5-5 as the match ticked towards the 90-minute mark. The two-time US Open champ saved two more break points and continued hitting through Muchova to edge into a 6-5 advantage, one game from the semifinals.

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Kimi Antonelli is about to embark on his second home race of the season at Monza, and the Mercedes driver feels that he learned a lot from his previous outing in front of his local fans at Imola.

Kimi Antonelli has outlined the difference in approach that he is taking for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix in comparison to his previous home event earlier in the year at Imola, with the Mercedes driver admitting that he feels “much more prepared” this time around.

Antonelli experienced a busy few days at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix back in May, having brought his school class along to the paddock at the beginning of the event. On the track, the Italian did not manage to reach Q3 in Saturday's Qualifying and then suffered a retirement owing to a technical problem in Sunday's race.

At the time, Antonelli stated that he “didn't manage things the best” – particularly in terms of saving energy for the driving – but the 19-year-old is confident that he will be able to get more from his performance at Monza.

“For sure. I will be much more prepared, and definitely I know much better what to expect,” Antonelli explained during Thursday's media day.

“I know much better how I need to move around and how I need to behave during the race weekend in order to be able to be 100 per cent every time I go in the car.”

Pushed on what he learned from his first home race at Imola ahead of his second this weekend, the rookie answered: “Obviously it was my first home race and there was a lot going [on] around, especially outside the track.

“I think also on my side I didn't manage energy the best way. I was going back in the car and not feeling 100 per cent, also focus-wise. I feel like on that side I will know much better how to react and how to behave, so I think that is going to be the main learning.

“Also trying to manage my energy the best way possible throughout the whole weekend, but obviously you start the weekend and then as you arrive to Sunday you have a bit less energy overall.

“The most important is that you arrive with the most amount of energy. I remember being in Imola and already from the Saturday I was pretty tired, so definitely that was a big learning and I don't want that to happen again.”

While Antonelli has not raced in a Formula 1 Grand Prix at Monza before, the Italian did make his FP1 debut at the track last year on the same weekend in which he was announced as a Mercedes driver for 2025.

The practice outing did not end well for the teenager after crashing into the barriers shortly into the session, meaning that he arrives into this event with mixed emotions.

“A lot of things have happened [in the past year],” Antonelli reflected. “I have good memories but also really bad memories here, but it's a really special place and I think it's going to be a special weekend.

“It's not just my second home race, but this is where it all started with the announcement, so that's why it's going to be a very special one. It's been very intense ever since, but so far it's gone quite okay.”

And in terms of what Mercedes might be able to achieve at Monza, the Italian said: “It's always tough to say, because the cars are getting closer and closer. Last year, looking at the result especially in Qualifying, they were up there.

“This year it's been a bit of a trend that the car, where it's been good last year, was also quite good this year, so hopefully it's going to be the same but we never know.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Lewis Hamilton is preparing for his first race weekend at the historic Monza circuit as a Ferrari driver.

Lewis Hamilton is embracing the “good energy” from Ferrari's passionate fans as he aims to give them something to cheer about at the Italian Grand Prix – despite heading into it with a grid penalty.

Hamilton has experienced a mixed first season at the Scuderia, with plenty to get used to on and off the track, but the seven-time World Champion starts his Monza weekend in high spirits after some special pre-race activities.

Indeed, Hamilton and team mate Charles Leclerc were greeted by a huge crowd of Tifosi at a Ferrari gathering in Milan on Wednesday, underlining the incredible support both drivers and the team will have behind them this weekend.

“It was such a unique experience,” said Hamilton during Thursday's driver press conference. “Already from yesterday morning, getting to [the Ferrari factory in] Maranello, when you walk in and see the Ferrari logo… I still have to pinch myself.

“There are people outside the factory always. I've never seen fans outside the factory before, in any of my years. You see that every single time [here]. There's clearly just so much love for this brand, and what it means to people.

“To be in Milan, really in the heart of it all, seeing the fans and just how passionate they were, it was intense, but very, very positive. I really tried to harness all of that good energy that they gave us.”

As for what Ferrari might be able to achieve at Monza, Hamilton expressed cautious optimism following the “loads of positives” he felt at the Dutch Grand Prix last time out.

“Every weekend is the first time driving this car at a track, and the approach is different from my previous experiences,” he reiterated. “When you go to these places the set-up's different, so it's always new, which I'm enjoying at the moment.

“I think Ferrari have generally gone pretty well [here] in the past years. Obviously they won here last year, with a great strategy and great drive from Charles.

“I'm just really keen to see how the car works here. We're definitely learning from weekend to weekend, [with] loads of positives to take from the last, so we just have to keep building on that.”

Pushed on whether he has wondered what it would be like to stand on the Monza podium as a Ferrari driver, Hamilton added: “Honestly, I haven't, simply because I've been on that podium plenty of times here.

“I know what it's like to be up there, I've seen how it's been for other Ferrari drivers, and anything I try to imagine it'll be far from it, of what that feeling could be.”

Nonetheless, Hamilton is aware of the task ahead given that he will take a five-place grid penalty on Sunday, having been penalised for a yellow flag breach on the reconnaissance laps before the Zandvoort race.

“It's going to be challenging this weekend,” he commented. “Qualifying is already… it's already so close between us all, so just getting into Q3 is tough, getting into the top five is very, very tough.

“Then, on top of that, to be set back five places is not great when you're going into your first Monza [race] with Ferrari, but it gives me more to fight for and I'm very motivated to make up those places.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

While Ferrari has yet to win a race this season, the loyal Tifosi will be hoping drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton can use the positive energy around Monza to come out on top

Monza's Temple of Speed, nestled in the dense woodland of a royal park, is the home of Italian motorsport and a place where Ferrari's faithful – the Tifosi – come to pay homage to the racing team whom they worship.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton knows what this place means to Italy, having made 18 Grand Prix appearances here, but he's about to experience it in a very different way at the 19th time of asking.

This time, he'll be dressed in red, Ferrari red, and he will be one of two drivers who Italy will want to win. The Briton knows a little of what it feels like already, having received the adoration of the Ferrari fans at Imola earlier this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but Monza is another level.

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

The first non-alcoholic brand backed by Moët Hennessy becomes the first ever official alcohol-free sparkling wine partner of Formula 1.

Formula 1 has announced French Bloom its first ever official alcohol-free sparkling wine partner.

The collaboration ushers in a new era of inviting celebration rooted in performance, precision, and purpose and marks the latest initiative in the partnership between Formula 1 and LVMH.

French Bloom is the first non-alcoholic brand backed by Moët Hennessy, the Wines and Spirits division of LVMH which acquired a minority stake in the Maison in late 2024.

French Bloom's award-winning alcohol-free sparkling wines bring a new dimension to Grand Prix weekends in 2025. Served across all F1 operated Paddock Clubs and the F1 Garage, and planned in other hospitality spaces, French Bloom offers an inclusive and elevated way to toast every moment.

Founded by Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger and Constance Jablonski, French Bloom was born from the belief that no one should be left out of the toast. Joy, excellence, and sophistication should never be compromised, not for alcohol, and not for conformity.

Crafted in France from organic Chardonnay wines, and made entirely alcohol-free through an innovative dealcoholisation process, French Bloom's sparkling wines offer a radically refined alternative for a new generation of consumers – one that's driving the future with clarity, intention, and celebration on their own terms.

As F1 expands its global reach, the partnership arrives at a cultural inflection point. Millennials, Gen Z and a growing female fanbase are increasingly driving demand for luxury experiences that offer flexibility, moderation and align with their evolving values.

French Bloom is built for that moment – for those who choose differently, embrace versatility, and are shaping the future on their own terms.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “We are delighted to add French Bloom to our ever-expanding list of Moët Hennessy brands partnering with the sport. The addition of French Bloom brings further variety to our hospitality beverages portfolio allowing us to cater for all guests and offer them an elevated real sense of luxury when they attend a Grand Prix.”

Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger, Co-Founder of French Bloom, added: “We are thrilled to partner with Formula 1 to usher in a new era of celebration, one that looks boldly to the future and is defined by excellence in every detail. Our sparkling cuvées unite centuries of French winemaking savoir-faire with cutting-edge innovation, offering a sophisticated alcohol-free sparkling for those who lead with intention and set the pace for what's next.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Alpine's Franco Colapinto was half a second away from scoring a point at the Dutch Grand Prix, following criticism earlier in the weekend by the team's Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore.

Franco Colapinto has earned praise from Flavio Briatore after narrowly missing out on a points finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Alpine chief calling it “probably his strongest” performance of the season so far.

Going into the weekend, Briatore made headlines by declaring that he was “not happy” with Colapinto's results since the Argentinian took over from Jack Doohan at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix – having so far failed to score.

However, Zandvoort brought more encouraging signs from the F2 race winner, who made his F1 debut as a Williams substitute driver last season before being released to join Alpine over the winter, initially as a test and reserve driver.

Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out.

In an encounter full of incidents and Safety Cars, and amid battling displays from both drivers, Alpine split their approach for the final restart by giving Colapinto fresh tyres and leaving Gasly out on old rubber.

Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position.

“Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”.

Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. It was a race where we had to be alert and ready to capture any opportunity. I felt I drove well and, at the flag, [scored] my best finish of the season.

“As a team there are some parts of the race we will assess to see what we could have done better. We made a call at the end to pit for softs during the final Safety Car to try and attack cars ahead towards the points. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end.

“There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.

No one chooses “The Long Walk.” Not really. That's the key to surviving Stephen King's cult-hit horror novel from 1979 — about a fascist American government and a group of teen boys who supposedly “volunteer” for its lethal endurance test.

Published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, more than a decade after King cracked the concept, “The Long Walk” is technically the first book from the legendary author. King wrote it when he was just 19 years old and still a student at the University of Maine. But the wisdom he gave his characters back then might explain some of the success he has now. 

 










“None of us really has anything to lose. That makes it easier to give away.” “If people took it one day at a time, they'd be a lot happier.” “Pick 'em up. Put 'em down. Just keep walking down the road.”

I've been quoting advice from “The Long Walk” since I was younger than Bachman, but the core genius of King's first novel didn't fully sink in for me until I saw Lionsgate's terrifying new film adaptation in theaters. Marching more than five miles… with over a dozen strangers… in the dark(!!), I couldn't tell if the immersive workout chose me — or if I chose it. 

 










Yes, I was one of the lucky few who got to see “The Long Walk” early, on a treadmill. 

“The emotion is the hard part,” said Briana McElroy, Lionsgate‘s head of worldwide digital marketing, to IndieWire. “We wanted audiences to put themselves in these characters' shoes, and watching people connect with that idea has been so, so exciting.” 

Inside the historic Culver Theater in Los Angeles over Labor Day weekend, seats were swapped for orange exercise equipment and actors stepped in as drill sergeants. Not unlike the rules of the death game we were simulating, our commanders' directives were deceptively simple. Maintain a speed of three miles per hour and you can finish the movie. But fall below that threshold for even a second? That's game over and you will get kicked out. 

“This movie is such a physically and emotionally compelling proposition,” said McElroy. “That's really where the heart of this idea came from, and seeing the incredible reaction people have had to it online makes us even more excited about the release.” 

Directed by Francis Lawrence (“The Hunger Games”) and written by JT Mollner (“Strange Darling”), Lionsgate's shocking new horror movie opens in theaters nationwide on September 12, but the exercise gimmick won't expand with it. If you're still trying to see “The Long Walk” early — and you're in the Los Angeles area tonight — then you should join me and actress Judy Greer for IndieWire's special advanced screening and Q&A. 

 










We'll be at the AMC Century City on Thursday, September 4 at 7 p.m. Request an invite for IndieWire's special early screening of “The Long Walk” here.

Sadly, the midnight movie magic that befell me and my Long Treadmill compatriots will be gone from our city by then. Turns out, you can rent lightweight treadmills that are remarkably easy to move, and they can be set at a fixed speed. Strategizing before the event, I knew we'd cover about five miles if we didn't go faster than we had to. In the end, we were forced to finish the hour and 48 minutes at a pace that technically kept us “together” the entire walk.

But seeing the boys' distance climb on screen, I almost forgot our race entirely.

“I was watching from the wings and I was feeling the emotion too,” said McElroy. “I was very impressed with everybody and their stamina. Like, I'm crying, my eyes are blurry, and I just can't imagine walking through it. The idea of what these boys went through in the book, the relationships they formed and tested by trying to win, then joining them in that by treating the stakes as 100 percent real in a theater, that just means everything to us.” 

Since the dawn of smartphones, cinephiles have been complaining about second-screeners who can't seem to sit through a film — but chasing after one like it's the only carrot in an equestrian apocalypse could be a solution that actually works. I'm notoriously fidgety myself, and when I'm not taking notes for an article or a review, I like to knit in theaters so I have something to do with my hands that's silent. Gyms can be loud, and heading into what was actually my second viewing of “The Long Walk” (more on that later), I was concerned the “whirr-whirr-whirr” of the treadmills might drown out the fear and misery on screen. 

 










In reality, the propulsive noise snapped us to attention and it seemed to subtly push the movie forward. This was an influencer event, so, yes, attendees were using their phones. But even capturing content for social media, “The Long Walk” held everyone's attention. Our drill sergeants struggled to keep on their aviators inside the dark theater, and although they were very attentive about giving us water, the live performers seemed just as captivated by the film as they were with managing the game and its participants.  

“The first reaction people have is wondering if they can handle it, physically,” said McElroy. “But the tech check was the second-most harrowing experience I've had today.” 

Shortly before the screening (mine was one of three that took place inside Auditorium 11, Culver Theater's most flexible event space), I introduced myself to a few other folks who were standing around. Our thespian captors mostly mean-mugged me, but I had an “Allie” to my left and a “Christine” to my right who were warm, friendly, and willing to chat. 

When that Allie stumbled and nearly fell during the film's first 20 minutes, this Ali panicked thinking her new friend might get kicked out. Instead, the instructors showed the Other Allie mercy (possibly because they didn't see the incident until it was too late to fix?), and she got the day's one and only warning.

 










Everyone made it to the end, and that's a testament to the format. But even without the hassle of Lionsgate founding a national gym/theater chain (a hybrid movie palace called something like but not exactly… Cinematic Soul Cycle?), the singular experience the studio gave us so-called “volunteers” tells you why “The Long Walk” feels like mandatory viewing for so many serious Stephen King fans in 2025.

In the movie, No. 47 Raymond Garraty (Cooper Hoffman) grapples with the consequences of putting his name in a lottery mandated by a government that's only claiming to give him a choice. He's flanked by friends as well as foes — No. 23 Peter McVries (David Jonsson), No. 38 known only as “Stebbins” (Garret Wareing), No. 46 Hank Olson (Ben Wang), No. 48 Collie Parker (Joshua Odjick), No. 6 Arthur Baker (Tut Nyuot), and more. We meet Ray in a sea of hopeless competitors succumbing to a capitalist rat race that has no real winners. In an attempt to hang onto my own identity, I wore Doc Martens instead of sneakers.

Lionsgate could have a full-on fascist field day explaining why Mark Hamill was the right choice to play the General for “The Long Walk.” Star Wars devotees, who have more thoughts on the 73-year-old actor than I can even fake, know all too well that epic adventures can make powerful metaphors for authoritarianism. But death games tell you how they end by design, and the last man standing in the movie is a far cry from Luke Skywalker. 

 










Disturbing and graphic moments pepper “The Long Walk” like buckshot, and as the going got tougher for Ray and his pals, I had a harder and harder time managing my own balance. The treadmill was narrow. My shoes had made me cocky. And still, the torture pressed on. I almost paid the price during what I consider to be the most emotional scene in the movie, when my glasses flew off but I continued to walk and cry in place. The friendliest jailer of the bunch grabbed them from the floor for me, and the Other Allie leaned in carefully from her treadmill to ask if I was OK. 

Afterwards, I told some people I was embarrassed to have faltered because I'd seen the film before. There's a slew of reasons I couldn't review “The Long Walk” for IndieWire. For starters, I've loved this book since I was a teenager — and as far as screenwriters go, I'm convinced JT Mollner can do no wrong. I also come from a family of batshit insane long-distance runners, and these days, if you talk to me at a bar anytime past 9 p.m., I've got more to say about politics than you would like to hear. 

But what's the main reason someone else at IndieWire will be critiquing “The Long Walk”? Because I attended a test screening of the movie this spring, and in my written feedback, I suggested the very treadmill idea the studio later brought to life for zany King fans like me. 

 










“Dream factory occasionally does make dreams,” said TIFF midnight programmer Peter Kuplowsky, when I DM'd him about the unforgettable event in an overjoyed frenzy. 

Early buzz for the adaptation is strong, and the online reaction to the treadmill activation has been quietly extraordinary to watch. Standing or sitting, this is my favorite horror movie of the year (so far!) and I'm excited to get back on the trail with a third screening soon. Exiting the auditorium, seriously questioning the Docs decision, another “Long Walk” line came to mind. 

“‘FUCK THE LONG WALK,'” I joked to one of my favorite publicists, No. 1 Alfonso Ardon. 

Taking on a small rebellion in the middle of a fight for their lives, the boys use that rallying cry to get through the middle slump of their grueling journey. It's one of my favorite scenes in the film, and while I'm very happy with the free swag I got at the treadmill screening, I mentioned to Alfonso how great I thought that would be on a t-shirt. The only race to resolve now? Whether I choose to make one… or Lionsgate beats me to it. 

“The Long Walk” is in theaters September 12. See it early with IndieWire on September 4.

Two years after Tamera Mowry-Housley starred in Hallmark's first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” movie, “Murder in G Major,” she'll take on a new crime in “Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at C” on October 12, 2025. The movie is a surprise addition to the Fall 2025 lineup of premieres.

Mowry-Housley revealed in February that she was in Ireland, filming at least one new movie as Gethsemane Brown. But with multiple other Hallmark mystery franchises on hold, including “Curious Caterer,” a second mystery on the autum schedule is a welcome surprise for sleuthers, and timed perfectly for a spooky weekend on the network with the October 11 premiere of “Haul Out the Halloween.” Countdown to Christmas is expected to start the following weekend.

In the first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries,” we met Gethsemane, a former orchestra conductor who moved to Ireland to teach at a boarding school, St. Brendan's, where she's tasked with turning a motley group of students into an award-winning chorus. 

But when she keeps hearing the same four notes playing in the old Irish house where she's staying, she discovers it's the ghost of one of her music idols, a songwriter-musician, Eamon, played by Risteard Cooper, who perished years before in a mysterious murder-suicide. 

Able to see his spirit, she reluctantly starts working with him to try to solve the mystery and clear his name. She gets assistance from local Inspector O'Reilly, played by Adam Fergus, and her teaching colleague Griff, played by Hallmark fan favorite and “Riverdale” actor Marco Grazzini. 

In the new movie, Gethsemane is back, as is the ghost of Eamon, to “solve the unexplained death of a sea captain,” per Hallmark. Grazzini reprises his role, too. 

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

On February 3, Mowry-Housley indicated that she would be filming in Ireland for a long shoot and would miss her husband and their two kids, though they eventually were able to visit. 

According to Ireland's Screen Crew and Services Database, “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” was scheduled to film for more than two months, from February 4 to April 11, in Dublin and in picturesque Wicklow, located about 30 miles south of the city.

Given that most Hallmark movies stick to a 15-day production schedule, it's likely that the cast and crew had enough time to film two movies. The movies are based on Alexia Gordon's Gethsemane Brown Mysteries five-book series, with the upcoming premiere likely based on the novel “Killing in C Sharp.”

Mowry-Housley's mystery movie will kick off a season when she'll have a heavy presence on Hallmark Channel. She also spent part of August filming a holiday movie in Vancouver. 

The “Sister Sister” alum will also helm the new reality competition series “Baked With Love: Holiday,” in which 10 pairs of “home bakers” will compete in a bake-off using family recipes, with the winners receiving a $50,000 prize. The series will air during Countdown to Christmas, but Hallmark hasn't announced a premiere date.

Kurt Russell (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) has been cast as a series regular in the new drama The Madison from Taylor Sheridan, starring Michelle Pfeiffer. Ahead of the show's first season premiere, it's expected that the show will receive an early renewal for a sophomore season, we hear.


The Madison is a heartfelt exploration of grief and human connection, following a New York City family in the Madison River Valley of central Montana.


	Russell joins the previously announced cast of Patrick J. Adams, Elle Chapman, Matthew Fox, Beau Garrett, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova and Kevin Zegers.

	Most recently, Russell starred in the Apple TV+ series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters alongside his son, Wyatt Russell.

Russell's most recent feature-film credits include Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pete Berg's Deepwater Horizon, Fast and Furious 8, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Christmas Chronicles 1 &2, and Smurfs. He is repped by UTA.

"Sorry" is one of only 15 music videos to have crossed the 4 billion mark.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Justin Bieber is no stranger to making history on YouTube, and now the pop superstar has scored his first music video to rack up 4 billion views on the platform.


	On Thursday (Sept. 4), YouTube announced that Bieber's “Sorry” music video had surpassed 4 billion views. Ironically, Bieber himself is nowhere to be found in the 2015 clip, which features a series of dancers in bright-colored clothes performing choreography from dance star Parris Goebel.


	“Sorry” is one of only 15 music videos to have crossed the 4 billion mark — led by Luis Fonsi's “Despacito,” featuring Daddy Yankee, with 8.8 billion views. While Bieber hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the Latin music duo thanks to their “Despacito” remix, his version is not in the blockbuster music video.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Sorry,” from Bieber's 2015 album Purpose, marked the singer's second-ever No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 (following “What Do You Mean?” reaching the summit in September 2015). Bieber co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, along with the song's co-producers Skrillex and Bloodpop.




	In 2010, Bieber set the record for the most-watched YouTube video ever, when his “Baby” video surpassed Lady Gaga's “Bad Romance.” He held the record until November 2012, when Psy's “Gangnam Style” took the crown (and eventually became the first YouTube video to surpass 1 billion views).


	Beyond “Sorry,” Bieber has five other videos in the Billion Views Club: 2010's “Baby” (3.4 billion views), 2015's “What Do You Mean?” (2.2 billion views), 2015's “Love Yourself” (1.7 billion views), 2010's “Never Say Never” featuring Jaden Smith (1.2 billion views) and 2012's “Beauty and a Beat” featuring Nicki Minaj (1.1 billion views).


	Also on Thursday, Bieber surprise-announced a second 2025 album, with Swag II set to be released at midnight tonight, following the July 11 release of Swag.

	When Sydney Sweeney arrives at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, she'll be happy to talk about anything pertaining to Christy, the David Michôd film in which she portrays professional boxer Christy Martin. She'll talk preparation, collaboration, and whatever else leads directly back to the movie. But don't ask her about the recent backlash surrounding her controversial American Eagle campaign — she won't answer. 


	“I am there to support my movie and the people involved in making it, and I'm not there to talk about jeans,” Sweeney told Vanity Fair in an interview ahead of the festival where the film is set to premiere. “The movie's about Christy, and that's what I'll be there to talk about.”


	The campaign, which launched earlier this summer, was slammed over allegations of dog-whistling eugenics because of the play-on-words tagline, “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans/Genes.” This week, American Eagle shared data showing that their Sydney Jacket sold out in one day, while their Sydney Jean sold out in one week, with plans to restock in November, per People. Proceeds from the jeans benefit the Crisis Text Line.

	Sweeney didn't have any further comment about the campaign to Vanity Fair. In August, American Eagle responded in a statement that the campaign “is and always was about the jeans.” Still, it received support from Donald Trump and Fox News, and backlash from artists like Lizzo and Doja Cat.


Christy is now Sweeney's second promotional cycle to be plagued by the controversy. The actress declined to speak to any press around the U.S. theatrical release of Americana, the crime thriller she stars in alongside Halsey, who also wanted to keep the focus on the film.

	“You should go see this movie. because [director] @tonytost made an exceptional film, in honor of a genre he knows intimately,” the musician said. “Because his work and his vision are greater than the 24 hr gossip tabloid denim bullshit. If you love cinema, then you should know that cinema comes first. This is cinema.” 


Rolling Stone named Christy one of the most anticipated movies scheduled to premiere at TIFF. “Now Sydney Sweeney steps into the ring, figuratively and otherwise, to play Martin in this sports biopic from David Michôd (Animal Kingdom, War Machine),” David Fear wrote. “No word on whether her jeans are good or not, but we can tell you that she apparently trained hard for the role, and Ben Foster plays her manager-slash-husband Jim Martin.”

Any discussion of Pete Ohs' movies inevitably turns towards his unique process, which combines the logical sequences of Ohs' background as a computer programmer with an open-minded, improvisational approach to writing and performance. Actors love Ohs for this, and the filmmaker has built a core company as a result. After co-starring in The True Beauty Of Being Bitten By A Tick, which premiered at this year's SXSW, Jeremy O. Harris returns for Ohs' latest, Erupcja. So does Will Madden, who's appeared in three Ohs films so far. 

But, also inevitably, the headlines around Erupcja will revolve around a new member of the ensemble: Pop singer (and high-profile Letterboxd user) Charli XCX stars in Erupcja as Bethany, a British tourist who doesn't know what she wants, but keeps feeling called back to Warsaw, Poland. She says it's because the city is romantic, and relatively under-visited compared to Paris or Rome. But really, it's because she can't stay away from Nel (Lena Góra), a Polish florist with whom Bethany shares an explosive connection. 

The chemistry between these two women is remarkable. It's natural and intimate, and spontaneous in the way that people can be when they're around someone they'd follow into the ocean if it meant a little more time together. It feels as though they've known each other for decades—which we learn as the story unfolds, and reveals that Bethany and Nel first met when Bethany came to Warsaw on a school trip many years ago.

Since then, she's returned periodically, clearly drawn to Nel but unable to make a commitment to her. So they go out and drink and party and try not to think about the next morning, because it feels so good to be in each other's company. Every time they get together, a volcano erupts—metaphorically and literally. A cynic might attribute this phenomenon to climate change. but to Bethany and Nel, it's further proof that they share something magical. 

This time, Mount Etna is keeping Bethany in Poland longer than expected. And this time, things are more complicated than usual, as Bethany has brought her boyfriend Rob (Madden) along on what's supposed to be a romantic weekend. (It is, but not in the way Rob was expecting.) Sweet, simple Rob is planning to propose, and Bethany is completely freaked out. So she subtly undermines any activity Rob has planned that might make an appropriate background for an engagement, while sneaking out at night to go see Nel. But Nel has a life of her own, and is getting tired of Bethany's random drop-ins. 

Madden is the film's most pathetic presence, walking alone in the rain and leaving a series of increasingly dejected voicemails on Bethany's phone. The characters in Erupcja behave in ways that are selfish and short-sighted, but painfully realistic; treating someone so poorly that they break up with you so you don't have to break up with them is practically a rite of passage for avoidant young adults like Bethany. 

Erupcja is wise in this way, and compassionate. In some ways, it's a movie about the things we don't say, and the things we project onto each other. In others, it's about finding the courage to look past your own needs and actually see the humanity in other people. Charli XCX gives a surprisingly good, grounded performance in this regard, adjusting her body language and eye contact to express the things her character can't. 

Bethany shifts in her chair and looks away when Rob tells her that their flight has been delayed because of a volcanic eruption. It's subtle, but Ohs and sound designer Danny Madden add a rumbling sound low in the mix as she processes the news. This sound reoccurs throughout Erupcja, a little louder each time, until—much like Bethany and Nel's attraction—it can no longer be ignored.

Like his writing (his script credit is shared with the cast), Ohs' shooting style is also improvisational, with the director serving as his own cinematographer in order to streamline the process. This lends an intuitive feel to the film's impressionistic cutaways, evoking memories of a perfect afternoon abroad with closeups of drops of rain splashing into a puddle, or fancy food arranged artfully on a plate, or the look someone gives someone else that shifts the vibe for the rest of the evening. The effect is sensual, even sexy, creating a dreamy bubble around the characters as they make decisions they'll have to apologize for later. 

Everything comes together as it should, which is a testament to the cast's intuitive and collaborative abilities as well as their director's. Erupcja is held together by fairytale narration, delivered in Polish by Jacek Zubiel; it's a smart strategic move, as otherwise the narrative might feel too slight or disjointed to keep the audience's attention long enough to appreciate all the subtle details. But it also adds a hint of enchantment to the story, evoking the sophisticated connotations of the international arthouse. It's this type of decision-making that makes Erupcja Pete Ohs' best film yet.

Nick Gehlfuss is a Dick Wolf universe OG again. The Chicago Med alum and and Michael Michele, who recurred on another Wolf series, New York Undercover, are set as leads alongside Tom Ellis on CBS' upcoming crime drama series CIA.


	The FBI offshoot centers on two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law. When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA's New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength.

Sometimes, a romance feels so inevitable that no matter what either party does, the universe just keeps pushing them back together. Hollywood romances are often built on a formula of “Guy Gets Girl, Guy Loses Girl, Guy Gets Girl Back,” but the love stories that shape us the most often require running through that cycle quite a few more times, with no guarantees of happy endings.

The five-year romance between Charlie (Nick Robinson) and Harper (Emilia Jones) is nothing if not cyclical. It began as a high school flirtation, with the two artsy misfits burning CDs of their favorite songs and leaving them in each other's lockers, content to let their favorite artists do the talking at an age when the prospect of socializing with people you like often feels like social suicide. They reconnect at a college party, initially feigning forgetfulness until a well-placed song on the aux cord makes it clear that their memories of each other were crystal clear. 

 








Related Stories I Survived ‘The Long Walk' Treadmill Challenge — What 5 Miles with the New Stephen King Classic Felt Like ‘Erupcja' Review: Charli xcx Ditches Her Boyfriend for a Polish Girl in Light and Breezy Movie About the Upside of Main Character Syndrome 

That sparks a romance that sees them move to New Orleans together as Harper pursues her culinary dreams, only to find that his lack of ambition and struggles with substance abuse are hurdles that their relationship isn't strong enough to handle. Years go by, and they each build their own separate lives until another spontaneous party encounter makes it clear that some feelings are harder to forget than your favorite song.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






That might sound like a spoiler-laden summary of an entire movie, but “Charlie Harper” writer Tom Dean (who co-directs with Mac Eldridge) utilizes cyclical storytelling that gives you all of that information very early on. The film alternates between the three “first” meetings between the doomed couple, who are utterly incapable of suppressing their mutual attraction — at least, the first three meetings, because there's every reason to believe it will happen again after the movie ends — cutting between the three legs of their relationship to illustrate that no amount of evolving external circumstances can change the fact that we love who we love.

The chemistry between the two young lovers is undeniable, but the wedges that eventually drive them apart are present from the beginning. He's a quintessential “I Can Fix Him” project, handsome and self-destructive with pain behind his beautiful eyes and a taste for poetry and literature despite living in a trailer park with a history of depression and addiction in his family. She's an ambitious planner with dreams of being one of the best chefs in the world, with the work ethic to do it. They're drawn to each other because they both see that there's more to the world than the sad little town they grew up in (and, let's face it, because they're both hot), but her obsession with rising above her station was always going to clash with his seeming contentment to drink himself into an early grave.

 










Dean and Eldridge know how to make a stylish film that manipulatively tugs on all the right emotional strings, and a few tears will probably be shed at the “Charlie Harper” premiere. It's not hard to imagine the film finding an audience among younger indie film fans who either don't remember movies like “(500) Days of Summer” or are simply eager to have one for their own generation. Those with a bit more viewing experience under their belts will probably grow bored of the film's dependence on cliches, as it often feels like a bittersweet mixtape of old indie tropes: the manipulative power of nostalgia, the ways that seemingly inconsequential pieces of physical media can become formative memories, the euphoric feeling of falling in love and fantasizing about the big world waiting for you outside your hometown, and the realizations that even if love wasn't enough, relationships can still shape us for the better.

Some movies get richer the more time you sit with them, but “Charlie Harper” is the kind of film whose impact will always be the strongest as you're walking out of the theater. The lack of originality and occasional on-the-nose dialogue cancel out most of its rewatch value, but it's hard not to be affected in the moment by the sincerity of its storytelling and the chemistry between Robinson and Jones. There have been multitudes of movies made about the toxic young romances that shape us into the more stable adults we eventually become, but the world will stop making them when they stop making us feel things. And “Charlie Harper” is proof that that day has not arrived yet.

 










“Charlie Harper” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

A 71-minute wisp of a film that moves and sounds like a cartoon wind curlicue, Pete Ohs' “Erupcja” — the Polish word for “eruption” — was (clearly) shot with half an outline and scripted on the fly, to the point that all four of its main actors are credited as co-writers as well. Here, that approach proves a bit more pointed than it did in the director's previous “Jethica” and “The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick,” as its elevated mumblecore energy suits the unformed and searching nature of a wherever you go, there you are story about the ways that people try to make sense of the world around them in real-time. 

 








Related Stories ‘Charlie Harper' Review: Sincerity Cancels Out the Cliches in a Cyclical Story of Doomed Love ‘Scarlet' Review: ‘Belle' Director Mamoru Hosoda Returns with a Bloody Anime ‘Hamlet' that Has Nothing to Say 

People like Bethany (Charli xcx, a sly and natural screen presence), a British girl who's convinced that a volcano explodes whenever she blows up her life for a biannual fling with flower shop owner Nel (Lena Góra) in Warsaw. Her puppy dog-like boyfriend Rob (Will Madden) wanted to propose to her in Paris, but when Bethany suggested they go to Poland instead — and not even Kraków, with all of its historic charm — some part of her was expecting the planet to crack open when they got there, as if the Earth itself were responding to her fears of heteronormative complacency. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Sure enough, Mount Etna erupts soon after the couple settles into their rental flat, and Bethany takes it as a sign to slip away from her almost-fiancé at a party one night (what else could it possibly be?), ghosting Rob and his well-planned itinerary in favor of another fiery tryst with Nel. Goodbye sleepy conversations at guidebook-recommended restaurants, hello all-night drug sprees followed by pre-dawn poetry recitations (sex is implied, I suppose, but Ohs' movie is too airy and ethereal to show anything as physical as a kiss). 

Is it “brat” to disappear from your dutiful boyfriend in the middle of the trip he planned for you, knowing full well that you've abandoned him to miserably scour the city for any trace of his would-be future wife? I'm not really sure, to be honest, but sometimes a girl just has to listen to the universe, even if it's really more of a self-absorbed echo chamber. Besides, it's probably never a great idea to marry someone who's saved in your contacts next to the emoji of a guy raising his hand — nobody wants to marry the emoji of a guy raising his hand.

Ohs, who recently moved to Poland himself, is fascinated by the transformative power of being in a foreign space, and by the process through which people — be they transplants or just tourists — try to reconcile who they are to the new reality around them, and “Erupcja” drifts along with the detachedness of an out-of-body experience. Claude (Jeremy O. Harris as an extroverted American painter who meets Bethany and Rob by chance at a sushi restaurant) is probably the closest thing the director has to a surrogate in this story, and at one point the camera finds him pontificating about how “Being immersed in a culture so different from my own helps me turn my brain off so I can enter a dream state more naturally.” 

 










Slight as it is, “Erupcja” crystallizes that condition to a tee. And while Ohs might point to “Celine and Julie Go Boating” and “Alice in the Cities” as his main sources of inspiration for this project, there's something very “‘Lost in Translation' by way of Hong Sang-soo” about how Bethany — subsumed into a waking dreamstate that still feels like real life to all of the people buzzing around her — starts to understand herself more legibly now that she's in another country where she's forced read the subtitles (figuratively for her, literally for us). To that end, Charli xcx's casting adds a metatextual richness to the movie and vice-versa, as the friction between her pop star persona and Bethany's somnambulant everywoman deepens the sense of a woman divided between the superreal and the literal, the spectacular and the mundane. 

“Erupcja” sustains that tension by adhering to a kind of semi-heightened non-logic, as in the very Rivette-like sequence where Bethany invisibly stalks Nel halfway across the city without being noticed. The film's non-judgmental narration — read by Jacek Zubiel — comments on the characters' innermost thoughts along the way, adding to the general patina of narcissism without pointing fingers or placing blame. 

 










It's a (potentially liberating) narcissism that Bethany may never have allowed herself while stuck in the gauziness of her day-to-day existence. Does Bethany not hear the cautionary self-absorption that's baked into the Lord Byron poem she recites directly to camera on the floor of Nel's apartment, or is that the only place where she might have ever related to “Darkness”? Did she have to come to Poland to have an easily interpretable relationship dream about being stuck aboard a speeding train, or did she just have to come to Poland in order to remember it when she woke up? And is Nel capable of sharing in Bethany's selfish dislocation, or is the reality of being in her own home — where she's regularly visited by the semi-jilted girl she's dating (“Ida” star Agata Trzebuchowska) — too grounding to buy into the myth that she and Bethany have been telling each other for the last 10 years or so? 

“Erupcja” is too breezy a film to conclusively answer such questions, but it lingers in spite of its lightness because it understands how the self-centeredness of travel can cut both ways. And, for that matter, how a little bout of main character syndrome might give someone the perspective they need to save them from becoming a subplot in their own life. 

 










“Erupcja” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

	“Sarah Harden's exceptional leadership and unwavering support laid the foundation for Hello Sunshine's success,” said Reese Witherspoon, founder of Hello Sunshine. “From our initial meeting, when we discussed our shared values and our passion for storytelling to reach women globally, Sarah's mentorship and friendship have been invaluable to me. I am so proud of the bold, innovative company we built together with the most talented team. Her belief in my vision made my wildest dreams for this company a reality. As we embark on this new chapter, I am excited for Hello Sunshine's future and eager to carry the company forward with the same spirit under the leadership of Maureen, Lauren, and our executive team.”

	Said Polo: “Hello Sunshine's mission is aligned with my personal passion, and it's an incredible honor to continue building and scaling this business alongside Reese and our exceptional team. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with and learn from Sarah for more than a decade, and I'm excited to lead Hello Sunshine into this next chapter.”


	Said Hardn: “I am profoundly grateful to have been Reese's partner on this beautiful ride. Her fearlessness, curiosity, creativity and inspiring bar for excellence have been matched by her decency, humor and warmth – always in service of pushing the boundaries on what we could build together. I know this mission will continue forward under the leadership of Maureen and the rest of our incredible team, which fills me with great pride.”


	Prior to joining Hello Sunshine, Polo led marketing strategy and solutions for WarnerMedia's entertainment portfolio including HBO Max, TBS, truTV, Adult Swim and Cartoon Network. Earlier, as General Manager at Fullscreen, she oversaw more than 350 employees and drove strategy across revenue, marketing, creative, production and operations. 

	











	Under Polo's leadership, Hello Sunshine has continued to expand its direct-to-consumer offerings. Reese's Book Club has selected 116 books since 2017, with more than 90 hitting the New York Times Best Seller List while contributing to roughly $800 million in U.S. sales. The company has also launched several groundbreaking initiatives: Shine Away, an experiential franchise now in its third year; The Bright Side podcast, which garnered 100,000 downloads in its first 72 hours and reached No. 1 in Apple's Arts category; Solar, an in-house social agency partnering with major brands; and Sunnie, a Gen Z-focused media and lifestyle brand.


	Founded in 2016, Hello Sunshine has redefined storytelling for women across platforms with a slate of premium content overseen by Neustadter. The company's upcoming slate includes Season 4 of The Morning Show (Apple TV+), Season 2 of The Last Thing He Told Me (Apple TV+), the anticipated Lucky (Apple TV+) starring Anya Taylor-Joy, and Elle (Prime Video) which reimagines the Legally Blonde universe for television. The company recently wrapped production on the first season of Elle and is preparing for The Nightingale, a feature adaptation with TriStar set to begin shooting in early 2026. 


	The company has released four films and nine series totaling 14 seasons, earning 112 award nominations and 10 wins of major industry honors including Emmys, Golden Globes, and Critics Choice awards. The company's recent film successes include You're Cordially Invited, which brought in over 50 million worldwide Prime Video viewers and ranks among Amazon MGM Studios' top three most-watched comedy films of all time; Where the Crawdads Sing, Hello Sunshine's first theatrical release, which grossed close to $200 million worldwide, and Something from Tiffany's starring Zoey Deutch, which became the No. 1 feature on Prime Video in 52 countries. 


	Hello Sunshine's slate of premium TV includes Emmy-nominated series like Little Fires Everywhere (Hulu), the two-season psychological thriller Surface (Apple TV+), three seasons of the NAACP Award-winning Truth Be Told (Apple TV+), the NAACP Award-winning and Netflix chart-topping From Scratch, and HBO's Emmy-winning Big Little Lies Season 2. The Last Thing He Told Me became Apple TV+'s most-watched limited series ever, while Daisy Jones & The Six (Prime Video) dominated streaming charts and earned nine Emmy nominations.


	The company's productions have consistently topped global streaming charts, with female filmmakers directing 91 episodes across 18 seasons of Hello Sunshine television. The company has also built an immense unscripted slate under the leadership of Sara Rea including series like Family Recipe Showdown (Food Network/Hulu), Women's Sports Now (Roku), F1: The Academy (Netflix), Surf Girls (Prime Video) and My Kind of Country (Apple TV+).


	Hello Sunshine reaches 163 million people across its social media properties.

The lawsuit was filed as a growing contingent of Hollywood steps into the fight over generative artificial intelligence. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Warner Bros. Discovery is suing a prominent artificial intelligence image generator for copyright infringement, escalating a high-stakes battle involving the use of movies and TV shows owned by major studios to teach AI systems.


	The lawsuit accuses Midjourney, which has millions of registered users, of building its business around the mass theft of content. The company “brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery's intellectual property” by letting subscribers produce images and videos of iconic copyrighted characters, alleges the complaint, filed on Thursday in California federal court.

	“The heart of what we do is develop stories and characters to entertain our audiences, bringing to life the vision and passion of our creative partners,” said a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson in a statement. “Midjourney is blatantly and purposefully infringing copyrighted works, and we filed this suit to protect our content, our partners, and our investments.”


	For years, AI companies have been training their technology on data scraped across the internet without compensating creators. It's led to lawsuits from authors, record labels, news organizations, artists and studios, which contend that some AI tools erode demand for their content.


	Warner Bros. Discovery joins Disney and Universal, which earlier this year teamed up to sue Midjourney. By their thinking, the AI company is a free-rider plagiarizing their movies and TV shows.

	











	In a statement, Disney said it's “committed to protecting our creators and innovators” and that it's “pleased to be joined by Warner Bros. Discovery in the fight against Midjourney's blatant copyright infringement.”


	Added NBCUniversal, “Creative artists are the backbone of our industry, and we are committed to protecting their work and our intellectual property.”


	In the lawsuit, Warner Bros. Discovery points to Midjourney generating images of iconic copyrighted characters. At the forefront are heroes who're at the center of DC Studios' movies and TV shows, like Superman, Wonder Woman and The Joker; others are Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry and Scooby-Doo characters who've become ubiquitous household names; more are Cartoon Network characters, including those from Rick and Morty, who've emerged as something of cultural touchstones in recent years.


	Midjourney, which has four tiers of paid subscriptions ranging from $10 to $120 per month and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, returns characters owned by Warner Bros. Discovery even in response to prompts like “classic comic book superhero battle” that don't explicitly mention any particular intellectual property, the complaint alleges.

	











	As evidence that Midjourney trained its AI system on its intellectual property, the studio attaches dozens of images showing the tool's outputs compared to stills from its movies and TV shows. When prompted with “Batman, screencap from The Dark Knight,” the service returns an image of Christian Bale's portrayal of the character featuring the costume's Kevlar plate design that differentiated it from previous iterations of the hero that appears to be taken from the movie or promotional materials, with few to no alternations made. One of the more convincing examples highlights a 3D-animated Bugs Bunny mirroring his adaptation in Space Jam: A New Legacy.


	The lawsuit argues Midjourney's ability to return copyrighted characters is a “clear draw for subscribers,” diverting consumers away from purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery-approved posters, wall art and prints, among other products that must now compete against the service.


	Like OpenAI, the content used to train Midjourney's technology is a black box, representing an obstacle for some creators who've sued AI companies for copyright infringement. Rightsholders have mined public statements from AI company C-suites for clues. In 2022, Midjourney founder David Holz said in an interview that his employees “grab everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” The specifics of the training process will be subject to discovery.


	Warner Bros. Discovery seeks Midjourney's profits attributable to the alleged infringement or, alternatively, $150,000 per infringed work, which could leave the AI company on the hook for massive damages.

	











	The thrust of the studios' lawsuits will likely be decided by one question: Are AI companies covered by fair use, the legal doctrine in intellectual property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted works without a license? On that issue, a court found earlier this year that Amazon-backed Anthropic is on solid legal ground, at least with respect to training.


	The technology is “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.


	Still, the court set the case for trial over allegations that the company illegal downloaded millions of books to create a library that was used for training. Anthropic, which later settled the lawsuit, faced potential damages of hundreds of millions of dollars stemming from the decision that may have laid the groundwork for Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney and Universal to get similar payouts depending on what they unearth in discovery over how Midjourney obtained copies of thousands of films and TV shosws that were repurposed to teach its image generator.


	Still on the sidelines in the fight over generative AI: Paramount Skydance, Amazon MGM Studios, Apple Studios, Sony Pictures and Lionsgate. Some have major AI ambitions.

The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Sept. 13, we look at Sabrina Carpenter's first two singles from her just-released Man's Best Friend set, and which may have the stronger performance on next week's chart.

Sabrina Carpenter, “Tears” & “Manchild” (Island/Republic): Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is all but guaranteed to have the top spot on next week's Billboard 200 albums chart with her new set Man's Best Friend. The follow-up to last year's four-week Billboard 200 No. 1 Short n' Sweet, Carpenter's latest arrives on the back of a good deal of discourse around its provocative title and cover — which the singer-songwriter has largely shrugged off — as well as her second No. 1 on the Hot 100 with lead single “Manchild,” which became her first song to debut atop the chart upon its June release.  

	











	Next week, Carpenter will look to make it two No. 1 debuts in a row with winking, discofied second single “Tears” — which, as “Manchild” did, arrives along with a big new music video. Directed by Bardia Zeinali (who also helmed the Barry Keoghan-co-starring clip for Carpenter's first Hot 100 No. 1, “Please Please Please”), the clip features a Rocky Horror Picture Show-inspired narrative, starring Emmy-winning actor Colman Domingo in drag, as well as elaborate staging and choreography. She has also maintained interest in the new video over the week by premiering multiple differing endings for the video — which originally closed with her killing her boyfriend, out of obligation to her personal brand — over the course of the album's release week.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Tears” is off to a very good start at DSPs, hitting No. 1 on both the Spotify Daily Top Songs USA chart and the Apple Music real-time chart, and maintaining in the top two on both throughout the week. On radio, it's still only getting started, but is also set to make a fairly strong debut, possibly entering the top 25 on Pop Airplay, and earning 7.4 million in all-format audience over the first four days of the tracking week (Aug. 29-Sept. 1), according to Luminate. The one area where it's clearly lagging behind where “Manchild” began is in sales, as “Tears” has had a good-not-great showing on iTunes, currently landing outside the top 25 on that real-time chart. (“Manchild” also had a sizeable first week in vinyl single sales; “Tears” is available for purchase only as a download.)


	“Tears” will also face continued competition from “Manchild” on the chart next week, as that song had slipped out of the top 10 on the Hot 100, but rebounds 14-7 this week with notable gains in both streaming and radio. Those streams should continue to rise for next week with the release of the full Man's Best Friend (which “Manchild” leads off), and the song is also continuing to grow on radio, most likely tracking for a second week atop the Pop Airplay chart, and up another 5% in all-format audience over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period.  


	Whether “Tears” can outpace “Manchild” and put up a real challenge for the No. 1 spot may be determined by its final few days of tracking — as the song returned to the top of the Spotify daily listing after Labor Day Weekend, and may continue to swell from there as more and more listeners catch onto its charms.  

	











HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): The biggest challenge for “Tears” on the Hot 100 will of course be getting past HUNTR/X's “Golden,” which holds at No. 1 this week for a third week, and which hasn't stopped growing yet in either streams or sales. It's taken back the top spot on the Apple Music real-time listing from “Tears” — and has traded off the Spotify daily No. 1 with Carpenter over the course of the week — and it continues to be one of the week's best-sellers, currently ranking at No. 2 on the real-time iTunes chart.  


	And on radio, it's officially taken off. The song is up 10% over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period, trending towards both the top 10 on the Pop Airplay chart and the top 25 on the overall Radio Songs listing. It's crazy to say about a song by a fictional girl group from a K-pop movie musical — versus one of the most consistent radio hitmakers of the last two years — but radio may be the thing that keeps “Golden” out of range for Sabrina Carpenter's latest to pass next week on the Hot 100.

Here's how the Mexican star makes history. 


													By
												

	Griselda Flores


Senior Editor, Latin


Peso Pluma is no stranger to history-making moments in music but today, the música mexicana star marks a new milestone in the fashion world. 


	The 26-year-old hitmaker makes history as the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) first Mexican ambassador for New York Fashion Week. Peso Pluma (born Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija) will help kick off the spring/summer 2026 season alongside CFDA Chairman Thom Browne and designers Michael Kors and Anna Sui. Peso Pluma made his New York Fashion Week debut earlier this year at Thom Browne's fall/winter 2025 show. 


	Joining the CFDA as an ambassador is another feather in Peso's cap as he continues to expand his influence beyond music and double down on his efforts to globalize música mexicana. 

	











	Since his major breakthrough in 2023, the CAA-signed artist, managed by George Prajin, has headlined major festivals across the U.S., including Coachella, Rolling Loud California and Chicago's Sueños Festival. He is also set to headline ComplexCon 2025 in Las Vegas on Oct. 25.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Pluma has scored 25 top 10 hits on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart and 33 songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Landing at No. 3 on Billboard‘s Top Latin Artists of 2024, Peso Pluma has been on a signing spree for his Double P Records, launched alongside Prajin, with new artists joining his roster, including Julian Mercado, Reynaldos de la Sierra and Your Favorite Color.

It's been said that several filmmakers at Venice are showing up with their “state of the world” movies. Whether that's Luca Guadagnino with his take on cancel culture, Yorgos Lanthimos satirizing alt-right-style radicalization, or Kathryn Bigelow depicting our mutually-assured madness in nightmarish fashion, many of our most famed directors seem to be looking at a world in flux and asking: “How did we get here?”

Hosoda, a former Studio Ghibli animator who went freelance and has since become one of Japan's most successful auteurs, is no different. His last film, 2021's “Belle”, was a sci-fi adaptation of “Beauty and the Beast.” For his latest act, Hosoda hasn't traveled too far from that baroque fantasy setting, which was already more idealized than the relative normality of his mainstream breakthrough hit (and Oscar nominee) “Mirai.” “Scarlet” is a loose but clearly intended rendering of Hamlet, with all of its castles and knights, ghosts and traitorous uncles — and lots that isn't in Shakespeare's play, too.

One of the first lines of dialogue is Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) plotting the murder of his brother; “I have long dreamed of pouring poison into his ears”, he says, but the King is too popular and Claudius must instead frame him for plotting with a neighboring country, thus enabling his execution. Scarlet (Mana Ashida), a young princess, watches on distraught as her father's ruthless executioners seem to relish in their task. After Claudius poisons her, Scarlet begins her exile into the “Otherlands,” a sort of purgatory, where she plots her revenge alongside a horde of people who feel similarly wronged by their too-short lives.

But this is a Hosoda movie, so things will become considerably more complicated from there. Much like Mirai's acceptance that he's no longer the man of the house, Scarlet's most important journey is one of self-discovery — a quest far from the violent quest for justice undertaken by the original Prince of Denmark. But there is some of that, too. The Otherlands is a community of struggling people from all places and time periods, who can nevertheless understand each other despite their differences. Scarlet's journey through them will lead her to cross paths with a variety of characters, starting with Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a nurse from modern-day Japan who refuses to convince that he should have died. Soon thereafter, Scarlet encounters a little girl who says that if she were a princess, she would spend her life making sure the world was livable for little girls like her. It's enough for Scarlet to realize that vengeance might be a bit self-centered; there are bigger fish to fry.

The politics of the lost masses without food or a home is not far from James Gunn's “Superman”, another well-intended but fairly vague expression of struggling peoples and the evil rulers depriving them of life and dignity. Scarlet's venture is even more consciously informed by “Dune”, whose heir to the throne is radicalized to embrace the cause of his former antagonists. Hosoda's film poses a similar question to Scarlet as Frank Herbert's saga did to Paul Atreides: How much is this story all about her? Hijiri is a paragon of selflessness who teaches Scarlet that living for others is the only fulfilling way. Hijiri even questions her ruthless approach to warriors sent by her uncle to finish her off, telling Scarlet: “The ultimate warrior fires invisible arrows from an invisible bow.” That isn't really Scarlet's style, and it's probably too much to ask to put the weapons down while she's actively being hunted. But Scarlet does realize she has the power to improve the lives of all the people in the Otherlands — and perhaps even stop some of them ending up there.

 










Unfortunately, Hosoda's ideas in “Scarlet” never get more incisive or interesting than that. There's an over-sweet centre at the middle of it. Its ending is a feast of sincerity that, not just tedious in its own right, feels unrepresentative of the irreverent character with whom we've just spent two long hours. Despite bloody violence throughout, “Scarlet” lacks the edge that would make this culture clash of seminal western tale and Japanese art form as memorable or significant as it ought to be. The first few minutes of the film are a breathless, almost wordless introduction to the Otherlands, with Scarlet trapped under rotting hands clamoring to keep her there. But Hosoda's expressionism virtually disappears thereafter, and a dry sense of order exerts itself once the story is spirited back towards Elsinore.

To that end, “Scarlet” amounts to a frustrating waste of animating and directorial skill for the price of an excessively ordinary story. The sheer scale of Hosoda's success may have softened his storytelling instincts, even if the aesthetics are occasionally remarkable. Having written his past four movies alone, it may be time for Hosoda to consider collaborating once again. And maybe not with Shakespeare.

“Scarlet” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Sony will release the film in U.S. theaters on Friday, December 12.

The project has an Oct. 16, 2026 release date as Legendary inks a three-year deal with Paramount.


							By 

	Aaron Couch


Film Editor


Street Fighter — and its parent studio Legendary — have a new place to call home.


	Legendary has inked a three-year pact with Paramount to distribute its movies, with the Capcom video game adaptation Street Fighter the first out of the gate. The Kitao Sakurai-directed feature now has a release date of Oct. 16, 2026. 




	The film is currently in production, with Paramount and Legendary releasing the first plot details for the movie, which will be set in 1993, the year the popular game Street Fighter II hit arcades.

	Here's the new logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don't, it's GAME OVER!”

	










			Popular on THR		







	The Legendary deal, now official, was reported to be in talks on Aug. 18 and comes after its output deal with Sony expired at the end of 2024. Legendary's former partner Warner Bros. will continue to distribute key franchises such as the eventual sequel to the nearly $1 billion hit A Minecraft Movie, as well as 2026's third Dune and 2027's Godzilla x Kong: Supernova.

	











	The Street Fighter movie has a sprawling cast, including Noah Centineo as Ken Masters, Andrew Koji as Ryu, Callina Liang as Chun-Li, Joe “Roman Reigns” Anoa'i as Akuma, David Dastmalchian as M. Bison, Cody Rhodes as Guile, Andrew Schulz as Dan Hibiki, Eric André as Don Sauvage, Vidyut Jammwal as Dhalsim, with Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson as Balrog and Jason Momoa as Blanka.


	It also stars Orville Peck as Vega, Olivier Richters as Zangief, Hirooki Goto as E. Honda, Rayna Vallandingham as Juli, Alexander Volkanovski as Joe, Kyle Mooney as Marvin and Mel Jarnson as Cammy.


	“Legendary has built a reputation for ambitious, globally appealing films, and we're excited to be partnering with them. Street Fighter is the perfect start to our collaboration, which we believe will be strong and lasting,” said Josh Greenstein, co-chair of Paramount Pictures and vice chair of platforms, and Dana Goldberg, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Chair of Paramount Television. 


	Added Legendary CEO Josh Grode: “Partnering with David, Dana and Josh and their teams at Paramount marks an exciting new chapter for Legendary as we continue to pursue a diversified growth strategy—expanding our output, building new franchises, and creating more films for global audiences. This partnership is an extraordinary opportunity, and we look forward to working closely with Paramount on stories that will captivate and inspire moviegoers worldwide.”


	This is just one of many key early moves made by David Ellison's new Paramount, which lured Stranger Things creators the Duffer Bros. from Netflix, inked a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights, and signed Will Smith's Westbrook to a first-look film deal.

	Comedian Druski's latest sketch video only has nine words in its description: “That Guy who is just Proud to be AMERICAN.” But in the 36 hours since he posted it on social media, the video of him assuming the persona of a NASCAR fanatic — attending an actual NASCAR event complete with an American flag cowboy hat, sagging overalls, and oh, yeah, a full body race change via makeup — has already captured the internet's discourse machine. 


	The video is less than three minutes long, but manages to capture an impressive display of Druski embodying some of the funniest aspects of Southern racing culture, which includes him singing Born In The U.S.A. in a lifted truck, chugging beer after beer near a crowded race track, and being driven nearly to tears over a simple rendition of the National Anthem. There's also plenty of nods to how overwhelmingly white the sport tends to be — at one point Druski drives past a Black fan and asks if he's “lost.” It's an absolutely hysterical offering, but feels perfectly on-vibe from the comedian, who built a following with his character-driven social media sketches. Born Drew Desbordes, Druski, 30, is a long way from the kid who spent his time at the dinner table cutting up. He told Rolling Stone in 2024 that social media helped him build his comedy career because it allowed him to completely bypass gatekeepers — and find people who shared his sense of humor. “We don't need anybody to tell us we can be on that TV show, or to kiss up to somebody to try to get in that door,” he said. “I think it's just amazing that I can create my fan base.”

	











	Since Druski released his NASCAR video, it's gone viral on every social media platform it's been posted on, including Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. But it's been especially celebrated on X, where it's reached over 175 million views and is still growing. There's of course, the debate about whether a Black comedian donning makeup to appear white is racist — “whiteface is racism” arguments abound — which is to be expected on a site that's become known for a tidal wave of misinformation and misogyny, racism, and Nazi-themed content. But what's been louder is the general awe at just how perfect Druski's makeup looks — so good, in fact, that it's actually tricked some people. “Been scrolling by this not understanding why yall kept putting this white man all over my tl,” tweeted one person. “Whole time it's fucking Druski.”

	“The amazing thing about Druski's skits is not just the commitment to character but the access he somehow gets and the supporting characters that add a touch of verisimilitude,” wrote author Bolu Babalola. “A cultural historian if you will.” 


	While Druski is the mastermind behind the video, the Picasso responsible for that perfect blend of white makeup, fake tattoos, and farmer's tan is Georgia makeup artist Kaylee Kehne-Swisher, who specializes in everything from commercial touchups and makeovers to nitty gritty film special effects. She worked on Weapons, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Zombieland: Double Tap, and now, the internet comedy sketch that you've probably already watched at least three times. But what people might not know is that this isn't the first time she's worked with Druski — it's not even the first time she's used makeup to turn him white. Kehne-Swisher is also the makeup artist behind his May skit, “The white boy that's accepted by the Hood.”


	“I love these characters that Druski's coming up with,” Kehne-Swisher says. “I've always really loved [Saturday Night Live], where you can hardly tell who a person is under Clinton makeup, or White Chicks — these big makeup transformations. I've been trying to come up with more ideas for him, like ‘What can we get away with?'” 


Rolling Stone chatted with Kehne-Swisher about the process behind the now-viral video, working with Druski, and why she thinks SFX will always have a big place in art.

I'm so glad we're chatting! How long have you been doing makeup and SFX? Gosh, since 2011 now. I went to Joe Blasco, which is a makeup school in [Orlando], Florida. I've done everything from wedding makeup to these kinds of big body makeup and creature makeup and prosthetics. That's how I got wrapped in with Druski — he was looking for a big makeup [project] like this.


Had you heard of Druski before you signed on? Honestly, I hadn't. Once I heard his name and started looking his stuff up, I really liked it. But no, I'd never heard of him before that.


Tell me about how you even tackle a project like this. How much of this was your interpretation of a prompt versus entirely his idea? Well, the first time [they reached out], they were very hush hush about what it was exactly. Just that it was going to be a race change, it was the next day, and that we had to do it and let it walk away, no touch ups or anything. I knew it had to stay on a long time and be able to get on fast. But it still took about seven hours. 

	











That was for “The white boy that's accepted by the Hood,” which is another race change sketch.Yeah! It was a long process the first time because it was just me. So this time around, I was able to bring another artist on, assistant Rachel Bongard Ross, and we got the makeup down to about four hours. This time around for NASCAR, they sent me some samples of the sunburn and that mullet look and we just went from there. I had maybe four to five days to prep for it this time, which is really nice, but it was definitely a lot of work.


Walk me through the steps you have to go through in order to get a final product that, frankly, looks pretty realistic.This is something that makeup artists have to do often actually — like with stunt doubles, we have to make them match [the actor]. You have roll out their current color with a red or something close to neutralize and bring in that blood tone. Then you go over that again with different tones, and then eventually the flesh tone. From there, we add more paint on top of that, speckling and all kinds of  shimmer to make it look like more skin. For Druski, we added tattoos, and a lace mustache to him. Originally I was going to try to put a lace beard over his beard, but, with the time [crunch] we actually ended up just straightening his own board. We did have a lot of ideas at first, wanting to add things to his nose, and do a stretchy nipple and have more wrinkly eyes, but I'm actually really happy we didn't do it because I feel like you can see him in the makeup.


How do you make the sunburn and the tattoos look so realistic? It was so fun. I worked with a company called Hookup Tattoos here in Atlanta, and they make tattoos for movies and all kinds of things. Then I also found some temporary tattoos on Amazon and they came out surprisingly good. You have to put paint on top of them to make it look a little more real, but for character makeup it was perfect. 


	And we basically painted the sunburn right on. After we painted him a regular skin tone, we airbrushed the entire shirt outline on. Then with lighter tones, we went over and speckled different reds and misted other tones of red to give it some modeling. I think it works perfectly. 


One of the things that's so surprising about the video is how well the makeup wears. How do you keep so much paint intact through what was essentially a Beer Olympics? This is something I've done before with stunt actors or others in the film industry, when they have to be in water. It's a concoction of a lot of different makeup products called Jordiane, and then a makeup gel, and then a strong pigmented alcohol-based paint. A ton of things mixed together really blocks everything out and helps you get a blank canvas. And from there you can bring whatever tone you want, use a pink or an undertone of blue depending on what you want to achieve. It's basically a lot of color theory.

If it takes that much to put it on and get it to stay, what's the removal process like? It's another mixture of things [laugh]. We use a silicone oil and that helps kind of break down those different layers of paint. Then an alcohol based remover, and that kind of helps get that alcohol based paint off. It's very oily. It's a lot of rubbing and wiping and rubbing and wiping. 


You've been a makeup artist for a long time. What do you think makeup's place is in the art and film world, especially at a time when productions are dominated by a ton of technological advancements and VFX?I actually was on Weapons, which is a movie that came out recently. Gladys was me! But that was a huge thing using practical effects because a lot of films now are using CGI and AI. I think that it makes it a little bit more special when you do things practically, because it is becoming so much more of a norm just, you know, making it in a program and not having to do it for real. A blend of CGI and makeup together are perfect. But when you do effects completely in digital, it takes the artistry away from it. So finding people that are willing to keep doing things practically, and instructors that want to keep doing that, people like Druski, who want to make these big characters — it's really, really cool.

EXCLUSIVE: In a multi-studio bidding war, Columbia Pictures has paid mid six-figures for the rights to Jonathan Marty's short story The Earthling. Final Destination: Bloodlines helmers Zach Lipovsky & Adam Stein are attached to direct. Eric Heisserer's Chronology and Scott Glassgold's 1201 Films are producing.


	Directing duo's Final Destination: Bloodlines not only ruined the appeal of landscaping with a self-propelled mower, it turned in a $300 million worldwide gross for New Line. Stein & Lipovksy are circling a handful of high-profile projects, so add The Earthling to the pile. The duo is set to be exec producers on The Earthling, as well. Carmen Lewis will also produce on behalf of Chronology.

	Marty's short story attracted a handful of A-list packages around town. The survival sci-fi story has shades of The Martian and Edge of Tomorrow. Heisserer brought The Earthling into Sony through his first look deal there, and has some elevated sci-fi in his background, adapting the Ted Chiang short story, Stories of Your Life into the Denis Villenueve-directed Arrival.

	Marty has made a name for himself in the television space having sold a handful of shows including Splash Damage to Warner Bros. and the one-hour drama AI to the CW.


	The deal marks the seventh short story sale of the year for Glassgold and Verve, who in May sold Drift to Skydance, the Dwayne Johnson-attached Ripped to 20th Century, The Caretaker at Universal with Sydney Sweeney, The Dwelling at Amazon MGM with Michael B Jordan and Occupant at New Line with Zach Cregger producing.

	











	Verve repped Lipovksy & Stein, Marty and 1201 Films; Lipovsky & Stein are also represented by Ground Control and Jamie Feldman. Marty and 1201 are also represented by Jeff Frankel. Chronology is represented by CAA.

With the amount of money they waste on this crap, they could literally finance like 10 more movies a year. Insane. 

I hate to say that the industry contraction is of their own doing.

Pink never looked cooler than when Jason Momoa stepped onto the Venice red carpet. The “Aquaman” star, 46, stole the spotlight at the Venice Film Festival on Wednesday, September 3, when he arrived for the premiere of “In the Hand of Dante”. 

Momoa stepped out in a blush pink suit that wowed onlookers and stole the spotlight.

Known for his bold fashion choices, the actor hit the red carpet with effortless confidence. 

Wearing his long curls loose and accessorizing with sleek black sunglasses, Momoa struck a balance of playful charm and refined style at the star-studded premiere.

It was the details that made the look stand out. Momoa paired his suit with light pink fuzzy Birkenstock Arizona sandals from the brand's 2023 collaboration with Concepts and painted his toenails to match.

He even leaned toward the cameras at one point, striking playful poses to show off the coordinated look.

This isn't the first time Momoa has turned pink on the red carpet. At the 2019 Oscars, he wore a velvet Fendi tuxedo with a matching pink scrunchie on his wrist. He later told InStyle in 2020, “Pink is just a beautiful color. And I'm pretty secure in my masculinity. I don't really give a s—t what anyone thinks.”

Momoa has also shown affection for Birkenstocks over the years. In March, he sported another pink pair while promoting A Minecraft Movie in Mexico.

The Venice appearance comes during a busy chapter for Momoa. In July, he made headlines after shaving off his signature facial hair for “Dune: Part Three”, joking on Instagram: “Haven't shaved in six years, and here we are again. Goddamn it, I hate it!”

Off-screen, the Hawaiian-born star has also been making waves in his personal life. He is currently dating actress Adria Arjona, 33, with the pair making their red-carpet debut earlier this year at the SNL 50 concert in New York City, following his divorce from Lisa Bonet.

From scrunchies to sandals, Momoa continues to prove that true style is about owning every detail — right down to the color of your toenails.

The co-head of digital will run the new division, titled Awareness Creation, focused on targeting younger audiences for clients that include studios (Warner Bros.) and brands (Applebee's).


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	As the attentions of the younger and chronically online become harder to pin down, Range Media Partners has announced a new division, Awareness Creation, meant to target younger audiences for clients that run the gamut from entertainment to sports to brands.


	The division is led by Kai Gayoso, co-head of Digital at Range, whose clients include Brooklyn Beckham and streamer Valkyrae. The company says that Gayoso leverages his experience working in the creator economy to help Awareness Creation clients like Warner Bros and Applebee's navigate the ever-changing social platforms to launch marketing campaigns and new projects, with a focus on virality.

	“Today's consumers are more aware of media as a whole, not just the projects themselves but the PR, marketing, and messaging around them, and Range Awareness Creation caters to this new set of media-literate audiences,” says Gayoso in a statement. 


	Awareness Creation has worked with Apple TV+, Formula E and Neon, as well as Range clients like Ed Berger on his last theatrical release, Conclave. (Awareness Creation sits apart from Range's Social Marketing+ division, now called Built for Digital, which is headed by Melissa Mondello and Allegra Salke-Hussey.)


	“I worked with Range Awareness Creation multiple times in the last year to augment when I saw an opportunity with specific peripheral audiences that existed outside of our core,” said Christian Parkes, CMO at Neon. Awareness Creation worked with the Oscar-winning outfit on genre offerings Immaculate and Longlegs. Says Parkes, “They're great for testing themes/concepts that live outside the core campaign but have the opportunity to explode virally.”

	











	Peter Micelli, CEO of Range, offered, “By guiding the conversation, Awareness Creation provides the solution for bridging this gap between audiences and our clients' projects and products. It reaches and activates consumers, where they are and with the messaging they respond to, in order to drive engagement and viewership, transactions and sales, and reach all other key business goals. Through this offering, we are singularly focused on delivering best-case results by engineering outcomes that are beneficial for all.” 


	Gayoso adds, “Our ‘Momentum Management' strategies don't just make audiences aware of these projects, they generate real appetite to go and partake in these cultural events.”

The macabre, medieval-set feature, now shooting in Prague, follows a knight who marries his devoted love after murdering her father — only to betray her for a wealthier bride.


							By 

	Lily Ford



The Hollywood Reporter can unveil a first-look image of Anna Biller's The Face of Horror, set in the plague-haunted medieval era.


Jonah Hauer-King (The Little Mermaid, I Know What You Did Last Summer), Kristine Froseth (The Buccaneers), Ellie Bamber (William Tell), Bella Heathcote (Pieces of Her, Relic), Leo Suter (Vikings: Valhalla, Lynley) and Ben Radcliffe (Masters of the Air) star in Biller's new film, now shooting in Prague. The American filmmaker is best known for 2007's Viva and 2016's The Love Witch.




The Face of Horror is based on the most famous Japanese ghost story of all time, Yotsuya Kaidan. It follows knight Edward Carnifex (Hauer-King), who marries his devoted love Eleanor (Froseth) after murdering her father — only to betray her for a wealthier bride (Heathcote). And it is only a matter of time before Eleanor will be forced to take a bloody revenge…

	Bamber plays Eleanor's sister Beatrice and Suter stars as Edward's squire and Beatrice's suitor, Richard. Radcliffe is Roger, the ill-fated tailor drawn into Edward's web of deception. Embankment Films released a still from the movie on Thursday, showing Hauer-King as Edward stood behind Froseth's Eleanor.


	The film is produced by Biller, with Mike Goodridge and James Bowsher for Good Chaos. The company's upcoming slate includes Edward Berger's Ballad for a Small Player (coming to Netflix later this year) and László Nemes's Orphan, in competition at Venice.


	Jared Sanford is executive producing and Sirena Films is servicing the production in the Czech Republic. Other executive producers are Phil Hunt for Head Gear Films and Compton Ross for Metrol Technology.

	











	“The Love Witch established Anna as a singular voice in genre cinema — a cult classic that resonated with cinephiles and horror fans worldwide, which has had a long life on multiple platforms,” said Goodridge. “She has followed this up with a bigger, bolder, even more ferociously entertaining film designed for the big screen: laced with sly humour, unapologetically bloody, and rendered in her signature technicolour style. A medieval nightmare with bite — this is the kind of fresh storytelling that current audiences demand.”


	Embankment handles worldwide sales and co-represents U.S. rights with WME Independent.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed today that mRNA vaccines kill people during a tense Senate hearing. The most common Covid-19 jabs, such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna, are mRNA vaccines.


	Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) asked Kennedy, Donald Trump's top health regulator, about his firing of every member of the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with his own picks. 


	“Are you aware that … one of these new members, Dr. [Retsef] Levy, wrote that ‘evidence is mounting and indisputable that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death, especially among young people,'” Bennet said. “Yes or no, are you aware that he said that?”


	“I wasn't aware. I agree with it,” responded Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaxxer.


	Levi is a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former intelligence official for the Israeli military. He does not have a medical background, and there is a petition calling for his firing.  

	











	In January 2023, Levi posted on X that mRNA vaccines cause harm: “The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!”


	Kennedy's speech was raspy and labored throughout the Senate Finance Committee hearing, with viewers noting that heavy breathing, which almost sounded like snoring, could be heard over the microphone. 

	











RFK Jr. frequently sparred with Democratic senators, and he was also testy with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician who cast a key vote to confirm him to lead the Health and Human Services Department (HHS). 


	“You just told Sen. Bennet that the Covid vaccine killed more people than Covid,” Cassidy said.


	“I did not say that,” Kennedy insisted.


	Cassidy noted that patients are having trouble getting Covid vaccines, now that the Food and Drug Administration — which is part of HHS — has limited access to annual booster shots to people over the age of 65 or those with certain medical conditions.

	“I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines,” Cassidy said. 


	“You're wrong,” Kennedy responded.


	Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) asked if Kennedy accepted the statistic that a million Americans have died from Covid. The United States reached that mark in May 2022, according to data from John Hopkins University.


	“I don't know how many died,” Kennedy said, before attempting to blame the CDC. “It was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC.”


	Merkley seemed stunned. He asked Kennedy if he believes “the vaccine did anything to prevent additional deaths.”

	“I would like to see the data and talk about the data,” Kennedy replied.


	“The secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from Covid, know if the vaccine helped prevent any deaths, and you are sitting as secretary of Health and Human Services?” Merkley said, before pleading: “How can you be that ignorant?”

When the Academy Museum first opened in September 2021, one of its most popular (and largest) artifacts was the sole surviving full scale model of the shark from Steven Spielberg‘s “Jaws,” lovingly restored by special effects master Greg Nicotero. Four years later, the museum is coming full circle with “Jaws: The Exhibition,” a massive undertaking that opens to the public on September 14 and provides an unprecedented opportunity for a deep dive into every aspect of the creation, reception, and legacy of Spielberg's masterpiece.

“Our goal in the exhibition space is to parallel the sense of joy, revelation, and discovery that is spurred by the cinema space,” senior exhibitions curator Jenny He told IndieWire. “Whether you've seen ‘Jaws' more times than you can count, or if you've never watched the film, this exhibition aims to recollect the movie experience. Visitors can find their favorite ‘Jaws' moments or discover this classic film for the first time.” The exhibition marks the first time the museum's largest space has ever been devoted to a single movie, though it's indicative of the film's expansiveness and importance that He still felt the biggest challenge was figuring out what was essential and what could be omitted.

“Since exhibitions are a form of spatial storytelling, the challenge in any exhibition is space limitations,” He said, “but it is even more pronounced with ‘Jaws.' Every frame of this near-perfect film can be analyzed and explored.” The intention behind the exhibit is to take viewers through “Jaws” scene-by-scene through original production artworks and objects, interactive moments, and immersive re-creations, all utilizing many works that have never been made available for public viewing.

 










Among these are original concept illustrations by production designer Joe Alves, the Panavision underwater camera used for the film, behind-the-scenes photographs captured by boom operator Frank Meadows, and Quint's sport-fishing fighting chair from the Orca boat. Most importantly, the museum had access to Spielberg's personal collection, which “led to insightful confirmations of his imprint on every aspect of the film's production,” according to He. Spielberg's sketches and notes will be on display alongside objects sourced from private collectors, many of which give a sense of the marketing blitz that accompanied “Jaws” upon its release and afterwards.

“We will have on view a large display of vintage merchandise, which assistant curator Emily Rauber Rodriguez has meticulously sourced from two in-depth collections of ‘Jaws' memorabilia,” He said, noting that other artifacts required a bit of detective work. “Through a persistent search, curatorial assistant Alexandra James Salichs has located film editor Verna Fields's Academy Award for ‘Jaws,' which had several owners after Fields's passing.”

One of the most innovative aspects of “Jaws: The Exhibition” is its immersive quality, as the Academy Museum has found ways of placing visitors in the shoes of the film's characters and filmmakers. “Visitors can create their own dolly zoom shot, a cinematography technique conceived by director Alfred Hitchcock and executed by second-unit cameraman Irmin Roberts for Vertigo (1958),” He said. “Steven Spielberg and director of photography Bill Butler adapted the dolly zoom for ‘Jaws' to perfectly telegraph police chief Martin Brody's dread.” 

 










Another activation enables visitors to play composer John Williams's famous two-note theme that signals the shark's approach. “We will also have a scale replica of the mechanical shark, built by KNB EFX co-founders Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger,” He said. “Visitors can become a part of the ‘Jaws' special effects team and move the shark themselves!” In another instance, the museum spotlights a story about an unplanned sinking of the Orca, when a production boat that was pulling the onscreen boat went too fast and yanked out the Orca's planking. 

As He explains, “Steven Spielberg recalled, ‘I have this image to this day of [production sound mixer] John [Carter] sinking holding his recorder. Months later, he was holding an Oscar in those hands!' This story will be told via a re-creation of the Orca out on an ‘open sea' immersive environment.” Another famous tale from “Jaws” relating to a reshoot in Verna Fields' pool that yielded the film's biggest jump scare is related to exhibit visitors in a “pool” environment, with the idea being, as He puts it, to “make the production history tangible.”

Film excerpts from “Jaws” will be shown throughout the exhibition, in creative viewing spaces are motivated by the film's production design. “Visitors can step inside a cabana to watch a beach scene. and sit inside the Orca's cabin for Quint's USS Indianapolis monologue,” He said, noting that curating the exhibition has deepened her admiration for a movie, and a filmmaker, she already loved. 

 










“I've always been an incredible fan of ‘Jaws' and the work of Steven Spielberg,” He said. “As the first modern summer blockbuster, ‘Jaws' changed not only the film industry's release strategies, it also altered the expectations of audiences. The summer became the time to see the films that everyone is going to be talking about, capturing the attention of film enthusiasts and casual moviegoers alike. 50 years later, this template remains in place.”

Given the movie's 50th anniversary this year, honoring it at the Academy Museum was a no-brainer for He and her colleagues. “Its significance has stood the test of time,” He said. “I've attended numerous ‘Jaws' screenings over the years, including several anniversary screenings this year. The theaters were always packed and sold out.” Now, He hopes the museum's exhibition will encourage both a deeper and broader understanding of a movie that nearly everyone who loves movies adores. “We're excited to present ‘Jaws' like never before.”

“Jaws: The Exhibition” runs at the Academy Museum from September 14, 2025 to July 26, 2026.

	“I'm a student of hooks,” the exceedingly prolific Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard tells Rolling Stone. If you're familiar with GBV's 40-plus-album catalog, that's an understatement. “That perfect combination of a lyric and a chord pattern that gives you that chill up the back of your spine.”


	The band nails that combo with their new single “(You Can't Go Back to) Oxford Talawanda.” It's the first track off of Thick, Rich and Delicious, their second album of 2025. The LP arrives on Halloween, which is also Pollard's 68th birthday.

	According to Pollard, the new single includes a hook he's been singing his whole life, but had yet to find a home for. A straight-ahead rocker mysteriously named after an Ohio high school, the track is a worthy inclusion to the band's 30-plus-song set list: sing-along heavy and driving. It's part of a suite of new songs — as well as older tracks culled from previous sessions — that the band recorded at a Brooklyn studio in an effort to capture the feel of their live shows.

	











Thick, Rich and Delicious follows February's Universe Room, of which Pollard told Rolling Stone: “I wanted to create, hopefully, an experience, kind of a wild ride, where the listener would want to hear it multiple times in order to grasp all the sections and fields of sound to discover something new with each listen.” Both albums were produced by Travis Harrison.

The project comes just a couple of months after the pop star's first Swag.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	It looks like Justin Bieber isn't turning his swag off just yet. 


	On Thursday (Sept. 4), the pop star announced that a sequel to his July Swag album is arriving at midnight Friday (Sept. 5), posting multiple photos to Instagram of new electronic billboards that have gone up in different cities. With pink backgrounds, the advertisements simply read, “Swag II.”


	In his captions, Bieber wrote, “SWAG II midnight tonight” and “Midnight tonight.”

	











	The news comes after Billboard previously reported that Bieber had more music in store for fans after Swag, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 after the Grammy winner dropped it earlier this summer. While Swag was distinctly R&B-focused — peaking at No. 1 on the Top R&B Albums chart — Swag II will be more pop-inspired, sources indicated at the time.




			Trending on Billboard		







	With the first Swag arriving a little over a month ahead of the 2026 Grammy eligibility window closing on Aug. 30, the runway is also clear for Swag II to score nods at the 2027 awards — meaning Bieber would avoid competing against himself in any categories next year.


	Bieber's sudden announcement marks the second time this year he's unveiled an album with hardly any warning. Fans also only knew that the first Swag was coming just a few hours ahead of time, with the star planting black-and-white billboards displaying album visuals and the tracklist in New York City just before the LP's release.


	In the months since, Bieber has stayed busy by releasing music videos for tracks on Swag, including Billboard Hot 100 hits “Daisies” and “First Place.” The latter showed the hitmaker working on music at Floki Studios in Iceland, where he recorded Swag (and possibly Swag II).

	











	He's also been sharing photos of himself in the studio in recent weeks, possibly hinting to fans that Swag wasn't the last they'd be hearing from him any time soon. Beliebers are sure to welcome the high volume of new music he's been creating, as they'd previously had to wait four years for a new album after 2021's Justice.

Fans learned which celebrities would be competing on season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars” on September 3. Naturally, the network also revealed which professional dancers they'd be dancing with. Now, host Alfonso Ribeiro says the DWTS pairings were different weeks before the announcement. 

Ribeiro spoke to US Weekly about how the pairings usually work. He said, “Typically, once we have a list of the pros that are gonna be on, we then, at some point, we'll get the opportunity to hear who's gonna be [on the show]. But it's never final, right?”

He went on, “It's ever-changing, and there were some pairings that were different three weeks ago.” Ribeiro continued, “Things continue to evolve as new people come in, and you realize, ‘Oh, actually, this is a better pairing than that pairing.' And they work on it right up until the final day until [the stars and pros] meet each other.”

He also stated that the show's executives “always get it right” regarding pairing celebrities with pros on “Dancing With the Stars.” According to him, “They figure it out. I don't know how they do it, but they always figure out how to put the right people together.” The beloved actor added, “They're magical.”

Elsewhere in the US Weekly interview, Ribeiro teased season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars.” He said, “I knew it was going to be a great season. I mean, it's really incredible, the amount of incredible personalities. We haven't seen this yet, but great dancing, great stories to tell [and] nostalgia. There's a lot of everything coming.”

Ribeiro continued, “You've got so many great people from different generations coming together, and … everyone's getting along, everyone's having a great time. I think it's gonna be an incredible season.” He also opened up about rehearsals. 

According to him, “They're just getting started. I've heard some things [and] there's gonna be some fun stuff.”

Fans don't have long to wait for the premiere of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34. According to ABC News, the show is set to premiere on September 16. It airs on ABC and is also available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu. 

This season of DWTS includes 14 celebrities. Some of them are Corey Feldman, Danielle Fishel, Dylan Efron, and Hilaria Baldwin. Julianne Hough also hosts the show in addition to Ribeiro.

Say what you will about Ryan Murphy's real-life murderer anthology, but at least he's settled on less cumbersome titles. Monster: The Ed Gein Story rolls off the tongue a lot easier than Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Yes, the series seems to have found its groove, so what better time to approach a figure Netflix describes as “history's most singular ghoul?” It's Charlie Hunnam's turn to be monstrous when the new season premieres October 3, and based on the trailer, he's up to the task.

“Serial killer. Grave robber. Psycho. In the frozen fields of 1950s rural Wisconsin, a friendly, mild-mannered recluse named Eddie Gein lived quietly on a decaying farm—hiding a house of horrors so gruesome it would redefine the American nightmare,” reads the synopsis for the series. “Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. From Psycho to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to The Silence of the Lambs, Gein's macabre legacy gave birth to fictional monsters born in his image and ignited a cultural obsession with the criminally deviant. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre—he became the blueprint for modern horror.”

﻿

Monster: The Ed Gein Story features a handful of Murphy alumni, as Murphy shows are wont to do; that includes Tom Hollander (Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans), Charlie Hall (Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story) and Lesley Manville (Grotesquerie). Some esteemed newcomers to Murphy's sandbox include Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf as Ed's mother Augusta Gein and Vicky Krieps as Ilse Koch. But once you're in the Murphy cinematic universe, you're in for life (well, except maybe Patti Lupone). Krieps has signed on to appear in the next season of Monster about Lizzie Borden, and it was reported this week Hunnam is in talks to play Borden's father. From killer to victim in just two seasons—now that's range.

Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Drake and Morgan Wallen are among the brightest summer stars.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Mariah Carey is Christmas royalty, per her performance on Billboard's holiday charts with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” But the bounds of her reach know no seasons.


	She's also among the top-charting acts in the history of Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart.


	As previously reported, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” reigns as the No. 1 hit on the season-ending 2025 Songs of the Summer survey. The running tally tracks the most popular titles based on cumulative performance on the weekly streaming-, airplay- and sales-based Billboard Hot 100 chart each year from Memorial Day through Labor Day.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Below “Ordinary,” Morgan Wallen boasts the Nos. 2, 3 and 4 songs for summer 2025: “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, “Just in Case” and “I'm the Problem,” respectively. He is the first artist with three top five entries on a season-closing Songs of the Summer chart.




	In Billboard's analysis of this year's tally, staff asked: “Is Wallen now the 2020s' unquestioned summertime king?” According to the numbers, and only halfway through the decade, he is clearly in the running to don the crown.


	But which artists have had the most success on Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart, dating to the Hot 100's launch in the summer of 1958?


	Below is a look at the acts with the most season-ending Songs of the Summer No. 1s and top 10s, as well as the one name with two summer coronations in the ‘20s and the artists with the most top 10 finishes so far this decade.


	Six elite artists, including Carey and Wallen, have each achieved No. 1 songs of the summer as many as two times. Here's a rundown:


Rihanna rules with 10 songs that have made the top 10 on season-ending Songs of the Summer charts.


	Her hottest summer hits: “Pon De Replay” (No. 4, 2005); “Unfaithful” (No. 8, 2006); “Umbrella,” featuring Jay-Z (No. 1, 2007); “Take a Bow” (No. 2, 2008); “Disturbia” (No. 8, 2008); Eminem's “Love the Way You Lie,” featuring Rihanna (No. 2, 2010); “Where Have You Been” (No. 6, 2012); Calvin Harris' “This Is What You Came For,” featuring Rihanna (No. 5, 2016); “Needed Me” (No. 7, 2016); and DJ Khaled's “Wild Thoughts,” featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller (No. 4, 2017).


	Here's a look at the acts with the most songs that finished in the top 10 on Songs of the Summer charts:

	











	As noted above, Wallen is the only artist with multiple season-ending Songs of the Summer No. 1s this decade, dominating with “Last Night” in 2023 and as featured on Post Malone's “I Had Some Help” in 2024.


	Wallen has also earned the most top 10s — five — on the Songs of the Summer chart this decade, thanks to his two No. 1s in 2023 and 2024 and his three top five hits this year.


	Harry Styles and SZA have each reached Labor Day with four entries in the Songs of the Summer top 10 in the ‘20s. Styles scored with “Watermelon Sugar” (No. 6) and “Adore You” (No. 10) in 2020 and “As It Was” (No. 1) and “Late Night Talking” (No. 9) in 2022. SZA placed in the top 10 as featured on Doja Cat's “Kiss Me More” (No. 4, 2021), with her own “Snooze” (No. 8) and “Kill Bill” (No. 9) in 2023 and with Kendrick Lamar on “Luther” (No. 5, 2025).


	Plus, Sabrina Carpenter has collected three Songs of the Summer top 10s this decade, all since last year: “Espresso” was No. 4 and “Please Please Please,” No. 6, in 2024 and “Manchild” rode to No. 9 this summer.

Late one night, Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) is out with his friends, laughing. There's an anxious tremor echoing through the car — Cliff (Raúl Castillo), sitting shotgun, can't hide his nerves — but it only elicits more chuckles from the driver, who's all but perfected the practice of self-serenity. His chosen music carries a soothing pulse and leisurely lyrics, and when Peach Boy (Owen Teague) questions the vibe, Robbie calmly explains, “Transportative [sic], isn't it? Takes you away from your reality, puts you in another.”

Robbie invites Peach Boy to close his eyes and imagine white sandy beaches, a big blue ocean, and beautiful women asking to dance with him. As Peach Boy sways sensually in the backseat, Robbie reaches his point: “Everyone's fucking happy as shit on that beach,” he says. “You don't got a care in the world.” Then, as Peach Boy's dreamy dancing gets a little more graphic, the men laugh and ride deeper into the night.

Circumstances aside, it's easy to believe everyone in that car, at that moment, is happy as shit, too; that these are the good times they should be savoring, rather than the reality they feel the need to escape. But the conditions eliciting stress aren't so easily tossed out, nor could they be for this specific crew on this specific evening. Robbie and the boys are on their way to a trap house, which they plan to loot, quickly and cleanly, as they have a half-dozen times before. The stolen cash won't go toward buying their own island, like Robbie and Cliff joked about earlier — there isn't enough for that. Instead, the blood money will be repurposed toward something if not good, then necessary: their families, their futures, their personal slice of paradise. 

 










“Task,” from “Mare of Easttown” creator Brad Ingelsby, is “transportative,” too. Robbie's practical version of that blissful beach is a remote quarry near his rural home. But over the years, his halcyon memories of swimming there with family and friends have darkened to a cold, isolated present. “Task” is so ingrained in the arduous lives of its dueling leads — Robbie and Tom (Mark Ruffalo), the FBI agent assigned to catch him — that it's able to simultaneously sweep us away to another place and level us with its wrenching reality. Casually shedding the clichés it's built upon, HBO‘s crime saga mounts a potent blend of cat-and-mouse chase, bleak family drama, and a character study of quite a few characters under extreme emotional duress. The laughs may be hard to come by, but the emphasis on caring — not as a burden to escape, but a responsibility to embrace — more than makes up for the hardships along the way.

That's life, isn't it? A good one can find compassion even where it appears there's none to be found.

When the seven-part series starts, Tom is reeling from the recent death of his wife, Susan (Mireille Enos) and the ongoing incarceration of his son, Ethan (Andrew Russel). Mourning the woman who lured him out of the priesthood and torn over what to do for his youngest child as he awaits sentencing, Tom can't even find solace in God. He prays most mornings — before dunking his head in an ice bath to shock himself back to an agonizing existence — but there's no response. “I'm lost,” he bluntly, honestly, tells his teenage daughter, Emily (Silvia Dionicio), as Ruffalo's soulful eyes convey his heartbroken truth.

 










Tom's self-aware suffering is one of many subtle ways “Task” defies convention. This isn't a man in denial. He doesn't need a gruff talking-to from his partner, nor is there a case he can crack to make everything at home OK again. His unimaginable situation leaves him with no obvious path forward — a purposeful choice by Ingelsby for a character who's literally trained in trauma recovery. (Tom got started with the FBI when they asked him to counsel victims at disaster sites.) Now, he's trying to use the tools that have always helped before, and they're not working. He's not only lost, but abandoned and hopeless.

Robbie isn't faring much better. His brother was killed a few months back, and while his wife didn't die, she's still gone —  having walked out on him and their two kids when times got hard. Now, Robbie is the only adult responsible for three minors, although his niece, Maeve (Emilia Jones), is handling most of the childcare. She cooks (enduring the complaints of her picky younger nephew), cleans (looking after the rural home, including a chicken coop out back), and works part-time at an arcade (with the one friend she has time to see).

Robbie tries to be appreciative of the young matriarch's sacrifices. His love for his kids comes through in the easy-breezy demeanor he brings home from his day shift picking up trash, buoyantly bouncing through a busy home to play with his son and charm his daughter. (The light Pelphrey infuses into Robbie is a brilliant, devastating choice, especially when cast so starkly against Ruffalo's hopelessness.) But his night job — stealing stacks of cash from drug dens — leaves a darker mark, no matter how well he composes himself before each raid, and his past damage paired with mounting responsibilities and a dangerous side-hustles leaves him just as wayward as Tom.

 










Maeve is practically a third lead (giving “CODA” star Jones her belated “Winter's Bone” moment), and her wise-beyond-her-years perspective doubles as a check on Robbie's recklessness and a reminder of how much familial responsibility is traditionally thrust upon women. Robbie can only chase down his own dreams (and demons) because Maeve's at home with the kids, doing the domestic and emotional labor by keeping him updated on their lives, maintaining relationships that don't even involve her. She's a hero in her own right, and “Task” rightly portrays her as such.

Similarly, Tom can only chase down Robbie and his team with the help of colleagues who are mostly women. In addition to his boss, Tom's task force consists of Grasso (Fabien Frankel), an affable bro and lapsed Catholic who still wears a cross around his neck; Lizzie (Alison Oliver), a green local cop who's easily startled; and Aleah (Thuso Mbedu), a smart, experienced, sharpshooter who's basically everything Lizzie is not. Yet it's the two women who form real bonds — with each other and the rest of the team — while Tom and Grasso tend to do their own thing (when they're not throwing shade at the religion that failed them). Oliver and Mbedu, both excellent in their own breakthrough roles (“Conversations with Friends” and “The Underground Railroad,” respectively), are impressive again here.

 










Enriched by regular moments of grace, “Task” still moves at an engrossing, steady pace. Ingelsby preserves the thrills of a relentless investigation while foregrounding his ensemble's relatable — often painfully so — experiences with guilt and forgiveness. Action is steadily interspersed throughout, including multiple tense chases scenes and a heart-in-your-throat shootout. Mysteries aren't the focus, but there are lingering questions that pop up and pay off in timely fashion. Each character's overall arc is satisfying, with a few minor hiccups (but with immense credit to casting director Avy Kaufman), and the story is balanced in a way that should reward weekly viewing.

Still, it's the way that Ingelsby interrogates the building blocks of a good life that hits the hardest. Tom and Robbie have been dealt bad hands. There's nothing they could have done to prevent their present circumstances (or, at least, nothing alluded to by the show), but what they do next not only drastically impacts their own quality of life but also their families'. What do we owe our loved ones? What do we owe the next generation? What do we owe ourselves? Ingelsby weighs these choices against each other without getting preachy or searching for answers that aren't there. Instead, he leads with compassion for all his characters (well, almost all of them), and that appreciation, under such dire constraints, leaves no excuse for forgetting to lead with empathy ourselves, amid comparably better days.

 










Watching “Task” may bring to mind Michael Mann's “Heat” and Ben Affleck's “The Town,” or Bruce Springsteen's “The River” and Ruffalo's last HBO series, “I Know This Much Is True” — movies, songs, and shows that run bone-deep in their recognition of the distinctions that make us unique, the commonalities that connect us to each other, and the hands of fate that too often make you wonder what could've been. Such comparisons aren't a slight, just as “Task” doesn't suffer for its similarities to other shows. (The DelCo accents are bound to get a ton of press, but I barely heard them by the finale.) Great stories can take us away from one reality and immerse us in another, or they can heighten reality to such a degree it's all you can see. What matters is that, either way, they resonate so strongly you can't help but give a shit. 

On this ride, the tears are just as valuable as the laughter.

“Task” premieres Sunday, September 7 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.

Kneecap will livestream a concert from a secret location in Ireland on Friday, October 10, as a sort of makeup show for their recently canceled U.S. tour. As well as broadcasting online from 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (at this link), the stream will play at a ticketed showing at Kings Theatre, in Brooklyn, New York, that night.

This week, Kneecap released “Sayōnara,” a new collaboration with Orbital's Paul Hartnoll, with a video starring Derry Girls actor Jamie Lee O'Donnell. Its release followed the cancellation of their sold-out, 15-date tour of the United States, apparently due to Mo Chara's forthcoming court appearance in London on a strongly disputed terror charge. Kneecap's four Canadian shows are set to go ahead, as are their European dates.

Normani is the star of the 2025 NFL Kickoff commercial. The singer put a spin on Quad City DJ's 1996 hit “C'mon N' Ride It (The Train),” this time branding it as “C'mon Ride the Float” to soundtrack the legions of football fans ready to cheer their favorite team to victory.


	A few fans and familiar faces, including social media stars Druski and the Rizzler, make appearances in the commercial. “I'm on a dolphin, not the float,” Druski semi-raps before yelling cut. “Guys, my legs are chaffing. I need some baby powder, seriously.” In a statement, he shared, “I've always been an NFL fan, so getting the chance to be part of this season's Kickoff campaign was a no-brainer.” 


	The Rizzler jumps in on behalf of the New York Giants, declaring, “Giant-sized hopes, you can't handle the rizz.” Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts makes a cameo, as well, but Normani is rooting for another Pennsylvania team. The singer sports a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey in the commercial. Earlier this year, she announced her engagement to their wide receiver DK Metcalf. 

	











	“Being part of the NFL Kickoff commercial is such a monumental and personal moment for me,” Normani shared in a statement. “I cannot remember a time when football was not a huge part of my household growing up, so now that I'm part of an NFL campaign, it means the world to my family.”

Tate McRae was born in the pop summer of 2003, the summer that climaxed in the legendary kiss between Britney and Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards. Tate could have been the baby born from that kiss, because she does their legacy proud. The Canadian star brought her Miss Possessive tour to New York's Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, for a manic pop-glitz spectacle. Everything about her show is louder-louder, faster-faster, more-more-more, especially Tate herself.


	We're living in a golden age for main pop girls, but Tate stands out by going for the classic Britney/Xtina vibe of the early 2000s, with power-disco energy and sex in the air. Not the dewy-eyed woe-is-me sensitive type, this one. She's trouble. She did not come here to read you her damn poetry. She radiates total “lock up your sons” energy onstage, even in her ballads, but any time she slows down to catch a feeling, you can count the seconds until she crushes it under her stiletto.


	So the Tate show is definitely not a place you go to feel your feelings and sing along and cry and hug it out and drunk-text your exes. It's where you go when your goal is feeling yourself a fraction as hard as Tate does — and that's a mighty high bar.

	Last night she did most of her new album So Close To What, with a handful of earlier hits. But she kept grinding and writhing through it all, for a delightfully rowdy NYC crowd rocking enough leopardskin to populate a rainforest. “It's so crazy for me to be playing Madison Square Garden again!,” she told the audience. “It's one of those arenas that feels like a fever dream every time you play it. It's just fucking crazy.”

	











	Swedish opener Zara Larsson hyped up the room with an ace set of hits like “Crush,” from her upcoming Midnight Sun, honoring her roots with Britney's “Gimme More.” Opening-act innovation, Part 1: she had the video screens displaying her name at all times, in case she worried about anyone not knowing who she was. (It also displayed a QR code, which looked way too downmarket for this stage.) Opening-act innovation, Part 2: in her last song, “Symphony,” she slammed it home with, “We have one more chorus left! One more chorus! Sixty seconds to go!” More people should do that.

	Tate took the stage to “Miss Possessive,” after an overlong delay. (Basic pop-star rule: you do not want your crowd doing the wave to amuse themselves before your set.) But what an entrance. First, there was a clip of Tate backstage, watching video monitors of crowd footage, in her underwear. Then her posse of beefcake dancing studs strutted out, in their billowing button-free shirts, striking a classic sensitive boy-band pose — it was like a Dru Hill reunion gig in here. Their tops and Tate's hair fluttered in the breeze of a wind machine absurdly cranked up to Stage 4 hurricane levels. But if you bet the over/under on how long the boys' shirts would stay on, you probably lost, because they somehow survived all the way to the third song.


	Tate made her name as a dancer, competing on So You Think You Can Dance, and she's got that energy down to her bones. She kept busting her eroto-acrobatic moves all night. Her band consisted of a drummer and a guitarist, which looked weird considering the synth-disco sounds, but they bravely held their ground. For her excellent “Purple Lace Bra,” she sat alone in a chair, while everyone else onstage was half of a lap dance.


	“I can show you better than I can tell you,” her voice-over narration purred on the speakers, as Tate crawled her methodical way down the catwalk toward her rendezvous with destiny, which turned out to be a stripper pole. She worked it out for “Uh Oh,” “Dear God,” and her most underrated tune, “Siren Sounds.” At the end, her guitarist ventured down the catwalk to play an awesomely Eighties cheese-metal solo that was like Nuno Bettencourt's eyelashes making sweet love to Neal Schon's back hair.

	She did an interlude focusing on the Softer Side of Tate, changing into a sheer gown for ballads like “Greenlight” and “Nostalgia.” “I just turned 22 this year,” she explained. “I feel like I was just thinking so much about time. Nostalgia is such an interesting concept to me, so I wrote a song about it.” She also did a medley of early tunes from her teenage YouTuber days, playing a keyboard despite warning, “I'm not very great at piano.” She sang brief snippets of “That Way,” “Stupid,” and “Feel Like Shit,” just a verse and chorus each. 

	











	But she went all the way into the rager “You Broke Me First,” asking, “Who's going through a break-up right now?” She urged the crowd, “Everybody please give it up to my incredible band up there.” (Two guys!) Yet you could also see she's still learning to feel her way around an arena as a headliner. She even busted out the “which side of the room can scream louder” routine, which pop pros usually outgrow before the third album.


	The climax was a blitz of dance bangers, with her nastiest, zippiest tunes — “Exes,” “Bloodonmyhands,” “She's All I Wanna Be,” “It's OK I'm OK,” and “Revolving Door,” one of the few Boston songs that's actually about having a good time there. She signed off with “Greedy,” to cannon blasts of confetti. The smell of gunpowder was in the air, which felt appropriate for her.


	“So you came to my show to watch me,” the Tate Voice-Over Narrator mused mid-show. “But do you really see me? You show up to hear me sing, but are you listening?” That kind of uncertainty makes a cool dance-floor taunt, but at heart, it's not really her. One of the things that makes her Tate McRae is that even when she sings about self-doubt, as in “She's All I Wanna Be,” she sounds fearless and invincible without even worrying about it. You can't hear, see, or feel a single moment of vulnerability when she's onstage. And no doubt that's exactly how she likes it.


	Set List:


	“Miss Possessive”“No I'm Not in Love”“2 Hands”“Guilty Conscience”“Purple Lace Bra”“Like I Do”“Uh Oh”“Dear God”“Siren Sounds”“Greenlight”“Nostalgia”“This Way”“Stupid”“Feel Like Shit”“You Broke Me First”“Run for the Hills”“Exes”“Bloodonmyhands”“She's All I Wanna Be”“Revolving Door”“It's OK I'm OK”

After two decades in the industry, the Grammy Award winner is reinvigorating the genre with a singular approach.


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



“I f–king hate talking, bro,” Leon Thomas tells his audio engineer. The Grammy Award-winning songwriter and R&B singer is rehearsing for his July set at the Hollywood Bowl, where he's opening for SiR; just days earlier, he was on the other side of the Atlantic performing at London's Wireless Festival, where his longtime collaborator and friend Ty Dolla $ign crowned him “the king of this s–t.”

	











	Thomas' résumé includes Broadway stints and a childhood Nickelodeon breakthrough, and he moves through rehearsals with the methodical meticulousness of someone who has been performing his entire life. With his black and red ombré dreads pulled back in a black wrap to complement his plain white T-shirt and black sweatpants, he floats through the Burbank, Calif., rehearsal space with prodigious finesse and childlike wonder. In quick succession, he translates his drum solo to a new kit, perfects how the slack delays land during “Blue Hundreds” and adjusts reverb levels to differentiate between his R&B and rock tracks. Thomas hates talking because he would rather his multifaceted stage show, as well as his strikingly singular approach to contemporary R&B, speak for itself.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After several years when hip-hop threatened to cannibalize R&B's presence in the marketplace, Thomas, 32, has emerged as a leader of its next class of superstars — and recently landed his highest-peaking Billboard Hot 100 hit as a lead performer with the slick-talking smash “Mutt,” which reached No. 12 on the chart in June. He's recentering the genre's focus, at least for male performers, on live instrumentation and dizzying riffs, and away from falsetto and emulating MCs — so it's something of a surprise that he attacks the verses of “Mutt” with the nimble cadence of a melodic rapper. “We're veering away from the bad-boy types,” he says over a latte in West Hollywood, fresh off a flight from the United Kingdom. “But there's still that toxic energy, slowly but surely becoming a little bit more buttoned up.”

	











	Just as it took R&B some time to find its footing in the streaming era, it took nearly two decades for Thomas to break through as an artist in his own right. Having spent years working within the system of kids' entertainment monoliths, studying under several Grammy winners, crafting multiplatinum radio hits for R&B's and pop's brightest stars and learning the ins and outs of the indie scene, the present version of Thomas is the culmination of almost 20 years of relentless devotion to his biggest goals and dreams. And it's clear, as he leaves the rehearsal space to study a recording of the hourlong run-through, that discipline underscores his devotion.


	“Even though I really consider myself to be a talented all-around artist, I want to be seen at the level that I know I can be seen in music,” he says. “It's been cool to knock down certain pillars when a lot of people thought I was done for.”


For Leon Thomas, musicianship is intensely personal. He inherited a genre-agnostic approach to music and fashion from his parents: a singer mother and a stepfather who played guitar for B.B. King, who were both part of New York's Black Rock Coalition and frequented the East Village's storied CBGB club. Thomas' grandfather — the late opera singer and jazz devotee John Anthony, who starred in the original Broadway production of Porgy & Bess — laid the family's entire foundation.


	Born and raised in Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood, Thomas first fell in love with the drums. At just 3 years old, he developed such an affinity for the kit that his parents continued putting instruments in front of him. By age 9, a family friend noted Thomas had the same hairstyle as the actor playing young Simba in The Lion King and eventually convinced his parents to have him audition for the Broadway show. Thomas snagged the role (which he shared with two other young actors), leading to appearances in Broadway productions of The Color Purple and Caroline, or Change.


	Backstage during those shows, Thomas wrote his first songs on the guitar, which he frequently played for cast mates. The Color Purple's success, and that of 2007's August Rush, brought him to the West Coast, where at 13 he signed a development deal with Nickelodeon that came with a Columbia Records recording contract. While at the network, he provided the singing voice for Tyrone on The Backyardigans for a season-and-a-half before bringing the character André Harris, a high school music producer, to life on Victorious, even penning original songs for the show.

	











	Alongside star-in-the-making Keke Palmer, Thomas became the primary source of representation for young Black Nick viewers in the 2010s. Victorious, which aired in over 80 countries, also helped launch the career of Ariana Grande, who later brought Thomas on as producer/co-writer for her Yours Truly and Positions albums. But while plenty of other Disney and Nickelodeon alumni of the late '00s and early '10s had notably rocky transitions to adulthood in the limelight, Thomas consciously steered clear of any actions that might have alienated the Victorious audience who looked up to him.


	“I probably would have benefited from [a rebellious break], but I knew I had kids following me,” he explains. “I decided to stay behind the scenes. I wasn't trying to edit myself online, but I made sure I was paying homage to the role model I used to be. Nickelodeon can still collaborate with me and it's not awkward. I never took steps to separate myself in ways that were toxic.”


	After Victorious ended production in 2012, Thomas turned down the chance to attend Morehouse College, opting instead to hone his songwriting under Babyface's mentorship. That same year, he joined forces with Khris Riddick-Tynes to form The Rascals, a production duo that crafted cuts for the likes of Grande, Toni Braxton and Zendaya, as well as Thomas' own debut mixtape, Metro Hearts, released in August 2012. The Rascals' work eventually brought them to Grammy-winning producer Boi-1da, whom Riddick-Tynes ran into while on a double date at Nobu. Alongside Boi-1da, Thomas earned his first best rap song Grammy nod for his work on “Gold Roses,” a 2019 collaboration between Rick Ross and Drake that foreshadowed Thomas' contributions to the latter's Certified Lover Boy in 2021.


	“I spent my 20s becoming the best version of myself,” he says. “I studied under amazing artists and watched how they built their teams and communities around themselves. It was like a nine-to-five, just banging out songs every day and sharpening my pen. I learned that being truthful to myself was the risk — that's the cool factor.”

	











	In 2019, Thomas met his manager, Jonathan Azu, through veteran music industry executive Marc Byers, making him one of the first artists signed to Azu's newly launched artist management firm, Culture Collective. In the following years, Thomas continued writing and producing, starting his own Eclectic Collective publishing company and eventually striking Grammy gold with SZA's “Snooze,” which he co-produced alongside Babyface in 2021. That track later appeared on SOS, SZA's blockbuster 2022 album, and soared to No. 2 on the Hot 100. With a win for best R&B song, “Snooze” earned Thomas his first Grammy and helped his publishing company “get into the green.”


	Meanwhile, Azu had spent the pandemic helping Thomas track down the right partners who would ensure his “freedom and flexibility” to sign a new deal. And by 2023, Thomas found the perfect match in EZMNY, a Motown imprint Ty Dolla $ign had launched alongside veteran A&R executive Shawn Barron the previous year.


	“I really looked up to how pgLang was moving with Kendrick [Lamar] and Baby Keem,” Thomas explains. “I thought it was cool to have that big-brother moment in an industry that's a little bit ‘every man for himself.' I could ask Ty questions that most up-and-coming artists don't get to ask their executives.”


	That year, Thomas released his debut album, Electric Dusk, and scored a minor street hit with its song “Breaking Point.” When Barron heard an early version of Electric Dusk, it showed him that Thomas was “making musical decisions that nobody else was” — but the timing wasn't ideal. Electric Dusk arrived as Motown was reincorporated into Capitol Music Group, creating instability that somewhat stunted the record's potential. EZMNY and Culture Collective did “the bulk of the work” to promote the record, Barron says. “We didn't have the resources we needed to make Electric Dusk what it could have been.”

	











	A little under a year later, things were very different: Motown's personnel changes straightened out, and Thomas, having apprenticed for his debut, was ready to own his big moment — a campaign for Mutt that fired on all cylinders.


Thomas wrote “Mutt” on his living room floor while he microdosed psychedelics and watched his dog and cat tussle. A portrait of warring romantic intentions and their unintentional impact, its brooding funk and rock-infused R&B bleeds across his 2024 album of the same name, which Thomas created alongside close collaborators Freaky Rob and David Phelps.


	“Nobody knew they were going to like the single with live drums and a funk groove and a live bassline,” Thomas says. “I decided that if I'm going to lead with anything, I want to lead with myself.” And with “Mutt,” Thomas bet on his intuition: He chose it as the album's lead single over “Far Fetched,” a Ty Dolla $ign-assisted midtempo originally written for Drake.


	Released in August 2024, the song's ascent was a slow burn. “Mutt” had crept into the top 10 of Hot R&B Songs by the top of 2025, but it didn't enter the Hot 100 until Feb. 8, several months after Mutt's September 2024 release.


	An anomaly in a post-pandemic world, “Mutt” blew up through word-of-mouth, not off the back of an easily identifiable and reproducible trend or a specific viral moment. Buzzy shoutouts from the likes of his old Nick-mate Palmer, SZA and Tems brought the song to new audiences, but listeners gradually gravitated to “Mutt” on the merits of its craft and content. “There was never a clear trend with it,” Motown head of digital Dante Smith says. “We saw people living with the song in a lifestyle setting, using the lyrics to tell stories about their relationships and soundtracking their day-to-day.”


	Through many of those lifestyle videos, “Mutt” became a sonic signifier for an aesthetic and personal brand defined by the appreciation of excellence and virtuosity. If someone wanted to show their followers their good taste and ear for quality contemporary music, they more than likely selected “Mutt” for their TikTok or Instagram Reel.

	











	A pair of key promotional spots in early 2025 exposed Thomas to more mature audiences and further propelled “Mutt.” With his Late Show With Stephen Colbert debut landing just two weeks before his first NPR Tiny Desk concert on Feb. 20, Thomas' early-2025 performances also helped the “Mutt” radio campaign shift into a higher gear. The week his Tiny Desk set hit YouTube, the song was milling around outside the top 10 of Adult R&B Airplay, missing in action on Rhythmic and just sneaking into the top 30 of Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. (Thomas dropped his full Tiny Desk set as a live EP on Aug. 15.)


	“We went to R&B [radio] first [in October 2024], and it took us 27 weeks to get that No. 1,” Capitol executive vp of urban promotion Bill Evans says. “[The song] had a couple of hiccups where research was not working in our favor, and a lot of stations were on the fence. As a team, we believed the song could be a No. 1 record, so we kept working it and eventually research started turning around.”


	The radio success of “Mutt,” which now includes No. 1 stints across three separate radio charts and a No. 5 peak on the all-genre Radio Songs chart, also owes to Thomas' unwavering tenacity. In between promoting Mutt, opening for Blxst's I'll Always Come Find You Tour and playing his first set of Mutt tour dates in late 2024, he made sure to personally visit radio stations in each city and connect with DJs, a few of whom had grown up watching him on Victorious.


	“It's tough, sometimes, as an artist when you go to a meeting and all the ideas are TikToks,” Thomas says. “You have to build the machine around your music and make friends with the power players in traditional media. I still agree with this being a people's industry. Shaking hands is important; not being a d–k is important.”

	











	Now, according to Luminate, “Mutt” has earned 295.6 million official on-demand U.S. streams through July 24, spending 20 weeks atop Hot R&B Songs and reaching No. 28 on the Billboard Global 200.


	“I feel like [Thomas is] showing that the younger generation still cares,” Ty Dolla $ign says. “You can make a smash hit and really be good at music [again]. There was an era when you didn't have to know what you were doing; you could make a beat on FruityLoops with the most minimal sounds and as long as it banged, your song is a smash. That started to dumb people down… Leon brought us back to hits with real guitar, real bass, a string section, Rhodes piano, synthesizers and stacked vocals.”


On Dec. 4, 2024, just two weeks after a rousing hometown show at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg, Thomas took to Instagram to share that his grandfather had passed. Less than two months later — and immediately after filming his instantly viral Tiny Desk set — Thomas attended the funeral.


	“The juxtaposition of those highs and lows is really, really challenging, man,” he says, his eyes piercing through his orange-tinted sunglasses. “It's different now being in this chapter without his physical support, but the lessons that he taught me are lingering in my heart and mind. Last year, we spent a lot more time together than we had for the past decade. It was good to have those last couple lessons because there were things he noticed about the system I've built for myself that needed to be tightened up. I'm carrying him with me to this day… I pushed through a lot of grief to keep the train rolling this year.”


	Keeping that train hurtling forward, on June 9, Thomas enraptured the BET Awards audience with a scorching rendition of “Mutt” — complete with a melodic nod to English prog-rockers King Crimson — that cemented his star power. From his head-banging guitar solo to his crisp, impressively precise vocals, Thomas delivered male R&B showmanship reminiscent of Maxwell or D'Angelo. “I got tired of people trying to tell me who I was or what I needed to be successful,” Thomas says, straightening up in his chair. “My inner rock star started peeking its head.” Later that night, BET crowned him best new artist, a moment shared on live TV with his entire team and family. Well, almost: His mother was in the restroom when actors Deon Cole and Dominique Thorne called his name.


	“I always tell people I'm my mom's startup,” Thomas says with a toothy smile beaming with pride. “We started this journey when I was 10 and I'm 31 now. She understands how hard I've worked and how alone I felt sometimes. I'm thankful for whatever they want to call me. I want to make sure that people really understand that I'm a student of the game and I have what it takes to be remembered. I never really played sports, so these awards are the tangible assets I have to show for my hard work.”

	











	Two weeks later, Thomas found himself at a very different awards ceremony (and a homecoming of sorts) as he presented an orange blimp at the Kids' Choice Awards alongside “Ordinary” singer Alex Warren. He may be over a decade removed from his Nickelodeon days — and recently snagged more adult roles in Issa Rae's Emmy-winning HBO series Insecure and Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit — but Thomas still plans to collaborate with the network “in the next couple of years,” underscoring his desire to return to acting. “I want to bring back that rom-com, Love Jones, Love & Basketball feeling to the game,” he muses.


	But before returning to the small and silver screens — he's rumored to appear in the upcoming Owen Wilson-led comedy Rolling Loud — Thomas will have to wrap the Mutt cycle, which will likely last through the 2026 Grammys in February. Thanks to “Mutt” and its parent album, he's poised to dominate the R&B categories — and potentially break into the general field.


	“I hope he's the guy with the Lauryn Hill photo [holding multiple trophies],” Azu says. “Every year, there's somebody and I hope it's him. He is a man of his peers, and I think over the past year he has proven to them that he's here to stay.”

	











	As he keeps relentlessly working Mutt, Thomas has also flooded the marketplace with collaborations, maximizing his reach as his star grows. This year alone, he has linked up with peers such as Coco Jones, YG, Giveon, Sasha Keable, Odeal, Venna and Annie Tracy, cementing his status as a contemporary R&B touchstone. A deluxe edition of Mutt called Heel arrived on May 30 with collaborations from Halle, Big Sean and Kehlani. The expanded version of the album also launched his nascent radio hit, “Not Fair,” which he co-wrote with James Fauntleroy; it has already reached No. 11 on Hot R&B Songs while garnering over 13 million official on-demand U.S. streams.


	“Leon's disrupting this easy, poppy R&B that we had going on,” says fellow R&B star and longtime friend Kehlani. “Something like ‘Mutt' being so successful shows that you don't have to compromise. You really can stay true to the genre. It's made me proud to look at my friend, who I've seen play the back seat in so many sessions, be the star.”


	But as the Mutt campaign has unexpectedly stretched out, Thomas does admit that “in a perfect world, I would be in a different album cycle.” In October, he will release a seven-track EP — a notably funkier, and at times more psychedelic, collection of tracks that carries the torch that Parliament-Funkadelic pioneer George Clinton passed to him at Coachella in April. In a hot-boxed trailer before his own Coachella performance, Clinton gifted him an all-white hat decked out with rhinestones, a dog face and a fox tail. “You the kid with the dog song, right? I like that joint. I made you this hat,” Clinton told Thomas. “Before I come out and perform ‘Atomic Dog,' I'm going to give you the crown.”


	The new EP also comes as Thomas doubles down on recording and rides “the tail end of packing up” writing and producing for other people. Who's still on the list of artists he has “gotta cook up for”? “Me and [Justin] Bieber have been talking a lot,” Thomas reveals. “He's a cool guy; I like him a lot. He just seems so free now and that is a beautiful thing.”

	











	There's also “an iconic female artist” — one who may have recently wrapped a globe-trotting rodeo — whom Barron notes Thomas has been cutting some songs for. “I never know what the f–k is going on,” Thomas says, both earnestly and evasively. “You work for a long time and these projects are so secretive, you just never know what's happening. I obviously want to work with a certain lady from Houston, though. That would be amazing.”


	With his biggest headlining tour yet on the horizon — he's graduating to 2,500-capacity venues with nearly 50 dates across North America, Europe and Australia — Thomas is exiting 2025 very differently from how he entered it. Though legendary soul singer Sam Cooke was his inspiration for starting his own publishing company, his career blueprint may be more in line with that of rock stars. “I'm thinking Jack White and The White Stripes,” Azu says. “When I walk into his dressing room, he's playing Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne. Leon is a trend innovator.”


	As I watch Thomas whirl across the Hollywood Bowl stage just days after channeling Jimi Hendrix at his Billboard cover photo shoot, Azu's assessment reads accurately. When he picks up each instrument and intertwines its energy with his, the innate rebelliousness of the most iconic rockers flows out of him. Here's an artist who, across a two-decade period, has become intimately acquainted with the entertainment industry's countless mutations, finally abiding by his own rules. In his quest to challenge R&B's status quo of “safe lyrics, early-2000s melodies, simple chord progressions, hypnotic loops and no bridges,” Thomas has crafted a collection of soulful, rock'n'roll-steeped songs that have simultaneously invigorated multiple generations of R&B lovers and put the top 40 zeitgeist on notice.


	“I don't really mind being in this position where we push Mutt for so long because it deserves to be heard by the world,” he says, swirling around the last drops of his latte. “I'm excited to be one of the trailblazers who brings back those old feelings without having to steal their chords or melodies.”

Bruce Springsteen has announced a Nebraska expansion that includes the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions, released for the first time. Long sought-after by fans, Electric Nebraska is the informal title of the album that Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded, in 1982, from a suite of demos for his follow-up to The River. But the Boss, preferring his originals, scrapped the full-band versions and instead released a selection of his stripped-down demos as Nebraska. Not all of them, though: Some were held back for his next album, Born in the U.S.A. One was the title track, and below, you can hear the Electric Nebraska version that might have been.

Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition arrives October 17 as a 4xLP or 4xCD box set, which both come with a Blu-ray containing a Thom Zimny–directed video of the band performing Nebraska in full this year. (The audio is one of the four audio discs, too.) The other discs comprise a remaster of the original album and a collection of Nebraska home recordings, some unreleased, plus tracks from a 1982 solo studio session.

On the version of “Born in the U.S.A.” below, Max Weinberg and Garry Tallent back Springsteen. “We threw out the keyboards and played basically as a three-piece,” Springsteen said in a press release. “It was kinda like punk rockabilly. We were trying to bring Nebraska into the electric world.”

He added of the live Nebraska rendition, “I think in playing these songs again to be filmed, their weight impressed upon me. I've written a lot of other narrative records, but there's just something about that batch of songs on Nebraska that holds some sort of magic.”

Springsteen recently reissued a series of mythic shelved records in the box set Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His new biopic, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, got its first trailer in June. The movie, centering on the creation of Nebraska, arrives in theaters on October 25.

A Sundance hit so enticing that its star's stans got the film pulled from the festival's online platform after it was repeatedly pirated for clout on social media, Twinless does indeed offer a hilarious, affecting, range-proving dual performance from Dylan O'Brien that's worth the criminal hype. Befitting the dark small-scale comedy's title, O'Brien plays both gay hotshot Rocky and his straight dimwit brother Roman—that is, until Rocky gets annihilated early on by a passing truck. But this narrative rug-pull isn't the last or largest in James Sweeney's ridiculous film, which twists its initial coping comedy premise into catty erotica just clever enough to pull off its sillier ideas.

But Twinless isn't just a hyper-specific joke about “boyfriend twins” spinning out into madness. Rather, that's just one small punchline caught in the avalanche of its snowballing plot, which begins innocuously enough with Roman heading to a support group for those who've lost twins. It's there, at this meeting ripped from a night at the improv, where the stressed and unmoored lunk runs into Denis (Sweeney), who reminds him of his brother and offers him a surrogate second half. Denis reminds Roman of Rocky not because he's gay and bitchy (though he is both of those things), but because he's sharp, witty, and confident enough to go after what he wants in life. Without his other (and, he worries, better) half, Roman isn't just adrift, but totally lost.

It's through this stunted confusion that O'Brien becomes the selling point of this charming, low-key film. His understated turn as Roman balances out his scenery-gobbling costars and provides some gut laughs as his oblivious schlub hits rock bottom. Roman devolves into a prototypically basic man-child when detached from his late twin, all grey sweatpants and video games and takeout, which Denis sees as an opening to get in with the malapropistic, sometimes caveman-like bro. Like Roman's “any port in a storm” attitude, Denis' affection for his support group compatriot isn't entirely compromised by ulterior motives, but a complex internal debate rages beneath every calculated move made on his end of the relationship.

This is where Sweeney—who injects his sophomore directing effort with some amusing visual gags, charmingly coordinated costumes, and shot designs far more thoughtful than your run-of-the-mill comedy—struggles as a performer. While the multihyphenate can zip through a long, writerly monologue with the practiced nuance of the person who wrote said monologue, hitting all the beats and turns needed to steer listeners along the path he's carved, he can seem a bit lost when not delivering snippy zingers. The problem is he's written himself a plot juicy enough to ask a lot more than he's able to give. Surrounding himself with O'Brien and Aisling Franciosi (endearingly cheery as Roman's crush) only emphasizes the gulf between them during the film's more earnest moments.

That heart, though, is an essential counterweight to the zanier elements of the story, which verges on viral Cut article territory in terms of sheer messiness and confident stupidity. As its characters make bad choices, some foolish, some perverse, and some truly Machiavellian, Twinless sticks with the absurd emotional catastrophe that follows. That dedication to the mess it's made is often captivating, even when the film's intentional line-blurring between comedy, romance, and gaslighting thriller never reaches the heights of its twin-centric sources of inspiration, like Brian De Palma. But it's both impressive and enjoyable that in his second film, Sweeney displays enough depth beneath his jokes to provide his characters and tones with their own foils. Even the subgenres encased within Twinless seem to banter with each other in a winning double act.

That's why the prolific author wanted the film adaptation of 'The Long Walk' to be "pretty brutal."


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Stephen King had one condition for the film adaptation of his book, The Long Walk: He wanted a lot of brutal violence.


	During a recent interview with The Times U.K., the prolific author criticized the way violence is depicted in superhero movies, such as some in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Studios. Oftentimes, those films don't show the realistic, gory consequences of violence, despite there being a lot of destruction.




	“If you look at these superhero movies, you'll see…some supervillain who's destroying whole city blocks but you never see any blood,” King said. “And man, that's wrong. It's almost, like, pornographic.”

	He added of the way violence is presented in The Long Walk, “I said, if you're not going to show it, don't bother. And so they made a pretty brutal movie.”


The Long Walk, based on King's 1979 dystopian horror novel, follows a group of teenage boys who compete in an annual contest known as “The Long Walk,” where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get killed. The last remaining walker wins the contest. The movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, with a script penned by J.T. Mollner.


	Superhero movies will typically avoid graphic violence to appeal to a broader audience, including families and younger viewers. However, there have also been plenty of R-rated superhero pics released that don't hold back on bloody violence, such as 2024's Kraven the Hunter, the Deadpool films, 1998's Blade, 2021's The Suicide Squad and 2019's Hellboy, among others.

	











The Long Walk arrives in theaters Sept. 12

South Park appears to be settling into a pattern as it continues its headline-generating 27th season: Pick a new aspect of Donald Trump's America to focus on every episode—this week, it was tariffs and Fox News, with a bit of Labubu mixed in for some of that wider cultural sauce—but above all else, keep hammering the man himself. So far, the series has managed to successfully play the trolling game with several members of the Trump entourage, luring in Kristi Noem and White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. But it's never actually cracked the head honcho. Will repeatedly airing the phrase “Donald Trump is fucking Satan,” while stating that the President has impregnated the Prince Of Darkness with a “butt baby,” finally earn them the coveted TruthSocial hate blast that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are so delightedly courting?

The overt topic of “Wok Is Dead” might have been the tariffs, for instance, which massively increase the price of Pop Mart's imported plush toys even as mania for them sweeps South Park Elementary. But the show was just as focused, if not more so, on underscoring the endlessly permissive morality of Fox News and its viewers when it comes to Trump's behavior. And most especially on poking the man itself, as faux Fox correspondents repeat the “fucking Satan” phrase multiple times, fawning over Trump for having landed the devil himself. (There was also some material with Jesus investigating the demonic Labubus, because you have to fit some plot into the thing somewhere, but as with a lot of South Park‘s output this season, the focus was clearly on provocation and jokes first.) The whole thing built—after in-depth discussions of what Trump fucking Satan might look and work like—to the reveal that the sitting president has, indeed, impregnated Old Scratch, and that Fox News thinks this is just marvelous.

If nothing else, the one-week-on, one-week-off structure of the season—besides doing its basic job of prolonging the news cycle around the series—is clearly giving Parker and Stone room to find new ways to thumb their eye at the White House. As we've noted before, none of the really grabbing material at play here is subtle, because “subtle” is not currently in South Park‘s own best interest. The show has taken firm grip of the idea that it's the one media project in all of America lobbing these kind of deliberately puerile, wildly popular spitballs at Trump on a national level, and it's clearly ready to ride that impulse through six more lightly serialized episodes, figuring out what the worst thing it can show the man saying and doing on cable TV every two weeks might be.

It's top marks for MI5's bottom tier.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Gary Oldman doesn't belong in Slough House, but here we are.


	On Wednesday, Apple TV+ released the trailer for season five of Slow Horses. In it, Jackson Lamb (Oldman), River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) and the rest of the MI5 rejects are on the case — and a bit on the defense. The fifth Slow Horses season, adapted from Mick Herron's Slough House book series, consists of six episodes and will premiere on Sept. 24. Episodes will roll out weekly until Oct. 29.




	“In season five of Slow Horses, everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occur across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected,” the logline reads. “After all, Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, the London Rules — cover your back — always apply.”

	Poor Roddy (Christopher Chung). A guy gets one pretty girlfriend and the only possible explanation to UK intelligence is that he must have participated in a terrorist attack.


	Watch the season five trailer:


Slow Horses is an espionage dramedy following Slough House, which is comprised of spies that blew it on the MI5 main roster. The series also stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Ruth Bradley, James Callis, Tom Brooke and Jonathan Pryce. Season five will feature guest star Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso).


	The series is produced by See-Saw Films; it was adapted for television by Will Smith — not that Will Smith, this one. Put some respect on Smith's name: he's won the sole Emmy for the series (for writing). Smith, Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Julian Stevens, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Douglas Urbanski, Gail Mutrux and Graham Yost executive produce the series. Saul Metzstein returns to direct season five.

Jack Osbourne is opening his heart about his life's greatest loss. Jack grew emotional as he recalled the heartbreaking moment he learned his father, Ozzy Osbourne, had passed away. In a YouTube video shared Wednesday, the 39-year-old reality star explained that a trusted family employee, who had been with them for three decades, arrived at his Los Angeles home at 3:45 a.m. to break the news. 

“When I looked through my window and I saw it was him, I knew something bad had happened,” Jack said quietly. “I was informed that my father had passed.”

Jack explained that the messenger had worked with the Osbourne family for three decades, making the sight of him at such an early hour even more unsettling. The moment marked the beginning of a painful but deeply reflective chapter for the family.

Jack said he cherished unexpected extra time with Ozzy after staying in the UK following Black Sabbath's final concert in Birmingham on July 5. 

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

He and his family had planned to vacation in Portugal, but canceled when his children came down with the stomach flu.

“I've never been more grateful for my kids to have the stomach flu than I am today,” Jack said, reflecting on those precious days.

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

While devastated by his father's death, Jack said he felt peace knowing Ozzy was no longer suffering.

“I wish he was still here, I wish he was still with us all, but he was having a rough go,” Jack admitted. “But nobody expected it to happen as quickly as it did, and when it did. It was not anything that was on our radar.”

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

Ozzy died on July 22 of a heart attack at 76. He had also been living with coronary artery disease and Parkinson's disease.

A source told Page Six that the rock legend was “re-energized” by his final Black Sabbath concert. “It filled him with life,” a close friend shared. “It's a beautiful ending.”

Jack grew emotional as he reflected on his father's personality.

“He was deeply complicated,” he said. “He was funny, and weird and awkward and clumsy and just hilarious and so insightful.”

Jack added that, despite appearances, his father was always aware. “People may have thought he was checked out, but most of the time he wanted you to think he was checked out,” Jack explained. “But he was very aware, always.”

Ozzy, who had been looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and enjoying life in England, left behind a legacy as one of rock's most influential frontmen — and a father deeply loved by his family.

Jennifer Aniston's new relationship has an unexpected Bravo connection. The actress is dating hypnotherapist Jim Curtis, and according to Bethenny Frankel, she dated him “maybe 10 years ago.”

The revelation came during the Sept. 2 episode of Frankel's podcast “Just B with Bethenny Frankel.” The “Real Housewives of New York City” alum shared the surprising connection while discussing Aniston's new romance.

“I dated Jennifer Aniston's boyfriend and he was a nice guy,” Frankel said. The reality TV star explained that she would not go into details “out of respect” for Aniston and Curtis, but she confirmed their brief romance.

Frankel went on to praise Curtis while reflecting on their past relationship. “I'm happy for her, and I want to say this in the right way. His name is Jim Curtis, and he's getting a lot of attention because he's with her now and he's in like the wellness space,” she said.

Curtis has spent more than two decades working in health and wellness. According to his website, he is a hypnotherapist, life coach and author. Frankel noted that while wellness was part of Curtis' career path, it wasn't something they explored together during their time as a couple.

A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel)

“He was earlier in his journey. But with that and with the wellness aspect, there was an earthiness to it, and it does vibe with Jen Aniston,” Frankel said.

She added that she believes Aniston and Curtis are a good match. “I'm happy for Jennifer Aniston because I do believe she wants to find love. I do believe it's been difficult, as I understand as well as anybody can, and I do believe she's sort of got that earthy, mellow side to her.”

Frankel concluded her remarks on a hopeful note: “I think this is good. I like it, and I'm happy for her and for him, who, like I said, I thought was a lovely man.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

According to Cosmopolitan, Aniston, 56, and Curtis were first linked in May when eagle-eyed fans noticed Curtis liked one of Aniston's Instagram posts, which featured a copy of his book, Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide. People later confirmed the two were “casually dating and having fun.”

The pair have since been seen on multiple outings, including a dinner date at Nobu in Malibu. A source also told People that Aniston's inner circle already approves of Curtis.

“Jim's great. Her close friends love him. He's amazing to be around. He has this really calm and secure energy. Jen loves it,” the insider said.

With Frankel's candid comments and Aniston's new relationship continuing to capture attention, the couple's romance is already generating buzz in both Hollywood and Bravo circles. Whether the two keep things casual or take their relationship further, Aniston's fans — and Frankel's followers — will be watching closely.

Amazon MGM still hasn't stepped up and announced who the next James Bond will be—a question that's been raging across movie-dom since Daniel Craig started making noises about being tired of the role at least as far back as 2015. But it has announced a James Bond. Specifically, the studio (and video game creator IO Interactive) have officially announced that Patrick Gibson will be playing the part in the game studio's upcoming “young Bond” game, 007: First Light, one of the first Bond projects Amazon has rolled out since spending huge amounts of money to wrest control of the franchise for its own personal Blofeld. That's right: Baby Dexter himself, recently freed of his Paramount+ bonds (after the streamer killed off prequel series Dexter: Original Sin after a single season), has been revealed to be the voice and face behind the game's less-polished version of the world's greatest superspy.

﻿
This is not wholly surprising: IO rolled out an earlier trailer for the game back in June, and eagle-eared listeners were pretty sure they'd picked out Gibson's voice amidst the chaos. Still, he's now officially been announced in the gig, playing a younger version of Bond as he attempts to track down an apparently rogue 009 and “earn the number.” (You can see a decent chunk of the actual gameplay, which seems to blend some of the reactivity and physics of IO's well-loved Hitman games with a less freeform action experience akin to an Uncharted game, in the trailer above.)

This all puts Gibson in the weird position of being the only James Bond kicking around at the moment, at a time when huge amounts of both money and attention are being focused on the franchise. (By the way, if you want to see how the series is faring in our current tournament of the greatest action franchises of all time, check in over here.) The Irish actor—who previously starred in both The OA and Shadow And Bone—will now presumably get to spend the next year or so being hounded about whether he might someday reprise the role in a non-interactive capacity, at least until Amazon finally feels willing to pull the trigger on a cinematic casting. First Light, meanwhile, comes out in March of 2026.

Paramount has been in “big, impressive deals!” mode ever since it begged, bribed, and scraped its way into an acquisition by Skydance a few months back, tossing big chunks of money at things like luring away Netflix's dice-rolling golden geese, popping up flashy video game adaptations to try to lure in the youths, and signing deals with Donald Trump's favorite “guys hit each other in the head” sporting event. All of which, presumably, is meant to convey a new spirit of vitality and “we have cash and aren't picky about where it lands,” leading to news today that the studio has found a new up-and-comer to take a chance on: A scrappy young actor and producer by the name of Will Smith.

Variety reports that Paramount has just signed a new first-look deal with Smith's Westbrook, which will apparently be focusing on “global, four-quadrant theatrical movies,” with a strong focus on launching new franchises and working with established IP. (Dang, the rest of Hollywood is presumably asking itself: Why didn't we think of that?) Paramount also isn't keeping Smith's wife's name out of its contracts: Jada Pinkett Smith is co-owner of Westbrook, and will serve as producer on projects while Smith himself stars in them.

Smith's brand is, of course, Very Weird in 2025: He's released exactly two Hollywood films since climbing up on stage and slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars, Emancipation (already filmed pre-Slap) and then the moderately successful Bad Boys: Ride Or Die. Even before that, though, Smith was operating in choppy cinematic waters: Yes, he picked up an Oscar for King Richard shortly after slapping Rock (and shortly before picking up a decade-long ban from the Oscars ceremony), but his only major commercial success in years was Disney's Aladdin remake, which came with a host of nostalgic caveats. (Notably, Gemini Man, an expensive action thriller entirely predicated on the idea people might like a second Will Smith to go with the original flavor, was basically an outright bomb.) The era of Will Smith, Guaranteed Box Office Draw is now fully twenty years out of date, so it's not entirely clear why Paramount thinks it'll get its money's worth out of this new deal. (Admittedly, Smith has had a bit more successful as a producer, lending his name to Peacock's Bel-Air—until his name got to be too toxic to be an asset—and, most notably, Karate Kid sequel show Cobra Kai.)

Westbrook reportedly already has two projects in development at Paramount: Sugar Bandits, based on a novel by The Town author Chuck Hogan, and a project titled Rabbit Hole

Jensen Ackles shared how Supernatural gave him "the tools" his career needed and how much Dean Winchester and the SPN family mean to him.



One of the things that we appreciate and respect about Jensen Ackles is that no matter how he continues to grow in his acting career, he doesn't forget what it was that put him on the map in a big way. Of course, we're talking about series creator Eric Kripke's Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins-starring Supernatural. With his Prime Video series Countdown having just wrapped what's hopefully the first of many seasons, Ackles was the focus of a profile interview with Variety that covered a wide range of topics. Regarding Supernatural, Ackles shared how his 15-season run gave him "the tools" he needed to move on to roles in The Boys, Countdown, and Big Sky. As for his feelings about being most known for playing Dean Winchester, Ackles makes it clear that he wouldn't change it for anything, opening about about how much the Supernatural family still means to him to this day.

Ackles Credits "Supernatural" For Giving Him "The Tools" His Career Needed: "'Locked-in' is a good word. A lot of it depends on the people involved in the project. 'Supernatural' gave me not just 15 years of a great story to tell and family that I've now come to know and love, but it gave me the tools to continue doing what I'm doing. It also gave me some notoriety so that people like showrunners like Derek or even Elwood Reid, who brought me onto 'Big Sky' and has also brought me onto 'Tracker,' and of course Eric Kripke — it gave me some proof in the pudding that I'm happy to take on whatever kind of challenges these guys throw at me. So I think it was less of, like, 'OK, I have to do this specifically,' and it was more the opportunity to work with people who I admire and trust and know I'm going to have a good time telling a story with, and I've been very fortunate so far."

Ackles on Being So Identified with Dean Winchester: "I've Always Loved It and Embraced It, Always": "I've always loved it and embraced it, always. And I've met actors that have had very popular characters on very popular shows or movies, and maybe try to shy away from that, like, 'Oh, I don't want to be known for that.' I mean, there's a reason I did it for 15 years! I love that story. I love that character. I love the people I did it with. I would never shy away from or reject anything that has brought me to this place, because I'm very proud of what we all did on that show, and obviously, I continue to talk about it. We go and do these fan conventions, and it's a gathering around a bunch of people who have a similar affection towards these characters and the show, and I will always be proud of what we did with that."

Performances will run from September 30th - October 12th.

Monli International Company LLC will present a new musical drama by Lisa Monde: L.O.V.E. Extraterrestrial Extravaganza.

By decision of the Big Intergalactic Council, the Earth is subject to destruction as a planet that has deviated from the "correct" path of development. However, it has preserved a unique feeling - Love, which does not exist anywhere else in the Universe.
An Inspector from the planet Krizon is sent to Earth to find out whether this feeling can be exported and instilled in the Krizonians, who have lost the ability to love during the process of evolution.

Janel, a theater actress, becomes his guide through the various types and manifestations of love on Earth. Passion flares between them, and the alien visitor wants to take Janel with him to his planet. She does everything she can to save planet Earth, and decides to stay.

"The subject of contact with the extraterrestrial intelligence does not lose its relevance. When creating the music for the production, I tried to make it "cosmic" for our alien characters, whom I imagine to be positively disposed towards the inhabitants of our planet," - says Lisa Monde. - "Subconsciously, we are waiting for them - the representatives of other worlds. Maybe this is how our meeting will go? With feeling, with a bit of glitz and glam."

The leading actor, the Extraterrestrial Inspector (Dyllan Vallier), faces a difficult task: to tell the story of their visit to Earth and the experience of communicating with people with their body. The Extraterrestrial will have to learn not only to understand his emotions, but also to feel them and reflect on them.

A phantasmagoric show filled with music, dance numbers, and humor once again reminds us of the value of love within any society striving for creation, development, and success. It will not leave the audience indifferent. Especially those who believe that we are not alone in this Universe.

The cast features Dyllan Vallier, Lisa Monde, Scott Lilly, Alex Orthwein, Jessica Rose Carter, Amy Rodriguez, Phoenix Gray and Anna Pitblado.

Written and directed by Lisa Monde, with costume and set design by Michael Gutierrez, lighting design by Jest Spickler, original music, lyrics, and sound design by Lisa Monde, choreography by Dyllan Vallier, stage management by Jest Spickler, and video projections and promotional materials design by Scott Lilly.

The show will run at the Producers' Club Theater NYC (The Crown) from September 30th - October 12th. Duration of the show is 2 hrs 30 mins with intermission.

Over 15 seasons, it's not uncommon for any show to suffer through some narrative pitfalls. When dealing with paranormal threats, for instance, it's quite easy to write oneself into a corner when you put your heroes up against villains like the Devil or the physical embodiment of darkness. This is exactly what Supernatural did in its last few seasons, and it's something of a miracle that the show came out on top at the end — even after a final season ruined by a boring, out-of-left-field retcon. But things were almost much worse for the Winchesters, as it turns out that the writers once entertained the idea of revealing the truth about monsters to the entire world.

In a recent interview with TV Insider for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special (on sale now), showrunner Andrew Dabb revealed that one proposed arc involved Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) revealing the truth about monsters, demons, and all the rest to the world:

"One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public," adding, "They're like, 'Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'"

Talk about a massive shift in the way that Supernatural functioned. For all those years of Sam and Dean trying to keep a lid on the supernatural, the series could very well have concluded itself with a revelation to the whole world that the things that go bump in the night have been there all along.

On the one hand, it's a cool idea to think about. How would normal people react? Would it throw the world into mass chaos and pandemonium? How would monsters and demons respond? One can see how this might've been an interesting way to end a show that spent so long keeping things under wraps, but there would have been some serious consequences that Supernatural would've had a hard time getting around.

The troubles that the Winchesters once had with the law would likely have resurfaced, the remaining British Men of Letters would undoubtedly have retaliated, and more people would have been in danger due to the mass pandemonium and the sudden confidence that vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures would have had due to being "outed" after so many years. The implications just would've been too big for the show to properly handle. That's not to even mention what would've happened to Jack (Alexander Calvert) if he were outed as the literal son of the Devil...

But if we really wanted to get into the nitty-gritty of why a story like this wouldn't have worked for Supernatural long-term (though perhaps a one-and-done standalone episode about the concept could've been interesting, provided it was all erased via time travel), there are several things that simply would not have worked after a revelation like this. Part of what made Sam and Dean's world work so well was that there was an air of mystery about it. The Winchesters had to go around the law in order to work each case, doing the impossible things that most would never dream of. Even in towns like Sioux Falls where the law was generally on their side, the show spent plenty of years putting the feds on the Winchesters' tails for a reason: it was simply a more compelling story. While revealing the truth could possibly save more lives, it could also have the opposite effect, with monsters and demons becoming bolder, with their desperation driving them to become more bloodthirsty and malicious.

Of course, then there's the idea that Sam and Dean would suddenly become international celebrities. While the show played around with the idea that only a select few knew everything about Sam and Dean due to the unpopular books written by Carver Edlund aka Chuck Shurley (Rob Benedict), it would have been a completely different kind of problem if the entire world knew about the Winchesters. "Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show," Dabb admitted. "It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it." In the end, the showrunner made the right call. As Supernatural had already gone on for so long at that point, this development would've certainly killed the show, switching up the entire concept on our heroes (and the audience) at the eleventh hour. But hey, maybe it would've finally forced them to address the monster families ruling over Chicago…

Part of the reason that Dabb and company entertained this idea in the first place was that they wanted the Winchesters to reach their full potential as hunters. "It would've been really nice to see Sam and Dean age into more mentorship roles," Dabb explained. The idea is that, upon revealing to the world the truth about the supernatural, the Winchesters would've gone full Ghostfacers and taught normal folks about how to defend themselves against monster threats. They would have trained the next generation of hunters, who now live in a world where those shadows have been exposed. Turning Sam and Dean into these almost fatherly advisors for a larger world is an interesting idea to be sure, especially if the show's unrealized Wayward Sisters spin-off had taken off. But the series found other ways to explore this concept.

When Sam and Dean brought in all the refugees from Apocalypse World, they taught many of them how to survive in this new world. Based out of the Men of Letters bunker in Lebanon, Sam, in particular, spent much of the time between Seasons 13 and 14 training them to become effective hunters, continuing his pull toward leadership during the war between the American hunters and the British Men of Letters in Season 12. Additionally, Sam, Dean, and Castiel (Misha Collins) all mentored Jack over the years, helping him to not just be a hunter, but to avoid his biological father's footsteps. As Supernatural went on, the Winchesters really did become mentors to the next generation, leading up to Sam raising his own son, Dean Jr. (Spencer Borgeson), to carry on without him, and Dean posthumously guiding alternate versions of their parents on the right path in The Winchesters.

Even without blowing the lid on the supernatural, Sam and Dean found a way to mold those who would come after them, ensuring that someone would fight the good fight long after they were gone. In the end, this was a much better way to wrap up Supernatural, ensuring the integrity of the show's worldbuilding and mythology while teasing more generations to come.

(Gray News) – A cause of death has been revealed for Dan Rivera, the ghost hunter and paranormal investigator who died while on tour with the infamous Annabelle doll, which is believed to be possessed.

According to PEOPLE, the Adams County coroner said in a statement Thursday that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac related. His death was ruled as natural.

The coroner also said that Rivera had a known history of heart issues and that the Annabelle doll was not in the room with him when he died.

Officials said Rivera, 54, was found dead in July in his hotel room the day after an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that featured the iconic doll. 

The event was part of the “Devils on the Run” tour, which displays Annabelle, “for those brave enough” to come face-to-face with her.

The coroner noted that there was nothing unusual or suspicious about the death.

Decades ago, Annabelle, a Raggedy Ann doll, was given to a nursing student who brought it home, where she lived with a roommate.

According to the New England Society for Psychic Research, almost immediately, the roommates noticed “strange occurrences” with the doll.

“They were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the NESPR website states. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”

In 1968, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated the doll and determined that Annabelle was “demonically possessed.”

“They removed the doll from the house and encased it in a glass box to contain the evil-spirited entity,” according to the NESPR.

The possessed doll's story with the Warrens inspired the “Conjuring” and “Annabelle” horror film franchises.

A Pennsylvania coroner's office has determined the cause of death of Dan Rivera, a Connecticut paranormal investigator and one of the handlers of the famed Annabelle doll. 

The 54-year-old died suddenly in his Pennsylvania hotel room in July, according to the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR).

He was in Gettysburg, PA for the “Devils on the Run Tour,” with the infamous Annabelle doll, at the time of his death. 

The Raggedy Ann doll was made famous by "The Conjuring" movie series based on the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who were also paranormal investigators in Connecticut. Many believe the doll to be haunted.

Francis Dutrow, the Pennsylvania coroner in charge of Rivera's case, said his death was cardiac-related.

Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which was consistent with the findings, according to Dutrow who also said Annabelle was not present in the room when Rivera died.

Annabelle is an endless source of fascination on social media, according to her handlers, because of the haunting stories that surround the doll.

Dan Rivera died on July 13, one day after an event featuring the infamous doll

 A cause of death has been determined for the paranormal investigator whose body was found in July after an event in Gettysburg, Pa., showcasing the infamous Annabelle doll. 


 Dan Rivera, an Army veteran and senior lead investigator for the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research, died on July 13, one day after an event with the purportedly haunted toy that has long been featured in horror tales.


 Francis Dutrow, the Adams County coroner, said in a statement on Thursday, Sept. 4, that Rivera's cause of death was cardiac-related and was ruled as natural.


 “Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings. It is also confirmed that Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of his passing,” Dutrow said.


 A July 13 report from the Pennsylvania State Police detailed the conditions in which Rivera, 54, was found.


 “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]. The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers," the report read. "Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene."

 Rivera had been with colleagues that morning but said he was feeling sick and was going back to his room, Dutrow previously told PEOPLE, although it wasn't clear what Rivera may have been ill with.


 At the time of his death, Rivera was on tour in Gettysburg to show Annabelle, which the New England Society for Psychic Research has described as “demonically possessed.”

 According to the society, Annabelle's origin dates back to 1968, when she was presented to a student nurse as a gift. The nurse took the doll to her home where she lived with her roommate.


 “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,” the psychic research society has said. “The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”


 Husband and wife Ed and Lorraine Warren, who founded the society, later removed Annabelle from the home and stored it in a glass box “to contain the evil spirited entity,” where it remains today. 


 Annabelle and the Warrens inspired the horror film franchise The Conjuring.


 Harrison Jones, a journalist for the Hanover, Pa.-based Evening Sun, attended the tour just one day before Rivera's death, telling PEOPLE afterward that Rivera "definitely struck me as a kind and very welcoming person, and my heart breaks for his family and colleagues."


 Joining a tour group, Jones took photos and video footage as Rivera spoke with the visitors before he took them to see the doll.


 “Mr. Rivera, along with another of NESPR's investigators, Wade Kirby, spoke to the group about Annabelle's history and their experiences working with the doll,” Jones said. “Among those discussions, Mr. Rivera spoke about how he had built the case that Annabelle was in himself, and that he had designed many aspects from the perspective of his faith.”


 Jones said he didn't speak much with Rivera but that the paranormal investigator “did ask me if I got what I needed out of my visit and asked if I had gotten good images during the tour.”

 On July 14, while Jones was working on his story about the event, he heard the news that Rivera had died.


 “It was clear from the prior controversy surrounding the tour that his death was going to immediately cause intense controversy and become his own part of paranormal legend no matter what was said,” Jones told PEOPLE. “But in my own reporting I was mainly concerned with trying to focus on the human life lost at the center of this tragic news, Mr. Rivera, who had dedicated so much time and effort in sharing his love for the paranormal."


 In a previous statement shared with PEOPLE, the New England Society for Psychic Research remembered Rivera as not only a "vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend."


 “Dan's passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace,” the society said. “We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for many, but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him. Out of respect for his family, we kindly ask for privacy as they mourn this tremendous loss."

"The weirdest looking cloud I've ever seen."- Whitney Merritt

That may be the understatement of the year. Whitney, an Owensboro native who now lives in White House, Tennessee (just north of Nashville), walks at least 10,000 steps a day. That's a lot of steps and the aspiring singer-songwriter normally passes her time listening to podcasts. Her favorite? Am I The A**hole.

But, Whitney didn't need a podcast to keep her company on Monday. Instead, she got quite a surprise on Labor Day when she was walking in the new neighborhood across from her apartment. Let's just say that, for a few moments, she was convinced she was having one of those Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

When I saw the video footage of what Whitney saw in the sky, I immediately had flashbacks to my own childhood in the early 80s. That's when the TV miniseries V was released. If you're close to my age, you know exactly what I am talking about. If you don't, check this out!

Whitney admits that the neighborhood she was walking in was giving her "creepy suburbia vibes", but it was the briefly unidentified object in the sky that made her say, "What in the HECKKKKK?"

Whitney says, "I was already kinda creeped out, then I turned onto the street within the neighborhood and passed a house to my left." That's when she looked up and saw this.

Whitney says she immediately thought that what she was seeing was some sort of  UFO. It hovered there, in that formation, for at least ten minutes. Oddly, no one else- in the creepy neighborhood- seemed to even notice it. Whitney knew she had to document what she was seeing, so she grabbed her phone.

She captured the video and shared her footage on social media. While a couple of her friends immediately proclaimed, "UFO!", a couple of others correctly identified the object as a lenticular cloud.

And, yes!  Lenticular clouds do resemble our notions of what a UFO would look like. Now, however, Whitney says the cloud now reminds of her something else.

She says, "The more I looked at it, it reminded me of the melted clock in the Salvador Dali artwork. Kinda."

She's not wrong.

Dan Rivera, the paranormal investigator who was touring alongside the infamous and purportedly ‘haunted' Annabelle doll, was found dead in July shortly after attending an event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Army Veteran served as the senior lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research. He died on July 13, with authorities now confirming the cause of his death.

The Adams County coroner, Francis Dutrow, released a statement on Thursday, September 4, 2025, that revealed that River's death was cardiac-related and has been ruled out as natural. Dutrow stated, “Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings. It is also confirmed that Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of his passing,” as reported by the PEOPLE.

A July 13 report from the Pennsylvania State Police outlined the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the 54-year-old.

The report read, “Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]. The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers.” It added, "Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene."

The Adam County coroner previously told the news outlet that Rivera was with his colleagues in the morning but went to his room as he was feeling sick. It was not revealed what he was feeling ill with. At the time of his death, he was on tour with the doll was described as "demonically possessed” by the New England Society for Psychic Research.

The Annabelle doll's origin goes back to 1968, when she was gifted to a student nurse who allegedly brought the toy to her apartment, which she rented with her roommate. The society shared, “Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle," as reported by PEOPLE.

They added, "The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.”

The founders of the society and popular paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, removed the doll from the apartment and locked it inside a glass box “to contain the evil-spirited entity.” 

The Conjuring film franchise is inspired by the Warrens and the Annabelle doll.

On the cusp of graduating law school, Guy is approached by a representative of the Talamasca, a secretive agency that monitors and protects us from the supernatural world. When Guy learns that the Talamasca has been tracking him since his childhood, he falls headlong into a world of secret agents and immortal beings who, up to now, have maintained a fragile balance with the mortal world. 

The series also features Elizabeth McGovern as Helen, a seasoned veteran of the Talamasca, and the leader of its New York Motherhouse; William Fichtner as Jasper, a mysterious American who has quietly assumed control and influence over the Talamasca's London Motherhouse; Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Olive, a beguiling and ambitious agent of the Talamasca; Celine Buckens as Doris, strong-willed and with an old soul, she lives with a coven of witches on a houseboat; and Jason Schwartzman as Burton, a charming, rakish vampire, leading a cloistered life in a luxurious Upper West Side penthouse.

In addition to these new characters entering AMC's Anne Rice universe, Talamasca will also feature a few faces familiar to Interview with the Vampire viewers. Eric Bogosian will reprise his role as Daniel Molloy, and Justin Kirk returns as Talamasca agent Raglan James.

Anne Rice's Talamasca comes from co-showrunners and executive producers John Lee Hancock and Mark Lafferty. Hancock also directs.

The series marks the third entry into AMC's Anne Rice Immortal Universe, following Interview with the Vampire and Mayfair Witches.

Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres its six-episode first season on Sunday, October 26 at 9pm ET/PT on AMC and AMC+.  After that, new episodes will continue to air weekly on Sundays.

Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is bringing the topic of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) into the limelight with an upcoming hearing. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which Luna chairs, aims to tackle the opacity shrouding UAPs, nudging the government towards greater transparency. This hearing, titled "Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection," is scheduled for September 9, according to a release shared on the House Oversight Committee website.

Luna's statement resonates with a citizenry leaning forwards on the edge of their seats, hungry for truth and clarity. "The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety," she asserted on the House Oversight Committee website. Whistleblowers, armed with information on the intricate web of spending, classifications, and policies that bind UAP secrets, are encouraged to come forward, shielded from backlash.

Witness testimonies will be a focal point during the hearing, with individuals like Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a U.S. Air Force veteran, and Chief Alexandro Wiggins stepping into the public eye as UAP witnesses. They will be joined by George Knapp, a journalist with a focus on UAPs, and Dylan Borland, another witness with a background in the U.S. Air Force. Together, these voices seek to illuminate the DoD's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office's (AARO) performance, a body erected by congressional mandate for such enigmas.

Interested parties are invited to attend this public and press-inclusive event at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center, with the proceedings set to kick off at 10:00 AM EST. For those unable to make it in person, a livestream link has been provided, ensuring broad access to the discussion.

Expectations are on the rise as the date draws closer, with press RSVPs required by September 8. It remains to be seen whether the veil of secrecy will be lifted and if the federal government will succeed in "providing better answers on UAPs," as Luna put it on the House Oversight Committee website, repairing the fissures of trust that have long marred the public's view of UAP-related disclosure.

The Adams County coroner has released the cause of death for a notable paranormal researcher who died unexpectedly during a tour featuring the "haunted" doll known as Annabelle.

Video above: Top stories from WGAL.

Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow said Daniel Rivera died in Gettysburg, Pa., on July 13. 

"The cause of death has been determined to be cardiac-related and is ruled out as a natural death," a statement from the coroner's office says. "Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings."

The statement added that it was confirmed that the doll Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of Rivera's death.

The statement ended by saying the coroner's office extends its condolences to the Rivera family and loved ones during this difficult time. 

Known for her creepy presence and eerie backstory, Annabelle has captivated horror fans and paranormal enthusiasts across the country and around the world.

In July, the doll was put on display as part of the "Devils on the Run Tour" at the Soldier's Orphanage Homestead, a historic building that served as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg.

WGAL was able to get an up-close look at the doll. A sign posted beneath the doll said:

"Annabelle

"This Raggedy Ann doll was believed to be possessed by a young girl named Annabelle. After the owner experienced more sinister and dangerous activity, Ed Warren determined that the doll was possessed by the demonic. The doll was soon turned over to the Warrens for safekeeping and placed in the Warren's Occult Museum. Annabelle is responsible for scratching one of its victims with seven psychic scratches, and several motor vehicle accidents including the death of a motorcyclist who taunted Annabelle shortly before the crash."

Japanese fashion brand JennyFax has been getting a lot of attention for its newest line of hair accessories, made up of a pair of women's panties with a hair clip glued to them.

Most people would only wear underwear on their heads as a joke or a dare, but if unconventional fashion brand JennyFax has anything to say about it, wearing women's panties in one's hair will soon become a fashion statement. The Japanese brand took a pair of silky women's underwear, glued a metal hairclip to them, and created an original accessory that was sure to get people talking. Aptly called “panty ribbon bow,” the new hairclip comes in three colors -black, pink, and blue – and is priced at an eye-watering 17,600 yen ($119).

The brand's founder, Jen-Fang, has always been known for her non-conformist design choices, and the panty ribbon bow is definitely consistent with the brand tone.

Photos of the controversial accessory recently went viral on Chinese social media, sparking a heated online debate about the creative liberties of fashion brands. JennyFax is definitely not the first company to push the envelope in terms of design. Balenciaga regularly sparks controversy with its unconventional, sometimes shocking creations, as do other lesser-known brands, like ZNWR, or Felissimo.

Universal Pictures and Blumhouse just released a new trailer for the sequel to Ethan Hawke's terrifying horror film, Black Phone 2.

The short story that the original movie is based on, written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King), follows a masked serial killer who abducts children, locks them in his basement, and torments them. That is until one kid, Finney (Mason Thames), uses a black rotary phone to speak to the ghosts of The Grabber's victims and hatches a plan to escape, kill the Grabber, and reunite with his family. Unfortunately, Thames lives in a horror movie that made bank, so the Grabber is spinning the block on him.

The sequel film sees the Grabber (Hawke) make a surprising return, transforming him from a horrific kidnapper into what can best be described as a spiritual successor to Freddy Krueger. Evidently, the circumstances of his demise were greatly exaggerated. Much like how his victims were able to get the upper hand on the Grabber by tapping into the mystical through a payphone and communicating with one, the Grabber seems to be able to do the same this time around, and now he's haunting a teenage Finney and the kids at Colorado's Alpine Lake Youth Camp during the winter.

Black Phone 2‘s story follows Finney and his younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who, after receiving a call from a black pay phone, see disturbing visions of kids being stalked at camp. Together, they work to prevent her visions from coming to pass and confront an even more powerful supernatural version of the Grabber.

“The phone is ringing again. Are you going to answer?”

Speaking at CCXP Mexico earlier this June, director and co-writer Scott Derrickson explained the film's premise pretty vaguely without giving away how the Grabber made it back.

“The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is a typical ghost story,” Derrickson said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.”

Like many horror movies that catch fire, Black Phone made a lotta cash when it released back in 2022, earning $161 million from an $18 million budget, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Derrickson didn't have plans on making a sequel film until Hill hit him up a couple of months after the first film's release with the idea of having a sequel set with kids at a different stage in their lives, i.e., high schoolers, THR added.

“It is certainly more violent, scarier, more graphic,” Derrickson said, regarding the sequel being more horror in comparison to its predecessor being a supernatural thriller. “And part of that is because of the age of the kids.”

Fans can witness what horrors await Finney and Gwen when Black Phone 2 hits theaters on October 17.

Imagine a scenario that sounds like science fiction: Earth, a warming planet, sees its glaciers slowly melt, and life begins to adjust to new conditions. Until, suddenly, everything changes. This is because temperatures drop dramatically, about 10°C, and the planet enters “winter mode,” a period that lasts more than a thousand years. This event, known as the Younger Dryas, occurred about 12,800 years ago and remains a great mystery to this day. So much so that, for a long time, the explanation was simple: the melting glaciers dumped large volumes of freshwater into the oceans, weakening ocean currents and interrupting the transport of heat to the Northern Hemisphere.

Well, the answer to the Younger Dryas enigma may lie further away than we imagined… not just in the melting ice sheets, but in the stars. To understand the impact of this discovery, we need to go back in time and look at what was happening on Earth. After more than 7,000 years of continuous warming, the planet entered an extremely rapid cooling phase. What caused this abrupt change?

The most widely accepted theory until then suggested that melting glaciers had dumped large volumes of freshwater into the oceans, disrupting the ocean currents that transport heat northward. But what no one could explain was the speed of the cooling, about a year. How could something so drastic happen so quickly? It was then that scientists wondered: what if this cooling wasn't just a consequence of the melting ice, but had been caused by something external? By something coming from space?

It was then that a team of scientists decided to further investigate ocean sediments collected from Baffin Bay, near Greenland, and their findings were surprising. They identified small metallic particles, rich in elements such as platinum, iridium, nickel, and cobalt. These elements are rare on Earth but abundant in comets and meteorites. Even more impressive, they found impact microspheres, which are small mineral bubbles that form when materials melt under intense heat, something that can occur when a comet disintegrates upon impact with the atmosphere.

It's worth remembering that these particles block solar radiation, causing an “impact winter.” This is a temporary blockage of the sun that could have drastically reduced temperatures, so rapidly that Earth was plunged into a long period of cooling. In other words, this event would have destabilized the planet's conditions, impacting ecosystems and the civilizations that were just beginning to form (much like this vast anomaly affecting America).

And no, this discovery isn't just a curious detail from the past… Here are some of the lessons we can learn from this discovery:

Even though research into the Younger Dryas is far from complete, these discoveries indicate that the cause of one of the planet's greatest climate shifts may have come from space. The comet that exploded over Earth, releasing cosmic dust, may have been the catalyst for a centuries-long global cooling. That's why we need to remain vigilant, especially now with this 1.9-billion-year-old megablast hurtling toward Earth.

Long before the deranged ranting and raging began, Luke Filby knew his uncle simply as the man who could make life feel electric – renting Terminator 2, blasting Metallica and mucking around like a fun older brother while they played Super Mario Kart.

Now, those memories are tainted by another set: a Christmas lunch filled with rants about religion and the end of the world. Hours at a hospital deathbed drowned out by angry tirades from his uncle Dezi Freeman against police. A frightening descent into violence and conspiracy theories.

“I tuned it out in the end,” Filby recalls. “It didn't even make sense to me. It was just like gibberish.”

Somewhere along the way, the uncle who once listened to songs like Metallica's Enter Sandman began insisting the music was satanic. It was one of the first steps in a long, spiralling collapse that would plunge his entire family deep into his vortex of fixation and paranoia, culminating in the horrific events in Porepunkah.

Filby mourns the man he lost years ago – long before his uncle chose a new life and a new name, before the shootings and the headlines, before Dezi became a fugitive.

“He went through so many different groups in his life phases,” Filby says.

“It was like he always tried to find a place, a group, where he could fit.

“Everything that has unfolded has completely devastated us. It has broken our hearts for the innocent lives lost, and their families involved.”

The last time Freeman saw his extended family was Christmas 2018, and he spent the day erratically regurgitating his fanatical views to weary relatives on everything from religion and doomsday theories to the impending apocalypse.

During his sudden bursts of rage over lunch, he spewed out vitriol about his hatred of police, his disdain for authorities.

Only months before the family gathering, Freeman was ranting and raving about the government and bracing for the end of the world at his father's deathbed.

“He was just going on and on about authority and politics,” Filby recalls.

This particular Christmas was a final tipping point for many of the Filbys, splintering an already fractured family, who say they have been estranged from the alleged double murderer for years by both name and ideology.

Freeman, a self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen”, changed his surname from Filby and has been on the run for 10 days after allegedly blasting Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, with a home-made shotgun through the door of a bus that the weapons enthusiast was living in near the township of Porepunkah on August 26.

He is then alleged to have opened a window of the bus and shot Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, 35, who also died at the scene. Another detective seriously wounded in the attack is understood to have hidden under the bus for up to an hour until paramedics arrived.

Police say officers were at the property to execute a warrant related to historical child sexual abuse offences.

Freeman has not been sighted since, despite hundreds of specialist officers trawling the dense forests, snow-laden mountains and deep valleys of Victoria's High Country, about 210 kilometres north-east of Melbourne.

By all accounts from family, friends and acquaintances, Dezi Freeman has had many incarnations over his life.

In his 20s, he was a tree-hugging environmentalist. A heavy metal fan with unkempt long dark hair who loved to play Nintendo. A devout Christian. Luke Filby recalls his uncle obsessively going to church youth groups and then destroying all his Metallica cassette tapes in the 1990s as he plunged deeper into Christianity and suddenly began to describe the band as “satanic and evil”.

He recalls his uncle bizarrely using a magnet to erase the music from the cassettes in a process known as tape degaussing, which works by using a strong magnetic field to erase data.

Those who have known the 56-year-old for decades say he has always struggled to hold down a job, living off welfare payments and a disability pension for years, and exhibiting what they describe as “narcissistic, racist and misogynistic” traits.

Locals say he has also worked sporadically as a freelance photographer, a diver and an abseiling instructor at “The Gorge” near Bright.

He was also an avid churchgoer, going to mass weekly at the Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Church in Bright – attending for the last time just days before the double shooting.

“He always wanted something for nothing,” says one acquaintance, who knew Freeman for years.

“Huge ego. A real jealous streak. He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.”

Another family member says he was the type of person “upset with everybody else having something better than him”.

His relatives say he refused to pay parking and speeding fines, and was embroiled in road-rage incidents and countless disputes with neighbours as he became a radicalised, anti-authority conspiracy theorist who adhered to pseudo-legal beliefs in line with sovereign citizens, who believe they are not subject to the law.

His volatile and often violent temperament caused him to constantly fall out with his family. Filby claims members of the family fell out with Freeman after he had an altercation with his own brother.

Freeman disappeared to the Philippines soon after this altercation, and Filby says he remembers his uncle suddenly re-emerging in the early 2000s with his wife, Amalia, known as Mali.

He says it was Mali who helped him to temporarily reconnect with his frayed family before they became estranged again.

“She's such a wonderful, spirited person,” Filby says. “We are very worried about her and the kids. He's gone on the run from police and has basically thrown them under a bus.”

Filby still mourns the uncle who he says was like an older brother to him as a boy.

“He would rent Terminator 2 from the video store and play Super Mario Kart with me,” he says. “That's what I loved about him, and so it was just sad that he had this weird anger inside of him, almost like a mental illness. This kind of rage where he constantly threw tantrums.”

‘He always wanted what others had but was not prepared to work for it.'

But like much of Freeman's family, Filby had distanced himself from his uncle for years as his behaviour grew more erratic and terrifying.

“My grandparents, Dezi's mum and dad, were some of the loveliest, good Samaritan Christians ever,” he says. “They never swore or anything. Always tried to do the right thing. They would just be absolutely heartbroken by this.” 

As the years went on, Freeman's extremist views only hardened. Those who knew him say he became paranoid, setting up surveillance cameras wherever he was living and meticulously researching technology devices as he joined online forums for conspiracy theorists, including a Facebook group dedicated to preparing for the apocalypse.

One family member also recalled him increasingly watching online videos of police brutality, and grotesque terrorism and beheading footage from the Middle East.

Freeman refused to abide by the law, believing it did not apply to him. He frequently spent extended periods in the bush and was known to be an expert hunter. His fixation with firearms and making his own guns intensified, too.

Former landlord Jamie King told this masthead last week that Freeman had a long-running fascination with home-made arsenal dating back more than decade. King recalled his former tenant showing him sketches of guns that he had found on the internet.

“He looked at me, and he said, ‘How hard do you reckon it would be to make them?'” he says.

Freeman had told the farmer he wanted to make his own guns, but had also asked his wife, Mali, to get a firearm licence so he could buy more weapons.

“I said, ‘Why would Mali want a gun?' And he said, ‘Well, I've got assault charges.'”

His intense hatred for police is well-documented in online posts, video footage and court documents.

During a hearing last year appealing against his suspended driver's licence, Freeman told a court that “even the sight of a cop or a cop car … it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier”.

He came to public attention for his anti-government stunts during the pandemic, making headlines in 2021 when he helped lead an attempted private prosecution of then-premier Daniel Andrews for treason.

Freeman has for years displayed contempt for police and the justice system, and is known among anti-authority extremist groups for his public stunts.

He has described police as terrorist thugs and Nazis. In the days before the police killings, his wife confided in a neighbour, fearing for his mental health.

In 2023, he posted online “the only good cop is a dead cop”, and called for the “extermination” of politicians. These views appear to have only deepened when he was drawn to the so-called freedom movement during the coronavirus pandemic.

During the pandemic, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. He refused to wear face masks in shops, voiced his refusal to get vaccinated, and told people about his distaste for government restrictions and lockdowns.

“He was anti everything to do with it,” one local said. “He fell down a bit of a rabbit hole. It was all a bit unhinged.”

A friend of Freeman's wife, Mali, says Freeman began to change during the pandemic, believing the Victorian government had mishandled its COVID-19 response.

She says Freeman had begun to mobilise with a group of people in the community who were also opposed to lockdowns, restrictions and vaccines.

King says Freeman considered himself to be “a bit of a Geronimo” – a reference to the famed Native American leader who resisted both Mexican and American forces in the late 19th century.

“He's probably wanting to go down in a blaze of glory so he gets written into history,” he says.

King says his former neighbour owned a ghillie suit, an elaborate type of camouflage clothing, that he would wear in the remote bushland when he disappeared into the High Country for weeks on end.

“I reckon he actually thought he was Native American,” King said, adding that Freeman had a tipi, a conical tent of indigenous American tribes, on the property when he lived there.

King still vividly remembers when Freeman came to his house one afternoon holding sketches and drawings he got online about how to make home-made guns.

Looking back now, that moment is chilling.

“I never would have thought it would come to this,” he says.

But another of Freeman's former neighbours, Gary French, is not shocked by the alleged brutal double murder.

“He's always been dangerous,” French says. “Anywhere Dezi has lived, he has brought chaos. He's created a multitude of problems for a lot of people.”

French and his family found themselves embroiled in a bitter land dispute and then a drawn-out civil court case when the suspected gunman began hunting for deer and continually trespassing on their land.

French says Freeman used drones and surveillance technology to spy on, threaten and torment his family when they lived next door to him in Myrtleford between 2017 and 2019.

“We took a civil case against him … It was a two-year process,” French says. “He was defending himself in court. He attempted to arrest the magistrate involved. It was just an absolute circus.”

It cost the family $100,000 in legal fees. French says he often felt police were powerless to stop him.

“He lost his gun licence at that time,” French says. “So I was dumbfounded that he actually got a gun licence back.

“But he has also been convicted of firearm offences previously, so I just couldn't believe he even had a firearms licence to begin with.”

King says he always felt that Freeman was envious of him because he owned a sprawling block of land in the remote hamlet of Nug Nug, about 20 kilometres west of Porepunkah.

“He was a little bit jealous of me because I own property,” King says.

“He'd say, ‘It's not fair that you own all this', and I would say ‘Dezi, I've had a job since I was 14 years old'. I've never been on Centrelink. I purchased this property.”

He remembers Freeman as a person who was self-absorbed and arrogant. He says he once pretended to be a photographer employed by the Country Fire Authority, wearing a firefighter uniform with the word “media” sewn on it, so he could take photos at close range as bushfires tore through the High Country.

Early one summer's day, when the two were still neighbours, Freeman told King to come outside his house after midday.

When King went outside, he saw Freeman had climbed a nearby mountain and was standing on top of it holding a tiny mirror in his hand, illuminating the vast countryside below with sunlight.

“You could see this light reflecting from the mirror kilometres away,” he said. “It was incredible. He was just standing there on top of this mountain like he was the king of it.”

Their relationship soured in 2012 during a dispute, when King discovered a vast marijuana crop growing on the property and told Freeman to dig it up within 24 hours.

“He [Dezi] flipped out. I mean this guy went f---ing nuts … He was in my face screaming that he's going to shoot me dead,” King says, his eyes flashing wildly as he recounts the encounter.

“It was like a switch flipped. This went on for five or 10 minutes,” King told this masthead earlier this week.

“I have thought a lot about what has happened these last few days, and I didn't think he had it in him.

‘He's always been dangerous.'

“But is he a doomsday prepper? F---, yeah. I reckon he's built an underground bunker somewhere or hiding down a mineshaft.” 

Filby was outside his home in the regional city of Albury-Wodonga tending to his birds when his mother, Freeman's sister, called last Tuesday afternoon. While they were chatting about their day, another call came through from Filby's uncle, Freeman's brother, and his mother hung up abruptly. Minutes later, she called him back.

“She said, ‘Google Porepunkah shooting right now',” Filby says. “So I Googled it, and Mum said, ‘Who do you think that is?' And, I was like ‘Oh my god. It's Uncle Des'.”

“My mum has been crying her eyes out about it for days,” Filby says.

“We are absolutely heartbroken for the two police officers who have died, their families, and the third guy that was injured.”

Now, Filby is left haunted by two versions of the same man: the uncle who once felt like a brother, and the alleged murderous fugitive accused of killing two police officers.

“I always felt something like this was going to happen,” Filby says. “But I wasn't sure precisely what would be the thing to finally tip him over the edge.”

Jensen Ackles offers new insights into "Vought Rising" and reuniting with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki & Misha Collins for The Boys.



During a wide-ranging interview with Variety that went live on Wednesday night, Jensen Ackles covered a wide range of topics regarding his professional career, including deep dives into Prime Video's Countdown and CBS's Tracker. Of course, you can't cover all of the things that Ackles has going on and not touch on his run as Soldier Boy in the upcoming fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys and in Showrunner Paul Grellong's upcoming Ackles and Aya Cash (Clara Vought, aka Stormfront)-starring prequel series The Boys: Vought Rising. In the following highlights, Ackles discusses the similarities and differences between the versions of Soldier Boy he plays in both series, an interesting observation he and Cash made about working on "Vought Rising" after The Boys, and what it was like reuniting with Supernatural co-stars and friends Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins on the set of The Boys for the final run.

Ackles Compares Soldier Boy in "The Boys" and in "The Boys: Vought Rising": "Obviously, they're the same guy, but certainly there's a lot of life that Soldier Boy has lived when we see him in 'The Boys' and when we see him in Season 5 — how he's relating to people, the things that are important to him, the things that he's willing to just slough off, his idea of the life he wants to lead. And then going back 70-odd years to see him when he was really starting to get going, I'm able now to deal with the struggles that made him who he became, and you start to see him before he has necessarily the swagger and the gravitas and the life lived of 75 years of being the top dog.

["Vought Rising"] predates all that, so I think I'm trying to show a little bit more of an early version of it — not necessarily an innocence to it, but there's certainly scenes, relationships and character traits that predate how we see him in modern day, and that's fun to play with. Now, that's not to say he's going to be a completely different character and he's not going to be the tough guy that I think we know and love. That's there, and we'll get there quickly, but it is fun to show the origin of how this guy became who he is, and what were the little tricks and little ticks that crafted him into where we see him now."

Ackles & Cash: "The Boys: Vought Rising" Feeling "Familiar, But Feels Unfamiliar Too": "It's funny — Aya [Cash] and I were talking and working together the other day. It's weird coming into a show almost feeling like you're coming back to a show, because you're playing the same character, but it's a totally different show. There's all new actors that you're working with, all new characters, and all new relationships that you're developing as that character, and she was like, 'It's like coming home, and you've sold the house and there's a new family living there. This feels familiar, but feels very unfamiliar too.' So we're still trying to find our footing. I'm glad we have each other, and everybody that we're working with has been super great.

Ackles on His Dynamic with Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins While Filming "The Boys": "Look, we're going to have fun no matter what venue we're operating in. Obviously, we spent many, many, many years together in front of the camera. We've spent many years — and continue to — behind the camera and at events and convention centers, so there's a relatability between all of us that exists that's far greater than just our characters. So I feel like you can stick us in anywhere and we all get along and we all know how to operate, whether we're playing a new character, an old character, or ourselves. There's just a camaraderie there that you get when you've spent 20 years together."

Along with Ackles and Cash, the spinoff prequel also stars Will Hochman (Blue Bloods), Elizabeth Posey (Euphoria), Jorden Myrie (Bridgerton), Nicolò Pasetti (Industry), Ricky Staffieri (The Bear), Brian J. Smith (Sense8), Mason Dye (Stranger Things), and KiKi Layne (The Old Guard 2). Here's a look at a screencap of Grellong's Instagram Stories, followed by his IG post confirming the start of production on the prequel spinoff series:
