                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stripe is funding a new blockchain company called Tempo, co-founder CEO Patrick Collison announced on Thursday. Tempo is aimed at high-volume processing of stablecoins — coins that help reduce crypto's notorious volatility because they are pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. What is surprising is the eye-popping list of companies Stripe has already enlisted: Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa. So if the blockchain works well, these design partners should be queued up to use or offer it for everything from agentic payments to remittances. Collison says Tempo will be run as an independent company. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It says Wesley Berry, a computer scientist and a cofounder of the tech startup Prophetic, previously filed trademark applications for Telepathy in May 2023 and Telekinesis in August 2024. Prophetic is building a wearable headset to induce lucid dreaming, but only Berry is the author of the trademark applications, not Prophetic. In response to Neuralink's application for Telepathy, the trademark office also references the existing trademark for Telepathy Labs, a Tampa-based company that provides interactive voice and chatbot technology to businesses. Musk's Neuralink, meanwhile, is developing a brain-computer interface that involves a device, surgically implanted in the skull, that collects brain activity. The company has been using the name Telepathy to describe its first product, which is designed to allow paralyzed people the ability to operate their phones and computers with just their thoughts. (Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment.) Both Berry and Neuralink filed “intent-to-use” applications, which allow businesses and inventors to reserve trademark rights before using the mark in commerce. Berry's application for Telepathy was accepted in December 2024 and for Telekinesis in August 2025 but the trademarks aren't fully registered until he shows that he's actually using them in commerce. Berry has three years to do that from acceptance, otherwise his applications would be considered abandoned and Neuralink's application would take priority. Berry has not marketed nor commercialized a product called Telepathy or Telekinesis, but in his trademark applications describes both as “software that analyzes EEG to decode internal dialogue to control computer or mobile devices.” EEG, or electroencephalogram, data refers to the electrical activity of the brain recorded through electrodes worn on the scalp. The trademark office's letters to Neuralink are not final decisions. Neuralink did not address Berry's applications in its response. “The standard for likelihood of confusion is, if a random consumer encountered both of these products, would they think that they're coming from the same company?” says Heather Antoine, an intellectual property partner at Stoel Rives in Sacramento, California. The trademark office will consider Neuralink's response and decide if there is a likelihood of confusion. If Berry succeeds in registering the marks, Neuralink would have a few options. Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of Gerben IP in Washington, DC, says it's difficult to know how things will shake out because there's a lot of nuance to a trademark claim.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is hosting its new hardware event on September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. More broadly, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that this will be the first of three planned years of major iPhone redesigns, with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026. It could come in new colors: purple and green. iPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025Full Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. The iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of around $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially include dark blue and copper. The Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,100. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Three weeks before the event, a leak showed “TechWoven” iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. This move appears to be Apple's response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple's long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026. While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. The battery life of the device is uncertain, but some believe it may be worse than that of previous models due to its thin design. Reports suggest that to compensate, an optional battery case may be sold separately. However, a newer prediction from JPMorgan suggests the iPhone Air will cost around $899 to compensate for the absence of a second camera. After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it's speculated that the watch will feature a larger display. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks. Apple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn't expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it's about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio. This story has been updated to include additional rumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There, Kennedy deflected and denied any harmful impacts from the CDC's implosion, while repeatedly spouting misinformation about vaccines and other health issues. Former CDC director Susan Monarez was fired last Tuesday for reportedly refusing to support Kennedy's vaccine agenda without review, and specifically, to follow the recommendations issued by an influential but independent vaccine advisory panel—the same panel that Kennedy recently purged and restocked with people who have criticized or voiced skepticism toward vaccines before. The CDC Implosion Continues as Staff Stage Unprecedented Walkout Kennedy, in both an opening statement and subsequent responses to Senate Finance Committee members, appeared to minimize the fallout from what happened at the CDC. That's why we have to fire people at the CDC,” Kennedy said. On the firing of Monarez, Kennedy implied that she was untrustworthy, rather than that she had refused to support his vaccine agenda. Kennedy also rebuffed criticisms of the remade vaccine advisory panel. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) noted that several of Kennedy's picks received money from testifying in vaccine-related lawsuits, arguing that this history should be seen as a financial conflict of interest—the same rationale used by Kennedy to dismiss the old ACIP members. Kennedy disagreed entirely, instead claiming that this was merely evidence of them possibly having a bias. When pressed to acknowledge that at least one million Americans died from covid-19, Kennedy said in a heated exchange with Warner that he didn't know many Americans died from covid-19. “I don't think anybody knows that,” Kennedy stated. Kennedy also claimed to not know how many lives were saved from the covid-19 vaccines, another common talking point of the anti-vaccination movement. And Kennedy's suggestion that vaccine makers didn't produce a study showing the covid-19 jab was suitable for healthy children is also incorrect, as those studies have been done. At one point in the hearing, Kennedy stated that he agreed with his handpicked ACIP member Retsef Levi's argument that the mRNA covid-19 vaccines caused serious harm, including death, to Americans, especially young people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robot vacuums that can climb stairs are now officially a thing if IFA 2025 is any indication. At the Berlin tech show, Eufy announced the MarsWalker, a dang stair-climbing mech suit that your robot vacuum can wear. And Eufy plans to release it in the spring of next year, with pricing to be announced later. Robot vacuum owners have been waiting years for a couple of things: a robot that actually does what you want with no compromises (we're not there yet) and the ability for them to actually get up and down your stairs without you (we're close!). A few companies have shown off stair-climbing robots before; consider the Migo Robotics Ascender, an ambitious project that can climb and clean your stairs, but that one hasn't made it to the world yet. I watched the MarsWalker do this over and over again on a small set of wooden stairs that only went up in one direction. But Eufy says it works fine with stairs that reach a landing and turn, either at a right angle or back in the other direction. I asked a member of Eufy's research and development team who was on site, and he tells me the MarsWalker can potentially handle spiral staircases too, but they'd have to have a wide curve. If I get a chance to review it, I'll try it on the spiral stairs in my own home. I asked Eufy's representative about the MarsWalker's future compatibility, and he said the company plans to make other robot vacs that work with it. The MarsWalker has a way to go before it can truly conquer stairs—it doesn't clean the stairs themselves, after all. But if it works as Eufy hopes it will, this little robot can get from one floor to the next all by its onesie, saving you from having to carry your robot vacuum upstairs (which, if you're me, you just don't do) or buy separate vacuums for each floor. And really, it's probably a good thing for Eufy to try to master getting up and down the stairs first before moving onto the next thing. Eufy's robot vacuums, like many on the market today, can save multiple maps of your house so you can move them around, but with this new approach, it creates a full map of all of your floors without you having to initiate separate map-making runs for each floor. Eufy says the Omni S2 is aimed at solving a number of issues that robot vacuums have, not just their inability to climb stairs. Those include the robots' inability to adapt to different floor surfaces, terrible carpet performance, tendency to get their filters clogged with dust and pet hair, and the fact that even the best mop-bots can't actually disinfect your floors. The Omni S2, which Eufy expects to sell for $1,599 in the U.S. in January, will have 30,000Pa suction (that's higher than the Omni E28's 20,000Pa and way higher than the S1 Pro's 8,000Pa), a self-cleaning mop, and can rid floors of “99.999%” of bacteria and pathogens. Eufy says the Omni S2, even without the MarsWalker, uses those to avoid obstacles and messes, adapting to your home as it cleans. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After six years of waiting, Team Cherry's long awaited Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, launched globally today at 10 am EDT. On the PlayStation store, the game appears to have disappeared entirely for some players, while it's not available to purchase for others. According to Verge reporter Tom Warren, fans trying to buy the game on Xbox Game Pass should remote-install it via the console's website. Twitch streamers trying to play the game for their viewers are running into similar problems. On X, user @HaydenSchiff posted a screenshot of many streamers encountering the same Steam error message. Players who've successfully managed to buy the game, meanwhile, are gloating about their success. “God's favorite,” wrote one with a picture of Silksong on their Switch 2. Silksong, announced in 2019, is the followup to Team Cherry's debut title, Hollow Knight. A winning combination of Dark Souls-like difficulty and cartoonish charm, Hollow Knight became an award-winning indie darling that sold over 15 million copies—an impressive feat for its tiny, Australia-based developer. While the team initially planned to release Silksong as downloadable content, the project eventually ballooned into a full-fledged title that took seven years to finish. Despite years of few updates and little news, the Silksong fanbase has remained active. Some fan communities have even turned waiting into a game, while others dedicated their time to (mostly non-existent) daily news updates. After developers made a surprise announcement in August that the game would launch in two weeks, at least half a dozen fellow indie developers delayed their own games to make way. “Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks notice makes everyone freak out,” wrote Demonschool developer Necrosoft on Bluesky after announcing its own delay. As of writing, Silksong is Steam's top-selling game; it already has more than 100,000 concurrent players on that platform alone.

Orchard Robotics, an agtech startup using artificial intelligence to deliver precise data on farm operations, has raised $22 million from investors. The company was founded by Seattle-based CEO Charlie Wu, a Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Cornell University to launch his business in 2022. “Orchard Robotics exists to help our farmers become more profitable and efficient, and this new funding accelerates our ability to deliver a sustainable future for agriculture.” The startup has developed a system with cameras that are mounted on tractors and other equipment to gather images as they traverse a farm. The collected images are then analyzed by Orchard Robotics' AI to generate data on vines, trees and crops, which is then processed to track the growth, yield and health of crops. The Series A round was led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, with continued participation from General Catalyst, Contrary, Mythos, Valyrian and Ravelin. Other investors include Formula One driver Nico Rosberg and Yext & Roam Founder Howard Lerman. Washington is home to a wide variety of agtech startups. That includes other companies that collect and/or analyze data, such Loftus Labs, innov8.ag and FruitScout, as well as IUNU and Koidra, which are focused on greenhouse crops.

Despite this massive increase, many Chinese companies, like TikTok owner ByteDance, are keen on getting their hands on Nvidia's latest chips, with some sources saying that these chips are considered great deals. In the meantime, many Chinese tech firms are still buying H20 chips despite Beijing's guidance to stop buying them. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously banned the sales of H20 chips, resulting in a $5.5-billion write-off for Nvidia. Because of this, there's currently a massive license backlog at the U.S. Department of Commerce —the worst it has experienced in 30 years — turning the H20 taps into a trickle. We've also seen reports that Nvidia is asking its suppliers to wind down H20-related production, with the company only telling Tom's Hardware, “We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.” So, with all these delays, red tape, and rumors, many of Nvidia's Chinese customers are getting apprehensive and want assurance that their H20 orders are delivered. This shows that there is still massive demand for these powerful chips, thus turning it into a massive geopolitical tool to be wielded on the negotiating table by both the East and the West.

Update 9/4/2025 05:28 am PT: An Nvidia spokesperson has reached out and provided this comment. "The AI Diffusion Rule was a self-defeating policy, based on doomer science fiction, and should not be revived. The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unveiled a preliminary version of the annual defense policy package that includes a requirement for American developers of AI processors to prioritize domestic orders for high-performance AI processors before supplying them to overseas buyers and explicitly calls to deny exports of highest-end AI GPUs. The legislators call their initiative the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (GAIN AI Act) and their goal is to ensure that American 'small businesses, start-ups, and universities' can lay their hands on the latest AI GPUs from AMD, Nvidia, etc before clients in other countries. However, if the bill becomes a law, it will hit American companies hard. "Globally, these chips are currently supply-constrained, which means that every advanced chip sold abroad is a chip the U.S. cannot use to accelerate American R&D and economic growth. As we compete to lead on this dual-use technology, including the GAIN AI Act in the NDAA would be a major win for U.S. economic competitiveness and national security." This GAIN AI Act demands developers of AI processors, such as AMD or Nvidia, to give U.S. buyers first opportunity to purchase advanced AI hardware before selling to foreign nations, including allied nations like European countries or the U.K. and adversaries like China. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. What is perhaps no less important about the act is that it sets precise criteria of what U.S. legislators consider 'advanced integrated circuit,' or advanced AI GPU. To qualify as 'advanced', a processor has meet any one of the following criteria: Essentially, the legislators plan to export control all fairly sophisticated processors, including Nvidia's HGX H20 (because of high memory bandwidth) or L2 PCIe (because of high performance density) that are now about two years old. Coincidentally, Nvidia on Wednesday issued a statement claiming that shipments of its H20 to customers in China does not affect its ability to serve clients in the U.S. "The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false — selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products," the statement reads.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Natural light flooded in through its windows, and a large pair of umbrella-like lighting rigs made the room even brighter. I took a deep breath and started to read out the script. The company's avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me. When Synthesia launched in 2017, its primary purpose was to match AI versions of real human faces—for example, the former footballer David Beckham—with dubbed voices speaking in different languages. A few years later, in 2020, it started giving the companies that signed up for its services the opportunity to make professional-level presentation videos starring either AI versions of staff members or consenting actors. Now Synthesia's avatars have been updated with more natural mannerisms and movements, as well as expressive voices that better preserve the speaker's accent—making them appear more humanlike than ever before. For Synthesia's corporate clients, these avatars will make for slicker presenters of financial results, internal communications, or staff training videos. It's slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn't know me, you'd probably think that's exactly what it was. And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? When my former colleague Melissa visited Synthesia's London studio to create an avatar of herself last year, she had to go through a long process of calibrating the system, reading out a script in different emotional states, and mouthing the sounds needed to help her avatar form vowels and consonants. As I stand in the brightly lit room 15 months later, I'm relieved to hear that the creation process has been significantly streamlined. Josh Baker-Mendoza, Synthesia's technical supervisor, encourages me to gesture and move my hands as I would during natural conversation, while simultaneously warning me not to move too much. It also has the unfortunate effect of making me sound like an employee of Synthesia.“I am so thrilled to be with you today to show off what we've been working on. We are on the edge of innovation, and the possibilities are endless,” I parrot eagerly, trying to sound lively rather than manic. “So get ready to be part of something that will make you go, ‘Wow!' The latter, Synthesia claims, makes its synthetic humans more lifelike and true to the people they're modeled on, complete with more expressive hand gestures, facial movements, and speech. You can see the results for yourself below. Its range of emotions was also limited—when she asked her avatar to read a script angrily, it sounded more whiny than furious. By way of contrast, I'm struck by just how much my new Express-2 avatar looks like me: Its facial features mirror my own perfectly. Its voice is spookily accurate too, and although it gesticulates more than I do, its hand movements generally marry up with what I'm saying. But the tiny telltale signs of AI generation are still there if you know where to look. “This is great!” my avatar randomly declares, before slipping back into a saner register. Synthesia's new technology is impressive but raises big questions about a world where we increasingly can't tell what's real. Anna Eiserbeck, a postdoctoral psychology researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin who has studied how humans react to perceived deepfake faces, says she isn't sure she'd have been able to identify my avatar as a deepfake at first glance. But she would eventually have noticed something amiss. It's not just the small details that give it away—my oddly static earring, the way my body sometimes moves in small, abrupt jerks. It's something that runs much deeper, she explains. I know there's no actual emotion behind it— it's not a conscious being. Watching the video gave her “this kind of uncanny feeling.” Its oddly upbeat register is completely at odds with how I normally speak; I'm a die-hard cynical Brit who finds it difficult to inject enthusiasm into my voice even when I'm genuinely thrilled or excited. Plus, watching the videos on a loop makes me question if I really do wave my hands about that way, or move my mouth in such a weird manner. If you thought being confronted with your own face on a Zoom call was humbling, wait until you're staring at a whole avatar of yourself. When Facebook was first taking off in the UK almost 20 years ago, my friends and I thought illicitly logging into each other's accounts and posting the most outrageous or rage-inducing status updates imaginable was the height of comedy. I wonder if the equivalent will soon be getting someone else's avatar to say something truly embarrassing: expressing support for a disgraced politician or (in my case) admitting to liking Ed Sheeran's music. Express-2 remodels every person it's presented with into a polished professional speaker with the body language of a hyperactive hype man. And while this makes perfect sense for a company focused on making glossy business videos, watching my avatar doesn't feel like watching me at all. The real technical challenge these days has less to do with creating avatars that match our appearance than with getting them to replicate our behavior, says Björn Schuller, a professor of artificial intelligence at Imperial College London. The team created a voice cloning model to preserve the human speaker's accent, intonation, and expressiveness—unlike other voice models, which can flatten speakers' distinctive accents into generically American-sounding voices. That information is then fed into a diffusion model, which renders the avatar's facial expressions and movements to match the speech. Then a final model renders the avatar with that chosen motion. This third rendering model is significantly more powerful than its Express-1 predecessor. This means it takes less time to create the avatar, says Youssef Alami Mejjati, Synthesia's head of research and development: Now, because we've trained it on much more diverse data and much larger data sets, with much more compute, it just learns these associations automatically without needing to see them.” Although humanlike AI-generated avatars have been around for years, the recent boom in generative AI is making it increasingly easier and more affordable to create lifelike synthetic humans—and they're already being put to work. Synthesia isn't alone: AI avatar companies like Yuzu Labs, Creatify, Arcdads, and Vidyard give businesses the tools to quickly generate and edit videos starring either AI actors or artificial versions of members of staff, promising cost-effective ways to make compelling ads that audiences connect with. Similarly, AI-generated clones of livestreamers have exploded in popularity across China in recent years, partly because they can sell products 24/7 without getting tired or needing to be paid. For now at least, Synthesia is “laser focused” on the corporate sphere. But it's not ruling out expanding into new sectors such as entertainment or education, says Peter Hill, the company's chief technical officer. In an apparent step toward this, Synthesia recently partnered with Google to integrate Google's powerful new generative video model Veo 3 into its platform, allowing users to directly generate and embed clips into Synthesia's videos. It suggests that in the future, these hyperrealistic artificial humans could take up starring roles in detailed universes with ever-changeable backdrops. Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. At present this could, for example, involve using Veo 3 to generate a video of meat-processing machinery, with a Synthesia avatar next to the machines talking about how to use them safely. For example, a video about the evolution of life on Earth could be tweaked for someone with a biology degree or someone with high-school-level knowledge. “It's going to be such a much more engaging and personalized way of delivering content that I'm really excited about,” he says. The next frontier, according to Synthesia, will be avatars that can talk back, “understanding” conversations with users and responding in real time Think ChatGPT, but with a lifelike digital human attached. Synthesia has already added an interactive element by letting users click through on-screen questions during quizzes presented by its avatars. But it's also exploring making them truly interactive: Future users could ask their avatar to pause and expand on a point, or ask it a question. “We really want to make the best learning experience, and that means through video that's entertaining but also personalized and interactive,” says Alami Mejjati. “This, for me, is the missing part in online learning experiences today. And I know we're very close to solving that.” Combining agentic technology—which is already capable of navigating the web, coding, and playing video games unsupervised—with a realistic human face could usher in a whole new kind of AI addiction, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab. “If you make the system too realistic, people might start forming certain kinds of relationships with these characters,” he says. “We've seen many cases where AI companions have influenced dangerous behavior even when they are basically texting. If an avatar had a talking head, it would be even more addictive.” Schuller agrees that avatars in the near future will be perfectly optimized to adjust their projected levels of emotion and charisma so that their human audiences will stay engaged for as long as possible. As I pause and replay my Express-2 avatar, I imagine holding conversations with it—this uncanny, permanently upbeat, perpetually available product of pixels and algorithms that looks like me and sounds like me, but fundamentally isn't me. But, I concede, she could deliver a damned good presentation about why Ed Sheeran is the greatest musician ever to come out of the UK.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation. Last year, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels and modules, while America shipped just $69 million, according to the New York Times. In its quest to prop up aging fossil-fuel industries, the Trump administration has slashed federal support for the emerging cleantech sector, handing his nation's chief economic rival the most generous of gifts: an unobstructed path to locking in its control of emerging energy technologies, and a leg up in inventing the industries of the future. Then it leveraged deep subsidies, targeted policies, and price wars to scale up production, drive product improvements, and slash costs. It's made similar moves in batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has set to work unraveling hard-won clean-energy achievements in the US, snuffing out the gathering momentum to rebuild the nation's energy sector in cleaner, more sustainable ways. The tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law in early July wound down the subsidies for solar and wind power contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation also cut off federal support for cleantech projects that rely too heavily on Chinese materials—a hamfisted bid to punish Chinese industries that will instead make many US projects financially unworkable. Meanwhile, the administration has slashed federal funding for science and attacked the financial foundations of premier research universities, pulling up the roots of future energy innovations and industries. A driving motivation for many of these policies is the quest to protect the legacy energy industry based on coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which the US is geologically blessed with. But this strategy amounts to the innovator's dilemma playing out at a national scale—a country clinging to its declining industries rather than investing in the ones that will define the future. It does not particularly matter whether Trump believes in or cares about climate change. The economic and international security imperatives to invest in modern, sustainable industries are every bit as indisputable as the chemistry of greenhouse gases. Without sustained industrial policies that reward innovation, American entrepreneurs and investors won't risk money and time creating new businesses, developing new products, or building first-of-a-kind projects here. Indeed, venture capitalists have told me that numerous US climate-tech companies are already looking overseas, seeking markets where they can count on government support. Some fear that many other companies will fail in the coming months as subsidies disappear, developments stall, and funding flags. All of which will help China extend an already massive lead. China harnessed the clean-energy transition to clean up its skies, upgrade its domestic industries, create jobs for its citizens, strengthen trade ties, and build new markets in emerging economies. In turn, it's using those business links to accrue soft power and extend its influence—all while the US turns it back on global institutions. These widening relationships increasingly insulate China from external pressures, including those threatened by Trump's go-to tactic: igniting or inflaming trade wars. But stiff tariffs and tough talk aren't what built the world's largest economy and established the US as the global force in technology for more than a century. It's a wild, Orwellian plea for you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears in a summer that saw record heat waves in the Midwest and East and is now blanketing the West in wildfire smoke. Over the weekend, more than 85 scientists sent a point-by-point, 459-page rebuttal to the federal government, highlighting myriad ways in which the report “is biased, full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making,” as Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers, put it on Bluesky. “The authors reached these flawed conclusions through selective filtering of evidence (‘cherry picking'), overemphasis of uncertainties, misquoting peer-reviewed research, and a general dismissal of the vast majority of decades of peer-reviewed research,” the dozens of reviewers found.The Trump administration handpicked researchers who would write the report it wanted to support its quarrel with thermometers and justify its preordained decision to rescind the endangerment finding.
