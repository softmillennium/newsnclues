Macrophages, which hoover up pathogens, have been implicated in the chronic inflammation that sets in with the march of time.Credit: Science Photo Library The inflammation-promoting cells emerge only in older mice, researchers found. Although the cells' precise role is unclear, they display several signatures associated with ‘inflammageing' — the persistent inflammation that develops as people grow older. “We did not anticipate that there would be a completely new cell type,” says study co-author Vishwa Deep Dixit, an immunobiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. When injuries or infections occur, the immune system mounts a protective response by releasing cells and proteins to affected tissues. But as we age, inflammation gradually increases and becomes persistent instead of being a state that occurs only when things go wrong. Ageing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world Ageing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world But the exact roles of each type of macrophage and how these cells change throughout the ageing process remain a mystery, says study co-author Elsie Gonzalez-Hurtado, also an immunobiologist at Yale University. “There wasn't really a good characterization of these cells.” A previously known type of macrophage that resides near nerves, for example, became less numerous in female mice as they grew older — but its numbers remained constant in males.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, how meal timing relates to our health remains less understood. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and their collaborators studied changes to meal timing in older adults and discovered people experience gradual shifts in when they eat meals as they age. "Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status. Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," said lead author Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity." Dashti and his colleagues -- including senior author Altug Didikoglu, MSc, PhD, of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey -- examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, health outcomes later in life. Notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. "Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," said Dashti. "Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults. Dashti noted that this has important implications as time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting gain popularity, where the health impacts of shifting meal schedules may differ significantly in aging populations from those in younger adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New Frontier of AI Hacking—Could Online Images Hijack Your Computer? Artificial-intelligence agents—touted as AI's next wave—could be vulnerable to malicious code hidden in innocent-looking images on your computer screen Compromised images can take over AI agents on user computers (image for illustrative purposes only). A website announces, “Free celebrity wallpaper!” You browse the images. There's Selena Gomez, Rihanna and Timothée Chalamet—but you settle on Taylor Swift. You set it as your desktop background, admire the glow. Instead it opens your web browser and downloads a file. What distinguishes an AI an agent from a chatbot is that it doesn't just talk—it acts, opening tabs, filling forms, clicking buttons and making reservations. And with that kind of access to your machine, what's at stake is no longer just a wrong answer in a chat window: if the agent gets hacked, it could share or destroy your digital content. Now a new preprint posted to the server arXiv.org by researchers at the University of Oxford has shown that images—desktop wallpapers, ads, fancy PDFs, social media posts—can be implanted with messages invisible to the human eye but capable of controlling agents and inviting hackers into your computer.

For instance, an altered “picture of Taylor Swift on Twitter could be sufficient to trigger the agent on someone's computer to act maliciously,” says the new study's co-author Yarin Gal, an associate professor of machine learning at Oxford. That means that the next person who sees your Twitter feed and happens to have an agent running will have their computer poisoned as well. Before you begin scrubbing your computer of your favorite photographs, keep in mind that the new study shows that altered images are a potential way to compromise your computer—there are no known reports of it happening yet, outside of an experimental setting. And of course the Taylor Swift wallpaper example is purely arbitrary; a sabotaged image could feature any celebrity—or a sunset, kitten or abstract pattern. Furthermore, if you're not using an AI agent, this kind of attack will do nothing. “They have to be very aware of these vulnerabilities, which is why we're publishing this paper—because the hope is that people will actually see this is a vulnerability and then be a bit more sensible in the way they deploy their agentic system,” says study co-author Philip Torr. Now that you've been reassured, let's return to the compromised wallpaper. To the human eye, it would look utterly normal. For this reason, agents built with AI systems that are open-source—that allow users to see the underlying code and modify it for their own purposes—are most vulnerable. Anyone who wants to insert a malicious patch can evaluate exactly how the AI processes visual data. “We have to have access to the language model that is used inside the agent so we can design an attack that works for multiple open-source models,” says Lukas Aichberger, the new study's lead author. By using an open-source model, Aichberger and his team showed exactly how images could easily be manipulated to convey bad orders. “Basically, we adjust lots of pixels ever-so-slightly so that when a model sees the image, it produces the desired output,” says study co-author Alasdair Paren. If this sounds mystifying, that's because you process visual information like a human. But the computer breaks the picture down into pixels and represents each dot of color as a number, and then it looks for patterns: first simple edges, then textures such as fur, then an ear's outline and clustered lines that depict whiskers. But because the computer relies on numbers, if someone changes just a few of them—tweaking pixels in a way too small for human eyes to notice—it still catches the change, and this can throw off the numerical patterns. Now why does the new study pay special attention to wallpapers? The agent can only be tricked by what it can see—and when it takes screenshots to see your desktop, the background image sits there all day like a welcome mat. The hidden command even survived resizing and compression, like a secret message that's still legible when photocopied. “On this website you can have additional attacks encoded in another malicious image, and this additional image can then trigger another set of actions that the agent executes, so you basically can spin this multiple times and let the agent go to different websites that you designed that then basically encode different attacks,” Aichberger says. The team hopes its research will help developers prepare safeguards before AI agents become more widespread. “This is the first step towards thinking about defense mechanisms because once we understand how we can actually make [the attack] stronger, we can go back and retrain these models with these stronger patches to make them robust. That would be a layer of defense,” says Adel Bibi, another co-author on the study. And even if the attacks are designed to target open-source AI systems, companies with closed-source models could still be vulnerable. “A lot of companies want security through obscurity,” Paren says. “But unless we know how these systems work, it's difficult to point out the vulnerabilities in them.” Gal believes AI agents will become common within the next two years. “People are rushing to deploy [the technology] before we know that it's actually secure,” he says.

Centromeres are epigenetically defined by the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Prior work in human centromeres has shown that CENP-A is associated with regions of hypomethylated DNA located within large arrays of hypermethylated repeats, but the functional importance of these DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed tools to perturb centromeric DNAme, revealing that it causally influences CENP-A positioning. We show that rapid loss of methylation results in increased binding of centromeric proteins and alterations in centromere architecture, leading to aneuploidy and reduced cell viability. We also demonstrate that gradual centromeric DNA demethylation prompts a process of cellular adaptation. Altogether, we find that DNAme causally influences CENP-A localization and centromere function, offering mechanistic insights into pathological alterations of centromeric DNAme. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAme) regulate chromatin architecture, gene transcription and cell division, and are often deregulated in cancer1. Centromeres, the chromosomal loci that control faithful chromosome segregation during cell division2, are epigenetically defined by chromatin enriched in the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A3,4, generally within highly repetitive DNA sequences5,6. CENP-A, along with other factors, identifies and maintains centromeric position indefinitely throughout the cell cycle7 and is a key player in maintaining centromere assembly and consequent faithful chromosome segregation8,9. CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed with canonical histone H3, with CENP-A representing 4–25% of nucleosomes in centromeric chromatin10,11, which constitutes about 10% of each repetitive sequence array on average12. What defines CENP-A position and boundaries within centromeric regions is still an open question. In canonical human centromeres, CENP-A assembles on direct (head-to-tail) tandem arrays of 171 base pair (bp) α-satellite (α-sat) DNA repeats13. α-Sat arrays are further arranged in higher-order repeats (HOR), which are themselves repeated hundreds to thousands of times to create homogeneous HOR arrays spanning up to 5 Mbp12. Although each chromosome may contain multiple distinct HOR arrays, CENP-A typically localizes within one array, deemed the ‘active' HOR array14. Approximately every other α-sat repeat unit contains a conserved 17 bp motif named the CENP-B box, which is bound by CENP-B, the only centromeric sequence-specific DNA-binding protein identified so far15 and a key player in centromere organization and function16. Recently, the complete assembly of centromere sequences revealed that centromeric DNA is heavily methylated with the exception of a small hypomethylated region within every active HOR array named the centromere dip region (CDR)17, which corresponds to a region of high CENP-A density11,12,17,18,19. These findings, along with the evidence that links alterations of DNAme at (peri-)centromeric regions and diseases such as cancer or immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome20,21, hint that DNAme is an important contributor to the epigenetic determination of centromere identity and stability22 (Fig. a, Scope of the paper. b, DNA (de)methylation cycle. c, Schematic of the DBDTET1AID active demethylation.

Addition of DOX leads to DBDTET1AID accumulation at centromeres (Fig. 1d,e) and to a gradual reduction in DNAme levels at centromeric regions as observed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA; Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. The catalytically inactive (or dead, dTET1) version of the construct had no effect on the centromeric DNAme levels despite its centromeric localization (Fig. DNA demethylation was not restricted to CENP-B-boxes, which harbor two CpG sites, and it spread throughout the centromeric α-sat repeats, while only minorly affecting noncentromeric regions including the flanking pericentromeric Human Satellite 2 (HSat2) regions (Fig. As expected from the TET-mediated active demethylation (Fig. 1b), the expression of DBDTET1AID led to a rapid centromeric accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)—the first and most abundant oxidation intermediate in the pathway26—that decreased at later time points (Fig. The kinetics of DNA demethylation were slower in the single-copy integration system compared to certain clones of the multicopy lentivirus integration (Extended Data Fig. 1g), and the rate of demethylation of the clones was dependent on DBDTET1AID expression levels based on centromeric fluorescence intensity (Fig. All centromeres were demethylated with similar kinetics (Extended Data Fig. The demethylation process is antagonized by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery as seen by the enhanced demethylation kinetics upon concomitant induction of a DBDTET1 construct with an AID-mediated degradation of the endogenous maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which doubled the rate of DNA demethylation (Fig. According to the role of DNMT1 in maintaining DNAme at centromeres, the rapid depletion of DNMT1 in DLD-1 cells27 led to a reduction of DNAme at α-sat and CENP-B boxes and, to similar extents, at pericentromeric HSat2 repeats (Fig. Co-depletion of DNMT1 and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, but not of DNMT3B alone, strongly affected DNAme levels, highlighting a cooperativity between DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the maintenance of (peri)centromeric DNAme. Altogether, these data show that the expression of DBDTET1 demethylates the centromeres and suggests that centromeric DNAme is mainly controlled by the canonical DNAme maintenance machinery, at least in somatic adult cells. We then addressed whether DNAme controls the position of human centromeres by modulating the binding of centromeric proteins (CENPs; Fig. CpG methylation of the CENP-B boxes was suggested to reduce the binding of CENP-B28,29 and CENP-B was previously implicated in promoting centromeric CENP-A assembly7,30. Using microscale thermophoresis, we determined in vitro that CENP-B has an eightfold stronger affinity for unmethylated CENP-B boxes (dissociation constant Kd ~ 0.3 µm) than for methylated ones (Kd ~ 2.5 µm; Fig. An increase of CENP-B signal at centromeric regions upon gradual DBDTET1AID-mediated DNA hypomethylation was confirmed in cells by immunofluorescence and CUT&RUN–qPCR (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. DOX induction times were chosen for each cell line based on their demethylation kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1g) and, unless stated otherwise, were followed by 2 days of auxin treatment to remove any possible steric hindrance of the TET1 enzyme bound to the centromeres. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed an increase of CENP-A levels at centromeres as DNAme levels decreased (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. The CENP-A increase was observed in all cell cycle phases (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f), including metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 2g), indicating that this increase is not an artifact due to centromeric clustering in interphase nuclei. Notably, the CENP-A/CENP-B increase was also observed when depleting DNMT1 and DNMT3B (Fig. A similar increase, although less consistently pronounced, was also observed for CENP-C (Fig. 2c,d,g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c,g), a key factor for the assembly of the kinetochore31 and known to interact with both CENP-A and CENP-B7. The increase of CENP-A signal was independent of the CENP-B increase as the siRNA-mediated knockdown of CENP-B did not prevent CENP-A accumulation at hypomethylated centromeres (Extended Data Fig. a, Schematic of experiments shown in (c–g). b, Affinity curves of CENP-B binding to methylated or unmethylated DNA. c,e, Representative immunofluorescence images in DLD-1 LV DBDTET1AID clone 6 at 4 days −/+DOX + 2 days IAA. c, Staining for CENP-A, CENP-B, and CENP-C.

Statistics defined by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons. To strengthen our observations on the inverse relationship between centromeric DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B levels, we fused the prokaryotic DNA methyltransferase MQ1Q147L or its catalytically inactive variant dMQ1 (C141S and S317A)32 to CENP-BDBD, generating, as for TET1, a dually controllable DOX/IAA system for targeted centromeric CpG hypermethylation (Fig. We inserted this system in RPE-1 cells for which a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly was recently published33, therefore allowing us to assess specifically the methylation levels of the CDRs where CENP-A is enriched. DOX induction of the active MQ1Q147L construct led to a rapid increase in DNAme within the CDRs (~1.8-fold increase in 4 days) and only minorly at the surrounding regions or at random genomic regions compared to the catalytically inactive dMQ1, as observed by ultralong read nanopore sequencing (Fig. In this condition, both CENP-A and CENP-B intensity levels at centromeres decreased (Fig. 2k), reinforcing the inverse relationship between DNAme and CENP-A/CENP-B centromeric binding. The increase in CENP-A levels could reflect a higher density of CENP-A nucleosomes within the same region or, alternatively, could mean that CENP-A expands beyond its canonical domain, that is the CDR, with CENP-A nucleosomes being deposited in newly hypomethylated positions. To test this hypothesis, we performed a directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) experiment using ultralong nanopore sequencing to map CENP-A molecules on single chromatin fibers11 before and after demethylation. DiMeLo-seq involves antibody-mediated tethering of a sequence-nonspecific prokaryotic adenine methyltransferase to a DNA-binding or chromatin-binding protein in permeabilized cells and the subsequent methylation of nearby accessible DNA as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). The exogenous m6A will be read along with endogenous 5mC by nanopore sequencing of native DNA (Fig. We performed DiMeLo-seq from a cell population and a single clone of CHM13 cells, for which a T2T assembly is available34, harboring lentiviral expression of the DBDTET1 construct. DBDTET1 expression led to a strong decrease of 5mC both within and near CDRs, therefore removing the DNAme boundaries across all CDRs (Fig. After this TET1-mediated centromeric DNA demethylation, we observed an increase in m6A, reflecting an accumulation of CENP-A (Fig. This increase in m6A was detected on the same reads harboring 5mC loss at active α-sat HOR arrays and specifically within and around CDRs (Fig. 3b), although m6A levels remained higher inside CDRs. We saw no effect of DBDTET1 expression on m6A levels (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e) across random genomic positions, further validating the DiMeLo approach. Unlike the population (Extended Data Fig. 4f), the single clone presents a reduction of DNAme outside centromeres, possibly due to leaky DBDTET1 expression during the prolonged time in culture (Extended Data Fig. a, Schematic depicting CENP-A targeted DiMeLo-seq experiment.

Given that hypomethylation causes CENP-A levels to increase within and around the CDRs of all centromeres, we then investigated other possible changes to the centromeric chromatin following hypomethylation. Fiber-seq revealed enhanced chromatin accessibility at both CDRs and flanking regions following centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. On the other hand, DiMeLo-seq detected little to no change in H3K9me3 levels following loss of DNAme at the CDR and flanking boundaries (Fig. 3k), which was corroborated by immunofluorescence imaging in mitotically arrested cells (Extended Data Fig. Altogether, these data indicate that rapid hypomethylation of centromeric regions decreases chromatin compaction, but it does not decrease the level of the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3 on these short time scales. We then assessed the short-term and long-term consequences of loss of centromeric DNAme for cell viability and chromosome segregation fidelity (Fig. Progressive centromeric DNAme reduction had a minor impact on the cell cycle, with a slight accumulation of cells in G2/M (Extended Data Fig. 5a), and a consistent negative effect on cell doubling and viability proportional to the kinetics of DNA demethylation in DLD-1 cells (Fig. These findings support a link between the level of centromeric DNAme and centromere function. Similar results were obtained in nontransformed, diploid RPE-1 cells expressing a DBDTET1 construct by lentiviral integration (Extended Data Fig. DLD-1 cells expressing the catalytically dead construct had a similar capacity to form colonies compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4c), indicating that the binding of ectopic TET1 to the CENP-B boxes in and of itself does not account for the negative impact of the catalytically active TET1 on cell viability. The centromeric demethylation rate from different DLD-1 clones correlated with an increased frequency of micronuclei formation (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5e), suggesting that the speed of centromeric demethylation (Fig. Time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence staining on a DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID revealed an increase in mitotic timing and chromosome mis-segregation in a DNAme-dependent manner (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5f), consistent with a loss of centromere function. Single-cell genome sequencing (scGS) further revealed that centromere-targeted acute demethylation causes a substantial increase in numerical and structural aneuploidies, with copy number alterations (CNA) occurring mostly near or at the centromeres (Fig. 5g,h), suggesting breaks at these regions. Loss of DNAme did not reveal any substantially distinct aneuploidy pattern (Fig. 4i), in agreement with the observed equal removal of DNAme at all centromeres. We conclude that both the total level of centromeric DNAme and the speed of DNA demethylation affect centromeric function. a, Schematic of the experiments shown in b–k. b, Real-time cell index of naïve DLD-1 cells (NT) and DOX pretreated (4 or 8 days) +DOX during the assay. c, Representative colony formation assays of DLD-1 LV DBDTET1AID clones (left), and ratio of colonies formed +DOX/NT (right). d, Percentage of cells with micronuclei at different demethylation levels. e, Correlation between the demethylation ratio at 0–2 days (Fig. 1g) and the change in percentage of cells with micronuclei (day 2 – day 0) for all clones. f, Mitosis presenting errors in time-lapse microscopy.

Recently, it was revealed that centromeres are organized into a bipartite structure during mitosis, which is important for chromosome segregation fidelity35. To assess whether centromeric demethylation compromised this structure, we performed super-resolution expansion microscopy36 on the DLD-1 clone expressing high levels of DBDTET1AID (Fig. Although the largest fraction of centromeres conserves a bipartite structure in cells with demethylation, we observed an increase in the number of centromeres with noncanonical structures (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and with more than two CENP-A sub-domains (Fig. These results, along with the observed increase in mitotic intercentromeric distance (Fig. 2g; second CENP-A/CENP-C peak shift), demonstrate that centromeric demethylation alters the global organization of CENP-A chromatin. Considering that one of the most prominent effects of centromeric hypomethylation is increased CENP-B binding, we tested whether removal of CENP-B could rescue the mitotic defects and cell lethality. To this end, we knocked out CENP-B by CRISPR–Cas9 in DLD-1 cells expressing high levels of the DBDTET1AID transgene to uncouple the effects of reduced DNAme from those related to increased CENP-B binding (Fig. Both the cell-growth defects and the frequency of micronuclei formation were reduced upon centromeric hypomethylation in CENP-BKO cells (Fig. Similarly, a mild ectopic overexpression of CENP-B—to mimic the levels observed following centromere hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. 6g) without affecting the normal centromeric methylation levels in DLD-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h)—led to a slight increase in micronuclei and few colonies formed compared to control and CENP-A overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. This observed CENP-B-mediated toxicity could be due to an increased accumulation of DNA loops30 leading to impairment of replication fork progression causing chromosome ruptures37,38, as observed by the increase in CNA number that occurs within centromeric regions following hypomethylation (Extended Data Fig. Accordingly, CENP-B overexpression caused a mild accumulation of the replication stress/DNA damage marker γH2A.X at centromeres during S-phase (Extended Data Fig. In addition, CENP-B knockout cells rescued with ectopic overexpressed full-length CENP-B (FL) had substantially higher centromeric breaks than cells rescued with a CENP-B mutant lacking the C-terminal dimerization domain (ΔC) that is required to form DNA loops30 (Extended Data Fig. Altogether, these results indicate that the accumulation of CENP-B at hypomethylated centromeric regions promotes genome instability and is partially responsible for the observed cell lethality following DNAme removal. This suggests that DNAme is an epigenetic layer that prevents excessive CENP-B binding to the centromeres. Finally, we tested whether cells could adapt to gradual centromeric hypomethylation (Fig. To this end, we treated DLD-1 Flp-In cells with DOX for 16 days to induce mild DBD-TET1AID expression. After the removal of the construct by auxin addition for another 16 days, α-sat methylation levels increased only marginally, without reaching the original level (Fig. Accordingly, centromeric CENP-A and CENP-B levels remained substantially higher compared to untreated cells even after prolonged washout (Fig. Similar results were observed in RPE-1 cells that transiently expressed DBDTET1AID followed by ~30 days washout (Extended Data Fig. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the new, stable epigenetic status of demethylated centromeres is translated into an equally stable increase of CENP-A and CENP-B levels. This suggests that, following slow and gradual hypomethylation, a process of cellular adaptation and remodeling of the centromeric protein landscape took place, ensuring cell survival in these new conditions. Accordingly, cells that were demethylated for either 8 or 16 days, then seeded in the absence of DOX, formed comparable numbers of colonies as fully methylated cells (Fig. In addition, cell viability did not further decrease in cells continuously treated for either 24 or 32 days with DOX compared to the 16-day treatment (Fig. These observations are in agreement with the stabilization in the percentage of cells with micronuclei at late hypomethylation times (Extended Data Fig. a, Scheme of the experiments shown in b–j.

To further test whether cells adapt to changes in DNAme, we generated a cellular model of ICF syndrome. This represents a unique physiological context in which centromeres have a naturally reduced level of methylation beginning in early development20,39. Patients affected by the disease have a poor life expectancy, mainly attributed to recurrent infections, but they can survive up to adulthood, proving that centromeric methylation is important but dispensable for cell survival40. To address the early consequences of the ICF mutations, we generated an ICF model in HTC116 cells by endogenously tagging both alleles of HELLS (Helicase Lymphoid-Specific, also known as LSH), which is mutated in ICF4 patients41, with mNeonGreen and an AID tag to mediate its rapid degradation (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. As expected from studies with patients, the degradation of HELLS causes DNA demethylation of specific genomic loci, including both pericentromeric (HSat2) and centromeric repeats as measured by nanopore sequencing, COBRA and pyrosequencing, but with extremely slow kinetics (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. As for the DBDTET1AID system, both CENP-A and CENP-B levels increased as a consequence of centromeric demethylation (Fig. CENP-B levels increased only slightly, in agreement with the less pronounced demethylation of CENP-B boxes compared to the DNMT1AID or DBDTET1AID cells (Fig. Similar results were observed in ICF3 (CDCA7 mutations) patient-derived fibroblasts (Fig. In accordance with the hypothesis of cellular adaptation after slow centromeric DNA demethylation induced using TET1 targeting, degradation of HELLS has no effect on cell viability even at late time points, when the centromeres are demethylated to similar levels of the DLD-1 cells expressing the DBDTET1AID constructs (Fig. Altogether, these results show that gradual and slow centromeric demethylation gives cells time to adapt to a new epigenetic landscape. DNAme is a fundamental epigenetic mark that regulates key cellular processes, and which is often altered in disease. Centromeres notably lose methylation in cancer and in ICF syndrome, highlighting the importance of centromeric methylation for the normal physiology of the cell. Here we have demonstrated that DNAme acts as a boundary to help define the position of CENP-A chromatin, and the loss of centromeric DNAme induces centromere alterations, resulting in aneuploidy and increased cell lethality (Fig. Centromeric hypomethylation causes an increase in CENP-A and CENP-B binding to the centromeres and allows CENP-A to spread outside the CDR boundary. A rapid, short-term demethylation of the centromeres causes chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy and reduced viability. A slow, long-term demethylation leads to cellular adaptation to the new epigenetic status. Centromeres have a unique epigenetic landscape that sets these regions apart from the rest of the genome. While active α-sat HOR arrays are overall highly methylated, the CDR has been described in all active human centromeres12,17,18,19,41 and also in the eastern hoolock gibbon42, highlighting a functional link between DNAme and centromere position that transcends the human species. By using human cell models to induce targeted DNA demethylation, our data demonstrate that the hypomethylation of the CDR helps to define the localization of CENP-A. However, what determines the initial anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme remains unknown. Either CENP-A nucleosomes could favor the hypomethylation of the CDR or DNAme might prevent CENP-A loading. Neither possibility is mutually exclusive and could act together as a positive feedback loop. These residues are present in H3 and are ubiquitinated by UHRF1, promoting DNMT1 recruitment independently of DNA replication43, a process crucial for maintaining DNAme in mid-to-late-replicating regions, like centromeres38,44. As a result, centromeric DNAme maintenance may be inefficient, causing passive methylation loss in CENP-A-rich regions. The anticorrelation between CENP-A and DNAme has also been recently observed at nonrepetitive neocentromere sites, suggesting that CENP-A loading in a given locus might prevent its DNAme45,46. For the second hypothesis, we can envision that DNAme disfavors the assembly of new CENP-A, possibly affecting nucleosome positioning and stability as observed for H3 at HSat2/HSat3 regions47, and/or the chromatin interaction of components involved in CENP-A deposition. Loss of DNAme at centromeres caused an enhanced deposition of CENP-A at CDR and a mild spreading outside of the CDRs. This rapid change in CENP-A was observed only after 4 days of active demethylation in the CHM13 clone, which represents approximately two cell divisions. Our data suggest that the rapid loss of DNAme creates a permissive chromatin environment conducive to the incorporation of new CENP-A nucleosomes, not only within the CDR itself but also in its flanking regions. Previously and/or newly deposited CENP-A accumulates and spreads into these new chromatin environments, likely mediated by enhanced chromatin accessibility, which we observed by Fiber-seq. In this view, we cannot exclude that heterochromatin domains flanking CENP-A also have a role in controlling boundaries, as recently observed45, although, in our time scales, H3K9me3 levels barely changed. This indicates that loss of DNAme per se is sufficient to favor CENP-A spreading outside the CDR, likely replacing canonical histone H3. It is possible that with longer time in culture, the position of CENP-A could drift further away from the original CDR after DNA demethylation, as observed following long-term depletion of heterochromatin-forming enzymes45. Centromere drifting was already observed in nonrepetitive centromeres of chicken cells48 and equids49 and occurs at neocentromeres as observed in the human45,46 and in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii50. The driving force that mediates CENP-A movement in hypomethylated centromeres remains to be elucidated. Here we speculate that, following the initial loss of DNAme boundaries, CENP-A nucleosomes redistribute during DNA replication and/or with transcription. This idea is supported by the particularly high number of replication origins found within the α-sats38 and by the fact that changes in DNAme are well known to be associated with deregulation in replication51 and transcription52. In addition, changes in DNAme have also been associated with changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization51,53, although only disrupting specific heterochromatin compartments27,54, that in turn could promote CENP-A deposition to certain locations, even favoring neocentromere formation55. The changes of the overall architecture of centromeres following hypomethylation observed in our experiments are likely to be directly responsible for the observed chromosome mis-segregation. The increase in CENP-A sub-domains as a consequence of DNAme loss could promote incorrect kinetochore/microtubule attachment, possibly by incrementing the incidence of merotelic attachments35. It can also induce changes in the stiffness of the centromere/kinetochore interface, possibly through condensin56 or CENP-B30 misregulation. It is also possible that promiscuous CENP-A incorporation outside its predefined domain could weaken centromere/kinetochore function. In this view, if the expansion and loading of CENP-A is not balanced, it is possible that the local CENP-A concentration will not be sufficient to form stable higher-order chromatin structures compatible with kinetochore assembly, similarly to what was proposed for CENP-T57. Our data highlight that the chromosome segregation defects observed in centromeric hypomethylated cells can be partially attributed to the demethylation-dependent increase of CENP-B. Here we show that while CENP-B is important for the normal topology of human centromeres, sustaining mechanical tension at the kinetochore/microtubules interface30, enhanced CENP-B binding interferes with DNA replication, possibly by forming an excessive amount of DNA loops, which in turn promote centromeric instability. This suggests that, at centromeric regions, the CENP-B-mediated fragility of centromeric DNA has a direct role in the observed aneuploidy and translocations of hypomethylated cells, possibly also fueled by the DNA damage repair activity of the TET1-mediated demethylation58. Therefore, we propose DNAme as an epigenetic layer that regulates centromere stability by controlling the binding of CENP-B to centromeric regions (Fig. However, the fact that two CDRs have been detected on the Y chromosome59, the only human chromosome that lacks CENP-B boxes and CENP-B binding15, is a strong indication that the role of DNAme at the centromere is not limited to the regulation of CENP-B binding. While rapid demethylation has severe effects on the cells, a slower and gradual demethylation of the centromeric DNA prompts a process of cellular adaptation as observed in the mild TET1-expressing cells and ICF4 (HELLS) cellular model. The molecular mechanisms by which cells adapt to low centromeric DNAme are still elusive, but this phenomenon can be related to the survival of ICF syndrome patients beyond early childhood despite having low centromeric methylation levels. Finally, our results offer mechanistic insights into the genesis of genome instability observed in certain cancers that display hypomethylation of repetitive regions, such as breast adenocarcinomas60, Wilms tumors61 and hepatocellular carcinomas62. While the association with genome instability was mainly established for pericentromeric repeats such as HSat2, it will be interesting to study how this imbalance in DNAme maintenance, including the dysregulation of TET enzymes, impacts specifically centromere functionality and stability, further promoting aneuploidy and chromosome rearrangements21,22,63. Altogether, our findings provide unambiguous experimental evidence that DNAme influences CENP-A localization and is a major determinant in regulating centromere functionality. Our results provide a direct connection between the loss of DNAme at centromeres and the pathological chromosomal alterations also observed in ICF and cancer, highlighting the functional importance of DNAme for human centromere biology.

Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min for 20 h using an inverted Eclipse Ti-E microscope (Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 (Yokogawa) spinning disk integrated in Metamorph software, and a four-laser bench (Gataca systems). Furthermore, ~45 μm z-stacks were acquired (z-step size = 3 μm) with a ×60 CFI Plan Apo VC oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The microscope has a motorized Nano z100 piezo stage (Mad City Lab), a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit) and an EMCCD camera (Evolve, Photometrics). For the quantification of fluorescence intensity at the centromeres of cells in interphase, an automatic analysis was performed by detecting the maximum intensity of CENP-C per nucleus, drawing 0.3 μm radius circles (region of interest (ROI)) and measuring the fluorescence of each channel on each ROI (custom Macro script, available upon request). For the quantification of fluorescence intensity in metaphase cells, circles of 0.84 μm radius were automatically drawn (custom Macro script, available upon request) and manually adjusted to encompass the whole centromere of each chromosome. For the line-scan quantification, the fluorescence intensity on each channel was measured along >3.5 μm long lines manually drawn across the centromeres. The data were manually phased to align the first peak of CENP-C with each centromere. Genomic DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Between 0.5 and 2 µg of DNA (equalized quantity for parallel comparisons) was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The converted DNA was amplified by PCR using locus-specific primers64 (Supplementary Table 1). PCR reactions were performed with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 200 μm of each primer and 0.5 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR products were digested for 3 h with 10 U of the appropriate enzyme at its digestion temperature (Supplementary Table 1). An equal amount of PCR product was incubated alongside the digestions without enzyme (undigested control). The full digests were loaded in 3% agarose gels. Images were acquired using a ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) and band intensities were quantified using Fiji. Bisulfite conversion affects C, 5fC and 5caC, all being considered as unmethylated DNA. The enrichment of centromeric DNA (CenRICH) was performed as described before65. Nanopore long-read sequencing was performed after CenRICH. The DNA was treated with the Short Read Eliminator kit (cutoff < 25 kb, Circulomics SKUSS-100-101-01) to remove contamination from shorter DNA fragments. Libraries were prepared using the Library Preparation by Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)), quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and checked by capillary electrophoresis with a TapeStation 4150 system (Agilent). The sequencing was performed on a Spot-ON Flow Cell (R9.4.1) on a MinION Mk1B device. The raw nanopore data were basecalled using the ONT software Guppy version 4.0 with a high accuracy modified-bases model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5mc_hac.cfg), which at the time could only identify 5mC modification. The resulting data were then converted with the fast5mod utility (https://github.com/nanoporetech/fast5mod), to produce as output the sequences of all nanopore reads and their per-base likelihood of methylation, expressed as a value ranging from 0 to 255. Details of the reads processing can be found in Supplementary Methods. DiMeLo-seq was performed as described in ref. The CHM13 population was sequenced with R9 chemistry (Supplementary Methods). The CHM13 single clone and RPE-1 hypermethylation experiments were sequenced with R10 chemistry. Fiber-seq was performed using the same protocol as DiMeLo-seq, with the following alterations: the primary antibody binding, protein A-Hia5 binding and activation steps were skipped. Instead, following nuclear isolation, nuclei were washed once in Tween-wash, then incubated with 1 µM free Hia5 and 800 µM S-adenosyl methionine in 100 µl activation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Supernatant was removed, and nuclei were resuspended in 1× PBS. Ultrahigh molecular weight gDNA was extracted using the NEB Monarch UHMW DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue (NEB, T3010), with a modified protocol. Nuclei from DiMeLo-seq or Fiber-seq reactions were resuspended in 40 µl of 1× PBS. In a separate tube, 1.8 ml NEB Monarch HMW gDNA Tissue Lysis Buffer and 60 µl proteinase K were premixed, then used to gently resuspend nuclei by pipetting with a wide-bore tip. The sample was then incubated at 56 °C for 10 min. Next, 15 µl of RNase A was added, and the sample was returned to the thermomixer to incubate for ten more minutes at 56 °C, this time with agitation at 650–750 rpm. Two glass beads were added to the sample, and 2.5 ml of isopropanol was added. The tube was gently inverted by hand until a clear, jelly-like substance was seen forming around the glass beads. The beads were washed twice with 2 ml Wash Buffer and then were transferred to a bead retainer with a collection tube beneath, quickly spun to remove liquid and quickly transferred into 200 µl extraction elution buffer from the ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10). Beads were transferred to a bead retainer with a clean Eppendorf tube beneath and spun at 1,000g for 1 min. The eluted DNA solution was then brought up to a final volume of 750 µl with extraction elution buffer, and quantified by Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q3328). Samples were prepared for sequencing using an ONT Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (ONT SQK-ULK001 for R9 and SQK-ULK114 for R10) and sequenced using one PromethION flow cell per sample, achieving estimated N50 values of 50–90 kb and throughput of 33–60 Gb per sample for the CHM13 population, estimated N50 values of 124–127 kb and throughput of 36–44 Gb for the CHM13 single clone CENP-A DiMeLo-seq, estimated N50 values of 120–130 kb and throughput of 12 Gb for the CHM13 single clone H3K9me3 DiMeLo-seq, N50 values of 79–86 kb and throughput 37–78 Gb for the CHM13 single clone Fiber-seq. Adaptive sampling was performed on all R10 experiments to deplete noncentromeric reads by providing a bed file with the genome-wide complement of all α-satellite HOR arrays in chm13v2.0 plus a 100 kb buffer to either side. Nanopore (R10) DiMeLo-seq raw data (.pod5 files) were aligned to the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome and basecalled using dorado (v.0.8.3) and DNA model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v5.0.0 with the following option specified: --modified-bases 6 mA 5mCG_5hmCG. Native barcoding runs had the following additional option specified: --kit-name SQK-NBD114-24. Aligned reads were filtered for primary alignment and sorted using samtools (v1.16.1). Barcoded runs were demultiplexed with dorado demux (v0.8.3). Centromeric ‘core' reads were defined as those overlapping T2T-CHM13v2.0 CDR coordinates, as specified in ref. Noncore reads (α-sat) were defined as those overlapping active α-satellite HOR, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium), but excluding CDR coordinates with a 10 kb buffer. Overlapping reads were isolated using samtools view (v1.16.1) and bedtools intersect (v2.30.0). Modification calls were dynamically thresholded using modkit call-mods (v0.1.13) with default parameters. Calls above the empirically determined threshold were clamped to certainty, while those below were discarded. Nucleosomes were called with the ft add-nucleosomes subcommand with default parameters using fibertools (v0.5.3). Chromatin accessibility was assessed by computing the proportion of methylation-sensitive patches over 50 bp using ft extract (fibertools v0.5.3) and custom Python scripts. To assess methylation levels at CDRs, samtools view was used to filter for reads aligning to α-sat HOR sequences, as specified in chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed (T2T Consortium). Reads were converted to fasta format with samtools fasta (v1.16.1), re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference genome33 using minimap2 (v2.26-r1175) with parameters specifying ONT sequencing (-x map-ont), then converted back to bam format and filtered for primary alignment with samtools view. MM/ML tags were repaired by broadcasting modification calls from the original BAM file with modkit repair (v0.1.13). Reads were visualized in IGV (v2.18.2 and v2.19.1). To assess off-target methylation, reads were converted to fastq format with samtools fastq (v1.16.1) with the -T MM, ML option specified to preserve modification calls and re-aligned to the RPE-1 reference with minimap2 with the following options specified: -ax map-ont --eqx -y --MD. Re-aligned reads were converted back to BAM format, filtered for primary alignment and sorted with samtools view and samtools sort, respectively. A bed file defining 10,000 random 1,000 bp intervals across the RPE-1 genome was generated with bedtools random (v2.30.0). Reads corresponding to these random intervals were isolated using bedtools intersect (v2.30.0), and the output was re-indexed with samtools index. To generate rolling profile plots, modkit pileup (v0.1.13) was used to count modifications at each reference position. The resulting bedGraph file was sorted using bedtools (v2.30.0), then converted to a bigWig file with bedGraphToBigWig (v2.10). The bigWig file was used to plot rolling mCpG/CpG values with a custom Python script. To quantify the kinetics of 5mCpG-to-5hmCpG-to-CpG conversion, we analyzed a time-course dataset from DLD-1 cells generated using native barcoding nanopore sequencing (R10 chemistry). Sequencing and basecalling were performed with the same parameters described above for DiMeLo-seq. The data were processed using modkit pileup with the --cpg setting enabled, and a CpG modification threshold of 0.8 was applied to classify cytosines as methylated (mCpG), hydroxymethylated (hmCpG) or unmethylated. CpG sites were then filtered to retain only those present in reads aligning within CENP-B boxes and α-sat HORs. Cells grown on 12 mm coverslip (1.5H) were permeabilized for 1 min with 0.1 M PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) with 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by fixation for 10 min with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) in PBS. Both pre-extraction and fixation solution were prewarmed to 37 °C. After fixation, coverslips were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA, 0.5% Triton in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted at 1:100 in 3% BSA were added to the coverslips and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Next, cells were washed thrice with 0.5% Triton in PBS and incubated with DAPI (1 μg ml−1) and secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in 3% BSA 0.5% Triton in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed thrice with PBS and prepared for ExM. Stained samples were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 Acryloyl-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A20770) in PBS for 2 h, washed thrice with PBS and incubated for 5 min in monomer solution (1× PBS, 2 M NaCl, 2.5% (wt/wt) acrylamide, 0.15% (wt/wt) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and 8.625% (wt/wt) sodium acrylate). Coverslips were placed on top of a drop of 90 μl of freshly prepared gelation solution (monomer solution supplemented with 0.2% (wt/wt) TEMED and 0.2% (wt/wt) APS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Gels were then incubated in digestion solution (8 U ml−1 proteinase K, 1× TAE, 0.5% TX-100, 0.8 M guanidine HCl) for 2 h at 37 °C and washed in PBS containing DAPI (1 μg ml−1). Full expansion was performed in a 10-cm plate by several washings of 30 min with excess volume of Milli-Q water (~4 to 4.5-fold expansion). Expanded samples were immobilized on 25 mm (1.5H) coverslips covered with 0.01% (wt/vol) poly-l-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich, P8920) and imaged on a Nikon Ti-E motorized microscope equipped with a Zyla 4.2Mpx sCMOS camera (Andor) and 100×1.35-NA objective lens (Nikon). Images were acquired as z-stacks at 0.3 μm intervals. Images from Nikon and Zeiss systems were deconvolved with Huygens Professional (v20.10) using up to 40 iterations of the Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm with theoretical PSF. The images were only adjusted in brightness and contrast on raw or deconvoluted data using the Fiji software. The number of subunits per single centromere was manually scored in z-stacks using Fiji. Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol buffer and by sonication. The lysates were BCA-quantified and denatured at 95 °C in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE using TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris–buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG (0.8 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; clone 14C10; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-HELLS (0.75 μg ml−1; Proteintech), rabbit anti-CENP-B (1 μg ml−1 polyclonal; Abcam, ab25734) or mouse antivinculin (1:2,000; clone hVIN-1, Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired on a ChemiDoc imager (Bio-Rad) and analyzed on Image Lab software (v6.1; Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis of all the graphs was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, www.graphpad.com). Details, including the value of cells and/or of centromeres measured, are reported in the figure legends. Full statistical test results can be found in Supplementary Table 5. Briefly, when possible GraphPad Prism's normality test was used to determine whether data followed a normal distribution. Depending on the data distribution, unpaired t test or Mann–Whitney test were used to compare two groups, ordinary one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test to compare more than two groups, Fisher's exact test to compare categorical data and one-sample t test to compare samples to a fixed value. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. All experiments were performed using several biological replicates. The number of biological replicates and of measurements for each experiment is indicated in the corresponding figure legend. Several steps were taken to ensure the reproducibility of experimental findings and key results were confirmed using complementary experimental approaches. With respect to data randomization, sample assignment to treatment and control groups, as well as data collection, were performed randomly without prior assessment of any cell culture characteristics. Generally, data collection and analysis were not performed blindly to the experimental conditions; however, quantitative image analyses, which are at the heart of all presented data, were independent of experimental conditions. No data were excluded from the analyses. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis through its thermogenic effects and the secretion of regulatory molecules. Here we report that RAP250 haploinsufficiency stimulates BAT in mice, thus contributing to a decrease in fat accumulation. Local in vivo AAV-mediated RAP250 silencing in BAT reduces body weight and fat mass and enhances glucose oxidation, thereby indicating that RAP250 participates in the regulation of BAT metabolic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms led to the finding that Neuritin 1 is produced and released by brown adipocytes, it plays a key metabolic role, and it participates in the enhanced BAT metabolic activity under RAP250 deficiency. Forced overexpression of Neuritin 1 in UCP1-expressing cells markedly decreases fat mass and body weight gain in mice and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Neuritin 1-deficient brown adipocytes also shows a reduced β-adrenergic response. We demonstrate a metabolic role of BAT-derived Neuritin 1 acting through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Based on our results, Neuritin-1 emerges as a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, affecting 650 million people worldwide (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight). Comorbidities of obesity—most notably type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia—are now major public health concerns1. Recent data also indicate that obesity is associated with a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 and risk of fatality2,3. Thus, there is an urgent need to delineate the precise mechanisms that underlie the onset of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an organ specialized in performing non-shivering thermogenesis, and it is present in adult human subjects4,5,6. The capacity of thermogenic fat to oxidize substrates and increase energy expenditure has drawn growing interest as a therapeutic approach to tackle obesity and associated metabolic disorders7. BAT thermogenesis requires the release of norepinephrine from local sympathetic axons; norepinephrine activates the β-adrenergic receptor-cAMP-PKA pathway in brown adipocytes to drive lipolysis and thermogenic respiration8. The release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and β3-adrenergic receptor binding to brown adipocytes determine the level of thermogenesis in BAT by regulating the activity of lipases, providing the immediate fuel molecules for BAT mitochondria and heat production8. Recent data indicate that brown adipocytes secrete multiple signaling molecules, named batokines, including FGF21, Myostatin, CXCL14, EPDR1 and adiponectin, among others, which operate as endocrine factors9,10,11,12,13,14. Regarding the locally-acting factors, some of them are produced by vascular cells, while others are generated by brown adipocytes15,16,17,18. The action of these local factors is highly variable, ranging from effects promoting neurite outgrowth from sympathetic neurons to direct effects on the metabolism of brown adipocytes. RAP250 (encoded by NCOA6 gene) is a co-activator of nuclear hormone receptors. It also transactivates other transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, CBP, heat shock factor 1, SRF, E2F-1, Rb, NFκβ, and C/EBPα19. RAP250 is also an integral and unique component of a Set1-like complex named ASCOM (for ASC-2 complex), which contains histone H3-Lys-4-methyltransferase (H3K4MT) MLL3 or its paralogue MLL420,21. RAP250 is a pleiotropic modulator that affects growth, development, reproduction, apoptosis, and wound healing22. MLL3Δ/Δ mice show decreased adiposity and enhanced insulin sensitivity, although the underlying target tissues were not studied28. In this work, we focused on the metabolic effects caused by the haploinsufficiency of RAP250. We report that RAP250 modulates the thermogenic activity of BAT in mice. Surprisingly, BAT from RAP250-deficient mice showed enhanced expression of Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), a protein that impacts on the central nervous system29,30,31,32. AAV-mediated expression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells caused metabolic effects leading to a reduction in fat mass and the induction of BAT thermogenic genes. The repression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells disrupted the capacity of these cells to respond to a β-adrenergic receptor agonist. Based on previous reports indicating that RAP250 regulates metabolic homeostasis23,24,25,26,27,28, we examined whether it plays a relevant role in energy metabolism. To this aim, we monitored the phenotype of male mice heterozygous for RAP250 (RAP250+/) since homozygous knockout mice show prenatal lethality33. Heterozygous mice showed an almost 50% decrease in RAP250 expression in inguinal (ING) adipose tissue, brown (BAT) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig. Control (wild-type, WT) and RAP250+/− male mice showed a similar body weight at 10 weeks of age but later diverged, the latter being leaner, despite increased food intake (Fig. Thirty-week-old male RAP250+/− mice also showed smaller inguinal (ING) and perigonadal (PAT) adipose tissues compared with control animals (Fig. However, no differences in heart, skeletal muscle or liver weight were detected (Fig. We monitored the gain of adipose tissue volume by microCT in several sets of male mice. Data revealed that the differences in the size of subcutaneous and visceral depots (the latter defined as the sum of omental, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and perigonadal depots) were fully established at 30 weeks of age and were maintained thereafter (Fig. In keeping with a reduced adipose mass, male RAP250+/− mice showed a markedly reduced adipose cell size (Fig. 1H, I) and low plasma leptin levels (Fig. Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− male mice (Fig. 1K), thereby suggesting no changes in cellularity. Thirty-seven-week-old but not thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice showed a reduced body weight compared to controls (Fig. ING or PAT adipose depots were also reduced in female RAP250+/− mice at the age of 37 weeks (Fig. Total DNA present in ING or PAT adipose tissues was similar in control and RAP250+/− female mice (Fig. A Body weight curves for 12- to 25-week-old male mice. Data are expressed as grams of body weight (WT n = 6, black open symbols; RAP250+/− n = 5, red symbols, and labeled as RAP250). B Food intake as grams of daily intake in 20- to 30-week-old mice (n = 11). Data are expressed as grams of tissue weight (n = 10). D Representative images of PAT and ING depots from WT and RAP250+/− male mice. E Transversal gray scale image of mouse abdominal region showing the subcutaneous adipose mass (SAT) and visceral adipose mass (VAT); vertebrae are seen as the denser white structures; least dense areas represent the adipose mass, and the layer that separates the visceral compartment from the subcutaneous region can be observed.

H PAT paraffin slices stained with Hematoxylin/Eosin (scale bar=100 µm). I PAT adipocyte cell size of 30-week-old male mice (n = 5, 52–200 cells counted per animal). J Plasma leptin in 16-h fasted 30-week-old male mice (n = 22 for WT, n = 18 for RAP250+/). K Total DNA in ING and PAT depots of male mice. Data are expressed as μg of DNA per depot (in ING depots n = 9 for WT and n = 6 for RAP250+/−, in PAT depots n = 10 for WT and n = 7 for RAP250+/−). Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B, C, F, I, J and K) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (A and G). Next, we analyzed the response of RAP250+/− mice to a high-fat diet (HFD). Male mice subjected to a 60% fat diet gained body weight throughout the experiment (Fig. S2A), and RAP250+/− mice consistently remained leaner than control counterparts (Fig. S2A) under conditions in which food intake was similar in both genotypes (Fig. HFD-treated RAP250+/− mice also showed a smaller visceral fat depot (Fig. S2C) and lower plasma leptin levels compared to control animals (Fig. Female RAP250+/− mice also showed a lower body weight and reduced adipose depots after a HFD (Fig. These data reveal that male and female RAP250+/− mice are resistant to HFD-induced obesity. Upon fasting, male RAP250+/− mice showed normal levels of plasma glucose, adiponectin and free fatty acids, and reduced concentrations of plasma insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol on a normal diet (ND) (Fig. Administration of a HFD for 20 weeks caused high plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin in control male mice, but concentrations remained within the normal range in RAP250+/− counterparts (Fig. Studies performed in 30-week-old male RAP250+/− mice on a standard diet showed improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin secretion compared to control mice (Fig. Glucose tolerance was also improved in male RAP250+/− mice fed with HFD (Fig. 2G), and under these conditions, plasma insulin was markedly attenuated (Fig. C Fasting plasma glucose (n = 12) and D insulin levels (WT n = 10 and RAP250+/− n = 12) of 30-week-old male mice under a high-fat diet (HFD). I Whole-body glucose turnover (Turnover), hepatic glucose production (HGP), whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), whole-body glycolysis rate (Glycolysis), and whole-body glycogen synthesis rate (Glycogen synthesis) were measured in a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (1.5 mU/kg/min insulin) in 30-week-old male mice (n = 9 for WT and n = 8 for RAP250+/−). J Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained paraffin slices of liver after 20 weeks of a HFD (scale bar=200 µm), and (K) Liver fat content as % of low density area (Lipid Droplets) over total histology slice area (n = 5, 25 slices per group). Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B, C, D, F, I and K) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (E, G, and H). Female RAP250+/− mice showed no changes in plasma glucose or insulin under a standard diet or HFD (Fig. Thirty-week-old female RAP250+/− mice subjected to either a standard diet or HFD also showed enhanced glucose tolerance in the absence of changes in plasma insulin levels (Fig. The impact of RAP250 deficiency on whole-body glucose utilization was also monitored in conscious male mice on a normal diet during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (Fig. Under hyperinsulinemia, RAP250+/− mice showed an increase in whole-body glucose infusion rate (GIR), glucose turnover (Turnover), whole-body glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis rate (Fig. Thus, these animals were indeed more insulin-sensitive than control mice. Moreover, hepatic steatosis induced by the HFD was prevented in RAP250+/− male mice, as reflected by large differences in hepatic fat deposition (Fig. In all, this pattern of changes suggests that RAP250+/− mice of both sexes show improved glucose tolerance as a consequence of the improved insulin sensitivity, which occurs even in the absence of changes in adiposity. We next questioned whether the reduced adiposity detected in RAP250+/− mice derives from a higher rate of energy expenditure, thereby explaining a lower fat content and a parallel increased food intake. Indeed, RAP250+/− mice showed improved whole-body O2 consumption and CO2 production, as shown by ANCOVA analysis (Fig. Energy expenditure, glucose oxidation, and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were also increased (Fig. Exposure of control and RAP250+/− mice to a HFD for 20 weeks maintained most of the alterations detected under a standard diet, such as increased O2 consumption, CO2 production, energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation (Fig. S4E–H), and again, no changes in locomotor activity were detected (Fig. A Whole-body oxygen consumption in male mice.

Representative images for UCP1, PPARγ, C/EBPα and α-Tubulin proteins in BAT extracts (M) from 20-week-old mice and quantification of protein expression (N). Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (A, D, E, G, I, J, L and N) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (C). Given these observations, we explored the involvement of BAT in this phenotype. Interscapular BAT mass was reduced in RAP250+/− mice (Fig. 3D), and glucose oxidation was markedly enhanced in isolated brown adipocytes obtained from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. In addition, histological examination revealed less accumulation of lipids and a smaller lipid droplet size in RAP250-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. Additional histological analyses using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, to label the cell surface), DAPI (to label the nuclei), and anti-UCP1 antibody (to measure the differentiation state of adipocytes) were performed in BAT sections. Triple staining showed an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from RAP250+/− mice, consistent with an enhanced metabolic activity (Fig. In addition, data showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. Electron microscopy also revealed the presence of larger mitochondria in brown adipose cells in these mice (Fig. To further study the alterations in BAT caused by RAP250 deficiency, we performed RNA-Seq analysis. More than 500 genes were significantly upregulated and more than 330 were downregulated in BAT from RAP250+/− mice (Fig. In keeping with the RNA-seq analysis, the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic genes such as Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Dio2, Ppargc1a, and Ucp1 was markedly increased in RAP250-deficient BAT, as determined by real-time PCR assays (Fig. In addition, the abundance of proteins PPARγ, C/EBPα and UCP1 was increased in brown adipose tissue from RAP250+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. In all, these data highly support the view that BAT is metabolically more active in RAP250-deficient mice compared to control, and that it may contribute to enhanced energy expenditure in response to RAP250 deficiency. Our data indicate that RAP250 is a negative regulator of BAT metabolism in mice. In order to further analyze this, we studied the impact of cold exposure on the BAT expression of RAP250. Exposure for 8 h to cold (4 °C) induced the expression of genes Ucp1, Ppargca1, and Pde3b, and this was accompanied by a marked repression of RAP250 gene expression (Fig. In parallel to these observations, exposure of brown adipocytes for 2 h in the presence of IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induced Rgs2 and reduced RAP250 (Fig. This suggests that RAP250 participates in the activation of thermogenesis of brown adipocytes during cold and that the response is mediated by cAMP. In addition, RAP250 heterozygous mice showed a greater induction of Ucp1 mRNA levels in BAT in response to cold exposure (Fig. Under these conditions a greater induction of glucose oxidation was also detected in RAP250+/− mice during cold (Fig. Next, we addressed whether local alterations in BAT were sufficient to induce some of the metabolic alterations detected in RAP250+/− mice. To repress RAP250 in interscapular brown adipose, we injected adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding shRNAs directed against RAP250, under H1 promoter, into the BAT of 2 month-old C57Bl/6 J mice (control mice were injected with AAVs encoding a scramble sequence). The injection of shRAP250 AAVs into this tissue reduced RAP250 expression (Fig. 4A and B), and this led to a significant decrease in body weight (Fig. 4C) and fat mass up to 10 weeks after the injection (Fig. In addition, shRAP250-injected mice showed enhanced glucose oxidation (Fig. 4E) and an improved respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Fig. The expression of UCP1 protein was also enhanced in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. Under these conditions, plasma leptin levels remained unaltered (Fig. Representative image for RAP250 protein expression (A) and quantification (B) in BAT extracts from 32-week-old male mice 24 weeks after injection with Scr or ShRAP250 AAVs into BAT.

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (B and G) and Ordinary two-way ANOVA (C, D, E, F and J) and two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparison test (K, L and O). In parallel studies, the perigonadal (epididymal) adipose tissue depots of 2 month-old C57Bl/6J male mice were injected with shRAP250- or scramble RNA-encoding AAVs. Data indicate that shRAP250 AAV administration reduced RAP250 expression in adipose tissue by 50% (Fig. S6A and B) 24 weeks after AAV injection. Under these conditions, body weight and total fat mass or perigonadal adipose depots were not altered in the RAP250-deficient group (Fig. RAP250 deficiency in WAT depots did not alter RER or glucose oxidation (Fig. Plasma leptin levels were not altered upon PAT gene manipulation (Fig. Based on our data, we propose that selective repression of RAP250 in BAT is the main driver that leads to alterations in energy expenditure that resemble those detected in RAP250+/− mice. Next, we examined whether the metabolic profile of RAP250+/− mice was modified upon exposure to thermoneutral conditions, i.e., upon inactivation of BAT metabolic activity. Thus, control and RAP250+/− mice were housed at 30 °C for 14 weeks (starting at 8 weeks of age). Half the mice were fed a standard chow diet (TN-ND), while the other half received a HFD (TN-HFD), which enhances thermogenic activity due to the high amount of fat34,35. RAP250+/− mice subjected to thermoneutrality and a standard diet did not show alterations in body weight (Fig. 4I) or total fat mass (Fig. In contrast, RAP250+/− mice subjected to a HFD had a lower body weight (Fig. 4J) and a marked reduction of fat mass (Fig. Under these conditions, the weight of BAT was only reduced in RAP250+/− mice upon a HFD (Fig. Tissue sections revealed unaltered adipose cell size in mice on a standard diet (Fig. 4M and 4O) but a reduced adipose cell size in the RAP250+/− group upon treatment with a HFD (Fig. These studies provide further evidence that BAT plays a major role in the alterations in energy metabolism of RAP250+/− mice. To explore the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced metabolic activity of BAT under RAP250 deficiency, we focused on the differentially expressed gene sets detected in RNA-seq assays (Fig. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in the action potential of neurons in RAP250-deficient BAT (Figs. In keeping with these data, RAP250-deficient BAT showed an enhanced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), suggesting an increased sympathetic innervation17 (Fig. In keeping with this, cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics detected an increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. This is relevant since sympathetic nerve fibers innervating BAT are predominantly non-myelinated Schwann cells, and they play a key role in neurotransmission, allowing rapid norepinephrine release to stimulate thermogenesis36,37. This type of analysis also revealed an increased abundance of myelinated Schwann cells in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. A Gene set enrichment analysis results of Regulation of action potential in neuron pathway (GO0019228) from Gene Ontology (GO) upregulated in BAT from RAP250+/− mice.

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (D, E, G, H, I, J, K and N), and Enrichment score rotation based test (roastgsa) (A). Analysis of western blot and real-time PCR validated the increased expression of Nrn1 in RAP250-deficient BAT (Fig. The increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA was detected in BAT from RAP250+/− mice aged between 2 and 6 months (Fig. Nrn1 mRNA was more enriched in brown adipocytes compared to the expression detected in the stromal vascular fraction obtained from BAT, similarly to was detected for UCP1 or RAP250 (Fig. AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT also caused an increased expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein (Fig. In contrast, AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in perigonadal adipose tissue did not alter the expression of Nrn1 (Fig. Exposure of mice to thermoneutrality abrogated the stimulation of Nrn1 mRNA levels in BAT (Fig. In separate studies, we analyzed the expression of Nrn1 in mouse brown adipose cells during adipogenesis. Nrn1 mRNA was substantially expressed in preadipocytes and it underwent a two-fold increase in adipocytes under conditions in which UCP1 was markedly induced (Fig. In contrast, the expression of Nrn1 protein was not detectable in preadipocytes and was markedly induced during brown adipogenesis (Fig. Nrn1 was detected as 15 kDa and 12 kDa bands and it is likely that the former is an unprocessed form of the protein. Nrn1 protein was also detected in culture media from brown adipocytes, suggesting that it was secreted. Moreover, the secretion was rapidly stimulated in response to isoproterenol treatment (Fig. In all, our data indicate that Nrn1 is expressed and secreted by brown adipose cells and that its expression is markedly enhanced in response to brown adipogenesis. We next tested whether Nrn1 expression in thermogenic adipose cells had metabolic effects in mice. To this end, control mice subjected to a normal diet were treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Thirty weeks after the AAV administration, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a 3-fold greater expression of Nrn1 mRNA and protein in BAT whereas no changes in expression were detected in ING adipose tissue (Fig. Plasma levels of Nrn1 were detectable but no differences were found between control and Nrn1-treated groups (Fig. Under these conditions, AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower body weight and lower fat mass (Fig. Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, CO2 production and glucose oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. Under these conditions, food intake but not ambulation was enhanced (Fig. AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides, normal glycemia, and a trend for reduced leptin levels (Fig. A Nrn1 gene expression in BAT and SAT from mice injected via the tail-vein with either AAV-UCP1 empty (Control) or AAV-UCP1-NRN1 vector under UCP1 promoter (BAT AAV-Control n = 9; BAT AAV-UCP1-NRN1 n = 7; SAT AAV-Control n = 8, SAT AAV-UCP1-NRN1 n = 6).

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test for all figures except one-sided Student´s t test (K and L). Sections of BAT revealed reduced size of brown adipose cells and lipid droplets upon Nrn1 treatment (Fig. Triple staining of BAT section showed a reduced adipose cell size in BAT from Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. In addition, an increased abundance of UCP1 in brown adipocytes from Nrn1 mice was also detected (Fig. In all, these data suggest an enhanced BAT metabolism and thermogenesis upon Nrn1 expression. In keeping with this view, we detected an increased expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the AAV-Nrn1-treated group (Fig. 6M), and also an enhanced expression of phosphorylated HSL, active PKA, UCP1 (Fig. We also detected that chronic overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipocytes enhanced the expression of OXPHOS subunits relevant in respiratory complexes I and II but not for CV (Fig. The Nrn1 group also showed a reduction in adipose cell size in visceral and subcutaneous depots (Fig. Mice subjected to a HFD were also treated with AAVs encoding Nrn1 under the control of the UCP1 promoter or an empty vector. Nrn1-treated mice showed increased Nrn1 gene expression in BAT and ING adipose tissue (Fig. 7A), and no differences in plasma levels were detected between groups (Fig. AAV-Nrn1-treated mice showed a lower rate of body weight and fat mass gain compared to control mice (Fig. Energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and lipid oxidation were enhanced in AAV-Nrn1-treated mice (Fig. Under these conditions, food intake was not altered (Fig. S9D), and nocturnal ambulation was enhanced in these mice (Fig. These mice showed lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides and leptin, and normal glycemia (Fig. We also detected an enhanced expression of thermogenic and metabolic genes in the Nrn1 group (Fig. A Nrn1 mRNA expression in BAT and SAT in mice injected via the tail-vein with either AAV Control or NRN1 vector under UCP1 promoter and subjected to a HFD for 15 weeks (AAV-Control n = 8, black symbols; AAV-UCP1-NRN1 n = 8, violet symbols).

Inner asterisk indicates adjusted P value < 0.05. As we found that enhanced Nrn1 expression activates brown adipose tissue, we next analyzed the mechanisms involved. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq assays using BAT samples from AAV-Nrn1-treated and control mice. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enhanced abundance of Hallmark Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Adipogenesis pathways in response to chronic NRN1 (Fig. Analysis of GO Cellular Compartment GSEA revealed that most of the genes upregulated were mitochondrial (encoding for mitochondrial proteins) (Fig. The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. Our data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure (Fig. These data indicate the existence of common processes operating in Nrn1 overexpressing BAT and upon cold exposure. We performed cell type deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptomics from control and Nrn1 overexpressing BAT tissues, and we detected and increased abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells (Fig. 7K), which was parallel to an increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. Moreover, a reduced abundance of myelinated Schwann cells was also detected (Fig. In all, these data indicate a sympathetic remodeling in BAT by Nrn1 involved an increased proliferation of non-myelinated Schwann cells. To further analyze whether Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we repressed Nrn1 in primary brown preadipocytes using lentiviruses encoding shRNA (Fig. These cells showed a normal differentiation and the expression of protein markers such as PPARγ2, PPARγ1, UCP1 and HSL was indistinguishable from that observed in control adipocytes (Fig. Given these observations, we monitored the acute stimulatory response of brown adipocytes to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol39. Isoproterenol activated the phosphorylation of HSL and other PKA substrates in control brown adipocytes (Fig. This activation was markedly reduced in Nrn1-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig. Isoproterenol also induced crucial genes, such as Ppargc1a and Ucp1, in control cells (Fig. This process was largely repressed in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. We also analyzed the effects of Nrn1 deficiency on mitochondrial respiration in brown adipocytes. In control brown adipocytes, mitochondrial respiration was reduced upon addition of oligomycin, and isoproterenol increased mitochondrial respiration to values close to those measured in the presence of FCCP (maximal respiration) (Fig. Depletion of Nrn1 reduced the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration, and also maximal mitochondrial respiration (Fig. Under these conditions basal respiration or ATP-coupled respiration were unaltered in Nrn1-deficient cells (Fig. The reduced response to isoproterenol was not a consequence of changes in the expression of β3-adrenergic receptors (Fig. In all, these results indicate that Nrn1 protein is synthesized by brown adipocytes and that it can modulate the metabolism of brown adipocytes and their capacity to respond to catecholamines.

Statistical differences according to a two-sided Student´s t test (A, I, K, N, O, P and Q) and two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparison test (D–F and G). To analyze whether extracellularly present Nrn1 has metabolic effects in brown adipocytes, we have expressed and purified mouse recombinant NRN1 to homogeneity (Fig. Next, we incubated brown adipocytes with recombinant NRN1 (100 ng/ml). Short-term incubation with recombinant NRN1 enhanced the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates in brown adipocytes (Fig. In addition, NRN1 caused a marked induction of Ucp1 and Ppargc1a gene expression in brown adipocytes (Fig. NRN1 also increased the effects of isoproterenol on mitochondrial respiration (Fig. These results clearly reveal a thermogenic effect of extracellular NRN1 in brown adipocytes, and further suggest that NRN1 has the capacity to act as an autocrine/paracrine factor in brown adipose tissue. The results reported here support the following highlights: a) RAP250 protein is a key component of energy homeostasis and it modulates BAT metabolism; b) RAP250 deficiency in brown adipose cells induces the expression of Nrn1, a factor until now unknown as a regulator of BAT biology; c) AAV-mediated overexpression of Nrn1 in brown adipose cells improves energy expenditure and stimulates BAT metabolism; d) Nrn1 repression disrupts the metabolism of brown adipocytes, an observation that indicates an autonomous cellular response; and e) exogenous mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue. Our findings reveal that RAP250 plays a key role in maintaining energy metabolism and adiposity in mice. We demonstrate that RAP250 deficiency upregulates energy metabolism, reduces adiposity, and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice. In addition, we found that global RAP250 deficiency in these animals stimulates BAT metabolism and that local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression in BAT reduces adiposity and enhances global glucose oxidation and BAT UCP1 expression. In addition, we document that RAP250 expression is markedly attenuated in BAT in response to cold, and is also reduced in brown adipocytes by phosphodiesterase inhibitors suggesting a regulatory role of cAMP. Based on all these data, we propose that RAP250 regulates energy metabolism, most likely through the modulation of the metabolic activity of BAT. In keeping with these data, many common variants of RAP250 show a very strong association with hip circumference-adjusted BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NCOA6)40 (Fig. This observation points to the participation of RAP250 in human metabolism. Our data indicate that RAP250 deficiency causes leanness in mice as a result of increased BAT metabolism and energy expenditure. We are aware of different studies indicating that Thus, the transcriptional activity of PPARγ is impaired in RAP250 KO mouse embryo fibroblasts27,41,42, and these cells are refractory to PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis27. Future studies are required to proof that RAP250 indeed controls in vivo white adipogenesis. RAP250 also regulates liver metabolism, and its inactivation disrupts hepatic lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity23,24,43. The enhanced energy expenditure of RAP250+/− mice was linked to greater glucose oxidation under a normal diet and to increased lipid oxidation upon HFD conditions. Moreover, these animals showed an enhanced BAT metabolism that was characterized by large transcriptomic alterations, increased glucose oxidation, improved mitochondrial respiration, high expression of key genes Pparg2, Prdm16, Cebpa, Ppara, Ppargc1a, Ucp1 and Dio2, and increased expression of proteins UCP1, PPARγ and C/EBPα. Two additional experimental findings revealed that BAT plays a major primary role in the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice. Thus, local repression of RAP250 protein mediated by the injection of AAV shRAP250 particles into the interscapular BAT depot of wild-type mice phenocopied many of the metabolic changes detected in RAP250-deficient mice, including reduced body weight, lower fat mass, and enhanced glucose oxidation. These effects were specific to RAP250 repression in BAT, because a similar genetic manipulation of RAP250 in PAT did not have metabolic consequences. A second observation came from the exposure of RAP250-deficient mice to thermoneutrality, which inactivates BAT thermogenesis. Under these conditions, marginal or no differences in body weight, fat mass or glucose tolerance were detectable between control and RAP250+/− mice. Moreover, the combination of thermoneutrality and a HFD, the latter enhancing the thermogenic activity of BAT35,44, maintained the differences in body weight, fat mass, and glucose tolerance normally appearing in RAP250-deficient mice. In all, our data strongly support the view that RAP250 modulates energy expenditure through the regulation of BAT activity in such a way that primary changes in BAT function lead to alterations in adiposity. Neuritin 1 (Nrn1), originally termed candidate plasticity-related gene 15 or Cpg15, was identified as a gene induced by the glutamate analogue kainate in the hippocampus dentate gyrus30. Nrn1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuropeptide expressed in postmitotic neurons and it regulates synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, and neuronal migration and survival29,31,32,45,46,47. It is also involved in memory and learning48. Moreover, Nrn1 operates in cells other than neurons. In this regard, it is also produced by follicular regulatory T cells, and it acts on B cells to suppress autoantibody development against tissue-specific antigens49. In addition, this protein is expressed in tissues such as the placenta, lung and spleen50. Our data support the notion that Nrn1 plays a key role in BAT metabolism. In this study, we document that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT under conditions of RAP250 deficiency. Given the observation that Nrn1 is upregulated in BAT upon local AAV-mediated RAP250 repression, we support the notion that RAP250 locally modulates Nrn1 gene expression in BAT. Moreover, we document that Nrn1 is abundantly expressed in brown adipocytes and that its expression is regulated during differentiation state at translational or post-translational levels. As RAP250 participates in COMPASS-related complexes containing the H3K4 methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL420,21,51, we propose that RAP250 repression drives epigenetic changes, thus causing an enhanced expression of Nrn1. The intricacy of those complexes is high, and MLL3 and MLL4 induce monomethylation of H3K4 at enhancer regions, whereas another enzyme in MLL3 and MLL4 COMPASS, namely UTX, demethylates H3K27me3, a modification associated with transcription repression by the Polycomb group of proteins52,53. Here, we also demonstrate that Nrn1 expressed in brown adipose cells causes the local activation of BAT metabolism and thermogenesis. Thus, the expression of Nrn1 in thermogenic adipose cells causes the activation of energy expenditure under normal conditions or upon an HFD. Under these conditions, we also detected a reduction in body weight gain. This occurred in parallel to an enhanced expression of BAT metabolic genes, including Prdm16, Ppargc1a, Cidea, Cpt1a, Hsl, and Dio2. RNA-Seq assays revealed the existence of a metabolic reprogramming in response to chronic NRN1 expression in BAT characterized by the induction of mitochondrial genes and also genes relevant in adipose cell differentiation. The pattern of changes detected upon NRN1 expression was similar to the changes reported in response to cold exposure to 4 °C for 1 week38. In all, these data indicate that BAT oxidative metabolism is activated upon NRN1 overexpression, and that the effects of NRN1 show striking similarity to the effects caused by chronic cold exposure. The effects of Nrn1 in BAT seem to be largely local. At a cellular level, Nrn1 seems to operate through an autocrine/paracrine mode of action. In this context, we detected that Nrn1 is secreted from brown adipocytes and that this secretion is significantly enhanced in the presence of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. In addition, we found that Nrn1 repression in brown adipose cells does not alter differentiation, but it markedly reduces the response to isoproterenol. Nrn1 groups with local-acting factors, such as BMP8b, which are secreted by brown adipocytes and activate BAT metabolism16,54. Interestingly, some common variants of the Nrn1 gene show a very strong association with BMI (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/gene.html?gene=NRN1), which suggests that Nrn1 participates in human metabolism. Interestingly, incubation of brown adipocytes with mouse recombinant NRN1 enhances the activity of protein kinase A, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipocytes, supporting the view that NRN1 acts as a secreted factor in brown adipose tissue. The specific receptors for NRN1 have not been definitively identified. To date, no canonical, high-affinity cell surface receptor has been unequivocally demonstrated55. Moreover, NRN1 is not part of a known ligand family like neurotrophins or FGFs, and it does not display any conserved domain homologous to these or other classical signaling molecules56. Several studies have proposed indirect mechanisms or potential receptor candidates for NRN1. For instance, cross-talk between NRN1 and insulin signaling has been observed, suggesting that neuritin may enhance or depend on insulin receptor pathways for its effects57. Notably, pharmacological blockade of the insulin receptor, but not the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, abrogated these effects, indicating a specific involvement of the insulin receptor in neuritin signaling. In addition, there is evidence that neuritin interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) to mediate axonal branching in granule neurons. Immunoprecipitation assays have revealed a strong association between neuritin and FGFR1, and inhibition or knockdown of FGFR1 significantly suppressed neuritin-induced axonal branching, suggesting that FGFR1 plays a critical role in neuritin's effects on neuronal development58. Regarding downstream signaling, activation of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways has been observed following neuritin 1 treatment, consistent with its role in promoting cell survival and growth57,59. It is also likely that Nrn1-receptor complex undergoes internalization, which may be relevant in further signaling49. In our study, we further demonstrate that neuritin 1 can rapidly activate protein kinase A signaling in brown adipocytes. Altogether, these findings suggest that neuritin 1 acts pleiotropically, modulating multiple pathways depending on the cellular context. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its actions remain to be fully elucidated and warrant dedicated investigation. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that Nrn1 is a key regulator of brown adipocytes, it performs trophic actions, and it preserves the capacity to respond to catecholamines, a crucial physiological characteristic of brown adipocytes. We do not exclude the possibility that Nrn1 exerts a neurotropic action in BAT. In fact, Nrn1 overexpression caused an increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression and enhanced abundance of non-myelinated Schwann cells in BAT, supporting a role on sympathetic innervation in this tissue. Given the properties of Nrn1, it emerges as a potentially useful protein for targeting energy expenditure in humans. RAP250 heterozygous mice, with a null mutation in the RAP250 gene, were used in this study42. Briefly, exons 7 and 8 were replaced with the neo gene which is flanked by a 5-kb homologous region on each side42. All animal work was conducted following the guidelines established by the Animal Care Committees of the “Parc Científic de Barcelona” and the University of Barcelona. Heterozygous female mice were crossed either with C57BL/6J male or heterozygous male mice to obtain control and heterozygous littermates. Mice were kept under a 12 h dark/light cycle and provided a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. For the high-fat diet (HFD) experiments, 10-week-old male mice were fed a standard diet or HFD for 15–20 weeks (10% or 60% calories from fat, D12492 and D12450B; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Animals were fasted for 16 h (17:00–9:00) in glucose tolerance and glucose turnover tests. In thermoneutrality experiments, 8-week-old mice were kept for 22 weeks at 30 °C either under a standard chow diet or HFD. Mice were kindly gifted by the Mouse Mutant Core Facility at IRB Barcelona. At the times indicated in figure legends, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Interscapular BAT (BAT), Perigonadal Adipose Tissue (PAT), Inguinal adipose tissue (ING), liver, gastrocnemius and heart were collected and used for RNA purification, protein extraction, or histology. Plasma was obtained by cardiac punction. All animal experiments were done in compliance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Barcelona Science Park and University of Barcelona (Protocol number 9279, approved by the Department of Territory and Sustainability, General Directorate of Environmental Policies and the Natural Environment, Government of Catalonia). Single-stranded AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were generated and produced by the “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” (www.viralvector.eu) at the UAB. The sequence used to repress RAP250 was 5'-ACACATACCTCAGAACATA-3'. AAV-UCP1 empty and AAV-UCP1-Nrn1 vectors were generated by Vector Biosystems and produced by “Unitat de Producció de Vectors” at the UAB. The AAV9-Scr-RSV-GFP and AAV9-Sh RAP250-RSV-GFP vectors were administered as reported60. For BAT infection, 1 × 1010 of the total viral genome (vg) of AAV9 Scr or Sh was administered (4 × 10 μl of viral solution) per BAT depot to 8-week-old male mice. In Nrn1 protein overexpression experiments, 1.5 × 1012 of the total viral genome (vg) was intravascularly administered (by tail) to 8-week-old C57BL6J male mice. Mice were placed individually in metabolic cages and acclimatised for 24 h before measuring food intake over four consecutive days. Feeding was accessed by evaluating the food remaining in a 24-h period. Blood samples were collected between 10:00 and 12:00 either after an overnight fast or under fed conditions; they were obtained by tail vein snip of unrestrained mice. Plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until assay. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were determined using the UltraSensitive Mouse Insulin Elisa Kit and Mouse Leptin Elisa Kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove IL, USA); adiponectin with the Quantikine Adiponectin kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA); and cholesterol and triglycerides with BioSystems Kits (Costa Brava, Spain). Blood glucose was assayed with an Accu-Chek glucose monitor and reactive strips (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) directly in blood drops from conscious mice. were performed as described in ref. Blood was collected, and glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at different time points. Whole-body glucose utilization rate was determined under euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions. Under physiological hyperinsulinemic conditions, insulin was infused at a rate of 4 mU/kg·min for 3 h, and D-[3H]3-glucose at a rate of 30 μCi/kg·min. Throughout the infusion, blood glucose was determined from blood samples (3.5 μL) collected from the tip of the tail vein with a blood glucose meter when needed. Euglycemia was maintained by periodically adjusting a variable infusion of 10% or 16.5% glucose. Plasma glucose concentrations and D-[3H]3-glucose-specific activity were determined in 5 μL of blood sampled from the tip of the tail vein every 10 min during the last hour of the infusion, as reported62. Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine by i.p. injection and positioned face down, with both legs fully extended, in a SkyScan 1076 high-resolution micro-CT scanner (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) mouse bed. 360° scans of the abdominal region were made at a rotation step of 0.8° and an isotropic voxel size of 35 μm; Source 50 kV/200 µA and 1.0 mm aluminium filter. Scans were reconstructed and analyzed using the NRecon and CTAn software provided by SkysScan. The region of interest (ROI) for each animal was defined based on skeletal landmarks from the gray-scale reconstructed images (between femoral head and L5 vertebra). Data are expressed as percentage of fat on a ROI: Fat Volume/ Total ROI Volume X 10063. Fat mass was also measured using magnetic resonance with EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer. An indirect calorimetry system (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments) was used to measure oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), and ambulation. The experiment included two days of acclimation and a third day (24 h) of valid data recording. Average RER index (VCO2 ml/h produced/VO2 ml/h consumed); Energy Expenditure (Kcal/h/Kg) [defined as VO2x(3.815 + 1.232xRER)/1000]; Glucose Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [(4.545xVCO2)-(3.205xVO2)] /1000]; and Lipid Oxidation (g/min/Kg0.75) [defined as [1.672x(VO2-VCO2)]/1000] were calculated from VO2 and VCO2 data. To remove variance in metabolic parameters derived from differences in body weight between animals, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. ANCOVA is a robust method to compare groups with divergent body weights and composition64,65. For data obtained in mice on a normal diet, values of O2 consumption and CO2 production were referred to an adjusted mean body weight of 25.8071 g determined with ANCOVA, using body weight as a covariate in WT and RAP250 male mice in normal diet. In acute cold exposure studies, a Sable Systems Promethion Core was used. In these studies, mice were acclimated to the cages during 4 days at 22 °C and subjected to 4 °C during 8 hours. Mouse body composition was measured using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance with the EchoMRITM Body Composition Analyzer. 30-week-old male mice were killed by cervical dislocation; BAT was harvested and kept in cold Washing Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA (Albumin bovine serum, fraction V, minimum 96% lyophilized)), until further processing. BAT samples were then transferred to Digestion Buffer (KRBH solution, 3.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 mg/ml glucose (D(+)- glucose anhydrous), 1 mg/ml Collagenase type II from Clostridium histolyticum), at a ratio of 10 ml Digestion Buffer per gram of tissue. They were then mechanically minced and allowed to digest at 37 °C and under 250 rpm shaking for 30'−1 h. Undigested material was discarded by using a 100-μm strainer. The BAT digestion solution was diluted (to lower collagenase activity) and used directly. For glucose oxidation, 0.5 ml adipocyte solution was incubated for 4 h with 0.5 ml Oxidation Buffer (KRBH solution, 1% (w/v) BSA, 5 mmol/L glucose, 1 μCi/mL (D-[U]-14C-glucose) in 6-well plates, and CO2 was collected as in ref. Data are expressed as nmol of glucose/h corrected by DNA content. Glucose oxidation from wild-type tissues was used as 100% value. Approximately 1-mm3 pieces of BAT were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer. The protocol is described in ref. Sections were observed under a JEM-1010 electron microscope (Jeol, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera SIS Megaview III and the AnalySIS software. BAT, adipose tissue depots and liver were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in methanol and then paraffin-embedded. Sections were subjected to standard Hematoxylin/Eosin (HE) staining. Images were acquired with a NanoZoomer-2.0 HT C9600 digital scanner (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France) equipped with a 20X objective and coupled to a mercury lamp unit L11600-05 and using NDP.scan2.5 software U10074-03 (Hamamatsu, Photonics, France). Adipocyte area was measured using open software ImageJ (W. Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Liver fat content was estimated from HE-stained slides using the CTAn software (SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). DAPI/Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)/UCP1 staining was performed as reported67. RNA from various tissues was extracted using a protocol combining TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNAeasy® minikit columns (Qiagen. Alameda, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript RTII kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Ca, USA). PCRs were performed using the ABI Prism 7900 HT real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA), or Taqman Master Mix. The thermal protocol was 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15'/95 °C–60'/60 °C. All measurements for mouse mRNA were normalized to Arp. For each designed primer set, a melting curve of PCR products was performed to verify unspecific amplification or primer-dimer formation. The primers used are specified in Table S2. Total DNA was extracted from mouse interscapular BAT, inguinal subcutaneous Adipose tissue (SAT) and perigonadal adipose tissue (PAT). Tissue was digested with proteinase K (Merck Life Science S.L.U., 03115801001) and total DNA was purified using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504). Total cellular DNA (1 ng DNA) is used as a template and is amplified with specific primers for Cox2 gene, as a mitochondrial gene (Cox2f: CTACAAGACGCCACAT and Cox2r: GAGAGGGGAGAGCAAT) and for Sdha gene, as a nuclear gene (Sdhaf: TACTACAGCCCCAAGTCT, Sdhar: TGGACCCATCTTCTATGC) by Real-Time PCR using SYBRGreen. The ratio genomic-nuclear DNA/ mtDNA was calculated. The concentration of total RNA in preparations was quantified with Nanodrop One (Thermo Fisher), and RNA integrity was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA Nano assay (Agilent). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared at IRB Barcelona's Functional Genomics Core Facility. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from 1.2 μg of total RNA using the kit NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). NGS libraries for RNA-seq were prepared from the purified mRNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Seven (WT/RAP250) and eight (Control/UCP1-NRN1) cycles of PCR amplification were applied to all libraries. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) and quality controlled with the Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA HS assay (Agilent), for WT/RAP250 BAT, and Tapestation HS D5000 assay (Agilent) for Control/NRN1 BAT. For WT/RAP250 BAT RNA-seq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to sequencing at the Centre for Genomic Regulation. A final qPCR quality control was performed before sequencing in one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequencing output was 270 million 50-bp single-end reads, and at least 28 million reads were obtained for all samples. For Control/UCP1 BAT RNAseq an equimolar pool was prepared with the nine libraries and subjected to paired-end 150 nt sequencing on a NovaSeq6000 S4 (Illumina). FastQ files were aligned against the Mus musculus mm10 genome with STAR 2.5.2b68 using default options. Aligned reads were used to obtain raw counts at mm10 NCBI RefSeq gene level using featureCounts from Rsubread version 1.32.469 with options minMQS=1. DESeq2 1.22.270 was used to find differentially expressed genes in KO vs WT. Genes were selected as differentially expressed with thresholds |FC| > 1.5 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P < 0.1. For functional enrichment analysis (GSEA), regularized log transformation (rlog) was applied to read counts using DESeq2 and rotation gene set testing using the maxmean statistic was performed71. For cell type deconvolution analyses, the DWLS algorithm (https://github.com/dtsoucas/DWLS) was used with reference single cell data obtained from ref. All analyses were performed in R-3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2018). Immortalized brown preadipocytes were generated as described in refs. Retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40 LT-Puro antigen was purchased from Addgene. Cells were grown in monolayer culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). The differentiation process is described in ref. Immortalized brown preadipocytes were also used to generate the NRN1 deficiency model. Lentivirus encoding for a shRNA scramble or against Nrn1 (TRCN0000177415 validated clone from Merk), as control (SCR) or knockdown (shNRN1), were produced in HEK 293 T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) as reported74. Transduced cells were selected based on Puromycin resistance (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-108071; 3 μg/ml). Adipocyes and SVF were obtained as reported75,76. A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 28-115 inclusive of mouse Neuritin (Accession number NM_153529) was amplified using the following semi-nested primers: The resulting 343 bp fragment was purified using AMPure (Beckman Coulter) before InFusion (Takara Bio) into KpnI and NotI-cut pOPINTTG77. The resulting construct will produce the following protein when expressed in mammalian cells: The protein consists of the µ-phosphatase signal peptide (with signal peptidase site indicated, first ↓, a Hexa-histidine tag and TEV cleavage site (indicated, second ↓) followed by amino acids 28-115 of mouse Neuritin. This protein will be secreted, can be purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and can then be cleaved with TEV protease to produce mature ‘soluble' NRN1 (this construct is truncated to also exclude the GPI-anchored G116). 293-6E cells78 were cultured in shaken flasks in F-17 Freestyle media (Gibco) supplemented with GlutaMax, Poloxamer 188 and G418 (final concentrations of 4 mM, 0.1% and 25 µg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 24 h the media was supplemented with sterile TN1 solution (Tryptone N1, TekniScience Inc. to 0.5% w/v in F-17 Freestyle media). After a further 96 hours the media was cleared by pelleting the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g then 5000 g followed filtration through Whatman 3 M paper filters. All further steps were performed at 4 °C. Urea was added to a final concentration of 4 M and the pH adjusted to pH 7.5 before the sample was applied to a 5 ml Excel IMAC column equilibrated with IMAC Wash Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 4 M, Imidazole 20 mM, DTT 2 mM). His-NRN containing fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged to Digest Buffer (Tris pH8 50 mM, NaCl 500 mM, Urea 2 M, DTT 2 mM) using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column before the addition of His-tagged TEV protease at a 1:25 His-TEV:His-NRN ratio and incubation overnight at 4 °C. The TEV-digested sample was first passed through a 1 ml Excel HisTrap column to capture uncut His-NRN and His-TEV before size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Superdex 30 pg 16/600 column equilibrated with Tris pH8 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Urea 6 M, DTT 2 mM, EDTA 2 mM. Peak fractions were buffer exchanged (as before, using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalt column) into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use. Adipocytes (Scr and shNRN1) at day 10 of differentiation were stimulated with Isoproterenol (10 uM) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 2 h. Cells were lysed to obtain RNA or total cell extracts. For the detection of proteins phosphorylated by PKA (p-PKA substrates) control adipocytes were washed in PBS twice and were incubated during two hours in media without serum. Cells were treated with NRN1 at different concentration during 2 h and then total cell extracts were obtained. For NRN1 chronic studies, brown adipocytes at day 4 of differentiation were treated with NRN1 at 100 ng/ml in the presence of differentiation medium. NRN1 was maintained during all the process of differentiation. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (ROCHE)) for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins from total homogenates were resolved in 8% (RAP250 detection) or 10% acrylamide gels for SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Proteins were detected by the ECL method and quantified by densitometry using Genetools from Syngene or by NIR-fluorescence detected with LI-COR Odyssey System and measured with Image Studio software. The following antibodies were used: RAP250 (ASC2 antibody BL1874, Bethyl laboratories and NCOA6 polyclonal antibody 25241-1_AP, Proteintech); p-HSL (S563, #4139), HSL (#4107), P-PKA substrates (#9624), βactin (AC-15, SIGMA); α-tubulin (SIGMA); Vinculin (Abcam); GAPDH (2118S, Cell Signaling), UCP1 (ab10983 Abcam); PPARγ and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz); total OXPHOS rodent WB antibody cocktail (ab110413, Abcam), ADRB3 (bs-1063R Bioss Antibodies), NRN1 (B-9 Santa Cruz and AF283 from Biotechne R&D Systems); TH (R&D Systems MAB7566SP and ab6211 from Abcam). Preadipocytes (Scr/ ShNRN1) were plated, grown and differentiated as it is described in ref. 67 For NRN1 treated cells, recombinant NRN1 protein was added chronically at day 4 of differentiation until d9-d10 at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Media was changed every two days. Seahorse experiments were performed as reported79. Neuritin 1 (NRN1) ELISA Kit (Catalog No: abx155876, Abbexa) was used to measure Nrn1 from mouse plasma and cell culture media. 75 μl of plasma and 300 μl of culture media were used following a commercial protocol. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed t-Student test, or by two-way ANOVA (Šidak's multiple comparisons test or by an Ordinary two-way ANOVA), or by Covariance (ANCOVA) with weight as the covariate. Significance was established at P < 0.05. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.
