Kimi Antonelli has outlined the difference in approach that he is taking for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix in comparison to his previous home event earlier in the year at Imola, with the Mercedes driver admitting that he feels “much more prepared” this time around. On the track, the Italian did not manage to reach Q3 in Saturday's Qualifying and then suffered a retirement owing to a technical problem in Sunday's race. Pushed on what he learned from his first home race at Imola ahead of his second this weekend, the rookie answered: “Obviously it was my first home race and there was a lot going [on] around, especially outside the track. I was going back in the car and not feeling 100 per cent, also focus-wise. “Also trying to manage my energy the best way possible throughout the whole weekend, but obviously you start the weekend and then as you arrive to Sunday you have a bit less energy overall. While Antonelli has not raced in a Formula 1 Grand Prix at Monza before, the Italian did make his FP1 debut at the track last year on the same weekend in which he was announced as a Mercedes driver for 2025. “A lot of things have happened [in the past year],” Antonelli reflected. “I have good memories but also really bad memories here, but it's a really special place and I think it's going to be a special weekend. And in terms of what Mercedes might be able to achieve at Monza, the Italian said: “It's always tough to say, because the cars are getting closer and closer. Last year, looking at the result especially in Qualifying, they were up there. “This year it's been a bit of a trend that the car, where it's been good last year, was also quite good this year, so hopefully it's going to be the same but we never know.”</p>

Lewis Hamilton is embracing the “good energy” from Ferrari's passionate fans as he aims to give them something to cheer about at the Italian Grand Prix – despite heading into it with a grid penalty. Indeed, Hamilton and team mate Charles Leclerc were greeted by a huge crowd of Tifosi at a Ferrari gathering in Milan on Wednesday, underlining the incredible support both drivers and the team will have behind them this weekend. “It was such a unique experience,” said Hamilton during Thursday's driver press conference. “Already from yesterday morning, getting to [the Ferrari factory in] Maranello, when you walk in and see the Ferrari logo… I still have to pinch myself. I've never seen fans outside the factory before, in any of my years. There's clearly just so much love for this brand, and what it means to people. “To be in Milan, really in the heart of it all, seeing the fans and just how passionate they were, it was intense, but very, very positive. As for what Ferrari might be able to achieve at Monza, Hamilton expressed cautious optimism following the “loads of positives” he felt at the Dutch Grand Prix last time out. “I think Ferrari have generally gone pretty well [here] in the past years. “I'm just really keen to see how the car works here. “Then, on top of that, to be set back five places is not great when you're going into your first Monza [race] with Ferrari, but it gives me more to fight for and I'm very motivated to make up those places.”</p>

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

While Ferrari has yet to win a race this season, the loyal Tifosi will be hoping drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton can use the positive energy around Monza to come out on top

Monza's Temple of Speed, nestled in the dense woodland of a royal park, is the home of Italian motorsport and a place where Ferrari's faithful – the Tifosi – come to pay homage to the racing team whom they worship.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton knows what this place means to Italy, having made 18 Grand Prix appearances here, but he's about to experience it in a very different way at the 19th time of asking.

This time, he'll be dressed in red, Ferrari red, and he will be one of two drivers who Italy will want to win. The Briton knows a little of what it feels like already, having received the adoration of the Ferrari fans at Imola earlier this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but Monza is another level.

French Bloom's award-winning alcohol-free sparkling wines bring a new dimension to Grand Prix weekends in 2025. Founded by Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger and Constance Jablonski, French Bloom was born from the belief that no one should be left out of the toast. Crafted in France from organic Chardonnay wines, and made entirely alcohol-free through an innovative dealcoholisation process, French Bloom's sparkling wines offer a radically refined alternative for a new generation of consumers – one that's driving the future with clarity, intention, and celebration on their own terms. As F1 expands its global reach, the partnership arrives at a cultural inflection point. Millennials, Gen Z and a growing female fanbase are increasingly driving demand for luxury experiences that offer flexibility, moderation and align with their evolving values. Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “We are delighted to add French Bloom to our ever-expanding list of Moët Hennessy brands partnering with the sport. The addition of French Bloom brings further variety to our hospitality beverages portfolio allowing us to cater for all guests and offer them an elevated real sense of luxury when they attend a Grand Prix.” Our sparkling cuvées unite centuries of French winemaking savoir-faire with cutting-edge innovation, offering a sophisticated alcohol-free sparkling for those who lead with intention and set the pace for what's next.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship However, Zandvoort brought more encouraging signs from the F2 race winner, who made his F1 debut as a Williams substitute driver last season before being released to join Alpine over the winter, initially as a test and reserve driver. Having run experienced team mate Pierre Gasly close in Qualifying, Colapinto used softer starting tyres to move ahead of the Frenchman early in the race, before adhering to team orders and letting him back through when their strategies played out. In an encounter full of incidents and Safety Cars, and amid battling displays from both drivers, Alpine split their approach for the final restart by giving Colapinto fresh tyres and leaving Gasly out on old rubber. Colapinto duly hounded the midfield runners ahead and ultimately fell just half a second short of overhauling Haas rival Esteban Ocon for 10th place, while Gasly lost ground and crossed the line in 17th position. “Starting from outside the points, we took some risks throughout to try and maximise our chances to score,” said Briatore in his post-race assessment, before noting that “with Franco, he drove a very good race, probably his strongest this season so far”. Colapinto himself added: “We were very close to securing some points as a team today. We were very close but just [fell] short at the end. “There are many positives to take from the weekend. We had an improved performance in Qualifying, I feel more things on my side are coming together and I look forward to returning to Monza next weekend, the venue of my F1 debut last year.”</p>

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

'It's far from being comfortable' - Piastri wary of relaxing after extending lead in drivers' championship

Ferrari have shown off the livery that their cars will wear at their home race at Monza, as F1 celebrates its 75th anniversary.

1 / 8

Ferrari have revealed the special livery that Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton's SF-25s will wear at this year's Italian Grand Prix – the first race at Monza for seven-time World Champion Hamilton since joining the Scuderia.

Featuring a more prominent white on the engine covers, alongside retro numbers and wheel covers, the car pays homage to the colourway of the Ferrari 312T that Niki Lauda took to the 1975 Drivers' Championship, and which earned the team the Constructors' title in the same year.

Ferrari head to Monza off the back of a tough outing at the Dutch Grand Prix, with both Hamilton and Leclerc retiring after crashes – although the drivers had been buoyed by the improved pace of their car as the weekend progressed.

Ahead of Leclerc and Hamilton hitting the track on Friday morning, check out the one-off colours in the gallery up top.
