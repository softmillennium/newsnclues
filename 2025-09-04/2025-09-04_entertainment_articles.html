                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Gehlfuss is a Dick Wolf universe OG again. The Chicago Med alum and and Michael Michele, who recurred on another Wolf series, New York Undercover, are set as leads alongside Tom Ellis on CBS' upcoming crime drama series CIA. The FBI offshoot centers on two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law. When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA's New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength. Nick Gehlfuss Returning To 'Chicago Med' As Dr. Will Halstead For Season 11 Originally planned for a fall 2025 premiere, the series in July was pushed to midseason while also undergoing a showrunner change. Warren Leight was tapped to replace FBI: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins, who originally was set to lead the series and co-write the pilot script with FBI, Law & Order & Chicago franchise boss Dick Wolf. Eriq La Salle remains attached to direct and executive produce the pilot episode. Gehlfuss was an original cast members on Wolf Entertainment's NBC drama Chicago Med and played fan-favorite character Dr. Will Halstead for eight season. He is reprising his role in a guest starring appearance on the medical drama's upcoming 11th season. Recently, Gehlfuss finished a run with Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater in its production of Fool For Love, directed by Jeremy Herrin. His other TV credits include recurring roles on Showtime's Shameless, HBO's Newsroom and Starz's Power, among others. He's repped by Gersh, MJ Management and Jackoway Austen Tyerman et al. Michele is coming off a recurring role opposite Queen Latifah on another CBS/Universal TV drime drama, The Equalizer. Michele, who also recurred on Queen Sugar, is repped by Untitled Entertainment, Innovative Artists and Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. A 71-minute wisp of a film that moves and sounds like a cartoon wind curlicue, Pete Ohs' “Erupcja” — the Polish word for “eruption” — was (clearly) shot with half an outline and scripted on the fly, to the point that all four of its main actors are credited as co-writers as well. Related Stories ‘Charlie Harper' Review: Sincerity Cancels Out the Cliches in a Cyclical Story of Doomed Love ‘Scarlet' Review: ‘Belle' Director Mamoru Hosoda Returns with a Bloody Anime ‘Hamlet' that Has Nothing to Say Sure enough, Mount Etna erupts soon after the couple settles into their rental flat, and Bethany takes it as a sign to slip away from her almost-fiancé at a party one night (what else could it possibly be? ), ghosting Rob and his well-planned itinerary in favor of another fiery tryst with Nel. Goodbye sleepy conversations at guidebook-recommended restaurants, hello all-night drug sprees followed by pre-dawn poetry recitations (sex is implied, I suppose, but Ohs' movie is too airy and ethereal to show anything as physical as a kiss). Is it “brat” to disappear from your dutiful boyfriend in the middle of the trip he planned for you, knowing full well that you've abandoned him to miserably scour the city for any trace of his would-be future wife? Besides, it's probably never a great idea to marry someone who's saved in your contacts next to the emoji of a guy raising his hand — nobody wants to marry the emoji of a guy raising his hand. Ohs, who recently moved to Poland himself, is fascinated by the transformative power of being in a foreign space, and by the process through which people — be they transplants or just tourists — try to reconcile who they are to the new reality around them, and “Erupcja” drifts along with the detachedness of an out-of-body experience. Claude (Jeremy O. Harris as an extroverted American painter who meets Bethany and Rob by chance at a sushi restaurant) is probably the closest thing the director has to a surrogate in this story, and at one point the camera finds him pontificating about how “Being immersed in a culture so different from my own helps me turn my brain off so I can enter a dream state more naturally.” Slight as it is, “Erupcja” crystallizes that condition to a tee. And while Ohs might point to “Celine and Julie Go Boating” and “Alice in the Cities” as his main sources of inspiration for this project, there's something very “‘Lost in Translation' by way of Hong Sang-soo” about how Bethany — subsumed into a waking dreamstate that still feels like real life to all of the people buzzing around her — starts to understand herself more legibly now that she's in another country where she's forced read the subtitles (figuratively for her, literally for us). “Erupcja” sustains that tension by adhering to a kind of semi-heightened non-logic, as in the very Rivette-like sequence where Bethany invisibly stalks Nel halfway across the city without being noticed. It's a (potentially liberating) narcissism that Bethany may never have allowed herself while stuck in the gauziness of her day-to-day existence. And is Nel capable of sharing in Bethany's selfish dislocation, or is the reality of being in her own home — where she's regularly visited by the semi-jilted girl she's dating (“Ida” star Agata Trzebuchowska) — too grounding to buy into the myth that she and Bethany have been telling each other for the last 10 years or so? “Erupcja” is too breezy a film to conclusively answer such questions, but it lingers in spite of its lightness because it understands how the self-centeredness of travel can cut both ways. And, for that matter, how a little bout of main character syndrome might give someone the perspective they need to save them from becoming a subplot in their own life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Sept. 13, we look at Sabrina Carpenter's first two singles from her just-released Man's Best Friend set, and which may have the stronger performance on next week's chart. Lady Gaga Makes 'Hard & Agonizing Decision' to Cancel Tonight's Miami Mayhem Ball Concert Young Thug Seemingly Addresses Online Backlash After Jail Calls Leak: 'Bashing Me Only Goin F--- That Rap Community Up More' Sabrina Carpenter, “Tears” & “Manchild” (Island/Republic): Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is all but guaranteed to have the top spot on next week's Billboard 200 albums chart with her new set Man's Best Friend. 1 Short n' Sweet, Carpenter's latest arrives on the back of a good deal of discourse around its provocative title and cover — which the singer-songwriter has largely shrugged off — as well as her second No. 1 on the Hot 100 with lead single “Manchild,” which became her first song to debut atop the chart upon its June release. Next week, Carpenter will look to make it two No. 1 debuts in a row with winking, discofied second single “Tears” — which, as “Manchild” did, arrives along with a big new music video. Directed by Bardia Zeinali (who also helmed the Barry Keoghan-co-starring clip for Carpenter's first Hot 100 No. “Tears” is off to a very good start at DSPs, hitting No. On radio, it's still only getting started, but is also set to make a fairly strong debut, possibly entering the top 25 on Pop Airplay, and earning 7.4 million in all-format audience over the first four days of the tracking week (Aug. 29-Sept. 1), according to Luminate. The one area where it's clearly lagging behind where “Manchild” began is in sales, as “Tears” has had a good-not-great showing on iTunes, currently landing outside the top 25 on that real-time chart. “Tears” will also face continued competition from “Manchild” on the chart next week, as that song had slipped out of the top 10 on the Hot 100, but rebounds 14-7 this week with notable gains in both streaming and radio. Those streams should continue to rise for next week with the release of the full Man's Best Friend (which “Manchild” leads off), and the song is also continuing to grow on radio, most likely tracking for a second week atop the Pop Airplay chart, and up another 5% in all-format audience over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period. Whether “Tears” can outpace “Manchild” and put up a real challenge for the No. 1 spot may be determined by its final few days of tracking — as the song returned to the top of the Spotify daily listing after Labor Day Weekend, and may continue to swell from there as more and more listeners catch onto its charms. HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): The biggest challenge for “Tears” on the Hot 100 will of course be getting past HUNTR/X's “Golden,” which holds at No. It's crazy to say about a song by a fictional girl group from a K-pop movie musical — versus one of the most consistent radio hitmakers of the last two years — but radio may be the thing that keeps “Golden” out of range for Sabrina Carpenter's latest to pass next week on the Hot 100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. It's been said that several filmmakers at Venice are showing up with their “state of the world” movies. Whether that's Luca Guadagnino with his take on cancel culture, Yorgos Lanthimos satirizing alt-right-style radicalization, or Kathryn Bigelow depicting our mutually-assured madness in nightmarish fashion, many of our most famed directors seem to be looking at a world in flux and asking: “How did we get here?” Hosoda, a former Studio Ghibli animator who went freelance and has since become one of Japan's most successful auteurs, is no different. His last film, 2021's “Belle”, was a sci-fi adaptation of “Beauty and the Beast.” For his latest act, Hosoda hasn't traveled too far from that baroque fantasy setting, which was already more idealized than the relative normality of his mainstream breakthrough hit (and Oscar nominee) “Mirai.” “Scarlet” is a loose but clearly intended rendering of Hamlet, with all of its castles and knights, ghosts and traitorous uncles — and lots that isn't in Shakespeare's play, too. One of the first lines of dialogue is Claudius (Kôji Yakusho) plotting the murder of his brother; “I have long dreamed of pouring poison into his ears”, he says, but the King is too popular and Claudius must instead frame him for plotting with a neighboring country, thus enabling his execution. Scarlet (Mana Ashida), a young princess, watches on distraught as her father's ruthless executioners seem to relish in their task. But this is a Hosoda movie, so things will become considerably more complicated from there. The Otherlands is a community of struggling people from all places and time periods, who can nevertheless understand each other despite their differences. Scarlet's journey through them will lead her to cross paths with a variety of characters, starting with Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a nurse from modern-day Japan who refuses to convince that he should have died. Soon thereafter, Scarlet encounters a little girl who says that if she were a princess, she would spend her life making sure the world was livable for little girls like her. The politics of the lost masses without food or a home is not far from James Gunn's “Superman”, another well-intended but fairly vague expression of struggling peoples and the evil rulers depriving them of life and dignity. Scarlet's venture is even more consciously informed by “Dune”, whose heir to the throne is radicalized to embrace the cause of his former antagonists. Hosoda's film poses a similar question to Scarlet as Frank Herbert's saga did to Paul Atreides: How much is this story all about her? Hijiri even questions her ruthless approach to warriors sent by her uncle to finish her off, telling Scarlet: “The ultimate warrior fires invisible arrows from an invisible bow.” That isn't really Scarlet's style, and it's probably too much to ask to put the weapons down while she's actively being hunted. Unfortunately, Hosoda's ideas in “Scarlet” never get more incisive or interesting than that. Its ending is a feast of sincerity that, not just tedious in its own right, feels unrepresentative of the irreverent character with whom we've just spent two long hours. Despite bloody violence throughout, “Scarlet” lacks the edge that would make this culture clash of seminal western tale and Japanese art form as memorable or significant as it ought to be. But Hosoda's expressionism virtually disappears thereafter, and a dry sense of order exerts itself once the story is spirited back towards Elsinore. Having written his past four movies alone, it may be time for Hosoda to consider collaborating once again. Sony will release the film in U.S. theaters on Friday, December 12.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a multi-studio bidding war, Columbia Pictures has paid mid six-figures for the rights to Jonathan Marty's short story The Earthling. Final Destination: Bloodlines helmers Zach Lipovsky & Adam Stein are attached to direct. Eric Heisserer's Chronology and Scott Glassgold's 1201 Films are producing. Directing duo's Final Destination: Bloodlines not only ruined the appeal of landscaping with a self-propelled mower, it turned in a $300 million worldwide gross for New Line. Carmen Lewis will also produce on behalf of Chronology. Sony CEO Tom Rothman Says 'The Studio' Is Mostly "Horse****" But It Has "Kernel Of Brilliant, Blinding Truth" Marty's short story attracted a handful of A-list packages around town. Heisserer brought The Earthling into Sony through his first look deal there, and has some elevated sci-fi in his background, adapting the Ted Chiang short story, Stories of Your Life into the Denis Villenueve-directed Arrival. Marty has made a name for himself in the television space having sold a handful of shows including Splash Damage to Warner Bros. and the one-hour drama AI to the CW. Marty and 1201 are also represented by Jeff Frankel. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. You realize ChatGPT can create mini treatments and short story ideas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pink never looked cooler than when Jason Momoa stepped onto the Venice red carpet. Momoa stepped out in a blush pink suit that wowed onlookers and stole the spotlight. Wearing his long curls loose and accessorizing with sleek black sunglasses, Momoa struck a balance of playful charm and refined style at the star-studded premiere. Momoa paired his suit with light pink fuzzy Birkenstock Arizona sandals from the brand's 2023 collaboration with Concepts and painted his toenails to match. He even leaned toward the cameras at one point, striking playful poses to show off the coordinated look. He later told InStyle in 2020, “Pink is just a beautiful color. And I'm pretty secure in my masculinity. I don't really give a s—t what anyone thinks.” Momoa has also shown affection for Birkenstocks over the years. The Venice appearance comes during a busy chapter for Momoa. In July, he made headlines after shaving off his signature facial hair for “Dune: Part Three”, joking on Instagram: “Haven't shaved in six years, and here we are again. Off-screen, the Hawaiian-born star has also been making waves in his personal life. He is currently dating actress Adria Arjona, 33, with the pair making their red-carpet debut earlier this year at the SNL 50 concert in New York City, following his divorce from Lisa Bonet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The macabre, medieval-set feature, now shooting in Prague, follows a knight who marries his devoted love after murdering her father — only to betray her for a wealthier bride. Jonah Hauer-King (The Little Mermaid, I Know What You Did Last Summer), Kristine Froseth (The Buccaneers), Ellie Bamber (William Tell), Bella Heathcote (Pieces of Her, Relic), Leo Suter (Vikings: Valhalla, Lynley) and Ben Radcliffe (Masters of the Air) star in Biller's new film, now shooting in Prague. TIFF's (Unofficial) Market Hot List Features Angelina Jolie, Sydney Sweeney, and Chris Evans Radcliffe is Roger, the ill-fated tailor drawn into Edward's web of deception. Embankment Films released a still from the movie on Thursday, showing Hauer-King as Edward stood behind Froseth's Eleanor. The film is produced by Biller, with Mike Goodridge and James Bowsher for Good Chaos. The company's upcoming slate includes Edward Berger's Ballad for a Small Player (coming to Netflix later this year) and László Nemes's Orphan, in competition at Venice. “She has followed this up with a bigger, bolder, even more ferociously entertaining film designed for the big screen: laced with sly humour, unapologetically bloody, and rendered in her signature technicolour style. A medieval nightmare with bite — this is the kind of fresh storytelling that current audiences demand.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed today that mRNA vaccines kill people during a tense Senate hearing. The most common Covid-19 jabs, such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna, are mRNA vaccines. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) asked Kennedy, Donald Trump's top health regulator, about his firing of every member of the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with his own picks. I agree with it,” responded Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaxxer. Levi is a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former intelligence official for the Israeli military. In January 2023, Levi posted on X that mRNA vaccines cause harm: “The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. Kennedy's speech was raspy and labored throughout the Senate Finance Committee hearing, with viewers noting that heavy breathing, which almost sounded like snoring, could be heard over the microphone. Cassidy noted that patients are having trouble getting Covid vaccines, now that the Food and Drug Administration — which is part of HHS — has limited access to annual booster shots to people over the age of 65 or those with certain medical conditions. “I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines,” Cassidy said. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) asked if Kennedy accepted the statistic that a million Americans have died from Covid. The United States reached that mark in May 2022, according to data from John Hopkins University. “I don't know how many died,” Kennedy said, before attempting to blame the CDC. “It was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC.” Bruce Springsteen to Release ‘Electric Nebraska' — and More — in Surprise Box Set David Gilmour Has a New Concert Film and Says He's Open to Playing Sphere “The secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from Covid, know if the vaccine helped prevent any deaths, and you are sitting as secretary of Health and Human Services?” Merkley said, before pleading: “How can you be that ignorant?” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I'm a student of hooks,” the exceedingly prolific Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard tells Rolling Stone. If you're familiar with GBV's 40-plus-album catalog, that's an understatement. The band nails that combo with their new single “(You Can't Go Back to) Oxford Talawanda.” It's the first track off of Thick, Rich and Delicious, their second album of 2025. The LP arrives on Halloween, which is also Pollard's 68th birthday. Bruce Springsteen to Release ‘Electric Nebraska' — and More — in Surprise Box Set David Gilmour Has a New Concert Film and Says He's Open to Playing Sphere According to Pollard, the new single includes a hook he's been singing his whole life, but had yet to find a home for. A straight-ahead rocker mysteriously named after an Ohio high school, the track is a worthy inclusion to the band's 30-plus-song set list: sing-along heavy and driving. It's part of a suite of new songs — as well as older tracks culled from previous sessions — that the band recorded at a Brooklyn studio in an effort to capture the feel of their live shows. Thick, Rich and Delicious follows February's Universe Room, of which Pollard told Rolling Stone: “I wanted to create, hopefully, an experience, kind of a wild ride, where the listener would want to hear it multiple times in order to grasp all the sections and fields of sound to discover something new with each listen.” Both albums were produced by Travis Harrison.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looks like Justin Bieber isn't turning his swag off just yet. On Thursday (Sept. 4), the pop star announced that a sequel to his July Swag album is arriving at midnight Friday (Sept. 5), posting multiple photos to Instagram of new electronic billboards that have gone up in different cities. With pink backgrounds, the advertisements simply read, “Swag II.” The news comes after Billboard previously reported that Bieber had more music in store for fans after Swag, which debuted at No. While Swag was distinctly R&B-focused — peaking at No. Bieber's sudden announcement marks the second time this year he's unveiled an album with hardly any warning. In the months since, Bieber has stayed busy by releasing music videos for tracks on Swag, including Billboard Hot 100 hits “Daisies” and “First Place.” The latter showed the hitmaker working on music at Floki Studios in Iceland, where he recorded Swag (and possibly Swag II). He's also been sharing photos of himself in the studio in recent weeks, possibly hinting to fans that Swag wasn't the last they'd be hearing from him any time soon. Beliebers are sure to welcome the high volume of new music he's been creating, as they'd previously had to wait four years for a new album after 2021's Justice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naturally, the network also revealed which professional dancers they'd be dancing with. Ribeiro spoke to US Weekly about how the pairings usually work. He said, “Typically, once we have a list of the pros that are gonna be on, we then, at some point, we'll get the opportunity to hear who's gonna be [on the show]. He went on, “It's ever-changing, and there were some pairings that were different three weeks ago.” Ribeiro continued, “Things continue to evolve as new people come in, and you realize, ‘Oh, actually, this is a better pairing than that pairing.' And they work on it right up until the final day until [the stars and pros] meet each other.” He also stated that the show's executives “always get it right” regarding pairing celebrities with pros on “Dancing With the Stars.” According to him, “They figure it out. I don't know how they do it, but they always figure out how to put the right people together.” The beloved actor added, “They're magical.” Elsewhere in the US Weekly interview, Ribeiro teased season 34 of “Dancing With the Stars.” He said, “I knew it was going to be a great season. Ribeiro continued, “You've got so many great people from different generations coming together, and … everyone's getting along, everyone's having a great time. I think it's gonna be an incredible season.” He also opened up about rehearsals. According to him, “They're just getting started. Some of them are Corey Feldman, Danielle Fishel, Dylan Efron, and Hilaria Baldwin. Julianne Hough also hosts the show in addition to Ribeiro.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Say what you will about Ryan Murphy's real-life murderer anthology, but at least he's settled on less cumbersome titles. Yes, the series seems to have found its groove, so what better time to approach a figure Netflix describes as “history's most singular ghoul?” It's Charlie Hunnam's turn to be monstrous when the new season premieres October 3, and based on the trailer, he's up to the task. “Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre—he became the blueprint for modern horror.” Monster: The Ed Gein Story features a handful of Murphy alumni, as Murphy shows are wont to do; that includes Tom Hollander (Feud: Capote Vs. Some esteemed newcomers to Murphy's sandbox include Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf as Ed's mother Augusta Gein and Vicky Krieps as Ilse Koch. Krieps has signed on to appear in the next season of Monster about Lizzie Borden, and it was reported this week Hunnam is in talks to play Borden's father.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen has announced a Nebraska expansion that includes the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions, released for the first time. But the Boss, preferring his originals, scrapped the full-band versions and instead released a selection of his stripped-down demos as Nebraska. Not all of them, though: Some were held back for his next album, Born in the U.S.A. One was the title track, and below, you can hear the Electric Nebraska version that might have been. We were trying to bring Nebraska into the electric world.” He added of the live Nebraska rendition, “I think in playing these songs again to be filmed, their weight impressed upon me. Springsteen recently reissued a series of mythic shelved records in the box set Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His new biopic, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, got its first trailer in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Sundance hit so enticing that its star's stans got the film pulled from the festival's online platform after it was repeatedly pirated for clout on social media, Twinless does indeed offer a hilarious, affecting, range-proving dual performance from Dylan O'Brien that's worth the criminal hype. Befitting the dark small-scale comedy's title, O'Brien plays both gay hotshot Rocky and his straight dimwit brother Roman—that is, until Rocky gets annihilated early on by a passing truck. But this narrative rug-pull isn't the last or largest in James Sweeney's ridiculous film, which twists its initial coping comedy premise into catty erotica just clever enough to pull off its sillier ideas. But Twinless isn't just a hyper-specific joke about “boyfriend twins” spinning out into madness. Rather, that's just one small punchline caught in the avalanche of its snowballing plot, which begins innocuously enough with Roman heading to a support group for those who've lost twins. It's there, at this meeting ripped from a night at the improv, where the stressed and unmoored lunk runs into Denis (Sweeney), who reminds him of his brother and offers him a surrogate second half. Without his other (and, he worries, better) half, Roman isn't just adrift, but totally lost. Roman devolves into a prototypically basic man-child when detached from his late twin, all grey sweatpants and video games and takeout, which Denis sees as an opening to get in with the malapropistic, sometimes caveman-like bro. Like Roman's “any port in a storm” attitude, Denis' affection for his support group compatriot isn't entirely compromised by ulterior motives, but a complex internal debate rages beneath every calculated move made on his end of the relationship. This is where Sweeney—who injects his sophomore directing effort with some amusing visual gags, charmingly coordinated costumes, and shot designs far more thoughtful than your run-of-the-mill comedy—struggles as a performer. That heart, though, is an essential counterweight to the zanier elements of the story, which verges on viral Cut article territory in terms of sheer messiness and confident stupidity. Even the subgenres encased within Twinless seem to banter with each other in a winning double act.
