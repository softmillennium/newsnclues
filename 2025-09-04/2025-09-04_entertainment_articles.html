That's the key to surviving Stephen King's cult-hit horror novel from 1979 — about a fascist American government and a group of teen boys who supposedly “volunteer” for its lethal endurance test. King wrote it when he was just 19 years old and still a student at the University of Maine. But the wisdom he gave his characters back then might explain some of the success he has now. “None of us really has anything to lose. That makes it easier to give away.” “If people took it one day at a time, they'd be a lot happier.” “Pick 'em up. Related Stories ‘Erupcja' Review: Charli xcx Ditches Her Boyfriend for a Polish Girl in Light and Breezy Movie About the Upside of Main Character Syndrome ‘Charlie Harper' Review: Sincerity Cancels Out the Cliches in a Cyclical Story of Doomed Love I've been quoting advice from “The Long Walk” since I was younger than Bachman, but the core genius of King's first novel didn't fully sink in for me until I saw Lionsgate's terrifying new film adaptation in theaters. Marching more than five miles… with over a dozen strangers… in the dark(!! Yes, I was one of the lucky few who got to see “The Long Walk” early, on a treadmill. “The emotion is the hard part,” said Briana McElroy, Lionsgate‘s head of worldwide digital marketing, to IndieWire. “We wanted audiences to put themselves in these characters' shoes, and watching people connect with that idea has been so, so exciting.” Inside the historic Culver Theater in Los Angeles over Labor Day weekend, seats were swapped for orange exercise equipment and actors stepped in as drill sergeants. Not unlike the rules of the death game we were simulating, our commanders' directives were deceptively simple. Maintain a speed of three miles per hour and you can finish the movie. But fall below that threshold for even a second? That's game over and you will get kicked out. “This movie is such a physically and emotionally compelling proposition,” said McElroy. “That's really where the heart of this idea came from, and seeing the incredible reaction people have had to it online makes us even more excited about the release.” Directed by Francis Lawrence (“The Hunger Games”) and written by JT Mollner (“Strange Darling”), Lionsgate's shocking new horror movie opens in theaters nationwide on September 12, but the exercise gimmick won't expand with it. If you're still trying to see “The Long Walk” early — and you're in the Los Angeles area tonight — then you should join me and actress Judy Greer for IndieWire's special advanced screening and Q&A. We'll be at the AMC Century City on Thursday, September 4 at 7 p.m. Request an invite for IndieWire's special early screening of “The Long Walk” here. Sadly, the midnight movie magic that befell me and my Long Treadmill compatriots will be gone from our city by then. Turns out, you can rent lightweight treadmills that are remarkably easy to move, and they can be set at a fixed speed. But seeing the boys' distance climb on screen, I almost forgot our race entirely. “I was very impressed with everybody and their stamina. The idea of what these boys went through in the book, the relationships they formed and tested by trying to win, then joining them in that by treating the stakes as 100 percent real in a theater, that just means everything to us.” Since the dawn of smartphones, cinephiles have been complaining about second-screeners who can't seem to sit through a film — but chasing after one like it's the only carrot in an equestrian apocalypse could be a solution that actually works. In reality, the propulsive noise snapped us to attention and it seemed to subtly push the movie forward. This was an influencer event, so, yes, attendees were using their phones. But even capturing content for social media, “The Long Walk” held everyone's attention. Our drill sergeants struggled to keep on their aviators inside the dark theater, and although they were very attentive about giving us water, the live performers seemed just as captivated by the film as they were with managing the game and its participants. “The first reaction people have is wondering if they can handle it, physically,” said McElroy. Shortly before the screening (mine was one of three that took place inside Auditorium 11, Culver Theater's most flexible event space), I introduced myself to a few other folks who were standing around. Our thespian captors mostly mean-mugged me, but I had an “Allie” to my left and a “Christine” to my right who were warm, friendly, and willing to chat. When that Allie stumbled and nearly fell during the film's first 20 minutes, this Ali panicked thinking her new friend might get kicked out. But even without the hassle of Lionsgate founding a national gym/theater chain (a hybrid movie palace called something like but not exactly… Cinematic Soul Cycle? 38 known only as “Stebbins” (Garret Wareing), No. We meet Ray in a sea of hopeless competitors succumbing to a capitalist rat race that has no real winners. In an attempt to hang onto my own identity, I wore Doc Martens instead of sneakers. Lionsgate could have a full-on fascist field day explaining why Mark Hamill was the right choice to play the General for “The Long Walk.” Star Wars devotees, who have more thoughts on the 73-year-old actor than I can even fake, know all too well that epic adventures can make powerful metaphors for authoritarianism. But death games tell you how they end by design, and the last man standing in the movie is a far cry from Luke Skywalker. I almost paid the price during what I consider to be the most emotional scene in the movie, when my glasses flew off but I continued to walk and cry in place. There's a slew of reasons I couldn't review “The Long Walk” for IndieWire. I also come from a family of batshit insane long-distance runners, and these days, if you talk to me at a bar anytime past 9 p.m., I've got more to say about politics than you would like to hear. Because I attended a test screening of the movie this spring, and in my written feedback, I suggested the very treadmill idea the studio later brought to life for zany King fans like me. “Dream factory occasionally does make dreams,” said TIFF midnight programmer Peter Kuplowsky, when I DM'd him about the unforgettable event in an overjoyed frenzy. Standing or sitting, this is my favorite horror movie of the year (so far!) and I'm excited to get back on the trail with a third screening soon. “‘FUCK THE LONG WALK,'” I joked to one of my favorite publicists, No. Taking on a small rebellion in the middle of a fight for their lives, the boys use that rallying cry to get through the middle slump of their grueling journey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after Tamera Mowry-Housley starred in Hallmark's first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” movie, “Murder in G Major,” she'll take on a new crime in “Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at C” on October 12, 2025. But with multiple other Hallmark mystery franchises on hold, including “Curious Caterer,” a second mystery on the autum schedule is a welcome surprise for sleuthers, and timed perfectly for a spooky weekend on the network with the October 11 premiere of “Haul Out the Halloween.” Countdown to Christmas is expected to start the following weekend. In the first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries,” we met Gethsemane, a former orchestra conductor who moved to Ireland to teach at a boarding school, St. Brendan's, where she's tasked with turning a motley group of students into an award-winning chorus. But when she keeps hearing the same four notes playing in the old Irish house where she's staying, she discovers it's the ghost of one of her music idols, a songwriter-musician, Eamon, played by Risteard Cooper, who perished years before in a mysterious murder-suicide. She gets assistance from local Inspector O'Reilly, played by Adam Fergus, and her teaching colleague Griff, played by Hallmark fan favorite and “Riverdale” actor Marco Grazzini. On February 3, Mowry-Housley indicated that she would be filming in Ireland for a long shoot and would miss her husband and their two kids, though they eventually were able to visit. According to Ireland's Screen Crew and Services Database, “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” was scheduled to film for more than two months, from February 4 to April 11, in Dublin and in picturesque Wicklow, located about 30 miles south of the city. Given that most Hallmark movies stick to a 15-day production schedule, it's likely that the cast and crew had enough time to film two movies. She also spent part of August filming a holiday movie in Vancouver. The “Sister Sister” alum will also helm the new reality competition series “Baked With Love: Holiday,” in which 10 pairs of “home bakers” will compete in a bake-off using family recipes, with the winners receiving a $50,000 prize. The series will air during Countdown to Christmas, but Hallmark hasn't announced a premiere date.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kurt Russell (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) has been cast as a series regular in the new drama The Madison from Taylor Sheridan, starring Michelle Pfeiffer. Ahead of the show's first season premiere, it's expected that the show will receive an early renewal for a sophomore season, we hear. The Madison is a heartfelt exploration of grief and human connection, following a New York City family in the Madison River Valley of central Montana. Russell joins the previously announced cast of Patrick J. Adams, Elle Chapman, Matthew Fox, Beau Garrett, Amiah Miller, Alaina Pollack, Ben Schnetzer, Rebecca Spence, Danielle Vasinova and Kevin Zegers. 'The Rivals Of Amziah King' Review: Matthew McConaughey And Kurt Russell In Bee Movie Crime Thriller - SXSW The series is executive produced by Taylor Sheridan, David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Christina Voros, Michael Friedman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kurt Russell and Keith Cox. Produced by Paramount Television Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions, The Madison is part of the growing Yellowstone universe. While the elder Russell has appeared in various TV shows throughout his lengthy career, he is perhaps best known for his work in films like Overboard, Grindhouse, Big Trouble in Little China, Tombstone, Escape from New York, Escape from L.A., Backdraft, The Thing, and Tequila Sunrise, to name a few. Russell's most recent feature-film credits include Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pete Berg's Deepwater Horizon, Fast and Furious 8, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Christmas Chronicles 1 &2, and Smurfs.

Justin Bieber is no stranger to making history on YouTube, and now the pop superstar has scored his first music video to rack up 4 billion views on the platform. On Thursday (Sept. 4), YouTube announced that Bieber's “Sorry” music video had surpassed 4 billion views. Ironically, Bieber himself is nowhere to be found in the 2015 clip, which features a series of dancers in bright-colored clothes performing choreography from dance star Parris Goebel. “Sorry” is one of only 15 music videos to have crossed the 4 billion mark — led by Luis Fonsi's “Despacito,” featuring Daddy Yankee, with 8.8 billion views. “Sorry,” from Bieber's 2015 album Purpose, marked the singer's second-ever No. Also on Thursday, Bieber surprise-announced a second 2025 album, with Swag II set to be released at midnight tonight, following the July 11 release of Swag.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Sydney Sweeney arrives at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, she'll be happy to talk about anything pertaining to Christy, the David Michôd film in which she portrays professional boxer Christy Martin. She'll talk preparation, collaboration, and whatever else leads directly back to the movie. “I am there to support my movie and the people involved in making it, and I'm not there to talk about jeans,” Sweeney told Vanity Fair in an interview ahead of the festival where the film is set to premiere. The campaign, which launched earlier this summer, was slammed over allegations of dog-whistling eugenics because of the play-on-words tagline, “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans/Genes.” This week, American Eagle shared data showing that their Sydney Jacket sold out in one day, while their Sydney Jean sold out in one week, with plans to restock in November, per People. Sweeney didn't have any further comment about the campaign to Vanity Fair. Christy is now Sweeney's second promotional cycle to be plagued by the controversy.

Rolling Stone named Christy one of the most anticipated movies scheduled to premiere at TIFF. “Now Sydney Sweeney steps into the ring, figuratively and otherwise, to play Martin in this sports biopic from David Michôd (Animal Kingdom, War Machine),” David Fear wrote. “No word on whether her jeans are good or not, but we can tell you that she apparently trained hard for the role, and Ben Foster plays her manager-slash-husband Jim Martin.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any discussion of Pete Ohs' movies inevitably turns towards his unique process, which combines the logical sequences of Ohs' background as a computer programmer with an open-minded, improvisational approach to writing and performance. After co-starring in The True Beauty Of Being Bitten By A Tick, which premiered at this year's SXSW, Jeremy O. Harris returns for Ohs' latest, Erupcja. But, also inevitably, the headlines around Erupcja will revolve around a new member of the ensemble: Pop singer (and high-profile Letterboxd user) Charli XCX stars in Erupcja as Bethany, a British tourist who doesn't know what she wants, but keeps feeling called back to Warsaw, Poland. She says it's because the city is romantic, and relatively under-visited compared to Paris or Rome. But really, it's because she can't stay away from Nel (Lena Góra), a Polish florist with whom Bethany shares an explosive connection. It's natural and intimate, and spontaneous in the way that people can be when they're around someone they'd follow into the ocean if it meant a little more time together. It feels as though they've known each other for decades—which we learn as the story unfolds, and reveals that Bethany and Nel first met when Bethany came to Warsaw on a school trip many years ago. but to Bethany and Nel, it's further proof that they share something magical. This time, Mount Etna is keeping Bethany in Poland longer than expected. And this time, things are more complicated than usual, as Bethany has brought her boyfriend Rob (Madden) along on what's supposed to be a romantic weekend. (It is, but not in the way Rob was expecting.) So she subtly undermines any activity Rob has planned that might make an appropriate background for an engagement, while sneaking out at night to go see Nel. Madden is the film's most pathetic presence, walking alone in the rain and leaving a series of increasingly dejected voicemails on Bethany's phone. The characters in Erupcja behave in ways that are selfish and short-sighted, but painfully realistic; treating someone so poorly that they break up with you so you don't have to break up with them is practically a rite of passage for avoidant young adults like Bethany. Charli XCX gives a surprisingly good, grounded performance in this regard, adjusting her body language and eye contact to express the things her character can't. This sound reoccurs throughout Erupcja, a little louder each time, until—much like Bethany and Nel's attraction—it can no longer be ignored. The effect is sensual, even sexy, creating a dreamy bubble around the characters as they make decisions they'll have to apologize for later. Erupcja is held together by fairytale narration, delivered in Polish by Jacek Zubiel; it's a smart strategic move, as otherwise the narrative might feel too slight or disjointed to keep the audience's attention long enough to appreciate all the subtle details. It's this type of decision-making that makes Erupcja Pete Ohs' best film yet. Director: Pete Ohs Writer: Pete Ohs, Jeremy O.

Sometimes, a romance feels so inevitable that no matter what either party does, the universe just keeps pushing them back together. Hollywood romances are often built on a formula of “Guy Gets Girl, Guy Loses Girl, Guy Gets Girl Back,” but the love stories that shape us the most often require running through that cycle quite a few more times, with no guarantees of happy endings. The five-year romance between Charlie (Nick Robinson) and Harper (Emilia Jones) is nothing if not cyclical. It began as a high school flirtation, with the two artsy misfits burning CDs of their favorite songs and leaving them in each other's lockers, content to let their favorite artists do the talking at an age when the prospect of socializing with people you like often feels like social suicide. They reconnect at a college party, initially feigning forgetfulness until a well-placed song on the aux cord makes it clear that their memories of each other were crystal clear. Related Stories I Survived ‘The Long Walk' Treadmill Challenge — What 5 Miles with the New Stephen King Classic Felt Like ‘Erupcja' Review: Charli xcx Ditches Her Boyfriend for a Polish Girl in Light and Breezy Movie About the Upside of Main Character Syndrome That sparks a romance that sees them move to New Orleans together as Harper pursues her culinary dreams, only to find that his lack of ambition and struggles with substance abuse are hurdles that their relationship isn't strong enough to handle. Years go by, and they each build their own separate lives until another spontaneous party encounter makes it clear that some feelings are harder to forget than your favorite song. That might sound like a spoiler-laden summary of an entire movie, but “Charlie Harper” writer Tom Dean (who co-directs with Mac Eldridge) utilizes cyclical storytelling that gives you all of that information very early on. They're drawn to each other because they both see that there's more to the world than the sad little town they grew up in (and, let's face it, because they're both hot), but her obsession with rising above her station was always going to clash with his seeming contentment to drink himself into an early grave. Dean and Eldridge know how to make a stylish film that manipulatively tugs on all the right emotional strings, and a few tears will probably be shed at the “Charlie Harper” premiere. It's not hard to imagine the film finding an audience among younger indie film fans who either don't remember movies like “(500) Days of Summer” or are simply eager to have one for their own generation. Those with a bit more viewing experience under their belts will probably grow bored of the film's dependence on cliches, as it often feels like a bittersweet mixtape of old indie tropes: the manipulative power of nostalgia, the ways that seemingly inconsequential pieces of physical media can become formative memories, the euphoric feeling of falling in love and fantasizing about the big world waiting for you outside your hometown, and the realizations that even if love wasn't enough, relationships can still shape us for the better. There have been multitudes of movies made about the toxic young romances that shape us into the more stable adults we eventually become, but the world will stop making them when they stop making us feel things. “Charlie Harper” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery is suing a prominent artificial intelligence image generator for copyright infringement, escalating a high-stakes battle involving the use of movies and TV shows owned by major studios to teach AI systems. Discovery's intellectual property” by letting subscribers produce images and videos of iconic copyrighted characters, alleges the complaint, filed on Thursday in California federal court. Brad Singer to Serve as Warner Bros. CFO After Company Splits “The heart of what we do is develop stories and characters to entertain our audiences, bringing to life the vision and passion of our creative partners,” said a Warner Bros. For years, AI companies have been training their technology on data scraped across the internet without compensating creators. It's led to lawsuits from authors, record labels, news organizations, artists and studios, which contend that some AI tools erode demand for their content. Discovery joins Disney and Universal, which earlier this year teamed up to sue Midjourney. In a statement, Disney said it's “committed to protecting our creators and innovators” and that it's “pleased to be joined by Warner Bros. Discovery in the fight against Midjourney's blatant copyright infringement.” Added NBCUniversal, “Creative artists are the backbone of our industry, and we are committed to protecting their work and our intellectual property.” Discovery points to Midjourney generating images of iconic copyrighted characters. Midjourney, which has four tiers of paid subscriptions ranging from $10 to $120 per month and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, returns characters owned by Warner Bros. Discovery even in response to prompts like “classic comic book superhero battle” that don't explicitly mention any particular intellectual property, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit argues Midjourney's ability to return copyrighted characters is a “clear draw for subscribers,” diverting consumers away from purchasing Warner Bros. Discovery-approved posters, wall art and prints, among other products that must now compete against the service. Like OpenAI, the content used to train Midjourney's technology is a black box, representing an obstacle for some creators who've sued AI companies for copyright infringement. Rightsholders have mined public statements from AI company C-suites for clues. In 2022, Midjourney founder David Holz said in an interview that his employees “grab everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” The specifics of the training process will be subject to discovery. The thrust of the studios' lawsuits will likely be decided by one question: Are AI companies covered by fair use, the legal doctrine in intellectual property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted works without a license? On that issue, a court found earlier this year that Amazon-backed Anthropic is on solid legal ground, at least with respect to training. Discovery, Disney and Universal to get similar payouts depending on what they unearth in discovery over how Midjourney obtained copies of thousands of films and TV shosws that were repurposed to teach its image generator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Sept. 13, we look at Sabrina Carpenter's first two singles from her just-released Man's Best Friend set, and which may have the stronger performance on next week's chart. Lady Gaga Makes 'Hard & Agonizing Decision' to Cancel Tonight's Miami Mayhem Ball Concert Young Thug Seemingly Addresses Online Backlash After Jail Calls Leak: 'Bashing Me Only Goin F--- That Rap Community Up More' Sabrina Carpenter, “Tears” & “Manchild” (Island/Republic): Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is all but guaranteed to have the top spot on next week's Billboard 200 albums chart with her new set Man's Best Friend. 1 Short n' Sweet, Carpenter's latest arrives on the back of a good deal of discourse around its provocative title and cover — which the singer-songwriter has largely shrugged off — as well as her second No. 1 on the Hot 100 with lead single “Manchild,” which became her first song to debut atop the chart upon its June release. Next week, Carpenter will look to make it two No. 1 debuts in a row with winking, discofied second single “Tears” — which, as “Manchild” did, arrives along with a big new music video. Directed by Bardia Zeinali (who also helmed the Barry Keoghan-co-starring clip for Carpenter's first Hot 100 No. “Tears” is off to a very good start at DSPs, hitting No. On radio, it's still only getting started, but is also set to make a fairly strong debut, possibly entering the top 25 on Pop Airplay, and earning 7.4 million in all-format audience over the first four days of the tracking week (Aug. 29-Sept. 1), according to Luminate. The one area where it's clearly lagging behind where “Manchild” began is in sales, as “Tears” has had a good-not-great showing on iTunes, currently landing outside the top 25 on that real-time chart. “Tears” will also face continued competition from “Manchild” on the chart next week, as that song had slipped out of the top 10 on the Hot 100, but rebounds 14-7 this week with notable gains in both streaming and radio. Those streams should continue to rise for next week with the release of the full Man's Best Friend (which “Manchild” leads off), and the song is also continuing to grow on radio, most likely tracking for a second week atop the Pop Airplay chart, and up another 5% in all-format audience over that Aug. 29-Sept. 1 period. Whether “Tears” can outpace “Manchild” and put up a real challenge for the No. 1 spot may be determined by its final few days of tracking — as the song returned to the top of the Spotify daily listing after Labor Day Weekend, and may continue to swell from there as more and more listeners catch onto its charms. HUNTR/X: EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): The biggest challenge for “Tears” on the Hot 100 will of course be getting past HUNTR/X's “Golden,” which holds at No. It's crazy to say about a song by a fictional girl group from a K-pop movie musical — versus one of the most consistent radio hitmakers of the last two years — but radio may be the thing that keeps “Golden” out of range for Sabrina Carpenter's latest to pass next week on the Hot 100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The project has an Oct. 16, 2026 release date as Legendary inks a three-year deal with Paramount. Street Fighter — and its parent studio Legendary — have a new place to call home. 'Call of Duty' Coming to Theaters as Paramount, Activision Strike Major Film Deal Here's the new logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. The Legendary deal, now official, was reported to be in talks on Aug. 18 and comes after its output deal with Sony expired at the end of 2024. “Legendary has built a reputation for ambitious, globally appealing films, and we're excited to be partnering with them. Added Legendary CEO Josh Grode: “Partnering with David, Dana and Josh and their teams at Paramount marks an exciting new chapter for Legendary as we continue to pursue a diversified growth strategy—expanding our output, building new franchises, and creating more films for global audiences. This is just one of many key early moves made by David Ellison's new Paramount, which lured Stranger Things creators the Duffer Bros. from Netflix, inked a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights, and signed Will Smith's Westbrook to a first-look film deal.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comedian Druski's latest sketch video only has nine words in its description: “That Guy who is just Proud to be AMERICAN.” But in the 36 hours since he posted it on social media, the video of him assuming the persona of a NASCAR fanatic — attending an actual NASCAR event complete with an American flag cowboy hat, sagging overalls, and oh, yeah, a full body race change via makeup — has already captured the internet's discourse machine. The video is less than three minutes long, but manages to capture an impressive display of Druski embodying some of the funniest aspects of Southern racing culture, which includes him singing Born In The U.S.A. in a lifted truck, chugging beer after beer near a crowded race track, and being driven nearly to tears over a simple rendition of the National Anthem. There's also plenty of nods to how overwhelmingly white the sport tends to be — at one point Druski drives past a Black fan and asks if he's “lost.” It's an absolutely hysterical offering, but feels perfectly on-vibe from the comedian, who built a following with his character-driven social media sketches. Born Drew Desbordes, Druski, 30, is a long way from the kid who spent his time at the dinner table cutting up. He told Rolling Stone in 2024 that social media helped him build his comedy career because it allowed him to completely bypass gatekeepers — and find people who shared his sense of humor. Since Druski released his NASCAR video, it's gone viral on every social media platform it's been posted on, including Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. There's of course, the debate about whether a Black comedian donning makeup to appear white is racist — “whiteface is racism” arguments abound — which is to be expected on a site that's become known for a tidal wave of misinformation and misogyny, racism, and Nazi-themed content. But what's been louder is the general awe at just how perfect Druski's makeup looks — so good, in fact, that it's actually tricked some people. “Been scrolling by this not understanding why yall kept putting this white man all over my tl,” tweeted one person. While Druski is the mastermind behind the video, the Picasso responsible for that perfect blend of white makeup, fake tattoos, and farmer's tan is Georgia makeup artist Kaylee Kehne-Swisher, who specializes in everything from commercial touchups and makeovers to nitty gritty film special effects. She worked on Weapons, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Zombieland: Double Tap, and now, the internet comedy sketch that you've probably already watched at least three times. But what people might not know is that this isn't the first time she's worked with Druski — it's not even the first time she's used makeup to turn him white. “I love these characters that Druski's coming up with,” Kehne-Swisher says. “I've always really loved [Saturday Night Live], where you can hardly tell who a person is under Clinton makeup, or White Chicks — these big makeup transformations. I've been trying to come up with more ideas for him, like ‘What can we get away with? Rolling Stone chatted with Kehne-Swisher about the process behind the now-viral video, working with Druski, and why she thinks SFX will always have a big place in art.

I went to Joe Blasco, which is a makeup school in [Orlando], Florida. That's how I got wrapped in with Druski — he was looking for a big makeup [project] like this. But no, I'd never heard of him before that. Tell me about how you even tackle a project like this. So this time around, I was able to bring another artist on, assistant Rachel Bongard Ross, and we got the makeup down to about four hours. This time around for NASCAR, they sent me some samples of the sunburn and that mullet look and we just went from there. I had maybe four to five days to prep for it this time, which is really nice, but it was definitely a lot of work. Walk me through the steps you have to go through in order to get a final product that, frankly, looks pretty realistic.This is something that makeup artists have to do often actually — like with stunt doubles, we have to make them match [the actor]. You have roll out their current color with a red or something close to neutralize and bring in that blood tone. From there, we add more paint on top of that, speckling and all kinds of  shimmer to make it look like more skin. For Druski, we added tattoos, and a lace mustache to him. Originally I was going to try to put a lace beard over his beard, but, with the time [crunch] we actually ended up just straightening his own board. We did have a lot of ideas at first, wanting to add things to his nose, and do a stretchy nipple and have more wrinkly eyes, but I'm actually really happy we didn't do it because I feel like you can see him in the makeup. I worked with a company called Hookup Tattoos here in Atlanta, and they make tattoos for movies and all kinds of things. Then I also found some temporary tattoos on Amazon and they came out surprisingly good. You have to put paint on top of them to make it look a little more real, but for character makeup it was perfect. And we basically painted the sunburn right on. Then with lighter tones, we went over and speckled different reds and misted other tones of red to give it some modeling. How do you keep so much paint intact through what was essentially a Beer Olympics? This is something I've done before with stunt actors or others in the film industry, when they have to be in water.

RFK Jr. Claims mRNA Vaccines Kill People in Heated Senate Hearing Bruce Springsteen to Release ‘Electric Nebraska' — and More — in Surprise Box Set What do you think makeup's place is in the art and film world, especially at a time when productions are dominated by a ton of technological advancements and VFX?I actually was on Weapons, which is a movie that came out recently. But that was a huge thing using practical effects because a lot of films now are using CGI and AI. A blend of CGI and makeup together are perfect. So finding people that are willing to keep doing things practically, and instructors that want to keep doing that, people like Druski, who want to make these big characters — it's really, really cool.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pink never looked cooler than when Jason Momoa stepped onto the Venice red carpet. Momoa stepped out in a blush pink suit that wowed onlookers and stole the spotlight. Wearing his long curls loose and accessorizing with sleek black sunglasses, Momoa struck a balance of playful charm and refined style at the star-studded premiere. Momoa paired his suit with light pink fuzzy Birkenstock Arizona sandals from the brand's 2023 collaboration with Concepts and painted his toenails to match. He even leaned toward the cameras at one point, striking playful poses to show off the coordinated look. He later told InStyle in 2020, “Pink is just a beautiful color. And I'm pretty secure in my masculinity. I don't really give a s—t what anyone thinks.” Momoa has also shown affection for Birkenstocks over the years. The Venice appearance comes during a busy chapter for Momoa. In July, he made headlines after shaving off his signature facial hair for “Dune: Part Three”, joking on Instagram: “Haven't shaved in six years, and here we are again. Off-screen, the Hawaiian-born star has also been making waves in his personal life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Say what you will about Ryan Murphy's real-life murderer anthology, but at least he's settled on less cumbersome titles. Yes, the series seems to have found its groove, so what better time to approach a figure Netflix describes as “history's most singular ghoul?” It's Charlie Hunnam's turn to be monstrous when the new season premieres October 3, and based on the trailer, he's up to the task. “Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre—he became the blueprint for modern horror.” Monster: The Ed Gein Story features a handful of Murphy alumni, as Murphy shows are wont to do; that includes Tom Hollander (Feud: Capote Vs. Some esteemed newcomers to Murphy's sandbox include Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf as Ed's mother Augusta Gein and Vicky Krieps as Ilse Koch. Krieps has signed on to appear in the next season of Monster about Lizzie Borden, and it was reported this week Hunnam is in talks to play Borden's father.

Kneecap will livestream a concert from a secret location in Ireland on Friday, October 10, as a sort of makeup show for their recently canceled U.S. tour. As well as broadcasting online from 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (at this link), the stream will play at a ticketed showing at Kings Theatre, in Brooklyn, New York, that night.

This week, Kneecap released “Sayōnara,” a new collaboration with Orbital's Paul Hartnoll, with a video starring Derry Girls actor Jamie Lee O'Donnell. Its release followed the cancellation of their sold-out, 15-date tour of the United States, apparently due to Mo Chara's forthcoming court appearance in London on a strongly disputed terror charge. Kneecap's four Canadian shows are set to go ahead, as are their European dates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen has announced a Nebraska expansion that includes the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions, released for the first time. But the Boss, preferring his originals, scrapped the full-band versions and instead released a selection of his stripped-down demos as Nebraska. Not all of them, though: Some were held back for his next album, Born in the U.S.A. One was the title track, and below, you can hear the Electric Nebraska version that might have been. We were trying to bring Nebraska into the electric world.” He added of the live Nebraska rendition, “I think in playing these songs again to be filmed, their weight impressed upon me. Springsteen recently reissued a series of mythic shelved records in the box set Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His new biopic, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, got its first trailer in June.
