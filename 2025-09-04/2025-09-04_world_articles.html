                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Letitia James seeks to reverse appeals court's decision to wipe away president's penalty in financial fraud case New York's attorney general has requested the state's highest court reinstate Donald Trump's large civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion dollar penalty to nothing. James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal. Trump, the US president, declared “TOTAL VICTORY” after the appellate division wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers. Trump, a Republican, filed his own appeal last week, asking the court of appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, from holding corporate leadership positions in New York. Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the appellate division judges said Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals. James's appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida. After a trial the judge, Arthur Engoron, ruled last year that James had proved Trump engaged in a years-long conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m – payback of what the judge deemed “ill-gotten gains” from his puffed-up financial statements. The five-judge appellate division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo is “Donald Trump's choice” for mayor, Zohran Mamdani said at a press conference. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The Times reports that Trump's advisers have discussed giving Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa positions in the president's administration in order “to give former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in November's general election.” Sliwa said in a statement that he had not been contacted by the Trump administration. Cuomo told reporters, “I don't want him [Trump] involved in anything with my race.” Cuomo has not held elected office since he was forced to step down as New York governor in 2021 after several women accused him of sexual harassment. Last year, Cuomo joined the legal team for accused war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A Truthout investigation  published last month revealed that billionaires and their companies “have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates.” Mamdani is running on a platform that includes raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers, as well as a rent freeze, free city buses, and universal pre-K. “Today, we have learned what New Yorkers have long suspected, that Andrew Cuomo is Donald Trump's choice to be the next mayor of this city,” Mamdani said at a press conference he called in response to the Times story. Last year, Adams was charged with bribery and campaign finance violations. “We are talking about a mayor who was facing an indictment that was then dropped by this administration to ensure greater collaboration with the immigration directives of this administration now being considered for a job offer,” Mamdani said. 62 days until we elect @ZohranKMamdani and put this absurd cabal behind us.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court has blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.” On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier called this a “victory against an activist judge” in a social media post. “The 11th Circuit not only blocked Judge (Kathleen) Williams' order to close Alligator Alcatraz, but they blocked her from proceeding with the case until the appeal is complete. A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!” It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July. Ever since then, the makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure. “The project creates irreparable harm in the form of habitat loss and increased mortality to endangered species in the area,” US District Judge Kathleen Williams said in her order in late August. Ron DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees. This is a developing story.</p>

Recently, I was running down the street, carrying food for my friend in northern Gaza, with a tank speeding behind me like a predatory beast. It had only been a nightmare — but a nightmare rooted in the reality of war, in the deep psychological harm that has marked us and continues to haunt us every day. A door slamming shut is enough to make our bodies jolt involuntarily, convinced We're hearing an explosion. And every time we try to heal, we realize that this fear has been growing inside us during months of death under Israeli siege. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “The psychological situation today [in Gaza] is more complex and more dangerous than at the beginning of the war,” said Dr. Mohammad, a mental health specialist working at a counseling center in Deir al-Balah who asked to keep his last name private. At first, the psychological reactions were acute but predictable — fear, panic, anxiety. People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it. People unconsciously use defense mechanisms such as repression and isolation. They speak and act as if death were just another story to tell. He said the symptoms he sees repeatedly include nightmares, panic attacks, inability to concentrate, survivor's guilt, insomnia, disorientation, dissociative symptoms, denial, and unfocused anger. He has also observed a rise in self-harm attempts, especially among teenagers, alongside severe and almost constant depressive symptoms. “People don't cry as they did in the early days; instead, they look at you with empty eyes, as if saying goodbye to life without leaving it.” Dr. Mohammad explained that the psychological toll varies across age groups. Children often show behavioral symptoms such as bedwetting, excessive clinginess to their mothers, sleep disturbances, stuttering, or aggression. Teenagers tend to either rebel or withdraw, often struggling with identity crises and profound hopelessness. Adults live with the constant push-and-pull of survival, guilt, and responsibility. The elderly may face trauma in silence, rarely seeking help despite their deep suffering. It is not an individual trauma, but a structural one that wounds the very social fabric and reshapes collective consciousness.” Children — those who grew up under the sounds of missiles, loss, and hardship in an environment that denies them a healthy childhood — bear the heaviest scars. When Israeli warplanes bombed their home, Jinan survived and was pulled from the rubble by civil defense workers, but her father, mother, and all her siblings were killed. Her life was turned upside down in a single moment. “The ongoing absence of mental health care puts them at risk of developing chronic disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, and even personality disorders in the future. Some cases are simply beyond our capacity right now — children who have lost their entire families, people who witnessed massacres firsthand without access to a safe environment or consistent support. Those with prior mental health histories have also seen their conditions worsen dramatically.” He stressed that the psychological and human dimension of Gaza is largely absent from international reports, which tend to focus on numbers and material losses. “Covering trauma requires time, effort, and a high level of professionalism, which fast-paced media coverage often lacks.” When asked about the urgent needs for mental health support in Gaza, he said, “We need flexible, community-based emergency interventions; trained staff; medications; psychosocial support tools; safe spaces for children; and group therapy programs. We also need long-term plans that go beyond ‘temporary relief' and build a vision for community recovery.” Dr. Mohammad ended our conversation with a message to the international community and global mental health organizations: “You are required now to do more than condemn. We ask for real support, urgent trauma response, and genuine investment in building a sustainable mental health system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian missile struck a Danish humanitarian demining group in Chernihiv Oblast on Sept. 4, killing two and injuring eight people, the Danish Refugee Council reported. "It is with profound sadness that the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) confirms that one of our humanitarian demining sites in Ukraine was struck by a missile earlier today. "At the time of the incident, DRC teams were conducting purely civilian humanitarian activities—working to clear landmines and explosive remnants of war in order to protect communities and enable safe access to essential infrastructure, farmland, and homes," the organization wrote. Ukraine's northern Chernihiv Oblast borders both Russia and Belarus. "First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now, they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Chaus wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, condemned the attack, saying that Russia is once again violating fundamental norms of international law. As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spanned an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts. The Danish Refugee Council said it "remains committed to its mission of protecting people affected by conflict and displacement in Ukraine." "Despite the risks and challenges, our demining teams undertake this vital work to prevent further loss of life from landmines and unexploded ordnance," the nonprofit wrote.

A Ukrainian citizen was among those killed in a funicular accident in Lisbon, Portugal, on Sept. 3, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to Hromadske. "Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit. "First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times. The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said. The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing. The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal. The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles). The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Northwestern University President Michael Schill announced his resignation Thursday as the university faces an ongoing funding freeze by the Trump administration. His departure is the latest in a string of university leaders' resignations, following tenures marked by criticism and battles with the federal government. “As I reflect on the progress we have made and what lies ahead, I believe now is the right time for new leadership to guide Northwestern into its next chapter,” Schill said in a message to the campus community. “Therefore, I have decided, in consultation with the leadership of the Board of Trustees, that I will step down as President.” In his message, Schill wrote the university faced “serious and often painful challenges” since his tenure began in September 2022, and “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.” The freeze added to similar actions the administration has taken against other elite universities, either demanding changes to their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, or in connection with their handling of protests against the war in Gaza. White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Thursday, “The Trump Administration looks forward to working with the new leadership, and we hope they seize this opportunity to Make Northwestern Great Again.” House Republican Leadership Chairwoman Elise Stefanik said Schill's resignation was “long overdue.” “President Michael Schill finally resigned today after he failed (to) protect Jewish students, caved to the demands of the antisemitic, pro-Hamas mob on Northwestern's campus, and failed to hold students who perpetuate antisemitic attacks accountable at an Education and the Workforce Committee hearing,” she said in a post on X. The university said it has updated its policies to curb antisemitism on its campuses, resulting in a “dramatic decrease” in reported incidents, according to a news release Thursday. Schill's resignation comes a day after a federal judge gave Harvard University a landmark victory in its fight against the Trump administration, siding with the Ivy League school in its effort to restore more than $2 billion in federal funding for research frozen by the White House. “This type of research is now at jeopardy,” the university said in an April statement. Schill had been leading “efforts to ensure the continuation of funding for critical research” during the funding freeze, the university said, and he will continue to work with its Board of Trustees to get them restored. “It is critical that we continue to protect the university's research mission and excellence while preserving academic freedom, integrity, and independence,” Schill said. An interim president for Northwestern has yet to be named and Schill will continue in his role until then, the university said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a lawmaker who monitors human rights abuses abroad, said that the off-the-cuff exchange—and the casual way organ transplants came up—was unsettling. “It shows how cruelty knows no bounds,” Smith told The Epoch Times. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, while walking together before a military parade on Sept. 3, discussed becoming younger with continued organ transplants. Xi suggested the possibility of living to 150 years old in this century. The conversation signals a seeming abundance of organs for China's top political echelon, known for extravagant privileges inaccessible to the Chinese public. How and where to source the organs seemed an afterthought. “The modern means of health support, medicine, even some surgeries involving organ transplantation, allow humanity to hope that the active life span will not be like today,” he told reporters, adding that “it differs from country to country.” “My own argument has been that from Xi Jinping on down, anybody in the higher echelon, especially in the Chinese Communist Party, will look to steal somebody else's internal organs, through coercion, through death, to extend their life. I can't think of a more selfish and barbaric act to do that,” Smith said. Hospitals in China have advertised waiting times as short as days, a major draw for tourists from countries such as the United States with developed organ donation systems, where getting an organ could take much longer. “[In China,] they go and they kill somebody who matches up with your antigens and everything else, so that there's no or less likely to be a rejection of the organ,” Smith said. “I've never seen anything like it, except in Nazi Germany, and I think that's what we're talking about here—it's Nazi like.” “There are so many horrible human rights abuses in the world today. In China, doctors could become an “oppressor,” stealing one's organs under state order, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is facing a gas shortage, The Moscow Times reported on Sept. 4. The statement comes after a months-long Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in an attempt to put economic pressure on Russia and undermine its ability to finance its war against Ukraine. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sept. 4, Putin said that signs of gas shortages are already visible in the Russian Far East. He said that supplying new enterprises can be challenging, and demand for gas is expected to rise significantly in the Far Eastern Federal District in the coming years. He didn't mention the reasons behind a potential shortage. Ukraine has targeted dozens of refineries, oil depots, and military-industrial sites with long-range drones since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 to disrupt Moscow's war effort. The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times. The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said. The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing. The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal. The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education. U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results. "That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said. "Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One sheriff calls surprise use of deputy email list offering $50,000 hiring bonus ‘unprofessional and unethical' The White House's aggressive push to hire federal immigration agents is causing friction with local sheriffs – even those who back Donald Trump's deportation agenda. Judd and other sheriffs have spoken out as the Trump administration has launched its massive recruitment effort to hire 10,000 new Ice officers and 3,000 border patrol agents, backed by an unprecedented $170bn in funding for immigration enforcement activities. Federal agents who would normally handle child abuse, money laundering, fraud and other serious crimes have been diverted to immigration enforcement, targeting undocumented people with civil violations, Reuters reported in March. Last month, the administration moved to temporarily reassign more than 100 FBI agents to conduct nighttime patrols in Washington DC, even though FBI officers generally have little experience or training in patrolling or immigration. Immigrant rights' groups have long criticized those partnerships as harmful to public safety, as they make immigrant communities less likely to report crimes or assist police in investigations. Wayne Ivey, the sheriff in Brevard county, Florida – who made headlines in June for threatening to hospitalize and “kill” anti-Ice protesters – told WESH 2 News last month that Ice's targeting of local deputies was “backhanded” and “frustrated every sheriff”. Recruitment emails to sheriff's deputies were signed by Madison Sheahan, Ice's deputy director, who previously served as an aide to Kristi Noem, homeland security secretary, when Noem was South Dakota governor, ABC News reported. “As someone who is currently supporting Ice through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law,” Sheahan's recruitment email said. He blamed Sheahan, saying she and her DC colleagues did not acknowledge the misstep: “They doubled down. Still, Judd said, “We're not going to back down on President Trump's mission. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning The association's executive director said last month it would be hard for local departments to compete with the $50,000 bonus and other incentives, which could burden agencies already struggling with staffing. Judd, however, said he wasn't concerned about his deputies joining Ice. When people see the way that Ice is being unfairly targeted, even if they want to be in law enforcement, they don't want to be in that branch.” Scott Shuchart, a former senior Ice official under Biden, who has raised concerns about Trump recruitment spree, said it seemed “really disrespectful” to poach from sheriffs who have invested their own funding to support Ice through 287(g) agreements: “They're already taking sheriff's deputies who are supposed to be keeping the community safe and instead are helping out Ice. Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement that Ice was recruiting “local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience”. More than $500m from Trump's major budget bill would go toward expanding 287(g) partnerships, she added. McLaughlin also said Sheahan, the Ice deputy director, had law enforcement experience from her previous job as secretary of the Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries, and had been “instrumental in leading negotiations” for more than 900 287(g) agreements: “These attacks on Madison Sheahan's leadership style have no basis in reality and are rooted in sexism. The effort to recruit sheriffs “shows how both cruel and reckless this administration is when it comes to law enforcement”, added Juan Cuba, executive director of Sheriff Accountability Action, a group that advocates for criminal justice reforms. “It's a complete disregard for one of the biggest issues local law enforcement has, which is recruitment and retention. Those challenges are exacerbated by the administration's approach, but they don't care. What they care about is hitting these artificial quotas,” he said, noting Trump's demands for 3,000 immigration arrests a day. Some sheriffs do oppose efforts to have their deputies act as immigration officers, because they already feel stretched thin or are concerned about eroding public trust, Cuba noted. But publicly objecting can carry consequences, he said, noting that after Broward county's sheriff said he didn't want deputies arresting people for civil immigration violations, Florida's attorney general threatened to take steps to have him removed from office. “We see silence from police chiefs and sheriffs because of political threats,” he said. “It is very alarming that public officials feel like they can't raise concerns.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He died at age 73 on Monday, Sept. 1, after a long illness.Mathew Tsang/Getty Images We were working on a short scene where a long estranged Indigenous father is talking with his daughter about how the rules of family can sometimes not have happy endings. “No,” he replies, “Graham Greene isn't here.” Yes, there was a time not that long ago when Graham Greene wasn't as well-known as he is today. These days, in many corners of the world, he's much more familiar than that British guy who wrote Our Man in Havana and The Quiet American. Governor General Mary Simon presents Graham Greene with a Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award in June, 2025.PATRICK DOYLE/The Canadian Press An Oneida of the Six Nations Reserve in Southern Ontario, Greene was an actor who spanned many mediums and genres of the storytelling venues. Before all that, he sampled the world as a welder, draftsman, steelworker and an audio technician before being urged to try acting and finding his true home. My life and his intertwined many times in the previous century. Another time I went out for a beer with him, and we found ourselves at a bar, sitting with the remaining original members of the Byrds, who were performing in a concert hall nearby. Another time, I was the writer-in-residence for a theatre company named Native Earth Performing Arts, I was attending the rehearsal of a little play called Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing written by Tomson Highway. It was there I saw Greene in his full glory, strutting the stage as Pierre St. Pierre, a role that many would argue put Greene on the map. He was also a mainstay on television, in shows such as Reservation Dogs, on which he played Maximus.Shane Brown/The Associated Press The play is seldom produced these days for several reasons, but his portrayal of that lovable drunk and hockey referee told me what a true actor can achieve. He would disappear into the character, creating unique elements that helped construct the persona he morphed into. And if I remember correctly, many of the actors had to take a few hours off rehearsal one afternoon, as there was a major film company in town holding auditions for a movie. With Greene's portrayal of Kicking Bird, and the subsequent Oscar nomination, his life changed. More recently, he strode the stage at Stratford, where he lived for the last few decades of his life. But perhaps it was his work in film that cemented his popularity in the consciousness of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Movies including Clearcut, Twilight, Maverick, The Green Mile, Pow Wow Highway and Thunderheart showed fans the diversity and complexity of Greene's acting, and of Indigenous characters in general. All of this at a time when Indigenous people were not commonly seen on the big screen. Greene played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in Stratford, where he lived for the last decades of his life.Richard Bain/Stratford Festival Many credit Greene with opening doors for other Indigenous actors, writers and directors, showing them how to storm the world of settler cinema. In fact, it could be said a good portion of society would more than likely recognize him from many of his more mainstream appearances, such as Die Hard with a Vengeance and Transamerica. He was also a mainstay on television, playing such a broad spectrum of characters, in shows such as The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon, Northern Exposure, The Red Green Show, Longmire, The Last of Us and Reservation Dogs. In fact, I believe I first met him on the set of a 13-part children's series that was shot three hours north of Thunder Bay, called Spirit Bay. It was 1985, and I was a young production assistant immediately captivated by his amazing and constant sense of humour. An absurd joke of his or a simple wry comment was better than a strong cup of coffee to start the day. Very casually, he reached into his pocket and pulled out three colourful marbles that he rolled around in his hand. Very dryly, he said, “Contrary to popular rumour, I still have them.” It took me a moment for it to sink in, then I laughed. Red Green (left) and actor Graham Greene enjoy a laugh during a taping of the popular The Red Green Show at CHCH channel 11 in Hamilton in 1995.The Canadian Press In 1991, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing was being remounted at the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and I flew out to see it. I turned to see him in full costume, including a furry hat with ear flaps. With that, he produced a look of shock and dismay, at the same time pulling a string in his pocket making the ears of the hat pop up like a curious dog. Whether the joke was cheap or sophisticated, Greene didn't care. Tom King, the renowned author and friend of Greene, perhaps put it best: “We were in Calgary filming Medicine River. There was a guy who had come from Toronto to interview Graham about the movie. He caught Graham after a long hard day of filming and began asking him a bunch of inane questions. Towards the end, he asked Graham what was his most embarrassing moment and Graham smiled and said it was talking to him. I know that's said frequently about a lot of people who have moved on but to us who have circled in his orbit, it's true. The owner (with his partner Hilary) of many cats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Mahon is director of geopolitical and international business advisory at consulting firm StrategyCorp. The reality is Canada had few other options in dealing with a much more powerful country that throws its weight around to get what it wants. Our initial response to Mr. Trump's tariffs followed an outdated playbook. As his resolve hardened and extended beyond Canada, it became clear that his trade attacks on our country were only the beginning of a much larger project. To advance its domestic and international agenda, the U.S. is pursuing a policy that maximizes power by exploiting its centrality in global economic and security affairs. Canada is in an unenviable position where trade dependence makes us susceptible to economic coercion. Removing our countertariffs is only the latest attempt to secure much needed market access through concessions. Carney says he spoke with Trump, expects ‘small agreements' on tariff relief for some sectors However, the extent and limits of this policy alignment have yet to be determined. Canada's de facto sovereignty is at risk – its ability to freely exercise foreign, security and economic policy. The only antidote is to rapidly build Canada's own power through domestic economic development and a network of complementary relations with other countries. To get clarity on the opportunities and constraints, we must recognize that we've entered a new geopolitical era, that of the economic security regime. A new set of principles and norms are quickly superseding the neo-liberal, rules-based international order. These deals also undermine the old rationale where issues of economics, security and foreign policy are self-contained in separate technocratic tracks. Mr. Trump's deals eschew this maxim, as he uses U.S. power to force multidimensional concessions. The new economic security regime is not merely a product of Mr. Trump's rise. Geopolitical orders are essentially constructions shored up by the system's most powerful countries. Throughout history, there has been an interplay between hegemonic powers that employ what are essentially variants of liberal policies, and rivals that seek advantage through mercantilism. At some point, the leading power reckons that a liberal economic policy no longer suits its interests and then reneges. Canada's tariff revenue surges – but nowhere close to Ottawa's projections It is shirking status quo commitments and redefining its terms of international engagement. The world is now in a transitory period with no clear leader. There is a global struggle over the economic vectors of power: productive investment, technological innovation, jobs and market access. Many of Mr. Trump's policy actions, both domestic and international, seek to maximize U.S. power using these elements. This is where the Canadian government's policy priorities should also lie. Some early indications from Prime Minister Mark Carney's government suggests he understands this. Internationally, the government must gear trade policy toward managing market access to maximize investment and jobs. This means shedding the dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism. Such a doctrine could also apply to China, as reconciling that trade dispute will require granting more certainty to Chinese enterprises, regardless of whether it's welcome or under what conditions. This must be based on an honest assessment of where engagement with China either aids or undermines Canadian economic interests. Despite having a network of free-trade agreements spanning the globe, Canada's trade with key markets doesn't live up to its potential because many Canadian companies manufacture products geared toward the North American market. The government could consider a tax rebate for capital expenditures on products that meet EU standards, at once spurring business investment and trade diversification. While the government has come around to the idea of making Canada an energy superpower, we should recognize that we're already an agricultural superpower and integrate this into foreign policy.

BEIJING, September 3. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are not plotting any conspiracy against the United States, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said, commenting on allegations from US President Donald Trump about the three leaders conspiring against Washington at Beijing's military parade.

"I'd like to say that nobody meant to conspire [against the United States] <…>. Moreover, I can say that everybody understands the role the United States, the Trump administration, and President Trump personally are playing in today's global narratives," Ushakov told VGTRK reporter Pavel Zarubin.

Earlier, Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, addressing China's Xi: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."

The People's Liberation Army of China held a large-scale military parade on Tiananmen Square in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. KURT M. CAMPBELL is Chairman and Co-Founder of The Asia Group. Washington Should Draw New Delhi Closer, Not Push It Away It is also time to consider how to fortify a relationship that has been one of the brightest spots of bipartisan support in a divided Washington where concerted international purpose has been in short supply. More recently, India's desire to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific has led to a strategic alignment with the United States that has effectively disincentivized reckless Chinese adventurism. This common purpose must not be taken for granted. This is partly because U.S.-Indian ties do not fit neatly into the boxes that the United States has historically used to define its most consequential bilateral relationships. Alliances involved formal treaty commitments built on the foundation of a mutual defense guarantee. Indeed, despite fundamental areas of alignment between the two countries, the U.S.-Indian relationship received relatively little attention, because it was not centered on a security guarantee. As Modi's chummy appearance over the weekend with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear, the United States could end up driving India directly into its adversaries' arms. India, meanwhile, could end up squeezed on all sides with an unaccommodating power in China on its border and strained technology, education, and defense ties with the United States. Given this reality, Washington and New Delhi must strive to do more than simply restore the old, suboptimal status quo. They must create a firmer and more ambitious foundation: a strategic alliance between the United States and India based on a series of mutual commitments regarding technology, defense, supply chains, intelligence, and global problem solving. An alliance, in other words, not based on a traditional mutual defense pact. At this moment of unprecedented discord, it may be hard to imagine reinventing and bolstering the relationship. But the United States and India can move forward by using the scaffolding already in place to build a stronger structure. A new strategic alliance between the United States and India would be established by a treaty subject to advice and consent by the U.S. Senate. It would be built on five core pillars, with the aim of enhancing the mutual security, prosperity, and values of both countries. This would mean working together on both the “promote” agenda of bold public investments, common R & D, and shared talent—as well as the “protect” agenda of aligning export controls and cybersecurity measures. The Trump administration's U.S.-India TRUST initiative, built on top of the Biden administration's U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, should be at the core of this effort, but it could and should evolve from primarily a convening forum to a more formal architecture. Such an agreement could anchor R & D partnerships and encourage private-sector investment. The United States and India should also establish a strategic talent partnership that removes obstacles for their scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and technical experts to work together on priority areas. This would include streamlining visa processes on both sides, creating common pots of funding, and removing outdated export controls that stymie collaboration. The natural first step would be a supply chain and investment agreement that would reduce mutual vulnerabilities to coercion and enhance the two countries' respective techno-industrial bases. India and the United States have each acknowledged dependencies on China for vital supply chains, and in some instances, those dependencies are interconnected. For example, China supplies India with 70 to 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since 40 percent of generic drugs in the United States are manufactured in India, the United States is indirectly exposed to India's reliance on Chinese APIs. Similarly, both countries rely heavily on China for critical minerals. This would involve both early warning of impending disruptions and longer-term strategies to make investments that build resilience. And both countries should pursue an investment pact that would reduce obstacles to foreign direct investment, especially in strategic sectors, by addressing nontariff barriers, removing outdated regulatory restrictions in areas like clean energy, and strengthening intellectual property protections. This need not require a traditional Article 5–like guarantee to trigger mutual defense. Among other things, this would mean further institutionalizing and capitalizing the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which was launched in 2023 as an innovation bridge that directly connects the full spectrum of the two countries' defense ecosystems, including government agencies, prime contractors, startups, investors, and research institutions. The agreement that GE Aerospace would manufacture F-414 jet engines in India—an unprecedented technology transfer to a nontreaty partner—showed the promise of a more robust defense partnership. But the goal here cannot and should not be simply to facilitate the transfer of American defense capabilities and technologies to India. The scope of cooperation should grow to include joint naval and air activities in the Indian Ocean involving more submarine cooperation, airborne reconnaissance operations, and joint contingency planning. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, for example, has allowed Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad—to address illegal fishing, trafficking, and unauthorized maritime activities. The next major step would be to build a common maritime intelligence picture for the Indian Ocean, as well as a formalized structure of intelligence sharing and joint analysis that can continually update that picture. The United States can mobilize public- and private-sector resources and development know-how; India can leverage deep experience with this set of challenges as well as its trusted relationships across East Africa and in the Pacific. This could start with joint scalable pilot projects in third countries—such as in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, where the Indian government has demonstrated a new commitment to ambitious infrastructure and health and technology initiatives that align with long-standing U.S. approaches in the Pacific—and grow from there. On this point, those invested in the relationship on Capitol Hill and in the business and strategic community need to impress on their Indian interlocutors that U.S. President Donald Trump's theatrics are often the prelude to dealmaking. This is a deeply unpleasant reality to many, but to paraphrase the late U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, you must do diplomacy with the United States you have, not the one you might prefer. Some will also credibly ask whether India's democratic backsliding would make such an alliance untenable. There are real challenges in India on pluralism, civil rights, and the rule of law, but the relationship should be mature enough to sustain an honest conversation with the government of India and Indian civil society about these trends. The United States should also be humble enough to acknowledge its own significant challenges when it comes to democracy and the rule of law. This is a choice that New Delhi can and should make for its own reasons, not out of deference to Washington. And there have been subtle signs in recent years that India has gradually repositioned itself more toward the United States and Europe. Washington must also refrain from hyphenating its relations with India and Pakistan: there should be no “India-Pakistan” policy. U.S. diplomacy in recent years has been heavily weighted toward New Delhi for a reason. As always, there is the practical question of bureaucracy and capacity on both sides. Can they move the machinery of government to build an alliance? Doing so would require leadership from the top of both governments. And it would require a vision that inspires not only their governments but also their private sectors, technology communities, universities, and publics. It is also worth remembering that many of Washington's most important alliances have seen setbacks and led to domestic discord. The NATO alliance has had to contend with persistent questions about burden sharing. The United States and South Korea previously butted heads over how to handle the threat from North Korea, and there have been periodic public upheavals in Korean public opinion over tragic incidents involving American troops stationed on the peninsula. And India has emerged as one of the United States' most consequential partners. The only thing harder than building and formalizing a deeply significant relationship with India is not having one. So, with no illusions, the United States and India should get to work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Years from now, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as a turning point in U.S. industrial policy, with President Donald Trump's deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials marking the beginning of a new era of direct state investment in key industries. As the United States competes over the technologies and industries of tomorrow, Washington is now experimenting with state-centric investment strategies that resemble those of Beijing. But because the U.S. federal government is constrained by a debt-to-GDP ratio above 120 percent and a budget deficit exceeding seven percent, U.S. policymakers will have to channel more private capital toward strategically important sectors. To ensure a successful industrial strategy, the Trump administration must set clear criteria for what qualifies as a strategic industry, marshal the necessary public resources, and incentivize private investment in those industries. In China, the government plays a central role as a source, allocator, and user of capital, directly resourcing strategic priorities but creating significant waste and inefficiency in the process. In the United States, by contrast, a market-led approach struggles to support less lucrative areas of strategic importance, such as basic infrastructure, but excels at directing capital toward areas with the highest perceived returns, such as artificial intelligence. In both countries, investment outcomes depend heavily on national conditions, including the strength of capital markets, workforce, infrastructure, and the judiciousness of laws and regulations. When these conditions are strong, countries become magnets for foreign capital and talent. As U.S. policymakers work to scale investments for strategically important technologies and industries, they may improve underlying conditions over time, but they should not bet on overnight transformations. State-owned banks provide most of the financing to companies in China, which is home to the world's four largest banks, all of which are state-owned. The government is also the dominant investor in venture capital and private equity, supplying six times more funding than private investors. Chinese companies can draw from a wide array of state-backed sources, including funds, banks, enterprises, and sovereign wealth vehicles. This broader Chinese ecosystem of beneficiaries allows the state to rationalize its continued support for a national champion. When all else fails, the Chinese government can move capital from profitable state-owned enterprises to keep their struggling counterparts afloat. Displaying a degree of focus that Washington has lacked, Beijing aimed to upgrade not just industry in general but ten specific sectors. China's subsidies, which are far larger than those of other countries, have created overcapacity in automobiles, solar panels, and semiconductors. Correcting this will be difficult as growth slows, the Chinese population ages, and reliance on foreign energy rises. In addition to draining resources from competing sectors, Chinese subsidies have provoked other countries to respond with their own measures, as evidenced by Trump's tariff policy. Foreign capital, especially venture funding, has collapsed amid higher risks and lower returns. Still, when strategic priorities are at stake, Beijing values control over efficiency. Trump's recent deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials may represent a significant escalation of a nearly decadelong shift toward experimenting with industrial policy. In his first term, Trump fired the opening salvo with his “America first” strategy based on a mix of tariffs, import substitution policies, and attempts to improve infrastructure. His administration has also taken dramatic steps to leverage the U.S. government's power as a customer and regulator to strike deals with private companies. In return, Trump committed to speeding up permits for Nvidia's expansion. Then, in July, the Department of Defense launched a partnership with MP Materials, the rare-earth miner, to build a fully domestic rare-earth magnet supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical defense inputs. This combination of incentives has already mobilized $1 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as a pledge from MP Materials to contribute $600 million to the project. The strategic case for more recent deals is less clear. In August, Washington announced that it would allow Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another leading semiconductor company, to export certain AI chips to China in exchange for 15 percent of top-line revenues generated from these sales. By converting a grant to an equity stake, taxpayers may benefit from future returns—but Intel may be at a disadvantage, since its competitors will likely continue receiving grants and other less demanding support. Second, they could signal the start of a more sustained industrial policy focused on supporting strategic sectors, both at home and abroad. But an ad hoc approach risks failing to achieve the scale and consistency necessary for long-term success. An effective industrial policy for strategic competition across multiple technologies and industries—including those that have yet to be discovered—may have to be extended for decades. Moreover, whatever policy takes shape over the coming years, U.S. public resources are limited and risk being spread too thin over too many priorities. It is critical that policymakers continue to identify strategic industries that require targeted state support and ensure that the United States has the capabilities, either domestically or through its network of partners and allies, to defend its vital interests under various scenarios. To that end, policymakers should ask several essential questions before making investments. Does this industry require support that capital markets cannot provide? If so, what form of support should it take? Should the state intervene directly in private capital markets or merely provide incentives? The government has a number of incentives from which to choose—tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees, as well as its own purchasing power—and each comes with tradeoffs. These questions should be standardized and addressed systematically through an investment vehicle, such as a sovereign fund, with rules that insulate decisions from political interference. A related challenge is identifying the critical ancillary requirements that strategic industries need. For example, AI requires massive data centers, which in turn depend on reliable power generation, water resources, and permits at both the local and federal levels. The 2021 infrastructure bill, for example, was almost entirely funded by federal and state governments, with minimal incentives for the private sector. A realistic industrial policy must also consider the supporting investments—in research, infrastructure, and workforce development—that are necessary for strategic industries to succeed. Policymakers should also continue nurturing the United States' underlying advantages. Capital markets could be further strengthened by lowering the tax burden on foreign capital from trusted sources seeking minority stakes in U.S. infrastructure and other priorities. The United States can lead in tomorrow's technologies and industries by leveraging its unparalleled capital markets, fostering public-private collaboration, and aligning policy incentives with long-term strategic goals.

VLADIVOSTOK, September 4. /TASS/. Russia is not going to discuss ideas of foreign military intervention in Ukraine in any format, Official Spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said at the briefing on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, commenting on plans of the European Union to potentially send troops to Ukraine.

"Russia does not intend to discuss the completely unacceptable and undermining any security foreign intervention in Ukraine in any form, in any format whatsoever," the diplomat stressed.

Security guarantees sought by Ukraine are guarantees of threat to the European continent and are absolutely unacceptable, Zakharova noted. "They are aimed at preserving Ukraine as a stronghold for terror, for provocations against our country. They are not security guarantees for Ukraine, they are guarantees of threat to the European continent," she stressed.

The US approval of the possible sale of more than 3,000 ERAM missiles and the equipment required for them contradicts the stated aspiration to settle the conflict diplomatically, Zakharova added.</p>
