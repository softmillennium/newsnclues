                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man killed his sister and wounded seven others in a mass stabbing at an Indigenous community in central Canada, police said Thursday. The man, a 26-year-old from Hollow Water First Nation, an Anishinaabe community on the eastern shores of Lake Winnipeg, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle and died after crashing into a police cruiser that was responding to the attack, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Manitoba said. His sister, 18, died from injuries sustained in the stabbing. The son and daughter of one of the victims said their father was stabbed several times after someone broke into his home. His lung was punctured by a stab wound in his back, but he remains conscious, they said, according to CBC. Meanwhile, a woman police officer who was seriously injured in the car collision is currently recovering in hospital. Most of the injured were taken to Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre by air and land, a spokesperson for the provincial health organization Shared Health said in a statement to CNN. The hospital temporarily declared a Code Orange Alert, which is normally issued during a mass casualty event. Hollow Water First Nation Chief Larry Barker said he's praying for all victims and has asked his community to do the same. RCMP officers along with other authorities have closed off a provincial road to investigate. “At this time, there is no risk to public safety,” the RCMP later said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Mayor Eric Adams met privately with Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this week to discuss potential opportunities to join the Trump administration, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. CNN previously reported that aides to President Donald Trump have floated the idea of offering Adams a job in the administration with the aim of blocking Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani from becoming the city's next mayor. Adams leaving the race could potentially allow former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to consolidate the opposition vote to Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June's Democratic primary but has elicited concerns from some top Democrats about his democratic socialist views. Witkoff is one of Trump's most trusted advisers. The source noted that nothing was offered to Adams, but that privately the president has indicated he would like to offer Adams a role in the administration. The New York Times first reported Witkoff and Adams' meeting. Facing questions about the possibility he might drop out, Adams said Wednesday that he had no plans to exit the race. I am still doing that, and I'm looking forward to getting reelected,” Adams told reporters. Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for the Adams campaign, declined to confirm Adams and Witkoff had met during a trip the mayor took this week to Florida. “He did not carry out any campaigning or governmental related duties.” This story has been updated with additional details. CNN's Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Letitia James seeks to reverse appeals court's decision to wipe away president's penalty in financial fraud case New York's attorney general has requested the state's highest court reinstate Donald Trump's large civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion dollar penalty to nothing. James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal. Trump, the US president, declared “TOTAL VICTORY” after the appellate division wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers. Trump, a Republican, filed his own appeal last week, asking the court of appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, from holding corporate leadership positions in New York. Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the appellate division judges said Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals. James's appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida. After a trial the judge, Arthur Engoron, ruled last year that James had proved Trump engaged in a years-long conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m – payback of what the judge deemed “ill-gotten gains” from his puffed-up financial statements. The five-judge appellate division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo is “Donald Trump's choice” for mayor, Zohran Mamdani said at a press conference. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The Times reports that Trump's advisers have discussed giving Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa positions in the president's administration in order “to give former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in November's general election.” Sliwa said in a statement that he had not been contacted by the Trump administration. Cuomo told reporters, “I don't want him [Trump] involved in anything with my race.” Cuomo has not held elected office since he was forced to step down as New York governor in 2021 after several women accused him of sexual harassment. Last year, Cuomo joined the legal team for accused war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A Truthout investigation  published last month revealed that billionaires and their companies “have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates.” Mamdani is running on a platform that includes raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers, as well as a rent freeze, free city buses, and universal pre-K. “Today, we have learned what New Yorkers have long suspected, that Andrew Cuomo is Donald Trump's choice to be the next mayor of this city,” Mamdani said at a press conference he called in response to the Times story. Last year, Adams was charged with bribery and campaign finance violations. “We are talking about a mayor who was facing an indictment that was then dropped by this administration to ensure greater collaboration with the immigration directives of this administration now being considered for a job offer,” Mamdani said. 62 days until we elect @ZohranKMamdani and put this absurd cabal behind us.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world must mount a campaign to end Israel's apartheid, as countries did for South Africa, he said. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Israel's apartheid across the occupied Palestinian territories is “far worse” than the apartheid perpetrated by white nationalists for decades in South Africa, Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, said in remarks on Wednesday. “Many of us that have visited the occupied territories in Palestine have only come back with one conclusion: that the Palestinians are experiencing a far worse form of apartheid than we ever experienced,” said Mandela. “These last two years, what you have been witnessing, is a testament to that.” Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “They isolated apartheid South Africa and finally collapsed it. From there, the group will set sail to Gaza, a journey expected to take a week or so, in hopes of breaking Israel's near-total blockade on humanitarian aid and other goods. At a rally in support of a part of the flotilla launching from Genoa, Italy, on Sunday, dockworkers said that they would work to block all shipments to Israel if Israel obstructs the flotilla once again. “Around mid-September, these boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe,” a dockworker said at the rally, per footage that circulated online. Dockworker activism also played a role in toppling South Africa's apartheid regime. In 1984, San Francisco dockworkers, many of them Black, launched a 10-day protest in which they refused to unload cargo sent from South Africa, protesting the reelection of pro-apartheid President Ronald Reagan. The dockworkers were members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which had a long history of supporting independence movements and figures like Nelson Mandela.

He was carrying an eight-page A4 printout that turned out to be a classified document on the Zapad 2025 drills. Gavel confessed that he had been instructed to "obtain information on the Zapad 2025 military exercises." A criminal case has been opened. The Pole had dollars, euros, Belarusian rubles, Bulgarian leva, and Polish zlotys with him. He also had a SIM card that someone else bought and gave to him. It was registered to another person. According to the TV channel, there is irrefutable evidence of the Polish citizen's espionage activities. Gavel had established contact with a Belarusian citizen through social networks and offered to cooperate with him in the interests of Polish special services. This cooperation consisted of covertly collecting and providing classified information about the command structure and military counterintelligence officers. Specifically, Gavel collected classified information about Belarusian military facilities for the Polish Internal Security Agency. In exchange for the information he needed, Gavel promised to pay the Belarusian citizen money every month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump had told Mike Johnson that he would not spend $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid The Trump administration must release billions of dollars in foreign aid approved by Congress, including money that Donald Trump said last week he will not be spending, a federal judge has ordered. “To be clear, no one disputes that defendants have significant discretion in how to spend the funds at issue, and the court is not directing defendants to make payments to any particular recipients,” wrote Ali, who was nominated by Joe Biden. Messages to the White House and state department were not immediately returned. The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday. Trump told Mike Johnson, the House speaker, in a letter on 28 August that he would not spend $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in effect cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch. He used what is known as a pocket rescission. The money at issue includes nearly $4bn for the US Agency for International Development to spend on global health programs and more than $6bn for HIV and Aids programs. Trump has portrayed the money as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals, and in January, issued an executive order directing the state department and the USAID to freeze spending on foreign aid. In his ruling, Ali said he understood that his decision would not be the final word in the case, adding that “definitive higher court guidance now will be instructive”. “This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian missile struck a Danish humanitarian demining group in Chernihiv Oblast on Sept. 4, killing two and injuring eight people, the Danish Refugee Council reported. "It is with profound sadness that the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) confirms that one of our humanitarian demining sites in Ukraine was struck by a missile earlier today. "At the time of the incident, DRC teams were conducting purely civilian humanitarian activities—working to clear landmines and explosive remnants of war in order to protect communities and enable safe access to essential infrastructure, farmland, and homes," the organization wrote. Ukraine's northern Chernihiv Oblast borders both Russia and Belarus. "First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. Now, they are killing people, civilians, who are risking their lives to clean up our land from the consequences of the Russian invasion," Chaus wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, condemned the attack, saying that Russia is once again violating fundamental norms of international law. As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spanned an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts. The Danish Refugee Council said it "remains committed to its mission of protecting people affected by conflict and displacement in Ukraine." "Despite the risks and challenges, our demining teams undertake this vital work to prevent further loss of life from landmines and unexploded ordnance," the nonprofit wrote. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs. A Ukrainian citizen was among those killed in a funicular accident in Lisbon, Portugal, on Sept. 3, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to Hromadske. "Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit. "First, Russians mined (Chernihiv) Oblast with explosives and mines. In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times. The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said. The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing. The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal. The FP-9 is claimed to be capable of hitting targets far deeper inside Russian territory and reportedly has a range of 855 kilometers (531 miles).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A total of 26 countries in the so-called Coalition of the Willing have confirmed their readiness to send military contingents to Ukraine once a ceasefire or peace agreement is established, French President Emmanuel Macron said at a press conference following coalition talks in Paris. "Today, 26 countries have officially committed to deploying troops to Ukraine in a support capacity or to ensuring their presence on land, at sea or in the air to provide this support on Ukrainian territory when a ceasefire or peace agreement is reached," Macron said. He added that "several other countries are still considering their position," noting that a total of 35 participants attended the meeting. He nevertheless assured that chiefs of staff already have concrete plans and are discussing them through confidential channels. When asked whether Germany, Italy, and Poland were among the countries that had agreed to send troops, Macron replied only that they had "confirmed their contribution to the training of Ukrainian troops or their participation in operations on land, at sea, or in the air." According to Macron, the formation of a military contingent on Ukrainian territory "is not intended to wage war against Russia;" rather, the forces must "guarantee peace and send a clear strategic message." He stressed that they would not be deployed on the front line, but in designated areas still under consideration. "Following this summit, we have decided to begin political and legal work on providing these security guarantees with the coalition countries and Ukraine," he added. On August 30, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Coalition of the Willing is attempting to undermine progress made in the Ukrainian settlement following Russian-US talks. Earlier, in an interview with NBC News, Lavrov also said that providing security guarantees for Ukraine through "foreign military intervention in some part of Ukrainian territory" would be unacceptable for Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a lawmaker who monitors human rights abuses abroad, said that the off-the-cuff exchange—and the casual way organ transplants came up—was unsettling. “It shows how cruelty knows no bounds,” Smith told The Epoch Times. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, while walking together before a military parade on Sept. 3, discussed becoming younger with continued organ transplants. Xi suggested the possibility of living to 150 years old in this century. The conversation signals a seeming abundance of organs for China's top political echelon, known for extravagant privileges inaccessible to the Chinese public. How and where to source the organs seemed an afterthought. “The modern means of health support, medicine, even some surgeries involving organ transplantation, allow humanity to hope that the active life span will not be like today,” he told reporters, adding that “it differs from country to country.” “My own argument has been that from Xi Jinping on down, anybody in the higher echelon, especially in the Chinese Communist Party, will look to steal somebody else's internal organs, through coercion, through death, to extend their life. I can't think of a more selfish and barbaric act to do that,” Smith said. Hospitals in China have advertised waiting times as short as days, a major draw for tourists from countries such as the United States with developed organ donation systems, where getting an organ could take much longer. “[In China,] they go and they kill somebody who matches up with your antigens and everything else, so that there's no or less likely to be a rejection of the organ,” Smith said. “I've never seen anything like it, except in Nazi Germany, and I think that's what we're talking about here—it's Nazi like.” “There are so many horrible human rights abuses in the world today. In China, doctors could become an “oppressor,” stealing one's organs under state order, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is facing a gas shortage, The Moscow Times reported on Sept. 4. The statement comes after a months-long Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in an attempt to put economic pressure on Russia and undermine its ability to finance its war against Ukraine. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sept. 4, Putin said that signs of gas shortages are already visible in the Russian Far East. He said that supplying new enterprises can be challenging, and demand for gas is expected to rise significantly in the Far Eastern Federal District in the coming years. He didn't mention the reasons behind a potential shortage. Ukraine has targeted dozens of refineries, oil depots, and military-industrial sites with long-range drones since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 to disrupt Moscow's war effort. The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. In light of a potential gas shortage, Putin suggested switching to coal reserves, which "will last for almost a thousand years," Putin said, as quoted by The Moscow Times. The drones left Polish territory without causing damage, Poland's General Staff Chief Wieslaw Kukula said. The comments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Beijing. The Elysee Palace said leaders would assess progress on security guarantees for Ukraine and evaluate Russia's stance, as Moscow continues to reject both a ceasefire and a peace deal. The economy's slowdown follows repeated warnings from high-level Kremlin officials. Skepticism was high among rural residents, people over 50, those without higher education. U.S. President Donald Trump's comments come as his peace efforts enter their eighth month without results. "That is why we are also supporting them with training, funding, and equipment," EU Foreign Affairs Chief Kaja Kallas said. "Russia does not intend to discuss foreign intervention in Ukraine, which is fundamentally unacceptable and undermines all security, in any form or format," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He died at age 73 on Monday, Sept. 1, after a long illness.Mathew Tsang/Getty Images We were working on a short scene where a long estranged Indigenous father is talking with his daughter about how the rules of family can sometimes not have happy endings. “No,” he replies, “Graham Greene isn't here.” Yes, there was a time not that long ago when Graham Greene wasn't as well-known as he is today. These days, in many corners of the world, he's much more familiar than that British guy who wrote Our Man in Havana and The Quiet American. Governor General Mary Simon presents Graham Greene with a Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award in June, 2025.PATRICK DOYLE/The Canadian Press An Oneida of the Six Nations Reserve in Southern Ontario, Greene was an actor who spanned many mediums and genres of the storytelling venues. Before all that, he sampled the world as a welder, draftsman, steelworker and an audio technician before being urged to try acting and finding his true home. My life and his intertwined many times in the previous century. Another time I went out for a beer with him, and we found ourselves at a bar, sitting with the remaining original members of the Byrds, who were performing in a concert hall nearby. Another time, I was the writer-in-residence for a theatre company named Native Earth Performing Arts, I was attending the rehearsal of a little play called Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing written by Tomson Highway. It was there I saw Greene in his full glory, strutting the stage as Pierre St. Pierre, a role that many would argue put Greene on the map. He was also a mainstay on television, in shows such as Reservation Dogs, on which he played Maximus.Shane Brown/The Associated Press The play is seldom produced these days for several reasons, but his portrayal of that lovable drunk and hockey referee told me what a true actor can achieve. He would disappear into the character, creating unique elements that helped construct the persona he morphed into. And if I remember correctly, many of the actors had to take a few hours off rehearsal one afternoon, as there was a major film company in town holding auditions for a movie. With Greene's portrayal of Kicking Bird, and the subsequent Oscar nomination, his life changed. More recently, he strode the stage at Stratford, where he lived for the last few decades of his life. But perhaps it was his work in film that cemented his popularity in the consciousness of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Movies including Clearcut, Twilight, Maverick, The Green Mile, Pow Wow Highway and Thunderheart showed fans the diversity and complexity of Greene's acting, and of Indigenous characters in general. All of this at a time when Indigenous people were not commonly seen on the big screen. Greene played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in Stratford, where he lived for the last decades of his life.Richard Bain/Stratford Festival Many credit Greene with opening doors for other Indigenous actors, writers and directors, showing them how to storm the world of settler cinema. In fact, it could be said a good portion of society would more than likely recognize him from many of his more mainstream appearances, such as Die Hard with a Vengeance and Transamerica. He was also a mainstay on television, playing such a broad spectrum of characters, in shows such as The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon, Northern Exposure, The Red Green Show, Longmire, The Last of Us and Reservation Dogs. In fact, I believe I first met him on the set of a 13-part children's series that was shot three hours north of Thunder Bay, called Spirit Bay. It was 1985, and I was a young production assistant immediately captivated by his amazing and constant sense of humour. An absurd joke of his or a simple wry comment was better than a strong cup of coffee to start the day. Very casually, he reached into his pocket and pulled out three colourful marbles that he rolled around in his hand. Very dryly, he said, “Contrary to popular rumour, I still have them.” It took me a moment for it to sink in, then I laughed. Red Green (left) and actor Graham Greene enjoy a laugh during a taping of the popular The Red Green Show at CHCH channel 11 in Hamilton in 1995.The Canadian Press In 1991, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing was being remounted at the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and I flew out to see it. I turned to see him in full costume, including a furry hat with ear flaps. With that, he produced a look of shock and dismay, at the same time pulling a string in his pocket making the ears of the hat pop up like a curious dog. Whether the joke was cheap or sophisticated, Greene didn't care. Tom King, the renowned author and friend of Greene, perhaps put it best: “We were in Calgary filming Medicine River. There was a guy who had come from Toronto to interview Graham about the movie. He caught Graham after a long hard day of filming and began asking him a bunch of inane questions. Towards the end, he asked Graham what was his most embarrassing moment and Graham smiled and said it was talking to him. I know that's said frequently about a lot of people who have moved on but to us who have circled in his orbit, it's true. The owner (with his partner Hilary) of many cats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Mahon is director of geopolitical and international business advisory at consulting firm StrategyCorp. The reality is Canada had few other options in dealing with a much more powerful country that throws its weight around to get what it wants. Our initial response to Mr. Trump's tariffs followed an outdated playbook. As his resolve hardened and extended beyond Canada, it became clear that his trade attacks on our country were only the beginning of a much larger project. To advance its domestic and international agenda, the U.S. is pursuing a policy that maximizes power by exploiting its centrality in global economic and security affairs. Canada is in an unenviable position where trade dependence makes us susceptible to economic coercion. Removing our countertariffs is only the latest attempt to secure much needed market access through concessions. Carney says he spoke with Trump, expects ‘small agreements' on tariff relief for some sectors However, the extent and limits of this policy alignment have yet to be determined. Canada's de facto sovereignty is at risk – its ability to freely exercise foreign, security and economic policy. The only antidote is to rapidly build Canada's own power through domestic economic development and a network of complementary relations with other countries. To get clarity on the opportunities and constraints, we must recognize that we've entered a new geopolitical era, that of the economic security regime. A new set of principles and norms are quickly superseding the neo-liberal, rules-based international order. These deals also undermine the old rationale where issues of economics, security and foreign policy are self-contained in separate technocratic tracks. Mr. Trump's deals eschew this maxim, as he uses U.S. power to force multidimensional concessions. The new economic security regime is not merely a product of Mr. Trump's rise. Geopolitical orders are essentially constructions shored up by the system's most powerful countries. Throughout history, there has been an interplay between hegemonic powers that employ what are essentially variants of liberal policies, and rivals that seek advantage through mercantilism. At some point, the leading power reckons that a liberal economic policy no longer suits its interests and then reneges. Canada's tariff revenue surges – but nowhere close to Ottawa's projections It is shirking status quo commitments and redefining its terms of international engagement. The world is now in a transitory period with no clear leader. There is a global struggle over the economic vectors of power: productive investment, technological innovation, jobs and market access. Many of Mr. Trump's policy actions, both domestic and international, seek to maximize U.S. power using these elements. This is where the Canadian government's policy priorities should also lie. Some early indications from Prime Minister Mark Carney's government suggests he understands this. Internationally, the government must gear trade policy toward managing market access to maximize investment and jobs. This means shedding the dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism. Such a doctrine could also apply to China, as reconciling that trade dispute will require granting more certainty to Chinese enterprises, regardless of whether it's welcome or under what conditions. This must be based on an honest assessment of where engagement with China either aids or undermines Canadian economic interests. Despite having a network of free-trade agreements spanning the globe, Canada's trade with key markets doesn't live up to its potential because many Canadian companies manufacture products geared toward the North American market. The government could consider a tax rebate for capital expenditures on products that meet EU standards, at once spurring business investment and trade diversification. While the government has come around to the idea of making Canada an energy superpower, we should recognize that we're already an agricultural superpower and integrate this into foreign policy.

The captain of a Japan Airlines flight from Honolulu was removed from the flight's crew in late August a day after he drank a prohibited amount of alcohol, which led him to say he felt unwell, it has been learned. On Wednesday, the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry conducted an emergency inspection of Japan Airlines Co.'s Flight Operations division at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, based on the Civil Aeronautics Law. JAL was given administrative guidance last December to improve its operations, after an incident involving excessive drinking by two pilots in Melbourne. As part of its efforts to prevent further incidents, the airline has implemented a “no alcohol” policy for pilots at their accommodations. However, he said he felt unwell before the flight, prompting JAL to arrange his replacement and causing a delay of about two hours for the flight and delays of up to18 hours for two other flights. An investigation by JAL found that the captain had consumed three tall cans, about half a liter each, of high-alcohol beer — just under 10% alcohol — in his hotel room on the afternoon of Aug. 27. The limit is equivalent to drinking two tall cans of beer that are 5% alcohol. The captain's alcohol intake was more than twice this limit. JAL was also given administrative guidance in May last year, when another captain caused a drunken disturbance at a lodging in Dallas. Spring Japan Co., JAL's group company, also received a stern warning in May this year after the captain of a cargo flight drank during the no-alcohol period before a flight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. KURT M. CAMPBELL is Chairman and Co-Founder of The Asia Group. Washington Should Draw New Delhi Closer, Not Push It Away It is also time to consider how to fortify a relationship that has been one of the brightest spots of bipartisan support in a divided Washington where concerted international purpose has been in short supply. More recently, India's desire to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific has led to a strategic alignment with the United States that has effectively disincentivized reckless Chinese adventurism. This common purpose must not be taken for granted. This is partly because U.S.-Indian ties do not fit neatly into the boxes that the United States has historically used to define its most consequential bilateral relationships. Alliances involved formal treaty commitments built on the foundation of a mutual defense guarantee. Indeed, despite fundamental areas of alignment between the two countries, the U.S.-Indian relationship received relatively little attention, because it was not centered on a security guarantee. As Modi's chummy appearance over the weekend with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear, the United States could end up driving India directly into its adversaries' arms. India, meanwhile, could end up squeezed on all sides with an unaccommodating power in China on its border and strained technology, education, and defense ties with the United States. Given this reality, Washington and New Delhi must strive to do more than simply restore the old, suboptimal status quo. They must create a firmer and more ambitious foundation: a strategic alliance between the United States and India based on a series of mutual commitments regarding technology, defense, supply chains, intelligence, and global problem solving. An alliance, in other words, not based on a traditional mutual defense pact. At this moment of unprecedented discord, it may be hard to imagine reinventing and bolstering the relationship. But the United States and India can move forward by using the scaffolding already in place to build a stronger structure. A new strategic alliance between the United States and India would be established by a treaty subject to advice and consent by the U.S. Senate. It would be built on five core pillars, with the aim of enhancing the mutual security, prosperity, and values of both countries. This would mean working together on both the “promote” agenda of bold public investments, common R & D, and shared talent—as well as the “protect” agenda of aligning export controls and cybersecurity measures. The Trump administration's U.S.-India TRUST initiative, built on top of the Biden administration's U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, should be at the core of this effort, but it could and should evolve from primarily a convening forum to a more formal architecture. Such an agreement could anchor R & D partnerships and encourage private-sector investment. The United States and India should also establish a strategic talent partnership that removes obstacles for their scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and technical experts to work together on priority areas. This would include streamlining visa processes on both sides, creating common pots of funding, and removing outdated export controls that stymie collaboration. The natural first step would be a supply chain and investment agreement that would reduce mutual vulnerabilities to coercion and enhance the two countries' respective techno-industrial bases. India and the United States have each acknowledged dependencies on China for vital supply chains, and in some instances, those dependencies are interconnected. For example, China supplies India with 70 to 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients. Since 40 percent of generic drugs in the United States are manufactured in India, the United States is indirectly exposed to India's reliance on Chinese APIs. Similarly, both countries rely heavily on China for critical minerals. This would involve both early warning of impending disruptions and longer-term strategies to make investments that build resilience. And both countries should pursue an investment pact that would reduce obstacles to foreign direct investment, especially in strategic sectors, by addressing nontariff barriers, removing outdated regulatory restrictions in areas like clean energy, and strengthening intellectual property protections. This need not require a traditional Article 5–like guarantee to trigger mutual defense. Among other things, this would mean further institutionalizing and capitalizing the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which was launched in 2023 as an innovation bridge that directly connects the full spectrum of the two countries' defense ecosystems, including government agencies, prime contractors, startups, investors, and research institutions. The agreement that GE Aerospace would manufacture F-414 jet engines in India—an unprecedented technology transfer to a nontreaty partner—showed the promise of a more robust defense partnership. But the goal here cannot and should not be simply to facilitate the transfer of American defense capabilities and technologies to India. The scope of cooperation should grow to include joint naval and air activities in the Indian Ocean involving more submarine cooperation, airborne reconnaissance operations, and joint contingency planning. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, for example, has allowed Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad—to address illegal fishing, trafficking, and unauthorized maritime activities. The next major step would be to build a common maritime intelligence picture for the Indian Ocean, as well as a formalized structure of intelligence sharing and joint analysis that can continually update that picture. The United States can mobilize public- and private-sector resources and development know-how; India can leverage deep experience with this set of challenges as well as its trusted relationships across East Africa and in the Pacific. This could start with joint scalable pilot projects in third countries—such as in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, where the Indian government has demonstrated a new commitment to ambitious infrastructure and health and technology initiatives that align with long-standing U.S. approaches in the Pacific—and grow from there. On this point, those invested in the relationship on Capitol Hill and in the business and strategic community need to impress on their Indian interlocutors that U.S. President Donald Trump's theatrics are often the prelude to dealmaking. This is a deeply unpleasant reality to many, but to paraphrase the late U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, you must do diplomacy with the United States you have, not the one you might prefer. Some will also credibly ask whether India's democratic backsliding would make such an alliance untenable. There are real challenges in India on pluralism, civil rights, and the rule of law, but the relationship should be mature enough to sustain an honest conversation with the government of India and Indian civil society about these trends. The United States should also be humble enough to acknowledge its own significant challenges when it comes to democracy and the rule of law. This is a choice that New Delhi can and should make for its own reasons, not out of deference to Washington. And there have been subtle signs in recent years that India has gradually repositioned itself more toward the United States and Europe. Washington must also refrain from hyphenating its relations with India and Pakistan: there should be no “India-Pakistan” policy. U.S. diplomacy in recent years has been heavily weighted toward New Delhi for a reason. As always, there is the practical question of bureaucracy and capacity on both sides. Can they move the machinery of government to build an alliance? Doing so would require leadership from the top of both governments. And it would require a vision that inspires not only their governments but also their private sectors, technology communities, universities, and publics. It is also worth remembering that many of Washington's most important alliances have seen setbacks and led to domestic discord. The NATO alliance has had to contend with persistent questions about burden sharing. The United States and South Korea previously butted heads over how to handle the threat from North Korea, and there have been periodic public upheavals in Korean public opinion over tragic incidents involving American troops stationed on the peninsula. And India has emerged as one of the United States' most consequential partners. The only thing harder than building and formalizing a deeply significant relationship with India is not having one. So, with no illusions, the United States and India should get to work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Years from now, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as a turning point in U.S. industrial policy, with President Donald Trump's deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials marking the beginning of a new era of direct state investment in key industries. As the United States competes over the technologies and industries of tomorrow, Washington is now experimenting with state-centric investment strategies that resemble those of Beijing. But because the U.S. federal government is constrained by a debt-to-GDP ratio above 120 percent and a budget deficit exceeding seven percent, U.S. policymakers will have to channel more private capital toward strategically important sectors. To ensure a successful industrial strategy, the Trump administration must set clear criteria for what qualifies as a strategic industry, marshal the necessary public resources, and incentivize private investment in those industries. In China, the government plays a central role as a source, allocator, and user of capital, directly resourcing strategic priorities but creating significant waste and inefficiency in the process. In the United States, by contrast, a market-led approach struggles to support less lucrative areas of strategic importance, such as basic infrastructure, but excels at directing capital toward areas with the highest perceived returns, such as artificial intelligence. In both countries, investment outcomes depend heavily on national conditions, including the strength of capital markets, workforce, infrastructure, and the judiciousness of laws and regulations. When these conditions are strong, countries become magnets for foreign capital and talent. As U.S. policymakers work to scale investments for strategically important technologies and industries, they may improve underlying conditions over time, but they should not bet on overnight transformations. State-owned banks provide most of the financing to companies in China, which is home to the world's four largest banks, all of which are state-owned. The government is also the dominant investor in venture capital and private equity, supplying six times more funding than private investors. Chinese companies can draw from a wide array of state-backed sources, including funds, banks, enterprises, and sovereign wealth vehicles. This broader Chinese ecosystem of beneficiaries allows the state to rationalize its continued support for a national champion. When all else fails, the Chinese government can move capital from profitable state-owned enterprises to keep their struggling counterparts afloat. Displaying a degree of focus that Washington has lacked, Beijing aimed to upgrade not just industry in general but ten specific sectors. China's subsidies, which are far larger than those of other countries, have created overcapacity in automobiles, solar panels, and semiconductors. Correcting this will be difficult as growth slows, the Chinese population ages, and reliance on foreign energy rises. In addition to draining resources from competing sectors, Chinese subsidies have provoked other countries to respond with their own measures, as evidenced by Trump's tariff policy. Foreign capital, especially venture funding, has collapsed amid higher risks and lower returns. Still, when strategic priorities are at stake, Beijing values control over efficiency. Trump's recent deals with Intel, Nvidia, and MP Materials may represent a significant escalation of a nearly decadelong shift toward experimenting with industrial policy. In his first term, Trump fired the opening salvo with his “America first” strategy based on a mix of tariffs, import substitution policies, and attempts to improve infrastructure. His administration has also taken dramatic steps to leverage the U.S. government's power as a customer and regulator to strike deals with private companies. In return, Trump committed to speeding up permits for Nvidia's expansion. Then, in July, the Department of Defense launched a partnership with MP Materials, the rare-earth miner, to build a fully domestic rare-earth magnet supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical defense inputs. This combination of incentives has already mobilized $1 billion in financing from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as a pledge from MP Materials to contribute $600 million to the project. The strategic case for more recent deals is less clear. In August, Washington announced that it would allow Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), another leading semiconductor company, to export certain AI chips to China in exchange for 15 percent of top-line revenues generated from these sales. By converting a grant to an equity stake, taxpayers may benefit from future returns—but Intel may be at a disadvantage, since its competitors will likely continue receiving grants and other less demanding support. Second, they could signal the start of a more sustained industrial policy focused on supporting strategic sectors, both at home and abroad. But an ad hoc approach risks failing to achieve the scale and consistency necessary for long-term success. An effective industrial policy for strategic competition across multiple technologies and industries—including those that have yet to be discovered—may have to be extended for decades. Moreover, whatever policy takes shape over the coming years, U.S. public resources are limited and risk being spread too thin over too many priorities. It is critical that policymakers continue to identify strategic industries that require targeted state support and ensure that the United States has the capabilities, either domestically or through its network of partners and allies, to defend its vital interests under various scenarios. To that end, policymakers should ask several essential questions before making investments. Does this industry require support that capital markets cannot provide? If so, what form of support should it take? Should the state intervene directly in private capital markets or merely provide incentives? The government has a number of incentives from which to choose—tax benefits, grants, loans, and guarantees, as well as its own purchasing power—and each comes with tradeoffs. These questions should be standardized and addressed systematically through an investment vehicle, such as a sovereign fund, with rules that insulate decisions from political interference. A related challenge is identifying the critical ancillary requirements that strategic industries need. For example, AI requires massive data centers, which in turn depend on reliable power generation, water resources, and permits at both the local and federal levels. The 2021 infrastructure bill, for example, was almost entirely funded by federal and state governments, with minimal incentives for the private sector. A realistic industrial policy must also consider the supporting investments—in research, infrastructure, and workforce development—that are necessary for strategic industries to succeed. Policymakers should also continue nurturing the United States' underlying advantages. Capital markets could be further strengthened by lowering the tax burden on foreign capital from trusted sources seeking minority stakes in U.S. infrastructure and other priorities. The United States can lead in tomorrow's technologies and industries by leveraging its unparalleled capital markets, fostering public-private collaboration, and aligning policy incentives with long-term strategic goals.
