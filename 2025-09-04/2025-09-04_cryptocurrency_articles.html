                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising demand for government bonds and gold underscores recession fears, limiting Bitcoin's ability to sustain bullish momentum. Correlation with equities remains high, but structural catalysts like Strategy's S&P 500 inclusion could shift sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold onto its bullish momentum on Thursday as traders fled toward the safety of government bonds after weaker-than-expected United States labor market data. This move drove gold to an all-time high and raised doubts over Bitcoin's $108,000 level, with recession fears increasingly dominating investor sentiment. Market participants grew more confident that the US Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. In contrast, cryptocurrencies faced renewed pressure as BTC briefly traded under $110,000. Unlike digital assets, stocks benefit more directly from lower financing costs and reduced household debt burdens, both of which can stimulate consumption. Yields on the 2-year US Treasury dropped to 3.60%, their lowest level in four months, signaling investors' willingness to accept lower returns in exchange for safety. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also reported that overall employment contracted. Still, investors remain skeptical that the Federal Reserve can sustain such easing for long. The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders expecting January 2026 rates at 3.75% or lower declined to 65% from 72% a month ago. Friday's US Bureau of Labor Statistics report will be crucial in guiding positioning across risk assets. So, while lower interest rates may offer short-term relief, strong demand for gold and short-term bonds highlights persistent risk aversion, which could weigh heavily on cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq's 60-day correlation with Bitcoin sits at 72%, showing the two assets have largely moved together. According to Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer at Bitpace, the inclusion “cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class.” Such a move would force index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the S&P 500 to purchase MSTR shares.

Even with elevated demand for US government bonds, fiscal imbalances could erode confidence in the domestic currency, a scenario historically favorable for Bitcoin. Bank of America analysts reportedly project the euro will strengthen against the US dollar by 2026, citing trade frictions and weakening institutional credibility. However, the growing demand for short-term Treasurys alone should not be viewed as a long-term bearish signal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart argues the current market represents an altcoin season through digital asset treasury companies rather than traditional token price rallies, with upcoming ETF approvals unlikely to replicate Bitcoin's institutional success. During a Sept. 4 interview with Milk Road, Seyffart said digital asset treasury companies (DATCO) have generated massive returns while individual altcoins remain relatively subdued compared to previous cycles. These DATCOs, I mean, they've been on absolute fire.” Further, the SEC's new framework for cryptocurrency ETFs positions approximately ten assets for immediate approval, including Dogecoin, Chainlink, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, Polkadot, Solana, and Hedera. Additional tokens, like Cardano and XRP, could qualify within months once futures contracts reach the six-month requirement on CFTC-regulated exchanges. However, Seyffart tempers expectations for altcoin ETF demand compared to Bitcoin products. Seyffart expects basket products containing multiple cryptocurrencies to attract significantly more institutional capital than individual altcoin ETFs. Seyffart noted that investment advisors prefer diversification over concentrated positions in individual altcoins. Bitwise's product holds ten assets while Grayscale's contains five cryptocurrencies in market cap-weighted allocations. The framework requires futures contracts to be traded for six months on CFTC-regulated exchanges, with Coinbase Derivatives serving as the primary qualifying platform. This outsources asset selection criteria to CFTC oversight while potentially allowing questionable projects into ETF wrappers. Seyffart questioned whether traditional altcoin seasons will materialize as institutional money drives cryptocurrency performance. “I just don't see a ton of institutional money coming into the 31st ranked crypto.” Digital asset treasury companies have absorbed capital that historically flowed into altcoins during bull markets. Strategy's financial engineering allows investors to gain leveraged cryptocurrency exposure through traditional equity markets rather than direct token purchases. Seyffart views current market conditions as increasingly institutionalized, with sophisticated players entering crypto markets. This structural shift may permanently alter altcoin rally patterns as traditional finance channels provide easier access to crypto exposure through regulated products rather than direct token ownership. Ethereum ETFs demonstrate this dynamic, generating substantial inflows after an initial sluggish performance, but failing to drive widespread momentum in altcoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Ethereum wallet linked to Tron founder Justin Sun has been blacklisted after moving more than $9 million worth of World Liberty Financial tokens, or WLFI, according to blockchain data. The token only just started trading on exchanges earlier this week. Exchange volumes indicate the token has been especially popular with traders in South Korea, on exchanges Upbit and Bybit. It's unclear why World Liberty Financial would have blacklisted the wallet, identified as belonging to Sun by blockchain analytics platforms Arkham and Nansen, for transferring tokens. But it is possible that early investors, like Sun or the Tron DAO, would have received token warrants that prohibit them from selling for a set amount of time. Neither World Liberty nor Justin Sun immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt. “His latest statement saying he has nothing to do with the dump looks legitimate.” Some analysts have been incredibly skeptical about the World Liberty project. Last week, analysts at Compass Point flagged WLFI as “another catalyst that could potentially decimate retail traders.” Trump-Backed World Liberty Token Could Decimate Retail Investors, Compass Point Warns And users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have overwhelmingly agreed with them. Before the market closed yesterday afternoon, odds had tipped entirely in favor of WLFI seeing a red candle within its first 69 hours of trading. Early investors of the WLFI token, including Sun, managed to buy in at just $0.015 per token, or a $1.5 billion valuation, and are still very much in the green by more than 10X.</p>

The Trump family has a bitcoin mining company that started trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday.

Why it matters: Running mining rigs is one of the most policy-sensitive corners of the crypto industry, with its number one cost input being the price of power.

Catch up quick: American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began publicly trading on Wednesday following a merger with a small-cap bitcoin miner, which allowed it to skip a traditional IPO process.

How it works: According to an investor presentation, American Bitcoin has a three-pronged strategy to provide leadership in the U.S. bitcoin industry:

Zoom in: Later in the presentation the company talks about building platforms and monetizing its surface area in the industry.

The big picture: The Trumps are entering the industry as competition has gotten fierce.

Between the lines: The cost of energy is crucial to a mining operation.

What we're watching: Nukes. We'll be curious to see if American Bitcoin comes out ahead of other miners in cutting deals with new nuclear plants, if they start getting permits.

💭 Our thought bubble: This could be yet another play to profit off of the presidency, but bitcoin mining takes a lot more elbow grease than running a meme coin or a second-tier stablecoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Established protocols like Aave, Curve, and MakerDAO are seeing renewed user activity, and many on-chain high-frequency traders have started positioning themselves for the next phase of high returns. However, for many ordinary users, these complex protocols are difficult to navigate, and the volatile price swings often result in unexpected losses. Therefore, more and more investors are turning to contract-based platforms like ProfitableMining that offer stable output and transparent returns to achieve truly “passive crypto earnings.” Rather than “chasing hype,” it's better to “lock in certainty.” This is exactly why an increasing number of people are choosing ProfitableMining. You simply choose a suitable mining contract, invest, and receive stable returns over the contract period — mining coins daily, unaffected by market volatility. Why are more ordinary users choosing ProfitableMining instead of diving into high-risk crypto trading? It allows users to truly “earn coins through technology, not luck.” Official Certification & Compliance: ProfitableMining is licensed by the UK financial regulatory authority, operating transparently and legally, eliminating risks of scams or fraud; Robust Asset Protection: Utilizes military-grade security architecture, multi-signature cold wallets, and encrypted data storage to keep every penny safe; Clear and Timely Earnings: Mining profits are credited daily, with real-time tracking, so users can watch their holdings grow every day; In this rapidly evolving era of cryptocurrency, profit matters, but security and sustainability are equally crucial.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Move will boost transparency as film investors who are not familiar with the industry often incur big losses, says lawmaker Hong Kong's legal sector is taking an unprecedented leap into the world of Web3 and digital assets to revolutionise the city's film and television industry in a bid to better track investments, with some massive losses incurred as a result of a lack of transparency. “This legal technology is actually helping the industry upgrade,” Ng said. Thomas So Shiu-tsung, chairman of eBRAM, said that “another critical step” had been taken. “This partnership not only consolidates Hong Kong's position as a film and television deal-making centre, but also encourages the industry to choose Hong Kong's dispute resolution services,” So said. By submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. Hong Kong-produced dramas could also be broadcast during prime time on mainland stations, among other things, he added. Alan Chiu, founder and managing partner of law firm ELLALAN, noted that many players in the film industry might not have good templates for contracts. He said it would provide convenience to the film industry if certain essential and simple templates for movie-related contracts could be provided through eBram, accessed easily and signed electronically over mobile phones through its platform. Such templates would not affect the business of lawyers as A-list artists always required tailor-made advice and contracts with specific clauses from lawyers, Chiu added. Ma expressed concern that creative people were not using contracts to protect their post-production work or individual intellectual property rights, leading to a lack of evidence that could prove the work was theirs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A virtualized Bitcoin advocate generated by AI, carrying forward early blockchain ideas and making technical concepts accessible. - Telegram's 2025 TON blockchain integration revolutionized NFT accessibility via 800M+ users, enabling in-app trading without external wallets. - Collectible Gifts generated $36M in sales with 184K+ wallets, transforming NFTs into engagement tools like usernames and phone numbers. - Regulatory risks and platform dependency challenges remain as TON's user-centric model reshapes decentralized marketplace dynamics. In 2025, the decentralized NFT marketplace landscape has undergone a seismic shift, driven by Telegram's integration of NFT trading via the Telegram Open Network (TON). Telegram's 2025 NFT integration marks a pivotal moment in blockchain history. This seamless experience is underpinned by TON's high throughput and low transaction fees, which make it a compelling alternative to Ethereum and Solana [3]. For instance, Telegram's Collectible Gifts feature—allowing users to trade animated stickers and profile decorations as NFTs—generated $36 million in sales, with over 184,000 wallets created in 2025 alone [4]. This demonstrates how Telegram is transforming NFTs from speculative assets into tools for real-world engagement, such as NFT-based usernames and anonymous phone numbers [3]. High-profile collaborations, like Snoop Dogg's Telegram Gifts collection, highlight the platform's mainstream potential. The Mini Apps ecosystem allows developers to deploy NFTs and decentralized applications (dApps) directly within the platform, reducing technical barriers for creators [2]. The TON Foundation has emphasized equitable access to this ecosystem, advocating for fair exposure for all projects to foster innovation [6]. This approach aligns with broader goals of global adoption, as Telegram's user base spans regions with limited access to traditional Web3 infrastructure. DeFi activity on TON nearly doubled in July 2025, while NFT trading volumes peaked at $3.5 million [4]. These figures suggest a maturing market, supported by TON's technical advantages and Telegram's user-centric design. For investors, the platform's focus on utility and accessibility positions it as a long-term contender in the NFT space, particularly as it competes with Ethereum and Solana for market share. Regulatory scrutiny looms, particularly as governments grapple with the implications of decentralized finance and digital asset trading. Investors must weigh these factors against the platform's growth potential. Telegram's integration of NFT trading via TON represents a paradigm shift in digital asset accessibility. By combining a user-friendly interface, gamified economics, and a focus on utility, the platform is democratizing NFT participation on an unprecedented scale. While challenges remain, the trajectory of TON's growth and the success of high-profile projects like Snoop Dogg's NFTs suggest that Telegram is not just a passing trend but a foundational force in the evolution of decentralized marketplaces.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's (BTC) feeble bounce this week ran out of gas on Thursday, with prices slipping back below $110,000 and some market watchers warning of a deeper pullback. The largest corporate BTC owner Strategy (MSTR) dropped 3.2% and is 30% down since July. Worries about further downside are growing louder, with some observers pointing to September historically being one of bitcoin's and and the broader crypto market's weakest months. At the same time, gold, the old-school safe haven and inflation hedge, broke out to fresh records above $3,500 following a multimonth consolidation, seemingly sucking capital from riskier plays. A new report from Bitfinex noted that BTC has entered its third straight week of retracement from the August all-time high of $123,640. The short-term holder realized price, a gauge of newer investors' cost basis of buying BTC, currently sits near $108,900, less than 1% below BTC's current price. Joel Kruger, market strategist of LMAX Group, remains more optimistic. September has usually been a month of consolidation ahead of stronger fourth-quarter performance, he said, adding that this year's correction might be shallower if ETF inflows, corporate treasury allocations and regulatory tailwinds materialize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. Two of Silicon Valley's top tech firms are teaming up to change the payments landscape. Tempo is among a new crop of layer-1 projects dedicated to stablecoins, along with Circle's Arc and Tether's Plasma and Stable. The Trump administration's embrace of the sector and Congress's passage of a stablecoin-focused bill in July have spurred many larger companies previously skeptical of blockchain technology, from banks to Big Tech companies, to begin exploring the space. But Stripe has been a pioneer, especially in Silicon Valley, including making landmark acquisitions of two stablecoin and crypto wallet companies. By helping build a blockchain alongside Paradigm—whose managing partner and Stripe board member Matt Huang will lead the project—Stripe is doubling down on its crypto bet as the future of global payments. Blockchains, or distributed ledgers that record transactions, have served as the foundation for crypto technology since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. The list of available options has proliferated, from mainstay layer-1 offerings like Ethereum and Solana to new generations built on top of old ones. While some like Ethereum are focused on building decentralized financial applications, a new slate of payment-focused blockchains has emerged over the past year in conjunction with the rise of stablecoins. These promise to process lightning-fast transactions with minimal fees, often built around native tokens, such as Circle's stablecoin USDC or the market leader Tether, which are often traded on Ethereum but deployed on many other blockchains as well. Stripe and Paradigm will launch their own blockchain amid this heightened competition. While other blockchains typically gain value through their native cryptocurrencies, Tempo will not launch with its own token, according to a source familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business information. Instead, it will accept different forms of stablecoins as “gas” fees, which are small payments made to a distributed network of entities that run a blockchain. The source said that there isn't a timeline yet for Tempo's launch, though the project already has around 15 employees, including Huang, who will continue to serve as managing partner at Paradigm alongside Alana Palmedo. In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Paradigm wrote that Tempo will be focused on global payments, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments, or payments conducted by AI agents—an area that crypto advocates argue that blockchain technology will be essential. Paradigm said that different partners will be involved in the development of Tempo, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Deutsche Bank, and Shopify.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The total amount of bitcoin held by public companies surpassed 1 million BTC on Thursday, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Over the past year, the number of companies seeking to capitalize on bitcoin's steady price growth has been increasing rapidly. Michael Saylor's Strategy is considered the pioneer of the trend, with many other companies also deciding to hold the cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin miners like Mara Holdings and firms such as Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and GameStop all holding BTC on their balance sheets. "Despite today's milestone, a number of indicators suggest institutional Bitcoin adoption remains in its infancy," said BitcoinTreasuries President Pete Rizzo. "For context, most major Bitcoin treasury firms have only started to deploy strategies aimed at long-term accumulation, meaning a large portion of raised capital remains yet to be deployed." Strategy's success, both in terms of its share price growth and the accrued value of the bitcoin it holds, has inspired several other firms to pursue similar strategies. This chart excludes Tesla, Coinbase, and Block to focus on companies running the Bitcoin treasury play. "That's about $111 billion locked up by institutions," he said. According to BitcoinTreasuries, more than 100 public companies currently hold bitcoin. And the number of companies adopting Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies or simply deciding to hold the cryptocurrency doesn't appear to be slowing down. In one of the more recent examples, on Tuesday, Nasdaq-listed sales development firm CIMG said it had completed a $55 million raise for purchasing bitcoin. "As Bitcoin continues to outperform fiat currencies globally, we expect the number of public firms buying and holding Bitcoin to rise, with the asset becoming a larger percentage of the balance sheets of the over 50,000 publicly traded companies globally," Rizzo said. ET on Thursday, according to The Block's price page. Bitcoin is up over 90% in the past year. Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years ago, Finance & Development devoted a full issue to anticipating “The Money Revolution,” driven by innovations in finance, such as crypto assets. Stablecoin companies have racked up millions of users globally, transacting across borders 24/7 at very low cost. New legislation in the US and other countries may further boost their growth. Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become a financial lifeline for people in some economies with high inflation. On the positive side: faster and cheaper cross-border payments. While it's hard to forecast how the use of this technology will play out, it's “likely to create major financial stability risks,” she writes. For example, lightly regulated nonbanks are providing more liquidity. “Stablecoins may function well in good times, but they can falter under stress.” Stablecoins are only one facet of the revolution. Some governments and central banks have responded to private payment initiatives by sponsoring systems that respond to consumer demand for fast, efficient payments. IMF researchers examine the case of India's Unified Payments Interface, which interconnects hundreds of banks, platforms, and apps and carries out more than 19 billion transactions a month. At the same time, central banks and supervisors must contend with disruptive innovation. Iñaki Aldasoro, Jon Frost, and Vatsala Shreeti, from the Bank for International Settlements, explore how competition among the new entrants and incumbents might unfold. They conclude that forward-looking public policies must accompany radical innovation to achieve the most impactful breakthroughs. Preventing crime is another area in which public authorities need to stay alert. Criminals, unfortunately, were among the earliest adopters of crypto, and all payment systems need to balance privacy and speed with the need to stop tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Stanford's Darrell Duffie and coauthors lay out a practical approach to getting ahead of the curve. We must keep an open mind about stablecoins and financial innovation. Who knows what new possibilities such innovations will unlock along the way? There are other thought-provoking pieces in our pages. Oxford's Carl Benedikt Frey discusses how a shift toward more centralization and less competition could snuff out AI's productivity-raising potential. Princeton's Swati Bhatt discusses the shifting geography of US start-ups, showing how entrepreneurial activity is migrating from California to southern states. Economic historian Marc-William Palen looks back to the 19th century, when free trade first faltered, in search of lessons for policymakers today. We also profile Nobel laureate Guido Imbens, whose work is reshaping how researchers establish cause and effect in the real world. And Harvard's Stefanie Stantcheva explains in our Café Economics interview series how policymakers can raise taxes without scaring off innovators. Thank you, as ever, for reading and engaging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. gave crypto one of its biggest regulatory jolts in years. With the signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins ("GENIUS") Act stablecoins now have a legal framework. That same push is showing up in the patent world, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") and Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB") are beginning to clarify how blockchain-related inventions can clear long-standing Section 101 hurdles. Just as the GENIUS Act provides clarity for stablecoins, a recent PTAB decision is beginning to provide clarity for blockchain patents. The claims at issue relate to "securely storing data across a network in a multi-dimensional distributed database" in order to "process[] license contracts, including computing proportional payments related thereto, using blockchains comprising supplemental fork blocks that comprise custodian addresses." In the Examiner's view, the invention simply used "a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea." The PTAB agreed in part – acknowledging that the claims involved an abstract idea because "[i]t is well settled that commercial interactions involving payment transactions or contractual agreements, are the type of judicially excepted abstract ideas categorized as methods of organizing human activity." In other words, the invention did more than implement a business method on a generic computer—it changed how the blockchain itself operates. As the Board explained, the claims "recite[] steps that transform the blockchain itself so as to allow for improved processing, i.e., simultaneous processing of supplemental fork blocks along the slidechain... [and] uses the recited abstract idea in a meaningful way beyond generally linking its use to a particular technological environment." Section 101 of the Patent Act has historically been a major hurdle for patent applicants attempting to claim improvements in blockchain technology. But as we discussed in relation to a recent PTAB decision related to quantum computing, patent applicants in blockchain-related industries can now find guidance in decisions like Ex Parte David L. Newman to overcome rejections based on 35 U.S.C. The Proskauer Intellectual Property Team is continuing to monitor the evolving guidance on patent eligibility of emerging technologies. With Congress providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and the PTAB recognizing technical improvements in blockchain, these parallel developments signal a more supportive environment for innovators. We welcome questions about how these shifts may affect your patent strategy in the crypto and broader emerging technology space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A central bank digital currency can take many forms, but most involve the issuance by a country's central bank of currency tokens on a blockchain or other type of distributed ledger. Retail-facing CBDCs aim to gradually replace cash, retaining the same central bank guarantee as bills and coins, while offering the convenience of digital money. In Europe, which will decide in October whether to launch development of a retail-facing CBDC, there is notable opposition, including among some legislators. The fear overlooks an entire segment of the economy in which the central bank already controls movements of funds, and in which privacy is not an expected feature: interbank transfers, known as "wholesale" payments. And yet they still encounter significant frictions when they involve correspondent banking networks, currency exchange and different operating hours. In this light, a wholesale CBDC makes sense. Unlike a retail CBDC, it would only be made available to commercial banks and other institutions with central bank accounts. One of the key advantages is more streamlined settlement, as wCBDCs could, in theory, move directly between banks via a shared ledger — no correspondent accounts necessary. Today, clearing and settlement involve reconciling various layers of information across different data systems. In an on-chain network, everything moves on the same layer, and while systems may differ, connectivity generally involves tweaking formats or adding a bridge rather than reengineering structures. The opportunity is compelling, especially given the emergence of new trade barriers and geopolitical fragmentation — smoother cross-border payments could lead to smoother and more flexible supply chains. The department is aiming to boost transparency and win Trump's trust after poor economic numbers last month led to a bureaucrat's firing. Yet here, too, there are deep misunderstandings about blockchain potential. Frictionless transfers between global banks can only happen on a shared ledger. Arriving at that happy state would require consensus among nations as to the ideal technology (there are many different types of distributed systems) as well as the platform's design, smart contract parameters, compliance requirements, legal status and governance. Getting nations to agree on anything so systemically significant would be a tall order, especially as it would mean giving up some sovereignty over how national currencies move. Of course, each country could have its own blockchain system on which to issue a wCBDC, and they could connect with each other via a neutral shared platform. But this not only introduces some friction, it also raises a similar set of questions. In recent months, the BIS, IMF and some private entities have published proposals for a "unified ledger" on which all on-chain currencies can move. The BIS, as the "central bank's central bank," could perhaps be a contender — but it recently withdrew from the multi-CBDC pilot mBridge after contemplating shutting it down to prevent Russia using a similar system to avoid sanctions. In this increasingly fractious world, "neutral" quickly becomes elusive. For instance, a distributed ledger platform shared between China and Saudi Arabia for oil trade settlement, or one to boost financial flows among Latin American countries. There is a reason most global trade uses the dollar for at least one leg: It removes liquidity risk. Perhaps smart contracts could ensure a measured currency conversion or lockup? There's also the potential for national CBDCs to have embedded functionality, such as an "off switch" — trust, even among trading partners, is a scarce commodity. This happens in traditional systems today — but with greater connectivity, the disruption could spread. In sum, public rejection of CBDCs due to fear of privacy erosion and greater government control overlooks the potential for a significant efficiency boost in a key economic segment that does not expect privacy or freedom from oversight — the technology is not necessarily the problem, it's the way it's applied. Zooming out, new technologies always run up against exaggerated expectations of both benefit and harm — in that regard, blockchains and distributed ledgers are no different.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world of blockchain is not just about cryptocurrency anymore. One of its most exciting innovations—NFT smart contracts—has changed how we see ownership, trust, and digital assets. Business leaders and creators alike are asking one big question: how can these digital agreements redefine ownership in both digital and physical worlds? The answer lies in blockchain-powered smart contract development, where trust is automated, and transactions are transparent. NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, were first designed to represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one-of-a-kind. Early on, NFTs gained attention in the crypto community as collectibles. Developers built these tokens using Ethereum's ERC-721 standard, making way for the first generation of NFT smart contract development. These early models may seem basic now, but they laid the groundwork for how industries use NFTs today. By minting their art as NFTs, they could sell directly to collectors without intermediaries. This is where NFT smart contract development went mainstream and caught global attention. While art and gaming were the launchpads, NFT smart contract development has now expanded far beyond. Real Estate: Tokenized properties allow fractional ownership and easier transfer of deeds. Music & Entertainment: Artists sell rights, royalties, and even backstage passes as NFTs. Supply Chain: Companies use NFT smart contracts to track authenticity and product journey. Healthcare: Medical records and patient data are securely tokenized for safer access. This shift is possible because smart contract developers are building custom solutions that adapt blockchain logic into real-world needs. The latest era of NFT smart contract development is no longer limited to basic transactions. Developers now create dynamic, interactive smart contracts that evolve with conditions. Programmable Royalties: Artists receive earnings each time their NFT resells. Interoperability: NFTs can move across multiple blockchains, thanks to smart contract development. Security Upgrades: Smart contract developers focus on preventing exploits and hacks with advanced auditing tools. This evolution is powered by expert smart contract development services, where developers integrate security, scalability, and user-friendly functions. The role of every smart contract developer will be to bridge imagination with execution. Behind every successful NFT project is a Smart contract development company that ensures reliability and innovation. For businesses looking to step into NFTs, working with the right smart contract development services is critical. A web3 smart contract developer can build marketplaces tailored for art, gaming, real estate, or finance. In fact, the success of NFT adoption relies heavily on how these marketplace builders and blockchain experts guide creators, startups, and enterprises through the complexities of NFT smart contract development. NFT smart contracts have traveled an inspiring journey—from enabling artists to empowering global industries. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that helps businesses navigate this revolution. The evolution of NFT smart contracts shows us one thing: innovation thrives when technology meets trust. At their simplest, smart contracts are digital agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute once certain conditions are fulfilled, ensuring transparency and trust. Cryptocurrencies have evolved into more than just digital assets; they now represent innovation, decentralization, and global financial inclusion. Behind every thriving crypto business lies a structured lifecycle that transforms abstract ideas into functional, secure, and widely adopted platforms. From initial concepts to live market deployment, this lifecycle determines the credibility and success of a project. In the realm of cryptocurrency fundraising, successful projects require clear, transparent communication and a professional presentation of the project's goals, technical architecture, and value proposition. A white paper serves as the cornerstone for establishing credibility, building investor trust, and guiding decision-making. As crypto markets grow increasingly competitive, investors seek projects that showcase innovation while demonstrating meticulous planning and market understanding. White Paper Development services play a crucial role in crafting documents with precision, clarity, and persuasive impact, positioning projects for successful fundraising campaigns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Company says it's already in discussions to commercialize the licensed tech TNF Pharmaceuticals has entered into a licensing agreement with laser-based computing startup LightSolver for exclusive use of the latter's laser-based processing units (LPUs) for cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. The system is around the same size as a traditional desktop computer; it looks similar to a standard server and operates with low power requirements and at room temperature. “We believe LightSolver has created a disruptive computing paradigm that opens a new world of light-speed computation,” said Joshua Silverman, TNF's executive chairman. “Our new partnership with LightSolver gives us exclusive access to quantum-inspired LPU-based systems capable of unlocking unprecedented performance and sustainability for the cryptocurrency industry.” He added that in addition to the new partnership with LightSolver, TNF is also in late-stage discussions with a tech infrastructure and crypto mining expert to lead the development and commercialization strategy for the licensed technology. “With LightSolver, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the strong momentum behind both photonic computing and the future of cryptocurrency infrastructure,” Silverman said. LightSolver CEO, Dr. Ruti Ben-Shlomi, said: “With LightSolver's LPUs, we believe compute-intensive combinatorial and physical problems can be solved at the speed of light—orders of magnitude faster than other methods. In addition to the partnership announcement, TNF said that it has also entered into a securities purchase agreement for a $7 million private placement financing, including the sale of 7,000 shares of newly created Series H convertible preferred stock. TNF said the securities purchase agreement is expected to close on or about September 4, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many of the world's largest banks have increased their crypto custody strategies recently. Earlier this year, both State Street and JPMorgan Chase announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency custody service line in 2026, and US Bancorp has refocused on this service line. Now, we hear that Citi is looking to follow suit, with the global head of partnerships and innovation for the bank's services division stating that it is prioritising custody for high-quality assets backing stablecoins. JUST IN: Jim Cramer says JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon will "go all in on crypto" after calling it a fraud and a ponzi scheme last year. These moves are also partly a response to increased regulatory requirements – last month, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission updated its controls for licensed custodians of virtual assets. Financial institutions under the supervision of the OCC have been able to conduct cryptocurrency custody activities as long as they implement appropriate third-party risk management practices. However, this trend is also evident in Europe, where Deutsche Bank reportedly intends to launch cryptocurrency custody services next year. Commerzbank launched a crypto custody offering for corporate clients in 2024, BBVA has partnered with Binance to provide off-exchange custody for its customers' digital assets, and it has also been suggested that Sberbank is preparing to offer custody services for cryptocurrency assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency is gradually making inroads into residential real estate transactions, but few Americans realize that virtual money can be used to buy or sell a home—and even fewer trust it. Participants included a mix of first-time homebuyers, repeat buyers, sellers, and renters. According to the results of the research, most participants were at least somewhat familiar with crypto, and some of them had owned or invested in blockchain-based assets. However, most were unaware of digital currencies' use in homebuying or selling. "While participants are not highly familiar with crypto being used in real estate transactions, many were able to intuitively identify how it could be used for the homebuying or selling process: direct peer-to-peer transfers, using digital assets as collateral for a loan, or converting crypto to cash for a traditional purchase, said Daniela Valdivieso Eguiguren, senior market researcher at Research & Insights at Realtor.com. I would not personally trust it," a Gen X participant named Robert said. Meanwhile, Nick, a first-time homebuyer, cited crypto's "variable value and less than solid backing" as some of the reasons why he would not rely on it "for a big purchase." Other participants argued that blockchain-based currency had a potential for user error, with one fretting about having a typo in the digital wallet address, and another worrying about losing access to the assets by misplacing the account information. Perceived benefits of cryptocurrency uses included greater transaction security, increased speed, and a potential to maximize earnings. Only a few participants had used crypto for real estate deals, citing limited investments and distrust. "It came as no surprise to participants that crypto can be used for real estate transactions," said Valdivieso Eguiguren. "However, many still think it is a new technology that needs time and reliability before it can be trusted for mainstream use in such a significant financial process." "I don't want to invest my hard-earned money into uncertain places," concluded a millennial repeat buyer named Madan, while a Gen Xer named Robert dismissed crypto as an "unreliable fad that should fail in the future." Those still on the fence about virtual currency said they needed more information or time to see where it goes from here before they decide to get involved. "I would need to learn a lot more about how that process works before I'd be willing to make that kind of decision," a participant named Sunnie said. These comments come as no surprise to housing market experts. "In the short term, consumer distrust will keep crypto a novelty or marketing tool in real estate rather than a mainstream payment option," says Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. "Uncertain regulations, unclear tax treatment, and limited institutional adoption make buyers wary, while the currency's volatility reinforces its reputation as speculative and risky." In some good news for real estate professionals specializing in crypto transactions, a few of the participants praised the use of virtual money to buy or sell properties as forward-thinking and a smart investment. Aaron Kirman, CEO of Christie's International Real Estate Southern California, who heads the new crypto-only unit, told Realtor.com that there is "a real market" for tokenized property deals. Tokenized payments are growing increasingly popular especially among high-net-worth individuals and celebrities looking to protect their privacy and keep their property acquisitions under wraps. Christie's Real Estate SoCal has already closed multiple deals totalling over $200 million paid entirely in cryptocurrency—and Kirman said his portfolio of for-sale homes whose sellers are seeking crypto offers boasts a combined worth of more than $1 billion. The convergence of virtual currency and housing has not gone unnoticed by policymakers in Washington, DC. In June, President Donald Trump's administration ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals for considering crypto holdings as assets when weighing the creditworthiness of a homebuyer applying for a mortgage. The rule change would make it easier for homebuyers who own cryptocurrency to qualify for a mortgage, and potentially up their loan amount limits, without requiring them to convert their tokens into cash. Since taking office eight months ago, Trump has appointed David Sacks as "crypto czar" and hosted the first White House Crypto Summit in March. In July, Trump signed into law the landmark GENIUS Act, introducing federal rules for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoin. Jones says that could change going forward, but only if certain conditions are met. "Long-term adoption will hinge on currency stability, regulatory clarity, ease of use, and greater normalization through precedent," says the analyst. "For crypto to become commonplace in real estate, it must first earn broader credibility and trust among buyers."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April 2023, a woman requested personal information about her father from Bridlington Lodge Care Home. Jason Blake, 56, was found to have blocked, erased, or concealed records held by Bridlington Lodge Care Home between 12 April and 12 May 2023 to prevent this information being disclosed. Under data protection law, people have the legal right to ask an organisation if it is using or storing their personal information and receive a copy of any personal information held. The personal information requested included incident reports, copies of CCTV footage and notes relating to her father's care. Mr Blake appeared at Beverley Magistrates Court on Wednesday 3 September 2025 where he was ordered to pay a fine of £1,100 and additional costs of £5,440 after being found guilty. This is because it helps people understand how and why organisations are using their information. This family put their trust in Bridlington Lodge Care Home to look after their father, and they had a right to receive information about his care. “By ignoring this request for personal information and refusing to provide any explanation, Mr Blake believed he was above the law. It is a criminal offence for organisations to alter, deface, block, erase, destroy or conceal information with the intention of preventing disclosure under Section 173 of the Data Protection Act.
