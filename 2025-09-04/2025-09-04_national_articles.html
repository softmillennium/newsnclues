Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the military is going back to basics on 'The Will Cain Show.' FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Friday to alter the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, reverting to the agency's former namesake, Fox News Digital has learned. Both Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have recently indicated they want to change the name of the agency. It is one of several initiatives the Trump administration has spearheaded as part of its "warrior ethos" campaign within the Pentagon. A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday that Trump would roll out the name change Friday. The executive order calls for using the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense, along with phrases like "secretary of war" for Hegseth, according to a White House fact sheet. The order also instructs Hegseth to propose both legislative and executive actions to make the name permanently U.S. Department of War. The Sept. 5, 2025, order will also instruct Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to propose both legislative and executive actions to make the name change permanent. Trump signaled in recent days the change was imminent. "Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "Then we changed it to Department of Defense." Hegseth, who Trump already has referred to on occasion as the "secretary of war," also expressed similar sentiments and said the change would reflect a broader, cultural shift within the Pentagon. President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, right, speaks during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington Aug. 26, 2025. We want warriors, folks that understand how to exact lethality on the enemy," he said. "We don't want endless contingencies and just playing defense. The U.S. employed the Department of War title for its military agency until 1949, when it was renamed the Department of Defense in accordance with a series of massive reforms included in the National Security Act of 1947. It's unclear if Congress, which has the authority to establish federal executive departments, will need to step in to issue final approval on the move. However, Trump previously has voiced confidence that he doesn't need approval from lawmakers and that they will get on board if necessary. "We're just going to do it," Trump told reporters Aug. 25. "I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that." Fox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.

A brand-new $1 million Turkish yacht tips over and begins to sink just minutes after it's launched as terrified passengers jump overboard. Dramatic video shows a brand-new luxury yacht sinking just minutes after it was launched off the coast of Turkey, forcing its crew to leap overboard. According to reports, the new $1 million vessel, an 85-foot cruiser named Dolce Vento, was launched Tuesday in the Ereğli district of Zonguldak, a port city on Turkey's Black Sea. As bystanders watched, the luxury yacht lurched to one side, tilting dangerously before taking on water. A $1 million luxury yacht sinks off Turkey's Black Sea coast after launch. Chaos erupted as people on board had to scramble onto the sloping deck. One clip shows a man in a dark suit standing on the vessel's side before springing into the water. The Turkish Coast Guard and port teams reportedly rushed to the scene, setting up a security perimeter around the capsized craft as it slipped further into the water, per TMZ. A man is seen standing on the side of the doomed luxury vessel. Technical inspections will be carried out to determine whether a construction flaw, balance issue or human error doomed the luxury vessel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Capital Planning Commission Chairman Will Scharf presides over a National Capital Planning Commission meeting, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in Washington. Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary, said during a public meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission that the board does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property. “What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,” Scharf said. But Scharf made a distinction between demolition work and rebuilding, saying the commission was only required to vet the latter. “I think any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been, or it will be, is simply false,” he said. Asked after the meeting if the eventual approval process might delay work on the ballroom, Scharf said, “Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you're talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process.” “Given the president's history as a builder, and given the plans that we've seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” Scharf said. L. Preston Bryant Jr., who was appointed to chair the National Capital Planning Commission in 2009 by President Barack Obama and served in that role for nine years, said proposed projects typically worked in four major stages of commission approval that began “with an early consultation, where a project is very much conceptual.” That hasn't been the case with Trump's promised ballroom. “The White House and its design team would be very, very wise to involve NCPC and its staff very much on the front end of the project – in the early design stages – as it'll make for a better project and help ensure it meets all regulatory and legal compliances,” Bryant said. Trump has been anxious to hustle toward work beginning on the ballroom, with an eye toward completing it prior to his leaving office in January 2029. A building mogul before he was a reality TV star and politician, has relished personally overseeing improvement projects at the White House and walked last month on the building's roof with construction officials. The lawn in the Rose Garden was paved over with stone and patio tables reminiscent of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, complete with exterior speakers. Scharf also used the meeting to argue that the Federal Reserve had flouted planning board jurisdiction while undertaking major renovations to its building. Trump has for months called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to resign, and has specifically decried the long-planned building project for going well over budget. They could build an amusement park on their property and no one would have any qualms.” A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday. Scharf said after the meeting of Fed officials, “I'm hopeful that they'll see the light of day and come back in and re-present their construction project as they should have up front.”</p>

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., cursed at pro-Israel politicians in a fiery speech at the "People's Conference for Palestine" in Detroit. After "Squad" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., blasted America as a country founded on racism at a pro-Palestinian conference on Sunday, an expert is warning that the country's lax immigration policies have resulted in the importation of anti-American ideals and a rise in "ethno-politics" in the U.S. Simon Hankinson, an author and senior research fellow on the border and immigration at the Heritage Foundation, is urging the U.S. to adopt stricter immigration standards to crack down on foreign loyalties, especially among American leaders. And I think that is a good idea, because I don't think you can serve two masters," he explained. Following Rep. Rashida Tlaib bashing the U.S. as founded in racism and oppression, an immigration policy expert is calling for lawmakers to have sole loyalty to the U.S. (Gary Hershorn/Getty Images; Jose Luis Magana/AP) "We used to have that as a very strict principle here. But over the past few decades, the government has been much more lenient about allowing people to retain dual nationality and there's only very limited circumstances where we require someone to give it up, like, for example, if they become a minister in a foreign government or president or prime minister in the foreign government or senior official. But for the most part, we've let it go." "The biggest change was in 1965, when we essentially opened up immigration to the entire world, and we saw a dramatic change in where people came from," he said. And if they have beefs that they brought with them from the old country, then those can take a generation or two to die out. And sometimes with encouragement, they can last a lot longer." One example of this is the anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric in a speech by Tlaib, who is a second-generation Palestinian American. Speaking at the "People's Conference for Palestine" in Detroit, Tlaib railed against Israeli leaders and supporters of Israel, shouting, "I want to say to all of them, every genocide enabler, look at this room motherf---ers, we ain't going anywhere." Rep. Rashida Tlaib protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress in 2024. Tlaib also drilled into the United States as an "empire in Washington, D.C.," saying, "the political structures that I have to work in, that we all are surrounded by, was built on slavery and genocide and rape and oppression." "It is no surprise to me, as the daughter of Detroit, that I see our government, that has supplied the bombs and excuses Israel from destroying literally every single day hospitals, communities in Gaza, and manufacturing mass starvation, is also the same government that's defunding healthcare and food assistance programs here in our country." Commenting on her remarks, Hanksinson said that "for someone, particularly an elected representative, to not just criticize policies that are enacted by politicians that they're opposed to, but to criticize the country and its very foundations to challenge the history and the framework of the United States, I think it's a very dangerous thing to do." "We can look to examples like Lebanon, like India or Pakistan or countries in Africa where tribal and ethnic disputes have really gotten in the way of economic and political and social progress. We have managed to avoid that mostly in the United States, and I would hate to see us usher in a new era of that kind of ethno-politics into our country." He pointed to another recent speech by Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who, while speaking at a pan-American conference in Mexico City, said in Spanish, "I'm a proud Guatemalan before I'm an American." "I grew up in a dictatorship, and I don't even remember ever witnessing anything like that, to have a democracy, a beacon of hope for the world, to now be turned into one of the worst countries, where the military are in our streets, without any regard for people's constitutional rights, while our president is spending millions of dollars propping himself up like a failed dictator with a military parade." In response, Hankinson explained that for many on the left, assimilation has become a "dirty word." "Assimilation is the process by which people from different cultures, languages, religions, while they can retain those roots, share a common understanding of what the United States is and what it means to the world and what it can mean for centuries to come," he said. "I don't think you can be considered assimilated if you come here and manage to become a permanent resident and then a citizen without ever loving this country, understanding and knowing its history, speaking its language, and, for all its flaws, understanding that this is fundamentally a great country." Demonstrators holding signs and flags face California National Guard members as they protest in response to federal immigration operations in Los Angeles, on June 9, 2025. "We're seeing that in some parts of the United States where there are enclaves that are ethnically very concentrated. And so, for example, Rep. Tlaib or Ilhan Omar, they're very identified still with the cultures that they or their families left recently in a way that makes it seem as if they're putting the priorities of those peoples ahead of their own constituents." "If you were to go to a progressive, ultra-liberal friend and ask them, are there any rights that an American citizen should have that an illegal immigrant should not, You'll have to wait for the answer, because they're going to have a hard time coming up with anything," he said. The White House declined Fox News Digital's request for comment on whether it would support a policy more strictly mandating American citizens and lawmakers have sole loyalty to the U.S. Fox News Digital also reached out to the offices of Tlaib, Omar and Ramirez for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.” On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. The makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure. Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!” The majority noted Florida could eventually seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but until such funding is formally approved, the project does not qualify as a “major federal action” that would trigger NEPA's environmental review requirements. A single judge on the Atlanta-based panel dissented saying he would have let William's shutdown order stay in place in what should have been a “relatively simple denial” of the state's motion. Ron DeSantis publicly said the federal government would fund it. That, the judge argued, makes it a “major federal action” subject to environmental review. “In fact, it's just starting, and we're committed to fighting on,” she said. Top Florida official says ‘Alligator Alcatraz' will likely be empty within days, email shows “I know many are questioning why the Trump and DeSantis administrations are insisting on pouring millions of taxpayer dollars into this dirty, destructive detention facility in the heart of the Everglades,” she told CNN. “Our legal system can and should stop this incredibly harmful boondoggle.” The next step, according to Bennett, is that a freshly-selected panel of appellate judges will now decide whether to reinstate the injunction to shut down the Everglades facility or strike it down altogether. “Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we've always said, open for business.” It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July. Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening to decide whether President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff policy is lawful. But that would assume the Republican-controlled Supreme Court applies the same limits on executive power to Trump that it imposed on Democratic President Joe Biden — a highly uncertain proposition. The Court's Republicans only recently invented this doctrine. It has no basis in law, and it has only ever been used against one president in history: Joe Biden. That said, the Court did preview the doctrine in an Obama-era decision that applied it to a hypothetical regulation. In that case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014), the Republican justices announced that “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance. '” The idea was that, even if a federal law can be read to permit the executive to enact a particular policy, courts should read those laws narrowly if the policy is too ambitious. Indeed, under Biden, the Court even used this recently made-up doctrine to strike down policies that are unambiguously authorized by federal law. But federal law could not possibly have been clearer that the executive is permitted to cancel these loans. The secretary could use this power, moreover, “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans. That petition describes the tariffs as Trump's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative.” It claims that the tariff is necessary to close US trade deficits of “$1.2 trillion per year.” It alleges that the tariffs have given Trump leverage to extract multi-trillion-dollar concessions from foreign nations. And it also claims that the increased taxes Trump has unilaterally imposed on imports — taxes that will largely be paid by the American consumer — “will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.” To be sure, it's never a good idea for a court to base its decisions on factual claims made by this particular administration. An August analysis of the tariffs by Yale's Budget Lab, for example, concluded that Trump's tariffs will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025, and that the tariffs will raise $2.7 trillion in taxes over a 10-year window. It would seem, then, that a straightforward application of the major questions doctrine compels this Court to invalidate Trump's tariffs. Concurring in FCC v. Consumers' Research (2025), Kavanaugh suggested that this newly invented doctrine does not apply to “foreign policy contexts.” The Court has never published a majority opinion claiming that this doctrine can be found in any provision of the Constitution, or in any federal statute. And while some individual justices have offered their own explanations of where this recently invented doctrine comes from, those explanations range from silly to ridiculous. Concurring in Nebraska, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett claimed that the doctrine is implicit in a parable about a babysitter. Asking whether the doctrine applies to foreign policy decisions, in other words, is a bit like asking your daughter whether her imaginary friend likes fried chicken. The answer is whatever your daughter wants it to be. As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this year, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.” If the major questions doctrine derived from a constitutional provision, then the justices could read that provision to determine if it contains a foreign policy exception. But, because the major questions doctrine is simply something that the Republican justices made up, there is no principled way to determine if it conveniently contains an exception that just happens to rescue a Republican president's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative” from invalidation. If the Republican justices actually buy Trump's claim that he is exempt, that will leave little doubt that these justices are simply playing Calvinball — creating one set of rules to spite Democrats, and a different, far more favorable set of rules for Republicans. Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. The Court has a special set of rules for Trump. A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire and onetime top White House advisor Elon Musk said he was invited to a tech leader summit at the White House's newly renovated Rose Garden on Thursday, but will not be attending. “I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there,” Musk said on Thursday, replying to an X user who asked why the xAI, SpaceX and Tesla leader was not invited. Once referred to as “the first buddy,” and near constant presence at President Donald Trump's side, Musk had a messy blowup with the president this summer after leaving his position at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk even vowed to support primary challengers of Republicans who voted for Trump's signature funding bill, and he claimed he would be starting a new political party, although there does not seem to have been any movement on that front. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In recent days, public comments from Trump and Vice President JD Vance seem to suggest Musk would be welcomed back into the fold. Speaking to CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his podcast this week, Trump said Musk is “a man of common sense,” a “good man,” even though he “got off the reservation incorrectly.” In an interview last month with far-right outlet Gateway Pundit, Vance called Musk's relationship with the Trump White House “complicated.” But he said he expects and hopes Musk will support the Republican Party by next November's midterm elections. So I really think it's a mistake for him to try to break from the president,” Vance said. Musk has backed off attacking the administration on X and, in some cases, appears to be fully supporting the White House. Last month, he replied with a fire emoji and a laughing emoji to a post from White House communications adviser Margo Martin, who captioned a photo: “President @realDonaldTrump showing President Zelenskyy and President Macron his 4 More Years hat.” The White House invitation could also be a lesson in history: Musk was famously not invited to a White House summit on electric vehicles in 2021 during President Joe Biden's administration. (Part of the reason appeared to be because Tesla is a nonunion automaker.) Musk has been vocal about how much he continues to be upset over the snub. On Thursday, he reposted a 2023 interview where he said Biden “added insult to injury” and hurt the company by claiming at the event that General Motors was “leading the electric car revolution” while Tesla made far more EV cars. Musk reposted the 2023 video with the comment: “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman discusses President Donald Trump speaking with Volodomyr Zelenskyy after Vladimir Putin met Xi Jingping and Kim Jong Un in China. President Donald Trump called on European leaders to stop "funding" Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine and accused them of failing to pressure China. In a statement to Fox News Digital following a call between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who met in Paris for a Coalition of the Willing summit, a White House official said, "President Trump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war – as Russia received €1.1 billion [nearly $1.3 billion] in fuel sales from the EU in one year. "The President also emphasized that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia's war efforts," the official added. France's President Emmanuel Macron, right, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrive to chair the Coalition of the Willing Summit, at The Elysee presidential Palace in Paris, on Sept. 4, 2025. The EU has drastically cut its imports of Russian oil following the invasion of Ukraine, though the president's comments point out that it has not completely cut off its energy imports from Moscow. The White House did not confirm where it pulled its figures from or the period of time it referenced. White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff also attended the meeting in Paris and was seen giving Zelenskyy a handshake and a hug at the beginning of the meeting on Thursday, according to a video posted by Macron's office. It remains unclear what specifically was ironed out during the summit, though Macron said following the meeting that some 26 nations had agreed to deploy troops "by land, sea or air" to Ukraine the day after a ceasefire deal is secured, reported the BBC – a move that Putin has repeatedly condemned. White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, left, shakes hands with France's President Emmanuel Macron upon their arrival at the Coalition of the Willing Summit in Paris, on Sept. 4, 2025. "We talked about how to push the situation toward real peace," Zelenskyy said. "We discussed different options, and the most important is pressure, using strong measures, particularly economic ones, to force an end to the war. "The key to peace is depriving Russia's war machine of money, depriving it of resources," he added. Zelenskyy also said the leaders discussed how to better defend Ukraine's skies from the constant barrage of missile and drone attacks by Russia, though the White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions on whether the U.S. has pledged further support. "I thank President Trump for supporting our people. The meeting came just one day after Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Bejing for a military parade commemorating the cessation of World War II hostilities 80 years ago. Both China and North Korea have remained steadfast supporters of Putin during his war in Ukraine and amid rebuke from the West. White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, center, speaks with France's President Emmanuel Macron during the Coalition of the Willing Summit in Paris, on Sept. 4, 2025. Putin on Wednesday also invited Zelenskyy to meet with him in Moscow, which Ukrainian and Western security officials have flagged as disingenuous amid pressure from Trump for the pair to meet. Trump said he will speak with Putin in the coming days. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's currently drifting between the southern tips of Africa and South America An iceberg, known as A23a, top, seen on a NASA satellite, is visible near South Georgia Island, bottom, on Sept. 1, 2025, off the coast of Antarctica. The shrinking megaberg, known as A23A, is unlikely to survive through the end of November and may face a sudden and spectacular collapse like an avalanche of ice at sea, said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos. “It's an interesting thing to watch, certainly not unprecedented,” Scambos said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press. “But every time these happen, it's sort of a big spectacular event.” But the reduction in ice shelves will cause melting land glaciers to flow into the oceans, and that causes sea levels to rise a few feet (meters). A23A first broke away from Antarctica's Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986 along a massive crack that scientist first noticed in the 1950s and called “the Grand Chasm.” It hovered close to the southern continent for about three-and-a-half decades uneventfully until the last couple years when it drifted north to the place where massive icebergs go to die, around South Georgia Island, Scambos said. Earlier this year the iceberg was the size of Rhode Island and weighed in at a trillion tons, now it's down to the size of Houston and shrinking fast. It's nearly twice as big as the shrunken A23A, according to Andrew Meijers of the British Antarctic Survey. A23A has already spawned smaller chunks named A23D, A23E and A23F. NASA satellite images Thursday show the smaller bergs that weren't detached on Saturday, just a few days before. It's finding weak spots in the iceberg, and those are breaking off. “I expect its fracturing will accelerate,” Meijers said via email. That's when it can collapse with warm water even at the top and it will then look “sort of like an avalanche that's floating” and even fall apart in a single day, he said. Back in January, Meijers, who visited the iceberg at the end of 2023, painted a different picture of A23A: “The iceberg itself is colossal and it stretches from horizon to horizon ... It's a huge wall, a Game of Thrones style wall of ice that towers above the ship.” Megabergs spawning is a natural process that has happened for centuries, Meijers said, and so is their breaking apart around South Georgia Island when the current and warmer waters get hold of them, Scambos said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans and Democrats scrutinized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for more than three hours Thursday morning on Capitol Hill. The hearing was scheduled as a review of President Donald Trump's healthcare agenda, but it quickly became a referendum on Kennedy's leadership of the sprawling department, with the heated conversation ranging from abortion to COVID-19 policy, to the recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez. Here are some of the highlights from the more than three hours of Kennedy's testimony, which at times veered into confrontation and personal accusations. Kennedy lambasted Monarez's credibility when asked repeatedly by Democrats and Republicans about the cause for her termination last week. He flatly said that Monarez lied when she wrote in her Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that Kennedy told her to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel,” whose members were handpicked by the secretary. “No, I did not say that to her, and I never had a private meeting with her other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say I never said that,” Kennedy said. Monarez's lawyers told the Washington Examiner that they dismiss Kennedy's claims “as false and, at times, patently ridiculous” and that she stands by what she wrote in her op-ed. A handful of Republicans criticized Kennedy's move to restrict approvals for COVID-19 vaccines to only those with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease, including seniors over age 65. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and John Barrasso (R-WY), both physicians, said their professional colleagues have expressed concern that Kennedy's administration is limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines, because HHS approval is essential for insurance coverage of the shots. Cassidy tripped up Kennedy about whether to praise Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that fast-tracked mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during the first Trump administration. Kennedy referenced a study published by the anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center this summer using insurance data that concluded that the complication rate of mifepristone is roughly 11%. This includes hemorrhaging and severe infections due to incomplete abortions. The tax credits, which Democrats passed as part of COVID-19 relief efforts in 2021 and 2022, are likely to be a main focus of both chambers of Congress before the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown. Instead, he said Democrats “had two chances to make them permanent, and they didn't.” Kennedy clashed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Warren argued that Kennedy curbed access to the vaccines by limiting the recommendation for shots only to people with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease. Because the shots are not recommended, she said, they are not available at many pharmacies or covered by insurance. Kennedy said the vaccines were not intended for healthy people. “I know you've taken $855,000 from pharmaceutical companies,” he said. “I'm not taking them away,” he later said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century. The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards. “I see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,” said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University's psychedelic center and was not involved in the research. The FDA has designated psilocybin, MDMA and now LSD as potential “breakthrough” therapies based on early results. Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA — also known as ecstasy — as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues. MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy. The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD — under professional supervision, but without therapy — and then were followed for about three months. At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose — 100 micrograms — continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches. Patients who got dummy pills also improved — a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies — but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug. The research was not immune to problems seen in similar studies. Most patients were able to correctly guess whether they'd received LSD or a dummy pill, undercutting the “blinded” approach that's considered critical to objectively establishing the benefits of a new medicine. In addition, a significant portion of patients in both the placebo and treatment groups dropped out early, narrowing the final data set. It also wasn't clear how long patients might continue to benefit. Mindmed is conducting two large, late-stage trials that will track patients over a longer period of time and, if successful, be submitted for FDA approval. “It's possible that some people may need retreatment,” said Dr. Maurizio Fava of Mass General Brigham Hospital, the study's lead author and an adviser to Mindmed. “How many retreatments, we don't know yet, but the long-lasting effect is quite significant.” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials have expressed interest in psychedelic therapy, suggesting it could receive fast-track review for veterans and others suffering psychological wounds. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines. The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn't new. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to “turn on, tune in and dropout.” A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs — without any medical use and high potential for abuse — essentially halted U.S. research. “LSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,” Fava said. This story has been corrected to show that the reported effective dose of LSD is 100 micrograms, not 100 milligrams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner about how many Americans have died from COVID-19, RFK Jr. claimed that nobody knows because of a lack of government data. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., facing pointed bipartisan questioning at a rancorous three-hour Senate committee hearing on Thursday, tried to defend his efforts to pull back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and explain the turmoil he has created at federal health agencies. Kennedy said the fired CDC director was untrustworthy, stood by his past anti-vaccine rhetoric, and disputed reports of people saying they have had difficulty getting COVID-19 shots. Medical groups and several Democrats in Congress have called for Kennedy to be fired, and his exchanges with Democratic senators on the panel repeatedly devolved into shouting, from both sides. But some Republican senators also expressed unease with his changes to COVID-19 policies. The GOP senators noted that Kennedy said President Donald Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for the 2020 Operation Warp Speed initiative to quickly develop mRNA COVID-19 vaccines — and that he also had attacked the safety and continued use of those very shots. “I can't tell where you are on Operation Warp Speed,” said Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Tillis and others asked him why the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was fired last week, less than a month into her tenure. Kennedy said she was dishonest, and that CDC leaders who left the agency last week in support of her deserved to be fired. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arrives to appear before the Senate Finance Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025. He also criticized CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic tied to lockdowns and masking policies, and claimed — wrongly — that they “failed to do anything about the disease itself.” The Senate Finance Committee had called Kennedy to a hearing about his plans to “Make America Healthy Again,” but Democratic senators pressed Kennedy on his actions around vaccines. Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, arrives and is seated before Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arrives to appear before the Senate Finance Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025. Wyden went on to attack Kennedy, saying he had “stacked the deck” of a vaccines advisory committee by replacing scientists with “skeptics and conspiracy theorists.” “I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote. Kennedy pushed back on concerns raised by multiple Republican senators, including Tillis and Sens. When Sen. Raphael Warnock, of Georgia, questioned Kennedy about his disparaging rhetoric about CDC employees before a deadly shooting at the agency this summer, Kennedy shot back: “Are you complicit in the assassination attempts on President Trump?” Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears before the Senate Finance Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025. Kennedy called Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico “ridiculous,” said he was “talking gibberish” and accused him of “not understanding how the world works” when Lujan asked Kennedy to pledge to share protocols of any research Kennedy was commissioning into autism and vaccines. “I didn't even hear your question,” Kennedy replied to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto as the Nevada Democrat repeatedly asked what the agency was doing to lower drug costs for seniors. He also told Sen. Bernie Sanders that the Vermont independent was not “making any sense.” That's what you are, ” said Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat. As the hearing neared its end, Kennedy pulled his cellphone from his pocket and then tapped and scrolled as Wyden asked about mifepristone, a drug used for medication abortion. In May, Kennedy — a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement — announced COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a move opposed by medical and public health groups. In June, he abruptly fired a panel of experts that had been advising the government on vaccine policy. He replaced them with a handpicked group that included several vaccine skeptics, and then shut the door to several doctors groups that had long helped form the committee's recommendations. Kennedy has voiced distrust of research that showed the COVID-19 vaccines saved lives, and at Thursday's hearing even cast doubt on statistics about how people died during the pandemic and on estimates about how many deaths were averted — statistics produced by the agencies he oversees. He said federal health policy would be based on gold standard science, but confessed that he wouldn't necessarily wait for studies to be completed before taking action against, for example, potential causes of chronic illness. In a statement Wednesday, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and 20 other medical and public health organizations issued a joint statement calling on him to resign. “Our country needs leadership that will promote open, honest dialogue, not disregard decades of lifesaving science, spread misinformation, reverse medical progress and decimate programs that keep us safe,” the statement said. Many of the nation's leading public health and medical societies, including the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have decried Kennedy's policies and warn they will drive up rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Shroud of Turin — a 14-foot-long linen cloth bearing an image of a crucified man — has captivated people for centuries, stirring debate over whether the relic once wrapped the body of Jesus Christ. For some, the cloth serves as visual proof of Jesus' resurrection; for others, it is merely a medieval relic made by an artist in the 14th century. These claims appeared in Oresme's collection of writings known as his “Problemata,” which are dated between 1355 and 1382, according to the new study published on August 28 in the Journal of Medieval History. It wasn't until lead study author Nicolas Sarzeaud, a researcher in history at the Catholic University Louvain, in Belgium, received the text from a colleague editing an unpublished treatise that he realized the significance of the writing. “The fact that we have this new testimony on this object is very, very valuable,” said Sarzeaud, who is also a fellow of the Villa Medici, a French Academy in Rome. Oresme was an interesting figure, not only for his merit as a scholar and philosopher, but because of his unbiased approach to topics, particularly those involving the church. “In his debates, he tried to be sure that a phenomenon was real before he (discussed it). And why do we believe in something? While researchers like Sarzeaud claim Oresme's text adds to the already plentiful scientific and historical evidence that the Shroud is fake, some remain unconvinced. The cloth, bearing an image of a naked man with long hair and a beard, as well as reddish-brown stains resembling wounds from crucifixion, quickly became popular. About 30 years later, when the cloth began to attract popular attention once more, the following bishop, Pierre d'Arcis, also stated in his letter that the cloth was artwork, and the pope decided soon after that it could continue being on display only as a representation of the true Shroud of Christ. The cloth moved around several times after that, until it was relocated to Turin, Italy, in 1578. Radiocarbon dating, conducted in 1988 by three separate laboratories, dated the fabric between 1260 and 1390, said Andrea Nicolotti, a professor of the history of Christianity and churches at the University of Turin who was not involved with the study but had worked with Sarzeaud previously. “In my opinion, we already have enough information to have settled the debate a long time ago,” he said. “Since no human body can leave that kind of image on the cloth, only two possibilities seem to remain: either it was artificially created by an artist, or it is a miracle,” Nicolotti said in an email. “Being able to say that the shroud is the result of a miracle, and that it is proof of the resurrection, is very tempting for some Christians: they think this way they can demonstrate Christ's divinity to the world.” In his Problemata, Oresme recommended caution when assessing alleged miracles, “because many clergy men thus deceive others, in order to elicit offerings for their churches.” He cited the Shroud as an example: “There is manifest experience of that in a church in Champagne, where it was said that there was the shroud of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Oresme died in 1382, seven years prior to the claims from the bishop of Troyes in the 1389 letter. More than 600 years after its documented discovery, the Shroud of Turin is still being researched and debated. Cheryl White, the Hubert Humphreys Endowed Professor of History at Louisiana State University at Shreveport, said that the newly examined texts from Oresme do not add much to our understanding of the Shroud and its debated authenticity. White was not involved in the new study. “There is no question (Oresme) was one of the leading intellectuals of 14th-century France, a bishop and royal advisor. His skepticism might carry more weight given his standing, but it actually reflects his broader fight against false relics more than drawing upon any direct knowledge he had of the Shroud itself.” “My position is that the Shroud of Turin has defied explanation for centuries. “We need both more historical documents and the most advanced scientific testing; however, the Shroud may never be ‘put to rest' — its enduring mystery is what makes it so compelling.” But like many other researchers, he acknowledges that additional research would be beneficial to understand more about the Shroud and how it was made: “I think the problem is that everything and its opposite has been written about the Shroud of Turin, so that it has become possible to pick and choose what we like and what we don't like.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger received welcome news in her campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. The Center for Politics on Thursday published ratings for a number of races, including in Virginia, where Democrats are hoping to flip the governor's seat blue. Winsome Earle-Sears is trailing by a narrow margin in the state's gubernatorial race to replace term-limited Gov. “We'll be paying attention to whatever tea leaves that may show up in the early voting patterns, but for now, we are upgrading Spanberger's position,” it continued. The University of Virginia-based institute criticized several recent polls that indicate Earle-Sears is closing in on Spanberger, suggesting they are biased in her favor. An Aug. 26 poll from co/efficient showed just a five-point gap between the two candidates, with Spanberger leading 48% to 43%. The Center for Politics argued the two latest polls “arguably stress-tested Spanberger's lead by suggesting an electorate that may be redder than what we will see in November, and she was still ahead.” “To be clear, we also don't necessarily think Spanberger is “actually” leading by considerably more than what these polls show—mid-to-high single digits may very well be where the race is at,” the pollsters added. In Virginia, Spanberger has come under attack from the GOP partly due to her positions on transgender and immigration policy. Sears and Youngkin have criticized the Democratic candidate for not supporting the Laken Riley Act, which targets illegal immigrants accused of committing violent crimes for swift deportation after one such man was convicted of murdering a Georgia nursing student. And Spanberger has also been pressured to support the federal government's push to mandate bathroom use on the basis of biological sex instead of gender identity. The matter has become a front-and-center issue in several Virginia counties, including Loudoun County, as multiple school districts refuse the Trump administration's request to reform transgender bathroom policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing Thursday to consider Miran's nomination to fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors. It was a crucial step in Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed, potentially eroding its long-accepted independence from politics, which in part has helped the US economy grow to and remain the world's largest over the past century. Republican and Democratic senators were unequivocal that the Fed's decisions on interest rates should remain free of political considerations. But Democrats questioned Miran's ability to distance himself from Trump, should he be confirmed to become a Fed governor. After all, Miran plans to technically remain an employee of the White House if he becomes Fed governor on a temporary basis. Miran said he would take a leave of absence from his current role as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers if his Fed term only lasts through January, but said he would resign if he remains for longer. Meanwhile, less than a mile away from Capitol Hill, a federal judge is set to review new court filings from the Trump administration and perhaps rule as early as Thursday whether Cook, whom the president fired last week over allegations of mortgage fraud, can remain as a Fed governor while her lawsuit challenging Trump's removal order moves forward in litigation. Fed officials have stood pat since December because they've wanted to see how the US economy responds to Trump's sweeping policies first, though they're gearing up for a rate cut in two weeks. Last year, Miran co-authored a Manhattan Institute report last year, that called the Fed's independence an outdated “shibboleth,” and he called for shorter terms for Fed governors to give the president more power to hold sway over the agency. “Central bank independence has long been considered an essential element for successful monetary policy. But central banks are creations of political exigency, and pure independence exists only in textbooks,” the report said. “It can also bestow power without accountability.” In a November 2024 paper, Miran detailed how a tariff -centric approach, aimed at weakening the dollar, could reshape the global trading system in favor of the United States. Democrats — and some Republicans — are expected to press Miran particularly on his view about the Fed's independence. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the banking committee's ranking member, said in prepared remarks published ahead of Miran's hearing that “every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn't an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump's puppet.” If confirmed to be a Fed governor, Miran would no longer play a role in shaping the administration's fiscal and trade policy. But lawmakers are expected to challenge Miran about whether his economic views are perhaps too radical to serve on the Fed. When Miran's nomination was announced, Trump said the appointment would last through January, aimed at filling the remainder of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's term, who resigned in early August without citing a reason for her departure. Last week, Trump said he is considering a longer term for Miran. “We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on August 26, referring to Cook's term, which is slated to last through 2038 and is currently in litigation after his firing of her. For months, Trump has complained that the Fed not lowering interest rates is forcing the federal government to make massive interest payments on its debt and that it is hurting housing affordability for Americans. If confirmed, Miran would be in a position to be elevated as Fed chair, potentially taking the same route that other former Fed chairs have taken, such as Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke (who also led the Council of Economic Advisers). According to Fed rules, the chair can be chosen only among current Fed governors, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has attacked for months, has refused to reveal if he's staying on the board after his term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell's term on the board runs through 2028, so he could theoretically choose to stay as a Fed governor, though Fed chair typically step down altogether after their term as chair ends. While senators consider the possibility of Miran as a Fed governor, Cook's own status on the central bank's governing board is in question. Last week, Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's firing of her, claiming the president violated her due process rights under the Constitution and federal law. Cook requested that the court allow her to remain in her job while the litigation moves forward, but in an emergency hearing on August 29, US District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee, asked for more written arguments to be submitted to her this week. The court's ruling on whether Cook will keep her job while the high-stakes case plays out is crucial, with a Fed policy meeting coming up on September 16-17. Last week after Cook was fired, the 11 Democrats on the committee that will consider Miran's nomination called on the chair, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, to postpone Miran's hearing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? There's a nationwide movement, Wait Until 8th, that argues that devices should be kept out of kids' hands until they're deep into middle school. “The kids have always had phones — since they were 3,” he told me a few months ago. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Introducing the device into his children's lives was an incredibly intentional process, akin to putting a series of training wheels on a bike. “It's designed so that everything about technology is a conversation,” he said. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Giving phones to toddlers is a counterintuitive idea, and that's putting it lightly. However, once you come to terms with the fact that these devices are also a vital tool in an increasingly tech-dependent world, the concept of teaching kids how to live with a phone from an early age — with guardrails, of course — makes perfect sense. Thirty-five states have laws or rules restricting or outright banning phones in schools to address a converging set of problems, including cyberbullying, classroom distraction, and the youth mental health crisis. Social media use, specifically, has been linked to depression and anxiety in kids. Parents and teens actually agree that social media in particular is a threat to mental health. It's even driving parents to sign pledges that they'll hold out and not buy their kid a phone until eighth grade. Critics like Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, have a point that kids and parents are completely outgunned by tech giants pushing addictive products onto kids. They're also correct that many solutions to keep kids safe, like better age verification, create new problems. But trying to keep kids away from smartphones, one of the most ubiquitous devices in the world today, is a fool's errand. Many parents — even those that signed pledges — have tried and failed. More than anything, teaching kids how to safely use technology is a good idea. Phones are a fact of life in the 21st century, and even if you try to keep them away from your kids, their friends will get devices, possibly without any safeguards, before you know it. Meanwhile, there's also growing evidence that screen time can be a good thing, especially when parents are directly involved. It's never too soon to teach digital literacy, if only so that children can spot scams and misinformation online, whenever they get access. By turning tech use into a conversation, parents also invite their children to come to them when things online inevitably go sideways. The number of children with devices is growing, too. “The research suggests that that can be effective in encouraging children's digital literacy, encouraging children's agency and exploration, and learning and avoiding the problems of saying, ‘I can use my phone, but you can't have one,'” Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has been studying kids and tech for decades, told me. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. Video calls have long been established as an early, educational screen time activity. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. A later study found that parent participation improved learning even more. As kids get older, though, passively watching videos can be good, too. A seminal study on the effects of Sesame Street found that watching the show in early childhood led to improved school performance. Of course, Sesame Street is created by a nonprofit with the explicit mission to educate kids. The infinite feed of YouTube, with its sometimes uncanny kids' content, is a different animal. The American Psychological Association said last year that features like endless scrolling and infinite feeds are “particularly risky” to young people, whose brains aren't as easily able to stop scrolling or watching and may become more distractible as a result. Creating playlists of music or videos and selecting specific audiobooks or podcasts is akin to putting training wheels on that corner of the internet. The most important part of that process is talking to kids about what they're watching or listening to, and eventually, discussing how platforms like YouTube and Spotify work. That includes explaining how dark patterns and algorithmic feeds can compel them to keep consuming content. “With some new boundaries and communication and approaches to content, parents can shift things in the right direction,” said Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School who coaches families on intentional approaches to tech use. “These tech companies don't deserve to occupy so much of our family's time and space.” These tech companies are also acutely aware of the very public perception that their products harm kids. That's why we've seen the introduction of things like YouTube Kids and Instagram Teen Accounts, which offer more parental controls but still profit from capturing the attention of children. The least parents could do is empower those kids with digital literacy skills so that they gain an understanding of how these powerful platforms work. The more I think about it, giving them their own smartphone to start the process at an early age — and talk to them about it constantly — is a great first step. You could argue that middle school, when many kids are deep in the throes of puberty, is the worst time for them to gain access to everything a smartphone can do. It's hard to imagine keeping phones out of kids' hands until an arbitrary age and then expecting them to develop a healthy relationship with the device overnight. “The goal is absolutely to think about how we can foster healthy, meaningful use of technology early on,” said Eisha Buch, who oversees the digital citizenship program at Common Sense. “Because those skills and the mindsets ideally are there to stay and stick with them for when they are 16 or 18 or whenever they've left the house and the parent isn't there to guide them.” Something that struck me when I started to imagine doing this for my own family is remembering the order in which I gained access to digital tools in the '90s. Then, I had an iPod, and eventually a flip phone. When I pick up my phone today, I still think of it primarily as a device that does helpful things like take pictures, play music, and connect me with family and friends. Admittedly, my phone has also turned into a way to waste time, thumbing through feeds or watching videos, and even my adult brain struggles to stop doing that. They should engage with their kid about tech, release oversight sequentially, and give the kid tools to handle challenges or talk to a parent when they're in trouble. “The worst outcome is a child who needs help from an adult but can't go to their parents because they don't have the trust that their parent is going to do something that's really going to help them,” Bickham said. One of the first sentences many toddlers learn is, “I need help.” If a parent wants to be seen as helpful when it comes to technology, making themselves available early on seems smart. Even in the near future, when we'll be able to talk to AI agents in our glasses, smartphones will remain ubiquitous. This generation of parents, who mostly grew up in the '80s and '90s, have a unique opportunity to ease their kids into this tech-filled world and to help them develop a healthy relationship with that tech. Personally, I'll take the years-long head start that comes with starting sooner rather than later. A version of this story was also published in the User Friendly newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” — but doesn't want you to see a report that could do just that. Most Americans still don't know that alcohol can cause cancer — and the alcohol industry is working hard to make sure it stays that way. For the past three years, the industry, aided by its allies in Congress and later the Trump administration, has sought to discredit and eventually bury a major analysis that offers new evidence of the link between drinking alcohol and getting sick and dying from various causes, including cancer. This year, Gallup recorded a historic low in the percentage of US adults who drink: 54 percent, down from 67 percent in 2022. Surveys have found that while the percentage of Americans who know that alcohol is a carcinogen has been rising, it is still below 50 percent. The alcohol study's results were intended to inform those guidelines. … Look at all this evidence we have,” Priscilla Martinez, deputy scientific director of the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute and one of the co-authors, told me in an interview. But after the authors submitted their final report to Trump's health department in March and never saw it again, Reuters reported in June, citing anonymous sources, that the new dietary guidelines would eliminate any specific recommended limits on alcohol consumption. “I think it's a shame,” said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and another co-author. “Anyone who is a decision-making authority, you want them to have all of the information.” It is another example of the Trump administration seeming to work against the best interest of public health — despite allying itself closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again movement. But neither Kennedy, who has been in addiction recovery himself for decades, nor the broader movement has seemed to make reducing alcohol consumption a priority. Instead, the Trump administration will not release a report that would actually show just how harmful to people's health drinking alcohol can be, the latest in a series of decisions that could actually leave Americans less healthy. “People are going to get sick who might have avoided getting sick, because they might have decreased their drinking,” Martinez said. For this story, I spoke with three of the six authors of the study: Martinez, Keyes, and co-author Tim Naimi, an alcohol researcher affiliated with the University of Victoria and Boston University. They not only reviewed a wide range of observational studies, but they also ran data through a statistical model based on the US population, specifically to estimate the mortality effects of alcohol for Americans. They broke out their findings by different drinking levels — from one drink per day to three — and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. The general finding that the health risks from alcohol start at low levels of drinking and increase significantly for people who drink more is consistent with previous research, as I covered in a story earlier this year. Public health experts broadly agree that heavy drinking is bad for your health; the debate has been over moderate amounts of drinking. There is another issue that continues to complicate the debate: Lay people may have an inflated definition of what “moderate” drinking means compared to their doctor or a scientist, which could lead to people putting their health at risk even if they don't think of themselves as heavy drinkers. In that context, the report is a harrowing read: Alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer — colorectal, breast cancer in women, liver, oral, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Risk for these cancers increases with any alcohol use and continues to grow with higher levels of use, the study's authors concluded. Women experience a higher risk of an alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed than men. Amid all of the public discourse about alcohol and its health effects, here was a clear and authoritative summary of the evidence that would be most relevant to Americans. It was, its authors told me, consistent with the scientific consensus at this time. “Nothing we're saying is all that surprising or controversial to those of us who know the field,” Keyes said. Every five years, the federal government reviews the nation's dietary guidelines and issues new ones that reflect the current best consensus among scientists about what we should eat, how much of it we should eat, and what we should avoid eating and drinking to lead a healthy life. US officials always solicit expert opinion as they prepare a fresh set of dietary guidelines. Ahead of drafting the new guidance for 2025, the Biden administration began considering in February 2022 whether to take a different approach to more thoroughly review alcohol's health effects ahead of the 2025 dietary guidelines being developed and released. By April 2022, HHS had decided to launch a new review of the science on alcohol and health, called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study — the research Trump's administration has yet to release — to be conducted by an outside expert panel. That analysis would be submitted to Congress as part of an annual report on underage drinking, and it would be shared with USDA and HHS to consider for the 2025 dietary guidelines. It makes sense why the federal government would launch an effort like this. The negative health effects of alcohol have been getting more and more attention, and research continues to link drinking even in moderate amounts to cancer, liver disease, and mental health problems. The World Health Organization declared in 2023 that no amount of drinking could be considered safe. It was time to take a hard look at American drinking. But almost immediately, controversy was already brewing around the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. In December 2022, several months after HHS had decided to launch the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, Congress included a provision in a routine government spending bill: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine should undertake its own study of alcohol's health effects and submit that as the basis for the 2025 dietary guidelines. Two of the initial co-authors for that report were removed after objections over their reported connections to the alcohol industry. Keyes told me that she believed she had been criticized for, in effect, describing the findings of various alcohol-related studies. “When I read criticism of my involvement in the committee, and it was described as a conflict of interest, the conflict was that I had accurately described scientific research in the media,” Keyes said. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill waded into the fight. In March 2024, Congress tucked a provision into another omnibus spending bill that instructed HHS and USDA to consider the National Academies report when writing the alcohol guidelines. Representatives from states including Kentucky and California — where whiskey and wine are important cultural exports, respectively — sent letters to HHS in April 2024 and again that September, criticizing the Alcohol Intake and Health Study for being duplicative of the National Academies report — even though the former was commissioned by the government first. (HHS said at the time that it would not be duplicative but complementary.) Both groups of researchers continued to assemble their reports as the public relations war raged. But when it came time to publish their findings, they had very different experiences. A draft version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study was posted on January 15, just days before Trump's second inauguration and around the same time that then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recommended that alcohol come with cancer warning labels; you can still find it online here. This is the process for most government reports: The authors put together a draft, the initial findings are released for public comment, stakeholders submit their takes, and then the authors will take those comments into consideration and revise their report for its final publication. But that didn't happen with the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. They sent that final report to the Trump administration in March. Vox contacted HHS with a detailed list of questions about the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and why it hasn't been released, as well as Kennedy's general perspective on alcohol and health. The agency sent a brief comment in response: “This information has been provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Guidelines,” an HHS spokesperson said. Some of the authors still held out hope that the study would be included in the annual report on underage drinking that is required by federal law to be submitted to Congress and is expected later this year. But then in August, those hopes were shattered: According to all three co-authors, they were told that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the study in any form and would not include it in the upcoming congressional report on underage drinking. (The authors are currently working, as they always planned to do, on publishing their findings in an independent academic journal.) Its findings, however, were controversial: It indicated that moderate levels of drinking could actually be beneficial to people, and even the links to cancer, despite ethanol being widely classified as a carcinogen, were limited. Critics said the National Academies report was based on observational studies that can show a correlation between, for example, moderate drinking and cardiovascular health, but don't prove a cause; the National Academies report's authors acknowledged that limitation. As Naimi told me earlier this year, many moderate drinkers may have other attributes — such as higher incomes — that could explain their better health without accounting for alcohol. Critics of the National Academies report also said the authors had used overly restrictive criteria for which research to include, excluding many studies that have found harmful effects from alcohol use. Will it change the dietary guidelines as rumored and eliminate a specific recommended limit on alcohol consumption? The National Academies report would appear to set the stage for such a change, with its industry-preferred messaging that low levels of drinking could make people healthier. ﻿Protecting astronauts in space — and maybe even Mars — will help transform health on Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized the military's strike on a Venezuelan drug boat, saying “even the worst people in our country” get trials. Paul suggested the drug boat's occupants should have been given a chance to be tried for their crimes. Paul said it isn't “our policy” to “blow people up” on the United States's coast. He added, “Even the worst people in our country, if we accuse somebody of a terrible crime, they still get a trial.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the strike on Tuesday, saying they “conducted a lethal strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug vessel which had departed from Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.” “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. The administration said Venezuela's government enables drug dealers and traffickers. It denied that, and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called Attorney General Pam Bondi's move to raise the award for President Nicolas Maduro's arrest “pathetic” and a “crude political propaganda operation.” The U.S. has not said whether it will strike Venezuela directly. Trump directed the military to target Latin American cartels last month.</p>
