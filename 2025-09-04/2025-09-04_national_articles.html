Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, challenged his opponent in NYC's mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, to five debates in each of NYC's five boroughs during a press conference Thursday. Andrew Cuomo challenged his NYC mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to five different debates across all five New York City boroughs during a press conference Thursday. The challenge came as the former governor slammed Mamdani at his press conference in Manhattan's Upper West Side for failing "to give a straight answer" to reporters' questions and changing his mind "on everything" he has said on the campaign trail. And, frankly, you guys let him get away with it," Cuomo told reporters Thursday. "I won't let him get away with it. And New Yorkers won't let him get away with it." Hours after Cuomo leveled his challenge to Mamdani, the self-described democratic socialist shot back a proposal of his own: debate President Donald Trump. Andrew Cuomo challenged Zohran Mamdani to several debates across New York City Thursday, but Mamdani countered with a proposal to debate Donald Trump instead. Mamdani's campaign told Fox News Digital in a statement. "If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors." The back-and-forth between Cuomo and Mamdani comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is weighing whether to offer jobs in his administration to incumbent NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the GOP candidate for NYC mayor, Curtis Sliwa. The former governor indicated during his press conference Thursday that he was aware of media reports about Trump possibly offering his NYC mayoral opponents jobs, subsequently clearing the field for him, but added that he has "no idea" if the reports are accurate. Cuomo said he has not spoken to either Mayor Eric Adams or President Trump about the matter. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Andrew Cuomo, an NYC mayoral candidate, criticized President Donald Trump (left) for striking Iran without congressional approval. Neither Adams nor his team responded to Fox News Digital's inquiries on Thursday either, but media reports Thursday indicated Adams met in Florida with Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, one of the president's closest advisors, to discuss a potential job with the Trump administration. News of the Adams meeting came after media reports last week indicating Trump had personally phoned influential businessman John Catsimatidis, an Adams ally, to set a deadline for the mayor and Sliwa to drop out. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as the moderate left-wing alternative to Mamdani in the race, described Mamdani's policy proposals Thursday as "absurd," "out of the mainstream" and "discordant with what New Yorkers believe." Shortly after launching his independent bid for mayor last month, Cuomo proposed that all the other candidates in the race, with the exclusion of Mamdani, make a pledge to agree that whoever is not leading in the polls by mid-September, would step aside. New York City mayoral candidates from left to right: Zohran Mamdani, Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa. However, the proposal has been rejected by Adams, and Sliwa suggested to Fox News Digital Thursday that Cuomo and Adams are not even the main frontrunners who New Yorkers want to win. "This is a race between the two major party nominees, myself and Mamdani, and New Yorkers know I'm the only one with the experience and grit to take him on," Sliwa told Fox News Digital. "I'm running to save New York City from decline and give working people the future they deserve." Speaking specifically to Mamdani's response to Cuomo's debate challenge, Sliwa added that Mamdani "is desperate to distract from his own radical agenda, so he hides behind cheap theatrics."

NFL legend Brett Favre discusses why he believes Trump won the presidential election so decisively on 'The Ingraham Angle.' The Packers legend spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before the election. Trump eventually defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election, carrying Wisconsin in the win. Favre said in a recent interview with sports personality Sage Steele he took a "common sense" approach when it came to his decision to support Trump. Brett Favre speaks during a campaign rally for Donald Trump at Resch Center in Green Bay, Wis., Oct. 30, 2024. "I thought about the rally in Green Bay when he asked if I would come talk. "There's been a hard line drawn in the sand, and you're either on one side or the other. I thought about if you persuade five voters, and who knows, it may be a five-vote difference. "It wasn't my cup of tea. I'm certainly not a political public speaker. And do I agree with everything President Trump says or does? Does he agree with everything that I do? Nor with anyone on the other side. "But from a common sense perspective, do you really think boys should compete in girls sports and that's fair? I'm all for doing the right thing for the people, but we have to protect our own first." Former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre speaks before Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a campaign rally at the Resch Center Oct. 30, 2024, in Green Bay, Wis. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) He said he also wondered whether supporters on the left thought about whether the country's direction was really something they wanted to further support. He said he couldn't be one of those supporters who rested on his laurels, hoping things would get better. "Some of the things that you're, on the left, are saying is normal, do ever not look in the mirror when no one is looking and it's just you and you go, ‘Are we out of our damn mind?'" "So, I felt like the conservative crowd, in general, sits on our hands, and I think at times I was like you just expect people to do the right thing and to make common sense decisions. And the left has no problem talking. And I'm thinking, ‘You know, like, if we don't start standing up and defending ourselves, not that we should have to, it is what it is, if we don't start taking a stand, we're gonna get dominated.'" Favre said he had no plans to run for office but wasn't going to tone his voice down either. Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre warms up before playing against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field. "I would like to run off into the sunset and enjoy life, but we gotta fight. I'd love to sugarcoat it, but they ain't going away," he said.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on where Zohran Mamdani stands with top NYC Dems and the criticism he's recently faced on 'Special Report.' The National Democratic Committee seemed to reaffirm their support for New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in a social media post on Wednesday despite the surge of new reporting about the self-identified Democratic socialist's anti-Israel views and extreme, far-left policies. The DNC clipped and posted Mamdani telling "I've Had It" podcast hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, "We welcome anyone to join this movement." Mamdani was describing how he fostered a broad coalition of supporters to win the Democratic primary in June by welcoming anyone to join his movement, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino said the DNC's post confirmed that the Democratic Party is "quickly finishing its transformation into a socialist party." Zohran Mamdani arrives for a news conference at Astoria Park during the New York City Mayoral Democratic primary June 24, 2025. The post comes as several party leaders, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have yet to endorse his campaign with just two months until Election Day. When asked in July about Republicans trying to anchor Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats, DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital, "The Democratic Party is a big tent party. While the DNC affirmed their support for New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, party officials and establishment leaders have been careful to outright embrace Mamdani and his radical policy agenda. Throughout the summer, Fox News Digital has reported extensively about Mamdani's past comments, political connections and questionable stances. A Fox News Digital review discovered that Mamdani's growing circle of influence is littered with activists who have espoused anti-Israel views and socialist principles. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani spoke to supporters at Prospect Park Aug. 17, 2025. Fox News Digital has also reported on a resurfaced interview in which Mamdani highlights his commitment to BDS, an acronym for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, and sanctions against Israel, as he runs for mayor in a city with the highest Jewish population in the United States outside of Israel. Mamdani spoke at SAAG Interactive in June 2021 about BDS in the interview, saying that "the ways in which we can marry our struggle to our day-to-day life and show our solidarity in that life, I think that's critical to winning this fight because it can't all be, as you've very well stated, just kind of exclusively considered a legislative battle. Another resurfaced interview included Mamdani explaining that the family he grew up in made him "open" to being a "radical" and suggesting that socialism needs to be rebranded. "I think, honestly, growing up in the family that I grew up in, I was quite open to what would be considered being a radical from a very young age," Mamdani said on "The Far Left Show" in 2020. "I mean, from the beginning, my identities are already considered radical by a lot of mainstream American political thought. So, being a Muslim and being an immigrant, these are things that already kind of put you in the box of ‘other.' So, often people in this country are considered radicals if they stand up for Palestinian human rights." Mamdani has faced criticism over some of his positions taken as a young man, including supporting an academic boycott of Israel, starting a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his college days and the past writings of his father, Mahmood Mamdani. "My platform is that every single person should have housing, and I think, faced with these two options, the system has hundreds of thousands of people unhoused, right? Mamdani asked in a resurfaced video that has been clipped and reposted across conservative social media. Mahmood Mamdani, the Columbia University professor and mayoral hopeful's father, has a social media presence littered with anti-Israel comments and praise for radical activists, a Fox News Digital review found. Mamdani, 79, who Fox News Digital previously reported sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, has posted on his X account about Israel on multiple occasions, using terms like "settlers" and "colonialism." Mamdani posted online May 21, 2021, as Israel was involved in a violent conflict with Hamas. New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani closed out his "Five Boroughs Against Trump" tour across New York City in Queens on Aug. 15, 2025. Mamdani's college newspaper articles also shed light on the candidate's early views on a variety of topics, including his promotion of an anti-Israel boycott and concerns about "White privilege," a Fox News Digital review found. Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine's prestigious Bowdoin College, from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel. He also faced ridicule for his comments at the Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, where he urged attendees not to compromise on goals like "seizing the means of production." "Right now, if we're talking about the cancellation of student debt, if we're talking about Medicare for all, you know, these are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country," Mamdani says in a video to conference goers. "But then there are also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS or whether it is the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment." Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC and Mamdani but did not immediately receive a response. Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump suggested Wednesday he may redirect National Guard members to New Orleans next, instead of Chicago where he has recently been threatening to surge troops – even while it's still not clear troops will show up. “So we're making a determination now, do we go to Chicago, or do we go to a place like New Orleans where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite tough, quite bad,” Trump told reporters. “So we're gonna be going to maybe Louisiana, and you have New Orleans, which has a crime problem.” These often-unwanted actions have been rife with controversy, sparking lawsuits and costing taxpayers millions of dollars. Judge says Trump administration's use of US military in Los Angeles violated federal law Violent crimes are trending downward in New Orleans over the past year with homicides down about 27%, a 15% decrease in reported rapes and a 16.5% drop in robberies, according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a national organization of police chiefs. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, a Democrat who was indicted last month over allegations of trying to hide her relationship with her bodyguard, did not immediately turn down Trump's proposal or comment directly beyond the city's statement. Cantrell, who is slated to leave office in just months due to term limits, joins two other Black female mayors who have found their city in Trump's crosshairs. Both Los Angeles and Washington, DC, each led by a Black woman, have seen National Guard troops deployed in their cities. In fact, Louisiana's governor sent the state's own guard members to Washington, DC last month even as two of its own cities – Shreveport and Lafayette – have violent crime rates higher than Washington, DC's. New Orleans City council member and mayoral candidate Helena Moreno, also a Democrat, vowed to fight a federal takeover and called Trump's plans “an attack on certain cities.” While New Orleans politics lean heavily Democratic, Louisiana is overall a Republican stronghold, including its governor, both US Senate seats and four of the six seats in the US House of Representatives. Republicans also hold a majority in both the Louisiana Senate and House. While other Democratic governors have rejected Trump sending National Guard troops to their states, Louisiana's governor is embracing the idea. “We will take President Donald Trump's help from New Orleans to Shreveport,” Landry, the conservative ally of the president said Wednesday in a social media post. “President Trump is focused on getting control of our cities but not doing it the way past presidents and other administrations have done, where it's temporary. What he wants to see is permanent safety for Americans,” Landry explained. Landry launched his own crime crackdown last year sending state police to establish a presence in New Orleans. If your gut reaction is to reject the President's offer for assistance without condition, perhaps you're the problem - not him,” Murrill said in a statement Wednesday. Here's how the nighttime escape of 10 Louisiana inmates from a New Orleans jail unfolded Some local leaders suggest sending in troops may not be needed and it's more of a political move. Defillo said local law enforcement is doing a “tremendous job” combating crime, noting that federal partners already have worked closely with local enforcement this year for big events like Super Bowl LIX and Mardis Gras. He does not see a current need to bring in any help. “Sending troops into Black and Brown cities is not a solution,” New Orleans Councilmember Lesli Harris responded, suggesting “if the federal government truly wants to help, it should invest in our city's ongoing programs.” “Militarizing the streets of New Orleans is not a solution. But to have a military zone created in the middle of the city of New Orleans is not necessary and I think it's actually politically motivated,” Carter told CNN's Erica Hill on Thursday. Bringing in troops to curb crime without providing services for people living in poverty or creating more jobs would not solve crime issues, Dennis Muhammad, the organization's founder, tells CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kory Krause, Frontiersman Sports owner, talks about how Robin Westman, the shooter who killed 2 schoolchildren in Minnesota, did not show any warning signs to his employees while buying a firearm, in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025. Gun store owner Kory Krause told The Associated Press that Robin Westman spent around 40 minutes at Frontiersman Sports in St. Louis Park on Aug. 23 and appeared completely at ease.

(AP Photo/Mark Vancleave) Westman had already passed the required background checks and had a valid permit to purchase the gun, Krause said. Krause said none came from his store. Westman, 23, attended the school for eighth grade and Westman's mother formerly worked for the parish, but investigators are still trying to determine a motive. Westman died by suicide after firing 116 rifle rounds through the church's stained-glass windows. As first reported by KSTP-TV, the security video shows Westman handling several firearms and talking with employees and other customers. Krause stressed that nothing in Westman's conduct raised any concerns among his staffers, who he said are trained to watch for warning signs. Frontiersman Sports owner Kory Krause recounts Robin Westman's visit to his store during an interview, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in St. Louis Park, Minn. (AP Photo/Mark Vancleave) Krause said his employees have extensive experience in picking out bad actors, straw purchasers, people who are homicidal, suicidal, mentally unstable or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He said nothing stood out with Westman. But it always ends with the answer of ‘nothing.' And that's what makes this situation so unique.” At a news conference Thursday at Hennepin Healthcare, a trauma hospital that treated several victims, Annunciation parent Malia Kimbrell delivered a wrenching account about her daughter's injuries and implored lawmakers to ban assault weapons. Her 9-year-old daughter, Vivian St. Clair, was shot three times: twice in the back and once in the arm. The girl, who had been in intensive care, is now recovering at home. You have a hole in your back,'” Kimbrell recounted. Kimbrell, a nurse in the hospital's newborn intensive care unit, challenged lawmakers to ban the kind of high-powered rifles and high capacity magazines used by the shooter, saying she will “settle for nothing less.” “I will get the names of any lawmakers who stand in the way of that happening, and I will invite you to come to my living room and insist that you hold Vivian's hand while we do her dressing changes each night and she cries the entire time,” she said. Thinking and praying are what you do after a tragedy. Taking action is what we can do before the next tragedy occurs.” Tim Walz said Tuesday he intends to call a special session of the Minnesota Legislature to address gun and school safety, and he suggested that an assault weapons ban would be on his list of proposals, which he is still developing. But it would be very difficult for anything to pass the closely divided Legislature without at least some bipartisan support. The proposals would also prohibit districts from banning school resource officers, as Minneapolis and some other districts have done. The House GOP also called for more mental health treatment beds and mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat criminals who use guns and for straw purchasers of firearms that are used in violent crimes. Students Demand Action, an arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, is organizing school walkouts across the country for Friday to demand that state and federal lawmakers ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A contentious three-hour hearing between U.S. senators and Robert Kennedy Jr. devolved into multiple screaming matches on Thursday as the nation's health secretary fended off accusations about sweeping changes he's made to vaccines, health care policy and leadership. A frustrated Kennedy dismissed those arguments but also sowed doubt on vaccine safety and effectiveness from the prominent perch on Capitol Hill. Kennedy repeatedly disputed the account of fired CDC director Susan Monarez, who was abruptly removed from her post last week after less than a month on the job. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Monarez reiterated that she was told to “preapprove” recommendations by Kennedy's handpicked vaccine advisers, many of whom have records of questioning basic vaccine science. and she said ‘No,'” Kennedy stated, explaining his change of opinion on Monarez. An attorney representing Monarez called Kennedy's statements “false” and “patently ridiculous,” in a written statement. Later in the hearing, Kennedy acknowledged that he'd told Monarez to fire several senior CDC officials. For Kennedy, tough questions from angry senators were an opportunity to fight back. Throughout the hearing, a resolute Kennedy accused senators of lying, misrepresenting his agency and making little sense. As a result, questioning from Democratic senators repeatedly turned into yelling matches. “You're just making stuff up,” Kennedy told Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, after she accused him of “blaming school shootings on antidepressants.” The health secretary said on Fox News after the recent Minnesota shooting that antidepressants could potentially contribute to violence, and said his agency was investigating. While critics of antidepressants have long alleged they may increase homicidal behavior, the link is not supported by multiple, large clinical trials of the drugs. When Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia questioned Kennedy about his disparaging rhetoric about CDC employees before a recent deadly shooting at the agency, Kennedy retorted: “Are you complicit in the assassination attempts on President Trump?” Kennedy said Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico was “talking gibberish” when the Democrat asked him about the details of his agency's autism research. Democratic senators pressed Kennedy on recent changes narrowing the approval of annual COVID-19 shots. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated shots but only for seniors or younger people with underlying health risks. That's sparked confusion and frustration from many Americans, including parents interested in vaccinating healthy children against the virus. “Why have you acted behind closed doors to overrule scientists and limit the freedom of parents to choose the COVID vaccine for their children?” Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire asked. Later, he acknowledged that access to vaccines at pharmacies “depends on the state.” In many states, pharmacists are legally barred from administering vaccines outside the uses endorsed by the CDC's advisory panel, prompting CVS and other pharmacy chains to turn away people seeking shots in certain states. “I'm not taking them away from people,” Kennedy said, noting that healthy Americans who want a shot should still be able to get one if a doctor prescribes one. Typically, Americans do not need to see a doctor for annual vaccine updates. In an exchange with Sen. Mark Warner, Kennedy claimed nobody knows how many Americans have died from COVID-19 because of a lack of government data. “The secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from COVID,” said Warner, a Virginia Democrat. Trump has long claimed success for the effort, while acknowledging unsubstantiated theories that mass vaccinations may have caused more harm than good. Kennedy has said it's unclear how many lives were saved by the vaccines because of imperfect data collected by the CDC and vaccine makers. Nevertheless, when questioned by Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana — a physician whose vote was key in Kennedy's nomination — about Operation Warp Speed, Kennedy agreed that Trump “absolutely” deserved a Nobel Prize. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, also a doctor and the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had grown “deeply concerned” that some vaccines could be in jeopardy after Kennedy had cut research funding and fired the CDC director. “Americans don't know who to rely on,” Barrasso said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday that will change the name of the Defense Department to the Department of War, a White House official told CNN. It's a move that the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have previewed in recent days, including Trump in the Oval Office last week when he told reporters his administration was going to “change the name.” “We call it the Department of Defense, but between us, I think we're gonna change the name,” the president told reporters on August 25. “We won the World War 1, World War 2 - it was called the Department of War, and to me, that's really what it is. Defense is a part of that, but I have a feeling we're gonna be changing.” While at Fort Benning on Thursday, Hegseth indicated the name change would be coming on Friday. “I would say standby tomorrow,” Hegseth said when asked about a potential change. And George Washington founded the War Department. CNN has reached out to the White House about how it would change the name this time. The Department of War, as it as once called, was first established by President George Washington when he founded the country's Army. But the name was later changed in 1949 as part of a broader reorganization of the military under President Harry Truman. The National Security Act also established the Joint Chiefs of Staff as an organization to advise the president on military planning and strategy. The effort to rename the Pentagon follows a number of similar steps by Hegseth to change the names of bases and ships. He reversed a Biden-era decision that had removed Confederate-era names of bases like Fort Bragg and Fort Hood, reverting to those titles but officially naming them after different individuals with the same names. In June, Hegseth also ordered the renaming of an oiler ship named after gay rights activist and Navy veteran Harvey Milk. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, and Mexico's Foreign Secretary Juan Ramon de la Fuente shake hands following a news conference at the Foreign Ministry in Mexico City, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum' s strategy of managing a tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump may be running up against wider regional tensions and lack of willingness by the Trump administration to make concessions, experts say. Since Trump took office, the freshly elected Mexican president has been lauded, and even dubbed a sort of “Trump whisperer,” for being able to offset the brunt of U.S. tariffs that have dealt a blow to other foreign economies. Sheinbaum has done so by cracking down on cartels with a heavier hand than her predecessor, delivering dozens of cartel affiliates to American authorities and pointing to lower fentanyl seizures at the U.S. border. “So what do we propose?” Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference Thursday. “If this problems reduces, then we evidently want to see that 25% (tariff) shrink.” But now, observers say Sheinbaum is increasingly backed against a wall. Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, said Sheinbaum is now having to walk “a fine line” with Trump that appears to only be getting more complicated. “There's a sort of uncertainty that hangs over the relationship,” Shifter said. “Sheinbaum likely feels incredibly frustrated because she has taken major steps toward dealing with the cartels. “You can see why Claudia Sheinbaum would be emphasizing sovereignty when on the way to visiting Mexico, Secretary Rubio was highlighting a U.S. military attack on an alleged vessel in the Caribbean.” But by Wednesday's meeting, it was clear the two governments were not going to sign a formal agreement. Instead, they announced a high-level group of Mexican and U.S. officials who would monitor their cooperation. It was unclear how much of a change that would actually make, given the fact that Mexican officials have been meeting regularly with the Trump administration since January. Palmira Tapia, a political analyst for Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said it was a sign that while Sheinbaum was following through on promises to crack down on cartels, Trump was not likely to make many concessions to the Mexican leader. “There aren't really any incentives for Trump,” Tapia said. “Because his winning strategy has been to get what he wants with the threat of tariffs.” However, Zissis and other observers said that while the Trump administration has showed little willingness to cede ground, Sheinbaum does have a few cards up her sleeve. One, long used by Mexico's government, has been helping the U.S. in block migratory flows north. The other is Sheinbaum's soaring level of popularity in Mexico, where polls show she boasts anywhere between 70% to 80% approval. At the same time, they said Sheinbaum has little room to radically shift her strategy toward Trump. “It's a very delicate balance, because at the same time that she's handled this relationship so well, so much is at stake for Mexico,” Zissis said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) have proposed using the “speech and debate clause” in the Constitution to expose the clients of Jeffrey Epstein‘s alleged sex trafficking ring. Greene, one of four Republicans who have signed onto a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill that would require a full release of the files related to the convicted sex offender, said Wednesday she would read the names on the House floor if Epstein's victims provide them. Although this clause is enacted on the floor at all times, it is not often used in cases similar to this one. “Can you imagine how terrifying it would be to name names like that?” “The general purpose of the speech and debate clause is to protect members of Congress from having to worry that anything they say in the course of legislative activities will implicate them in a lawsuit,” Middle Tennessee State University's Free Speech Center wrote. Other survivors expressed that they back this effort but shared the sentiment that the duty falls to the DOJ to release information, as many of them remain fearful of their safety. “It's a scary thing to name names, but I will tell you, I'm not afraid to name names, and so if they want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the House floor and I'll say every damn name that abused these women,” Greene said. Massie backed Greene's idea in a post on X, while some Democrats have also expressed support. Survivors at our press conference announced they are privately compiling their own Epstein list.They would be sued into homelessness for naming names, but @RepMTG and I are willing to name names in the House of Representatives under Constitutional “speech or debate” immunity. “Obviously, putting forward new names would open them up to significant lawsuits, so that is a good solution that they mentioned,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) told the Washington Examiner. Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) filed a so-called “discharge petition” this week to force a House vote on their Epstein Files Transparency Act, which calls for the full release of the criminal files with redactions to protect the victims. The House Oversight Committee released 33,000 pages of DOJ files on Epstein this week, just hours after the discharge petition opened, but critics say it's not enough. Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Nancy Mace (R-SC), and Greene signed on to the discharge petition after Mace left a House Oversight Committee meeting on Tuesday with the victims in tears after hearing their stories of abuse. Mace used the speech and debate clause earlier this year in a rare instance to speak out about her experience with sexual assault. She detailed accusations of sexual abuse, where she accused four men of rape, sex trafficking, and other sex crimes against her and other female victims. “I rise today to call out the cowards who think they can prey on women and get away with it. “I think using whatever tools constitutionally are necessary, but also in a deposition-type setting, if we as members of Congress asked questions about the name and they would be required to answer it, that would shield the victims from and provide some level of, I think, immunity for them as well,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro speaks during a news conference, Aug. 12, 2025, at the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal magistrate judge on Thursday angrily accused top Justice Department prosecutors of trampling on the civil rights of people arrested during President Donald Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital. Judge Zia Faruqui, a former federal prosecutor, said leaders of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office have tarnished its reputation with how they are handling the deluge of cases. He said Pirro's office is routinely bringing cases that don't belong in federal court and needlessly keeping people in jail for days while they evaluate charges. “It's not fair to say they're losing credibility. He later added, “There's no credibility left.” On Thursday, she responded to Faruqui's latest remarks by saying the judge “has repeatedly indicated his allegiance to those who violate the law and carry illegal guns.” “This judge took an oath to follow the law, yet he has allowed his politics to consistently cloud his judgment and his requirement to follow the law,” she said in a statement posted on social media. Trump has repeatedly attacked the courts and challenged their authority since he returned to office in January. But it's rare for a prosecutor to publicly criticize a judge by name, as doing so could damage the office's relationship with the federal bench. The judge lambasted Pirro's office during a hearing at which he agreed to dismiss the federal case against a man accused of threatening to kill Trump while in police custody. The defendant, Edward Alexander Dana, spent more than a week in jail before a federal grand jury refused to indict him. It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to balk at returning an indictment, but it has happened at least seven times in five cases since Trump's surge started nearly a month ago. Faruqui said there is no precedent for what is happening at the courthouse over the past few weeks. He said Trump administration officials are frequently touting the arrest figures on social media with seemingly no regard for how the arrests are affecting people's lives. Assistant U.S. Attorney Conor Mulroe said prosecutors from Pirro's office are working around the clock on the influx of new cases. Mulroe was the only representative of Pirro's office who attended Thursday's hearing. Faruqui questioned why Pirro or her top deputies “don't have the dignity to come here” and defend their charging decisions. Over 40 cases have been filed in district court, which hears the most serious federal offenses, including assault, gun and drug charges. Dana was jailed for approximately a week after his arrest on Aug. 17. On Thursday, Pirro's office opted to drop the federal case against Dana but charge him with misdemeanors, including destruction of property and attempted threats, in D.C. Superior Court. Dana's attorney, assistant federal public defender Elizabeth Mullin, said prosecutors should have known that this case didn't belong in federal court. Mullin said Dana's “hyperbolic rambling” didn't amount to a criminal threat. Faruqui ordered prosecutors to file a brief explaining why they didn't immediately inform him of its charging decisions in Dana's case. The judge apologized to Dana “on behalf of the court” and suggested that Pirro's office also owes Dana an apology. Pirro said in an earlier statement that a grand jury's refusal to indict somebody for threatening to kill the president “is the essence of a politicized jury.” “The system here is broken on many levels,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday condemned rumors that President Donald Trump is getting involved in the race to defeat his candidacy to become the Big Apple's first socialist leader. His words come after Politico and the New York Times reported this week that the Trump administration had contacted New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa, who are running against Mamdani, and floated federal positions for them if they agreed to drop out of the race. “But the reason that so many New Yorkers are fed up with politics as they know it is because of news like this, backroom deals, corrupt agreements, all of which serve to increase the sense of disaffection and despair as it pertains to how people feel about politics across this country, and to know that having defeated Andrew Cuomo by 13 points, having won the votes of close to 600,000 New Yorkers, has only been understood by that former government as an invitation to collaborate with Donald Trump.” As it stands, some Republicans fear the campaign could be Mamdani's to win because the race is split four ways between him, Adams, Cuomo, and Sliwa. Independent mayoral candidate Jim Walden dropped out of the race on Wednesday, urging other candidates “trailing in the polls” to suspend their campaigns and allow one contender a better chance of challenging Mamdani in November to defeat his chances of governing the country's largest city. Adams and Cuomo are both running on independent lines and are viewed as the leading contenders to Mamdani. Sliwa is campaigning as a Republican and is unlikely to make a competitive challenge to the socialist, whose rise has alarmed moderates on both sides of the aisle. White House officials have declined to comment to media outlets about the veracity of reports that the Trump administration floated a job offer to Adams at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in exchange for bowing out of his reelection bid. “If there's any changes in this race, I will announce that,” the incumbent mayor said. Cuomo said Thursday that his staff has not been in touch with Trump to “clear the field” for him to beat Mamdani in November. “I read the rumors, but no, it is up to Mayor Adams whether or not he wants to run or get out of the race,” Cuomo said during a campaign stop.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's order requiring Florida and the federal government to shut down and dismantle a controversial immigration detention facility built in the Everglades, widely referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.” On Thursday, the Eleventh US Circuit Court of Appeals granted requests from the State of Florida and the US Department of Homeland Security to stay a district court's preliminary injunction that would have forced the site to wind down operations within 60 days. The makeshift detention facility had been the subject of intense criticism for its treatment of migrants who had been confined there amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals, prompting members of Congress and state representatives that witnessed the conditions to demand its immediate closure. Florida may lose $218 million on empty ‘Alligator Alcatraz' as judge orders shutdown A win for Florida and President Trump's agenda!” The majority noted Florida could eventually seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but until such funding is formally approved, the project does not qualify as a “major federal action” that would trigger NEPA's environmental review requirements. A single judge on the Atlanta-based panel dissented saying he would have let William's shutdown order stay in place in what should have been a “relatively simple denial” of the state's motion. Ron DeSantis publicly said the federal government would fund it. That, the judge argued, makes it a “major federal action” subject to environmental review. “In fact, it's just starting, and we're committed to fighting on,” she said. Top Florida official says ‘Alligator Alcatraz' will likely be empty within days, email shows “I know many are questioning why the Trump and DeSantis administrations are insisting on pouring millions of taxpayer dollars into this dirty, destructive detention facility in the heart of the Everglades,” she told CNN. “Our legal system can and should stop this incredibly harmful boondoggle.” The next step, according to Bennett, is that a freshly-selected panel of appellate judges will now decide whether to reinstate the injunction to shut down the Everglades facility or strike it down altogether. “Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we've always said, open for business.” It had taken only a few days for the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport to be transformed from an 11,000-foot runway into a temporary tent city for migrants when it opened in July. Despite the controversy surrounding the facility, DeSantis is doubling down on immigrant detention centers in his state – including the announcement of a new immigration detention facility he dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which can hold as many as 2,000 detainees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening to decide whether President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff policy is lawful. The remarkable thing about Trump's petition asking the justices to take up this case, which is known as Trump v. V.O.S. But that would assume the Republican-controlled Supreme Court applies the same limits on executive power to Trump that it imposed on Democratic President Joe Biden — a highly uncertain proposition. The Court's Republicans only recently invented this doctrine. It has no basis in law, and it has only ever been used against one president in history: Joe Biden. In that case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014), the Republican justices announced that “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance. '” The idea was that, even if a federal law can be read to permit the executive to enact a particular policy, courts should read those laws narrowly if the policy is too ambitious. Indeed, under Biden, the Court even used this recently made-up doctrine to strike down policies that are unambiguously authorized by federal law. But federal law could not possibly have been clearer that the executive is permitted to cancel these loans. The secretary could use this power, moreover, “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans. That petition describes the tariffs as Trump's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative.” It claims that the tariff is necessary to close US trade deficits of “$1.2 trillion per year.” It alleges that the tariffs have given Trump leverage to extract multi-trillion-dollar concessions from foreign nations. And it also claims that the increased taxes Trump has unilaterally imposed on imports — taxes that will largely be paid by the American consumer — “will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years.” To be sure, it's never a good idea for a court to base its decisions on factual claims made by this particular administration. An August analysis of the tariffs by Yale's Budget Lab, for example, concluded that Trump's tariffs will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025, and that the tariffs will raise $2.7 trillion in taxes over a 10-year window. It would seem, then, that a straightforward application of the major questions doctrine compels this Court to invalidate Trump's tariffs. Concurring in FCC v. Consumers' Research (2025), Kavanaugh suggested that this newly invented doctrine does not apply to “foreign policy contexts.” The Court has never published a majority opinion claiming that this doctrine can be found in any provision of the Constitution, or in any federal statute. And while some individual justices have offered their own explanations of where this recently invented doctrine comes from, those explanations range from silly to ridiculous. Concurring in Nebraska, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett claimed that the doctrine is implicit in a parable about a babysitter. Asking whether the doctrine applies to foreign policy decisions, in other words, is a bit like asking your daughter whether her imaginary friend likes fried chicken. The answer is whatever your daughter wants it to be. As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this year, “judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply” because those courts “lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis.” If the major questions doctrine derived from a constitutional provision, then the justices could read that provision to determine if it contains a foreign policy exception. But, because the major questions doctrine is simply something that the Republican justices made up, there is no principled way to determine if it conveniently contains an exception that just happens to rescue a Republican president's “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative” from invalidation. If the Republican justices actually buy Trump's claim that he is exempt, that will leave little doubt that these justices are simply playing Calvinball — creating one set of rules to spite Democrats, and a different, far more favorable set of rules for Republicans. Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. The Court has a special set of rules for Trump. A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire and onetime top White House advisor Elon Musk said he was invited to a tech leader summit at the White House's newly renovated Rose Garden on Thursday, but will not be attending. “I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there,” Musk said on Thursday, replying to an X user who asked why the xAI, SpaceX and Tesla leader was not invited. Once referred to as “the first buddy,” and near constant presence at President Donald Trump's side, Musk had a messy blowup with the president this summer after leaving his position at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk even vowed to support primary challengers of Republicans who voted for Trump's signature funding bill, and he claimed he would be starting a new political party, although there does not seem to have been any movement on that front. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In recent days, public comments from Trump and Vice President JD Vance seem to suggest Musk would be welcomed back into the fold. Speaking to CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his podcast this week, Trump said Musk is “a man of common sense,” a “good man,” even though he “got off the reservation incorrectly.” In an interview last month with far-right outlet Gateway Pundit, Vance called Musk's relationship with the Trump White House “complicated.” But he said he expects and hopes Musk will support the Republican Party by next November's midterm elections. So I really think it's a mistake for him to try to break from the president,” Vance said. Musk has backed off attacking the administration on X and, in some cases, appears to be fully supporting the White House. Last month, he replied with a fire emoji and a laughing emoji to a post from White House communications adviser Margo Martin, who captioned a photo: “President @realDonaldTrump showing President Zelenskyy and President Macron his 4 More Years hat.” The White House invitation could also be a lesson in history: Musk was famously not invited to a White House summit on electric vehicles in 2021 during President Joe Biden's administration. (Part of the reason appeared to be because Tesla is a nonunion automaker.) Musk has been vocal about how much he continues to be upset over the snub. On Thursday, he reposted a 2023 interview where he said Biden “added insult to injury” and hurt the company by claiming at the event that General Motors was “leading the electric car revolution” while Tesla made far more EV cars. Musk reposted the 2023 video with the comment: “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans and Democrats scrutinized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for more than three hours Thursday morning on Capitol Hill. The hearing was scheduled as a review of President Donald Trump's healthcare agenda, but it quickly became a referendum on Kennedy's leadership of the sprawling department, with the heated conversation ranging from abortion to COVID-19 policy, to the recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez. Here are some of the highlights from the more than three hours of Kennedy's testimony, which at times veered into confrontation and personal accusations. Kennedy lambasted Monarez's credibility when asked repeatedly by Democrats and Republicans about the cause for her termination last week. He flatly said that Monarez lied when she wrote in her Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that Kennedy told her to “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel,” whose members were handpicked by the secretary. “No, I did not say that to her, and I never had a private meeting with her other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say I never said that,” Kennedy said. Monarez's lawyers told the Washington Examiner that they dismiss Kennedy's claims “as false and, at times, patently ridiculous” and that she stands by what she wrote in her op-ed. A handful of Republicans criticized Kennedy's move to restrict approvals for COVID-19 vaccines to only those with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease, including seniors over age 65. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and John Barrasso (R-WY), both physicians, said their professional colleagues have expressed concern that Kennedy's administration is limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines, because HHS approval is essential for insurance coverage of the shots. Cassidy tripped up Kennedy about whether to praise Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that fast-tracked mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during the first Trump administration. Kennedy referenced a study published by the anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center this summer using insurance data that concluded that the complication rate of mifepristone is roughly 11%. This includes hemorrhaging and severe infections due to incomplete abortions. The tax credits, which Democrats passed as part of COVID-19 relief efforts in 2021 and 2022, are likely to be a main focus of both chambers of Congress before the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown. Instead, he said Democrats “had two chances to make them permanent, and they didn't.” Kennedy clashed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Warren argued that Kennedy curbed access to the vaccines by limiting the recommendation for shots only to people with comorbidities that put them at risk for severe disease. Because the shots are not recommended, she said, they are not available at many pharmacies or covered by insurance. Kennedy said the vaccines were not intended for healthy people. “I know you've taken $855,000 from pharmaceutical companies,” he said. “I'm not taking them away,” he later said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger received welcome news in her campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. The Center for Politics on Thursday published ratings for a number of races, including in Virginia, where Democrats are hoping to flip the governor's seat blue. Winsome Earle-Sears is trailing by a narrow margin in the state's gubernatorial race to replace term-limited Gov. “We'll be paying attention to whatever tea leaves that may show up in the early voting patterns, but for now, we are upgrading Spanberger's position,” it continued. The University of Virginia-based institute criticized several recent polls that indicate Earle-Sears is closing in on Spanberger, suggesting they are biased in her favor. An Aug. 26 poll from co/efficient showed just a five-point gap between the two candidates, with Spanberger leading 48% to 43%. The Center for Politics argued the two latest polls “arguably stress-tested Spanberger's lead by suggesting an electorate that may be redder than what we will see in November, and she was still ahead.” “To be clear, we also don't necessarily think Spanberger is “actually” leading by considerably more than what these polls show—mid-to-high single digits may very well be where the race is at,” the pollsters added. In Virginia, Spanberger has come under attack from the GOP partly due to her positions on transgender and immigration policy. Sears and Youngkin have criticized the Democratic candidate for not supporting the Laken Riley Act, which targets illegal immigrants accused of committing violent crimes for swift deportation after one such man was convicted of murdering a Georgia nursing student. And Spanberger has also been pressured to support the federal government's push to mandate bathroom use on the basis of biological sex instead of gender identity. The matter has become a front-and-center issue in several Virginia counties, including Loudoun County, as multiple school districts refuse the Trump administration's request to reform transgender bathroom policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? There's a nationwide movement, Wait Until 8th, that argues that devices should be kept out of kids' hands until they're deep into middle school. “The kids have always had phones — since they were 3,” he told me a few months ago. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Introducing the device into his children's lives was an incredibly intentional process, akin to putting a series of training wheels on a bike. “It's designed so that everything about technology is a conversation,” he said. Przybylski didn't take an iPhone out of the box, connect it to the internet, and let his children start downloading apps. Giving phones to toddlers is a counterintuitive idea, and that's putting it lightly. However, once you come to terms with the fact that these devices are also a vital tool in an increasingly tech-dependent world, the concept of teaching kids how to live with a phone from an early age — with guardrails, of course — makes perfect sense. Thirty-five states have laws or rules restricting or outright banning phones in schools to address a converging set of problems, including cyberbullying, classroom distraction, and the youth mental health crisis. Social media use, specifically, has been linked to depression and anxiety in kids. Parents and teens actually agree that social media in particular is a threat to mental health. It's even driving parents to sign pledges that they'll hold out and not buy their kid a phone until eighth grade. Critics like Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, have a point that kids and parents are completely outgunned by tech giants pushing addictive products onto kids. They're also correct that many solutions to keep kids safe, like better age verification, create new problems. But trying to keep kids away from smartphones, one of the most ubiquitous devices in the world today, is a fool's errand. Many parents — even those that signed pledges — have tried and failed. More than anything, teaching kids how to safely use technology is a good idea. Phones are a fact of life in the 21st century, and even if you try to keep them away from your kids, their friends will get devices, possibly without any safeguards, before you know it. Meanwhile, there's also growing evidence that screen time can be a good thing, especially when parents are directly involved. It's never too soon to teach digital literacy, if only so that children can spot scams and misinformation online, whenever they get access. By turning tech use into a conversation, parents also invite their children to come to them when things online inevitably go sideways. The number of children with devices is growing, too. “The research suggests that that can be effective in encouraging children's digital literacy, encouraging children's agency and exploration, and learning and avoiding the problems of saying, ‘I can use my phone, but you can't have one,'” Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has been studying kids and tech for decades, told me. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. Video calls have long been established as an early, educational screen time activity. A 2013 study found that 2-year-olds learned new verbs by talking to people either in person or on a video call but not by passively watching videos. A later study found that parent participation improved learning even more. As kids get older, though, passively watching videos can be good, too. A seminal study on the effects of Sesame Street found that watching the show in early childhood led to improved school performance. Of course, Sesame Street is created by a nonprofit with the explicit mission to educate kids. The infinite feed of YouTube, with its sometimes uncanny kids' content, is a different animal. The American Psychological Association said last year that features like endless scrolling and infinite feeds are “particularly risky” to young people, whose brains aren't as easily able to stop scrolling or watching and may become more distractible as a result. Creating playlists of music or videos and selecting specific audiobooks or podcasts is akin to putting training wheels on that corner of the internet. The most important part of that process is talking to kids about what they're watching or listening to, and eventually, discussing how platforms like YouTube and Spotify work. That includes explaining how dark patterns and algorithmic feeds can compel them to keep consuming content. “With some new boundaries and communication and approaches to content, parents can shift things in the right direction,” said Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School who coaches families on intentional approaches to tech use. “These tech companies don't deserve to occupy so much of our family's time and space.” These tech companies are also acutely aware of the very public perception that their products harm kids. That's why we've seen the introduction of things like YouTube Kids and Instagram Teen Accounts, which offer more parental controls but still profit from capturing the attention of children. The least parents could do is empower those kids with digital literacy skills so that they gain an understanding of how these powerful platforms work. The more I think about it, giving them their own smartphone to start the process at an early age — and talk to them about it constantly — is a great first step. You could argue that middle school, when many kids are deep in the throes of puberty, is the worst time for them to gain access to everything a smartphone can do. It's hard to imagine keeping phones out of kids' hands until an arbitrary age and then expecting them to develop a healthy relationship with the device overnight. “The goal is absolutely to think about how we can foster healthy, meaningful use of technology early on,” said Eisha Buch, who oversees the digital citizenship program at Common Sense. “Because those skills and the mindsets ideally are there to stay and stick with them for when they are 16 or 18 or whenever they've left the house and the parent isn't there to guide them.” Something that struck me when I started to imagine doing this for my own family is remembering the order in which I gained access to digital tools in the '90s. Then, I had an iPod, and eventually a flip phone. When I pick up my phone today, I still think of it primarily as a device that does helpful things like take pictures, play music, and connect me with family and friends. Admittedly, my phone has also turned into a way to waste time, thumbing through feeds or watching videos, and even my adult brain struggles to stop doing that. They should engage with their kid about tech, release oversight sequentially, and give the kid tools to handle challenges or talk to a parent when they're in trouble. “The worst outcome is a child who needs help from an adult but can't go to their parents because they don't have the trust that their parent is going to do something that's really going to help them,” Bickham said. One of the first sentences many toddlers learn is, “I need help.” If a parent wants to be seen as helpful when it comes to technology, making themselves available early on seems smart. Even in the near future, when we'll be able to talk to AI agents in our glasses, smartphones will remain ubiquitous. This generation of parents, who mostly grew up in the '80s and '90s, have a unique opportunity to ease their kids into this tech-filled world and to help them develop a healthy relationship with that tech. Personally, I'll take the years-long head start that comes with starting sooner rather than later. A version of this story was also published in the User Friendly newsletter.

Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” — but doesn't want you to see a report that could do just that. Most Americans still don't know that alcohol can cause cancer — and the alcohol industry is working hard to make sure it stays that way. For the past three years, the industry, aided by its allies in Congress and later the Trump administration, has sought to discredit and eventually bury a major analysis that offers new evidence of the link between drinking alcohol and getting sick and dying from various causes, including cancer. This year, Gallup recorded a historic low in the percentage of US adults who drink: 54 percent, down from 67 percent in 2022. Surveys have found that while the percentage of Americans who know that alcohol is a carcinogen has been rising, it is still below 50 percent. The alcohol study's results were intended to inform those guidelines. … Look at all this evidence we have,” Priscilla Martinez, deputy scientific director of the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute and one of the co-authors, told me in an interview. But after the authors submitted their final report to Trump's health department in March and never saw it again, Reuters reported in June, citing anonymous sources, that the new dietary guidelines would eliminate any specific recommended limits on alcohol consumption. “I think it's a shame,” said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and another co-author. “Anyone who is a decision-making authority, you want them to have all of the information.” It is another example of the Trump administration seeming to work against the best interest of public health — despite allying itself closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again movement. But neither Kennedy, who has been in addiction recovery himself for decades, nor the broader movement has seemed to make reducing alcohol consumption a priority. Instead, the Trump administration will not release a report that would actually show just how harmful to people's health drinking alcohol can be, the latest in a series of decisions that could actually leave Americans less healthy. “People are going to get sick who might have avoided getting sick, because they might have decreased their drinking,” Martinez said. For this story, I spoke with three of the six authors of the study: Martinez, Keyes, and co-author Tim Naimi, an alcohol researcher affiliated with the University of Victoria and Boston University. They not only reviewed a wide range of observational studies, but they also ran data through a statistical model based on the US population, specifically to estimate the mortality effects of alcohol for Americans. They broke out their findings by different drinking levels — from one drink per day to three — and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. The general finding that the health risks from alcohol start at low levels of drinking and increase significantly for people who drink more is consistent with previous research, as I covered in a story earlier this year. Public health experts broadly agree that heavy drinking is bad for your health; the debate has been over moderate amounts of drinking. There is another issue that continues to complicate the debate: Lay people may have an inflated definition of what “moderate” drinking means compared to their doctor or a scientist, which could lead to people putting their health at risk even if they don't think of themselves as heavy drinkers. In that context, the report is a harrowing read: Alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer — colorectal, breast cancer in women, liver, oral, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Risk for these cancers increases with any alcohol use and continues to grow with higher levels of use, the study's authors concluded. Women experience a higher risk of an alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed than men. Amid all of the public discourse about alcohol and its health effects, here was a clear and authoritative summary of the evidence that would be most relevant to Americans. It was, its authors told me, consistent with the scientific consensus at this time. “Nothing we're saying is all that surprising or controversial to those of us who know the field,” Keyes said. Every five years, the federal government reviews the nation's dietary guidelines and issues new ones that reflect the current best consensus among scientists about what we should eat, how much of it we should eat, and what we should avoid eating and drinking to lead a healthy life. US officials always solicit expert opinion as they prepare a fresh set of dietary guidelines. Ahead of drafting the new guidance for 2025, the Biden administration began considering in February 2022 whether to take a different approach to more thoroughly review alcohol's health effects ahead of the 2025 dietary guidelines being developed and released. By April 2022, HHS had decided to launch a new review of the science on alcohol and health, called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study — the research Trump's administration has yet to release — to be conducted by an outside expert panel. That analysis would be submitted to Congress as part of an annual report on underage drinking, and it would be shared with USDA and HHS to consider for the 2025 dietary guidelines. It makes sense why the federal government would launch an effort like this. The negative health effects of alcohol have been getting more and more attention, and research continues to link drinking even in moderate amounts to cancer, liver disease, and mental health problems. The World Health Organization declared in 2023 that no amount of drinking could be considered safe. It was time to take a hard look at American drinking. But almost immediately, controversy was already brewing around the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. In December 2022, several months after HHS had decided to launch the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, Congress included a provision in a routine government spending bill: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine should undertake its own study of alcohol's health effects and submit that as the basis for the 2025 dietary guidelines. Two of the initial co-authors for that report were removed after objections over their reported connections to the alcohol industry. Keyes told me that she believed she had been criticized for, in effect, describing the findings of various alcohol-related studies. “When I read criticism of my involvement in the committee, and it was described as a conflict of interest, the conflict was that I had accurately described scientific research in the media,” Keyes said. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill waded into the fight. In March 2024, Congress tucked a provision into another omnibus spending bill that instructed HHS and USDA to consider the National Academies report when writing the alcohol guidelines. Representatives from states including Kentucky and California — where whiskey and wine are important cultural exports, respectively — sent letters to HHS in April 2024 and again that September, criticizing the Alcohol Intake and Health Study for being duplicative of the National Academies report — even though the former was commissioned by the government first. (HHS said at the time that it would not be duplicative but complementary.) Both groups of researchers continued to assemble their reports as the public relations war raged. But when it came time to publish their findings, they had very different experiences. A draft version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study was posted on January 15, just days before Trump's second inauguration and around the same time that then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recommended that alcohol come with cancer warning labels; you can still find it online here. This is the process for most government reports: The authors put together a draft, the initial findings are released for public comment, stakeholders submit their takes, and then the authors will take those comments into consideration and revise their report for its final publication. But that didn't happen with the Alcohol Intake and Health Study. They sent that final report to the Trump administration in March. Vox contacted HHS with a detailed list of questions about the Alcohol Intake and Health Study and why it hasn't been released, as well as Kennedy's general perspective on alcohol and health. The agency sent a brief comment in response: “This information has been provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Guidelines,” an HHS spokesperson said. Some of the authors still held out hope that the study would be included in the annual report on underage drinking that is required by federal law to be submitted to Congress and is expected later this year. But then in August, those hopes were shattered: According to all three co-authors, they were told that the Trump administration did not intend to publish the study in any form and would not include it in the upcoming congressional report on underage drinking. (The authors are currently working, as they always planned to do, on publishing their findings in an independent academic journal.) Its findings, however, were controversial: It indicated that moderate levels of drinking could actually be beneficial to people, and even the links to cancer, despite ethanol being widely classified as a carcinogen, were limited. Critics said the National Academies report was based on observational studies that can show a correlation between, for example, moderate drinking and cardiovascular health, but don't prove a cause; the National Academies report's authors acknowledged that limitation. As Naimi told me earlier this year, many moderate drinkers may have other attributes — such as higher incomes — that could explain their better health without accounting for alcohol. Critics of the National Academies report also said the authors had used overly restrictive criteria for which research to include, excluding many studies that have found harmful effects from alcohol use. Will it change the dietary guidelines as rumored and eliminate a specific recommended limit on alcohol consumption? The National Academies report would appear to set the stage for such a change, with its industry-preferred messaging that low levels of drinking could make people healthier. ﻿Protecting astronauts in space — and maybe even Mars — will help transform health on Earth.
