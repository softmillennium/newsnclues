A'ja Wilson has been voted as the 2025 WNBA Most Valuable Player, winning the award for a record-breaking fourth time.
    


            The Las Vegas Aces star amassed 51 of 72 first-place votes from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters as she picked up total of 657 points to finish ahead of the Minnesota Lynx's Napheesa Collier (534 points) and Phoenix Mercury forward Alyssa Thomas (391 points).
    


            Having previously been named MVP in 2020, 2022 and 2024, Sunday's announcement means Wilson has surpassed the three awards won by each of Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie and Lauren Jackson.
    


            Remarkably, it also means that Wilson – who was drafted No. 1 overall by the Aces in 2018 – has claimed the award in half of her eight seasons in the WNBA, with last year's won by unanimous vote for the first time since Cynthia Cooper in 1997.
    


            The Aces center was presented with the MVP trophy, designed by Tiffany & Co., on Friday, a video shared by the league showed.
    


            A tearful Wilson was mobbed by her teammates before being commended by WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert.
    


            “Since 2020 when we were in the bubble and I handed you your first one (MVP award), I've admired the way you've lived, your grace, your humility, your humor,” Engelbert said.
    


            “Just one of the greatest players to ever be in this league. A global icon, a global ambassador, not just for our game but all women's sports and all sports.”
    


            The seven-time WNBA All-Star averaged a league-high 23.4 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists in the 2025 regular season, and tied her playoff career high of 38 points on Thursday in a 74-73 win over the Seattle Storm to set up a semifinal clash with the Indiana Fever, which begins in Las Vegas on Sunday.
    


            Having ranked second in the league for blocks, with 92, and third for steals, with 64, Wilson was also named Defensive Player of the Year this week for the third time, sharing the award with Lynx forward Alanna Smith.
    


            She is the Aces all-time leading scorer and had her No. 22 jersey retired in February.
    


            For much of the season, it looked as though Collier was pacing to win her first WNBA MVP award. But her bid was hurt by a seven-game absence following an injury sustained in a win over Wilson's Aces, a layoff that coincided with the start of Las Vegas' 16-game winning streak – during which Wilson averaged 26.1 points and 12.0 rebounds.
    


            Wilson and Collier may yet face off the in the WNBA finals, with the Lynx set to begin their own best-of-five semifinal against the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday.

            Britain, Canada and Australia announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


            The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution.
    


            France and several other countries are expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week, deepening Israel's isolation and putting them at odds with Israel's key partner, the United States.
    


            In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.
    


            More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel's offensive in Gaza.
    


            In the first of a series of apparently coordinated announcements Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on X his country “recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel.”
    


            “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before the announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.”
    


            Carney had said in July that his country would recognize the State of Palestine at the UNGA, drawing immediate condemnation from Israeli officials and the US, with President Donald Trump saying it could hurt Canada in trade talks.
    


            The announcement by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes good on his pledge in July to recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel met certain conditions, which included agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to the prospect of a two-state solution.
    


            Since Starmer issued his ultimatum, Israel has moved to take control of Gaza City and expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and has repeated its opposition to a two-state solution.
    


            “In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for countries to join France in announcing their recognition at UNGA. Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino are among other governments planning to recognize a Palestinian state this week.
    


            Israel has furiously condemned the moves, saying they will reward and embolden Hamas for its October 7, 2023, terror attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another roughly 250 taken hostage.
    


            Israel's subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinian people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. A growing number of international scholars and bodies say Israel's war constitutes genocide, an accusation that the Israeli government has vehemently denied.
    


            Far-right members of the Israeli government responded to the announcements Sunday by urging Netanyahu to annex the occupied West Bank.
    


            Meanwhile, Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, told CNN that today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”
    


Western recognition won't change the reality on the ground: A Palestinian state has never seemed further away



            Despite the growing momentum to recognize Palestine, there are roadblocks to it becoming a full UN member.
    


            The path to become a full member requires at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council to vote in favor, and none of the five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the US – to veto it. The US would be expected to wield its veto power if the issue came before the Security Council.
    


            Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to recognize a Palestinian state, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation.
    


            And other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Canada and the UK are the first G7 countries to recognize Palestine, but fellow members Japan, Italy and Germany oppose the move.

            • Massive memorial service: Huge crowds of mourners have made their way inside a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, for the funeral of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month. Worship music is playing and seats are dwindling as tens of thousands of supporters pack into the service.
    


            • Trump administration: President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet will speak at the service, prompting extremely tight security. Kirk had a direct line to the president and was a personal friend of many Trump officials.
    


            • Outpouring of grief: Erika Kirk, who is taking the helm at her late husband's organization, Turning Point USA, will also speak. Kirk has said she's anguished at the loss of a loving husband and father and has vowed to continue his work.
    


            State Farm Stadium is at near capacity as attendees have filled the stadium for Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sunday.
    


            Almost all the available seats inside appear to be full just after 9:30 a.m. local time.
    


            More than 200,000 mourners may try to attend the service, a Glendale Police Department spokesperson told CNN.
    


Here's a glimpse inside the stadium: 



                    We have already seen some notable names in the crowd today, including several lawmakers, conservative influencers and Republican officials. There are various levels of access, including “floor” passes and VIP access, aside from the general admission. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            A number of Trump administration officials and Cabinet members who will speak at Charlie Kirk's memorial have both publicly and privately credited the conservative activist for their current positions.
    


            Kirk took an active role during Donald Trump's transition ahead of the president's second term, temporarily moving his family down to Florida and helping vet the officials.
    


            Many of these officials had Kirk on speed dial and would text with him on a regular basis until his death, sources told CNN.
    


            Trump, who will be the final speaker Sunday, has publicly lauded Kirk for helping him win over youth voters in 2024, which the president and his advisers believed helped him secure the election.
    


Vice President JD Vance, a close friend of Kirk's, will also speak at his memorial. Vance has credited Kirk with bringing him into the MAGA fold, helping him win his Senate campaign in Ohio and ultimately convincing Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., that Vance had truly come to support Trump. Trump Jr. played an enormous role in convincing the president that Vance was the right pick for VP.
    


Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth privately credited Kirk with getting him confirmed in the Senate. During what was a contentious confirmation process, one of the greatest hurdles to Hegseth's nomination was GOP Sen. Joni Ernst. Kirk launched an active campaign against Ernst, threatening to primary her and getting his large following on board.
    


            Trump's health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said Kirk was a leading architect of Kennedy's endorsement of Trump and crucial to him getting his Cabinet position. Sources said Kirk stressed the importance of Kennedy's “Make America Healthy Again” movement to Trump's team and how the former independent presidential candidate would open new avenues of voters to Trump.
    


            Kirk called getting Kennedy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed “mission critical.” Kirk used his enormous platform to promote Gabbard, who will also speak today. Kirk privately called senators and their associates when it looked as though she might not make it through the confirmation process, a source told CNN at the time.
    


            Here's another look at the crowds outside State Farm Stadium, where many tens of thousands of mourners will honor Charlie Kirk at today's memorial service:

                    Almost all available seats inside State Farm Stadium now appear full a little after 9:30 a.m. local time. There hasn't been official word that the venue is at capacity, but it certainly looks from the floor as if there aren't any more seats in the designated sections. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            Today's crowd is full of young adults who felt connected to Charlie Kirk, who began building Turning Point USA — the most influential young conservative organization in the country — when he was still a teenager.
    


            “He was willing for conversation. I think we've lost the desire to converse with opposite views … and I think Charlie really came and tried to bridge that gap,” said Karla Soto Perez, a student at Grand Canyon University who left campus at 2 a.m. to get to the stadium.
    


            “We are all humans and we're all created in the image of God and we all have something to say,” she said, summing up Kirk's faith-driven message. “And that's so important.”
    


            Her friend Emily Blumenschein said she felt compelled to attend today's service to show solidarity with Kirk's message.
    


            “I feel like our generation, especially for what he did for us, the least we can do is show up and to show that we stand with Christianity and for the truth and to support him and his family,” she said.
    


            Luke Bravo, from Fresno, California, said Kirk's assassination hit him hard.
    


            “It was like a brother in Christ was shot and killed, and I felt like a member of the family and it was really hard,” he said.
    


            He said he was looking forward to hearing in particular from Erika Kirk — who was named CEO of Turning Point and is poised to take on a significant profile in conservative politics.
    


            Starting early this morning, we saw huge crowds forming outside State Farm Stadium. As soon as the doors open, they filed in to Charlie Kirk's memorial service — but even as seats began to fill up, it feels on the ground like it barely made a dent on the still-growing number of mourners outside.
    


Here's another look at the scenes in Glendale, Arizona:



                    The hours before the service gets underway have the feel of a megachurch service, with worship music pulsing through the stadium and attendees on their feet raising their hands in praise. Almost all of the people I've spoken to here have mentioned Charlie Kirk's Christian faith as a reason they were drawn to him and motivated to come to today's memorial. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            While tens of thousands of people gather to memorialize Charlie Kirk, his Turning Point USA group is taking an opportunity to organize.
    


            In the hours before the official program begins, volunteers are walking through the concourse at State Farm Stadium with clipboards to help register voters.
    


            Attendees were also handed flyers for America Fest 2025, TPUSA's annual conference in December, with discount codes to attend.
    


            Turning Point USA was a major organizing force in President Donald Trump's reelection, pouring millions of dollars into the battleground state of Arizona, and many hope their work will continue in the wake of Kirk's passing.
    


            As many pile into State Farm Stadium on Sunday morning, CNN spoke to some attendees about what it means to them to be at Charlie Kirk's memorial service.
    


            “I wanted to be here to honor him and his life and his family, what he stood for,” Pamela Milton told CNN.
    


            Milton flew from California to attend the service. She said she arrived at the stadium around 5 a.m. local time and got inside about three hours later.
    


            Clifford Craig also arrived early, at around 2:30 a.m. local time.
    


            When asked about why he decided to attend the service, Craig told CNN, “To show my love and support for America and Charlie Kirk.”
    


            Craig described hearing the news of Kirk's death as devastating and “like losing a brother.”
    


            “I'd really like to hear positive influence, how we're going to move forward with unity and help bring this country back together, what it should be,” Craig said.
    


            Other attendees shared similar words about their hopes for the service and said they are happy to be in attendance to honor Kirk.
    


                    The venue is rapidly filling. The first and second tiers of seating are now full, and the uppermost level is beginning to look full as well. Lines of attendees continue to snake through the stadium as people find their seats. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            Ballistic glass surrounds the podium at Charlie Kirk's memorial service today inside Arizona's State Farm Stadium, where a high-profile lineup of speakers — including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance — are set to take the stage.
    


            The glass-secured podium, positioned front and center, reflects security measures now standard at grand and open-space events featuring the president, especially after last year's assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    


            CNN has reported on the heightened security operation for the massive event.
    


            President Donald Trump briefly spoke with reporters before he departed for Charlie Kirk's memorial in Arizona.
    


            The president answered questions about Russia's recent breaches of NATO allies' airspace and the Department of Justice potentially prosecuting several political foes.



Here's what he said: 



Defense of Poland and Baltic states from Russia: Trump told reporters he would defend the countries from Russia if necessary. “Yeah, I would,” he told reporters while leaving the White House for Arizona to attend Kirk's memorial service. Trump's comments come after breaches over the airspaces of several NATO member countries in the past week.
    


Pressure on Justice Department: “Pam Bondi is doing a great job,” he told reporters. “I think Pam Bondi is going to go down as one of the best attorney generals of the ages.” The comments come after Trump in a social media post Saturday put pressure on Bondi to bring criminal charges against several political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump suggested in a subsequent post Saturday he does have confidence in Bondi, whom he described as “very careful.”
    


            A Glendale Police Department spokesperson now tells us more than 200,000 may try to attend today's memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk — double the previous estimate of 100,000.
    


            Over 200,000 people have registered for the event on Turning Point USA's website, Jose Santiago told CNN today.
    


That would easily exceed the available seats: State Farm Stadium has capacity for more than 63,000 people, according to its website, with the ability to expand to accommodate an additional 10,000.
    


            Desert Diamond Arena, which will serve as an overflow site, has a seating capacity of around 19,000.
    


            State Farm Stadium is beginning to fill with what is expected to be many tens of thousands of mourners ahead of the service's official start.
    


            The atmosphere is far from that of a typical funeral. Attendees, many of whom have been waiting since the early morning hours to get inside, are mostly wearing red, white and blue — as suggested by organizers — with virtually no one coming in black.
    


            The crowd spans a range of ages, from teenagers to older folks. I've seen many families with young children as well.
    


            Right now, Christian musicians are on stage playing worship music as the crowd continues to arrive. Many in the crowd are standing and raising their hands to the music.
    


            Already, the first tier of seats appears mostly full. People are beginning to take seats in the second tier.
    


                    The streets of Glendale are gridlocked for miles. Streams of attendees — many wearing apparel with Charlie Kirk's likeness — are parking miles away and walking to the stadium. As a long procession of motorcycles donning American flags wove through the congestion, many motorists stepped out of their vehicles and applauded, with some yelling, “God bless America!” — Josh Campbell, Glendale, Arizona






            Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, who is accused of killing prominent conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, with aggravated murder and announced they would seek the death penalty.
    


            The charging document for the 22-year-old suspect outlines evidence collected by investigators, including DNA on the suspected murder weapon and a texted confession.
    


Here's what you should know:



            The charging document says Robinson “intentionally” targeted Kirk because of Robinson's “belief or perception regarding Charlie Kirk's political expression.”
    


            In addition to aggravated murder, prosecutors outlined six other charges against Robinson.
    


            He faces two charges of obstruction of justice after concealing or removing “the firearm used to shoot Charlie Kirk,” and after he allegedly “destroyed, concealed, or removed the clothing he wore during the shooting,” according to the document.
    


            Robinson also faces one count of felony discharge of a firearm and one count commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.
    


            Prosecutors presented two charges of witness tampering for directing his roommate to delete “incriminating” text messages and to stay silent if questioned by police, the court filing states.
    


            Read here for a full rundown of the key takeaways.
    


            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have vowed to go after Democrats and liberal organizations in the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, describing their actions as retribution.
    


            “I think this is right out of the authoritarian playbook,” Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in her first televised interview since the 2024 election. “They're taking a terrible crime, this awful murder of this young man, and they are trying to use it, along with others of their rationales, to go after their political opponents.”
    


            Clinton said the United States has “a violence problem,” pointing to the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home in April.
    


            In such moments, Clinton argued, “leadership should try to bring people together.”
    


            “But instead, we're seeing more of the divisiveness,” the former secretary said.
    


            Asked if ABC's yanking of Jimmy Kimmel's show after apparent pressure from Trump's Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is state censorship, Clinton said it “is a very clear example of that,” adding that free speech must always be protected — not only when it's favorable, which she argued is the Trump administration's approach.
    


            “You defend free speech in terrible times,” Clinton said. “And you defend free speech that is used against holding people in power accountable through satire, humor, barbed attacks. You defend it even when it is offensive.”
    


            CNN is here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where huge crowds of mourners are expected to gather for the funeral of Charlie Kirk.
    


            This video from a short time ago shows a line already stretching across the parking lot as attendees wait to enter the memorial service.
    


            Local authorities have told us they expect as many as 100,000 people to show up at the stadium and an overflow site.
    


            As President Donald Trump left the White House to attend the memorial for Charlie Kirk today in Arizona, he said the service will “celebrate the life of a great man.”
    


            “We want to look at as a time of healing,” Trump said. “That something like this could have happened is not even believable so we will have a very interesting day, a very tough day.”
    


            When asked what message he wants to share with Kirk's family, the president said, “I will just give them my love, there's nothing much you can say.”
    


            “He had a hold on youth because they loved him, they respected him,” Trump said. The service, he added, will highlight Kirk's “tremendous influence for a young man, he did a great job.”
    


            The memorial service for Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners to a football stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
    


            Earlier this week, the president said he will “say a few words” at the ceremony. In addition to the president, Turning Point USA has also said that Vice President JD Vance and Kirk's widow, Erika, will deliver remarks.

The UK, Canada and Australia have formally recognized the State of Palestine. The move comes as more than 140 world leaders are preparing to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly summit in New York next week, which will be dominated by questions regarding the region.

Canada was the first of these countries to officially recognize Palestine on Sunday, with Prime Minister Mark Carney announcing that Ottawa “recognizes the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel.”

The move was shortly followed by similar announcements from Australia and the UK.

“Australia's recognition of Palestine today, alongside Canada and the United Kingdom, is part of a co-ordinated international effort to build new momentum for a two-state solution, starting with a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages taken in the atrocities of October 7, 2023,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said in a joint statement.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the decision is intended to “revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution,” adding “I state clearly, as prime minister of this great country, that the United Kingdom formally recognizes the state of Palestine,” in a video statement posted on social media.

Earlier in September, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a resolution calling for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. In opposing the measure, Washington and West Jerusalem were only joined by eight other countries, including the remote Pacific island nations of Palau, Tonga, Micronesia and Nauru.

In prior decisions, the UN had limited itself to condemning the Hamas attack on Israel, in which the militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza.

The subsequent Israeli siege of Gaza has left nearly 65,000 Palestinians dead so far, according to local health authorities, and produced a devastating humanitarian situation in the enclave, leading to mounting international pressure on West Jerusalem to end its campaign.

Many countries have since condemned the war and a number have chosen to acknowledge Palestinian statehood. At the upcoming UNGA session, France and Belgium are expected to follow suit and formally recognize the country.

Moscow views a two-state solution as the only way to deescalate and end the Gaza War. As the legal successor to the Soviet Union, Russia has long recognized the State of Palestine.

US President Donald Trump has threatened unspecified reprisals if the Taliban government in Afghanistan fails to hand over Bagram Air Base.

American troops hastily evacuated the base in July 2021, a month before Taliban fighters seized Kabul, toppling the UN-backed government and ending the 20-year US occupation of the country.

Trump said earlier that he is seeking to reestablish control over the airfield, which he has described as being close to China's nuclear facilities.

“If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.

The Taliban has ruled out the return of American forces, while China backed Afghanistan's sovereignty and accused Washington of “stirring up tension and confrontation in the region.”

Although Trump negotiated the withdrawal of his country's troops during his first term, he went on to blame the collapse of the UN-recognized government and rapid Taliban takeover on former US President Joe Biden, calling the chaotic departure of the last American soldiers “a disgrace.”

Originally built by the Soviet Union, the Bagram airfield was modernized and expanded during the US occupation, serving as America's largest outpost in Afghanistan. Trump has repeatedly claimed that China is secretly using the base, a charge denied by both Beijing and the Taliban.

Golden light spills over endless rows of vines, and the hum of harvest fills the valleys of California. For weeks every fall, the land turns into a symphony of baskets, presses, and fermenting grapes – the heartbeat of an industry that now makes the United States the world's fourth-largest wine producer and its biggest consumer. Ninety percent of that comes from California alone, a state that has become synonymous with fine wine.

This success story began not with the land, but with a man. Behind Napa's rise stood an unlikely figure: a Russian émigré who fled revolution, crossed Europe, and brought Old World science to the New. His name was Andre Tchelistcheff – the godfather of American winemaking.

When Andre Tchelistcheff arrived in California in the late 1930s, he found a land with perfect soil and sunshine but a winemaking industry in ruins. Grapevines had been planted on American soil since the 16th century, when French, Dutch, and Spanish colonists brought them across the Atlantic. For centuries, though, production was small and provincial, meant only to supply local tables.

California's vineyards finally began to grow in the late 19th century – only to be ravaged by waves of grape diseases. Then came Prohibition. Between 1920 and 1933, the industry collapsed almost entirely. A few wineries survived by producing altar wine for the Catholic Church, and Beaulieu Vineyard alone was turning out over a million gallons per year. But these were rare exceptions.

By the time Prohibition was repealed, American wine was a shadow of its former self. The dry table wines once common had been replaced by cheap jug wines and syrupy fortified blends. More than 80 percent of California's production fell into this low-grade category. One critic of the era put it bluntly:

“It's better to drink beer than California wine.”

This was the state of Napa Valley on the eve of Tchelistcheff's arrival.

Andre Tchelistcheff was born in Moscow in 1901, into a noble family whose lineage stretched back to the fifteenth century. His youth was shattered by the October Revolution and the Civil War. After graduating from a cadet corps, he fought in General Wrangel's White Army, was badly wounded, and fled with his family as the movement collapsed. Like many Russian émigrés, they began a long journey through Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia before finally settling in Europe.

In Prague, Tchelistcheff studied agronomy and trained at the legendary Tokaji vineyards in neighboring Hungary. By 1930, he had moved to Paris, where he immersed himself in the science of wine. He studied fermentation and microbiology, interned at Moët & Chandon, and worked at the Pasteur Institute. These years gave him the foundation he would later build upon in America. As he liked to say, “When I think about wine, I switch from English to French.”

By the late 1930s, his reputation was growing. Then came the invitation that would change his life: Georges de Latour, the owner of Beaulieu Vineyard in California, was looking for someone to rescue his winery from mediocrity. Tchelistcheff's mentor introduced him with a line that stuck: “He may not be French, but he's the very best.”

California in the 1930s had everything nature could offer a winemaker – sun-drenched valleys, fertile soils, and a Mediterranean climate. What it lacked was craft. When Tchelistcheff first set foot in Napa, he was stunned by what he found. Cellars were stiflingly hot, presses were cooled by dumping in blocks of ice, and equipment stood rusting in the corners. Hygiene was almost nonexistent: workers didn't wash their hands, larvae bred in barrels, and dead rats were even left floating in fermentation tanks.

For a man trained in the rigor of the Pasteur Institute, it was a shock. Yet the contrast went beyond winemaking. Tchelistcheff was every inch a European aristocrat – always immaculately dressed, precise in his manners, addressing men as “my dear sir” and women as “madam.” In remote Napa, this refinement made him an object of ridicule. His young son was even beaten up at school for wearing a French-style uniform.

It was into this unlikely environment – a land of promise wrapped in provincial roughness – that Andre Tchelistcheff began his American experiment.

Tchelistcheff's first act in California was simple but radical: he demanded order. The barrels were scrubbed clean, the cellars cooled, and the old rusty equipment replaced with stainless steel tanks and enamel-lined pipes. It was the first time such technology had been used in Napa Valley, and the effect was immediate: the wines no longer carried the metallic tang of rust.

He introduced cold fermentation for white wines and malolactic fermentation for reds – practices that would later become standard worldwide. He drastically reduced the use of sulfur dioxide, which had been added to Californian wines in reckless quantities. Local workers could hardly believe it; one foreman even suggested dumping in a whole bucket of the chemical “just in case.”

At the same time, he turned to the vineyards. California was then dominated by high-yield grapes good for bulk wine but useless for quality. Tchelistcheff pushed for Cabernet Sauvignon, convinced that Napa's soil and climate could rival the Old World's best. After overcoming resistance from the vineyard's owners, he finally got his way.

The result was the Georges de Latour Private Reserve. By the 1940s, it had become a symbol of American fine wine, poured at White House receptions and recognized as California's first truly world-class vintage.

No single winemaker, however brilliant, could transform an entire industry alone. Tchelistcheff's true legacy came through his students.

After Georges de Latour's death, Beaulieu Vineyard passed into the hands of corporate owners more interested in profits than in quality. Frustrated by marketing gimmicks and budget cuts, Tchelistcheff left the winery in 1973 after more than twenty-five years. It turned out to be a turning point. As an independent consultant, he became a mentor to a new generation of California winemakers.

Unlike many in his field, Tchelistcheff never hoarded his knowledge. He was exacting in standards, generous in teaching, and utterly devoted to the craft.

But his vision reached beyond Napa. Studying the soils of the Pacific Northwest, he saw that Cabernet Sauvignon could thrive in Washington, while Pinot Gris would do well in Oregon. With his guidance, his nephew Alexander Golitsyn – another Russian aristocrat in exile – founded Quilceda Creek Winery, later hailed as one of America's finest producers of Cabernet. Tchelistcheff also advised Chateau Ste. Michelle, steering it toward Gewürztraminer, Semillon, and Riesling, which put Washington State on the wine map.

By the late 1970s, his influence spanned the entire American West. Tchelistcheff earned the title of “America's most influential winemaker since the Prohibition,” or simply “The Maestro” – the man who gave the United States not just great wines, but a wine culture.

For centuries, French winemakers dismissed the New World as incapable of true greatness. But in 1976, that certainty was shattered. British wine merchant Steven Spurrier organized a blind tasting in Paris, pitting French classics against upstart California wines.

To the astonishment of the judges – and humiliation of Bordeaux and Burgundy – the winners were from Napa Valley: a Cabernet from Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and a Chardonnay from Chateau Montelena. Both had been made by Tchelistcheff's students. For the first time in history, American wines outscored the French in their own capital.

News of the upset reached Tchelistcheff while he was touring Bordeaux. Ever the diplomat, he told his assistant not to mention it to their hosts: “If we tell them right now, the French might take offense – and after all, we're their guests.”

The so-called “Judgment of Paris” became a turning point in global wine history. It was proof that the New World could rival, and even surpass, the Old – and Tchelistcheff's fingerprints were all over the victory.

Even in his later years, Tchelistcheff remained restless. In the early 1980s he returned to Europe, not as a refugee but as a master, sought out by winemakers across the continent. One of them was Lodovico Antinori, scion of a dynasty that had been making wine in Tuscany since the fourteenth century.

Antinori wanted to plant Cabernet Sauvignon in the coastal soils of Bolgheri. After studying the land, Tchelistcheff disagreed. Merlot, he argued, would thrive there. Their debate became almost comic: Antinori crossed out “Merlot” on the vineyard map and scribbled “Cabernet,” while Tchelistcheff crossed it back again. In the end, the Russian émigré prevailed.

The result was Masseto, a bold Merlot that stunned the wine world. Today it is considered one of Italy's most prized and expensive wines – a legacy born not in Florence or Bordeaux, but from the instincts of an old exile from Moscow.

Despite his fame, wealth, and influence, Tchelistcheff never owned a vineyard of his own. Friends urged him to, but he always refused. “I am a child of revolution,” he explained.

“I know what it means to lose everything overnight. I don't have a cellar, I don't have a vineyard, I have nothing. All I have is my mind.”

Then, with a smile, he would add: “Well, maybe also a dozen bottles under my bed.”

Andre Tchelistcheff died in Napa Valley in 1994, at the age of ninety-two – the place where he had arrived as an outsider and which he helped turn into one of the world's great wine regions. To generations of winemakers, he remained simply The Maestro: the Russian émigré who gave America a wine culture and, in doing so, proved that the New World could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Old.

TEHRAN, September 21. /TASS/. Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be suspended due to actions by the ""E3"" (the United Kingdom, Germany, and France) aimed at restoring UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) of the Islamic Republic announced.

""Despite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' cooperation with the Agency and the submission of plans to resolve the crisis, cooperation with the Agency will be suspended in connection with the actions of the European countries,"" Tasnim news agency cited the statement.

It was noted that even amid the suspension of cooperation, Iran's Foreign Ministry is recommended to continue consultations with the IAEA within the framework of SNSC decisions to protect national interests.

On August 28, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France initiated the snapback mechanism to restore UN Security Council sanctions on Iran. On Friday, the Security Council rejected a resolution calling for the non-restoration of the sanctions regime against Iran. In the vote, Russia, China, Algeria, and Pakistan supported the resolution. Nine members, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, voted against it, while two members abstained.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LONDON, September 21. /TASS/. Nearly 90% of British citizens do not support London's upcoming recognition of Palestinian statehood, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing a JL Partners survey.

The poll, conducted between August 19 and 31 among 2,118 respondents, found that 87% opposed the unconditional recognition of a Palestinian state, while only 13% expressed their backing.

Support for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision was lowest among opposition parties, with just 6% of Conservative voters and 8% of Reform UK voters in favor. Among Labour supporters, only 11% backed the move.

The survey also showed that 51% of respondents oppose recognition while Hamas remains in power, and 40% said recognition should come only after Hamas agrees to a ceasefire and releases Israeli hostages. Seventeen percent rejected recognition under any circumstances.

According to the BBC and Sky News, Starmer will announce the decision on September 21. Critics argue that the move would undermine London's ability to influence both Israel and Hamas.

On July 29, the prime minister's office warned it would recognize Palestine before the start of the UN General Assembly session in September if Israel continued to block humanitarian aid to Gaza and did not end its military operation in the enclave. Amid the escalating conflict, the Foreign Office later confirmed that recognition would proceed in September. The high-level week of the UN General Assembly will run from September 23 to 27, as well as on September 29.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

ENERGODAR /Zaporozhye region/, September 21. /TASS/. The plan for the potential transition of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) into power generation mode is being successfully implemented, including addressing the most critical issues - ensuring sufficient water for reactor cooling and securing external energy supply, ZNPP Director Yuri Chernichuk told TASS.

""Work is proceeding across all elements of the plan. In areas such as staffing and licensing, progress is more visible. As for other aspects, they are not yet as obvious, but work is underway in every direction. This includes the most frequently discussed issues, including ensuring the plant's power supply, maintaining the transmission lines required for generation, hydrotechnical facilities, and keeping water levels adequate for the plant's operation. Work is being carried out across all these areas,"" Chernichuk said.

On February 18, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev told TASS that, under his directive, a major program was being prepared for bringing ZNPP back online. He later noted that the state corporation had already drawn up a comprehensive plan for the phased commissioning of the plant, which is currently under review by the Russian government. At the same time, Likhachev emphasized that the program could only be carried out once military threats from Ukrainian forces are removed.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Changes to regulatory or information environments will help states decouple from federal health recommendations

Seven US states and the nation's largest city announced this week that they have formed the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, in an effort to strengthen the region's health guidance as the national health landscape fractures. Maryland announced they would join the alliance on Friday.

As national health agencies revisit their recommendations, including high-profile restrictions on the updated Covid shots and the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the pressure is increasingly falling on states to navigate recommendations and new federal rules.

“I definitely see a future where there is considerable state-level variability on vaccine policy, much like we have seen in the abortion space,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and former senior adviser for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

There were already some access issues with vaccines, especially for people who have been marginalized. “But in general, it didn't matter where you lived,” said Jen Kates, senior vice-president at the health non-profit KFF. “Now it does.”

And while Covid shots were the first to be restricted, policies could also change on other shots – as with the MMRV restrictions proposed on Thursday.

“The area where it could really have a dramatic impact, is what might change with the kids' [routine vaccination schedule],” Kates said.

The new alliance – among Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York state and New York City, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island – has been collaborating for months, including a meeting in August to discuss emergency preparedness, vaccine purchasing, lab capacity and more.

The West Coast Health Alliance, a similar organization led by the governors of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii, issued their first winter vaccine recommendation on Wednesday, encouraging residents to stay up to date on vaccines against Covid, flu and RSV.

In the past, the federal government funded much of the public health work done at state, local, territorial and tribal levels, and has worked as a “norm setter” by offering the best available evidence and public health practices, Kates said.

The states would then make decisions on, for instance, which vaccines are required for school attendance and whether they offer non-medical exemptions.

States also regulate pharmacists, deciding whether a pharmacist can vaccinate someone without a prescription or administer vaccinations to kids. And states regulate a subset of health insurers operating within their jurisdictions.

Several states have laws that pharmacists can administer vaccines, and that insurers must cover them, when they're recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Now, amid delays on recommendations and concerns that federal information may not be based on evidence or data, “they are scrambling to change their regulatory or information environments to be decoupled from the federal recommendation to the extent that they can”, Kates said.

“It's a pretty dramatic thing. It's happened very quickly,” Kates said. Several states have already moved to allow pharmacists to administer a Covid vaccine without a prescription and to require insurance coverage of the shots, and some have implemented broader language to potentially apply to other vaccines.

“It is going to create a very different environment, and it's already happening.”

Other states are considering new restrictions to their vaccination policies. Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, promised the state would soon end vaccine mandates for school attendance, though no law has been proposed to amend those mandates.

Idaho has the highest non-medical exemption rate in the country, and the state tried to pass a law earlier this year ending mandates, though that part of the law was ultimately removed.

West Virginia's senate passed a bill in February to expand non-medical exemptions, and Texas passed a bill making it easier to avoid vaccine mandates in May.

Some states, without changing any of their laws, might restrict access simply by “following exactly what FDA and CDC say”, Kates said.

The result is a patchwork of vaccine rules varying by location – the divided states of America.

The fractures will not be felt equally even among states. Low-income people who don't have a strong relationship with doctors or private insurers will face more barriers to getting prescriptions and paying for shots, for example.

Medical organizations have also broken with official recommendations.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), for example, offers its own guidance on respiratory virus vaccination.

AHIP, the health insurance trade association, announced on Tuesday that members' health plans will “continue to cover all ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025”. Not every major insurer is a member of AHIP.

States can help implement the recommendations of these professional organizations and try to clear roadblocks to access, Jetelina said.

By banding together, states can also share the work of examining scientific evidence and offering recommendations, as well as sharing potential bulk orders and making other collaborative actions.

But one state's policies can have repercussions for the entire nation.

“Infectious diseases don't see state lines,” Jetelina said. “What happens in one state will directly impact people living in other states, especially those that cannot protect themselves because they are too young or too sick to get vaccinated.”

The changes to vaccine recommendations are “stressful”, even for people who try to stay informed, and “it contributes to this ecosystem of mistrust”, Kates said.

“And even for people who want to get a vaccine, the more obstacles that are put up – it's going to deter everybody.”

While vaccine policy is shifting, vaccines remain overwhelmingly popular across the US.

The “vast majority of Americans” – between 80% and 90%, depending on the poll – still favor vaccination, though support has “dramatically shifted” along political lines in recent years, Jetelina said.

Even conservative parents in Florida, for example, support vaccines, according to a new KFF survey.

“They support mandates for going to school. They want their kids to be vaccinated,” Kates said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Murano resident reported children, aged between 12 and 13, to the police

Italy might be a football-loving country but that did not stop police in Venice from pursuing a group of unlikely targets: 14 children who fell foul for playing the game in a public square, leading to fines presented to their parents, in a move that has sparked a debate about the rights of young people to play outdoors.

The children, aged between 12 and 13, were playing football earlier this month in Pino Signoretto square in Murano, an island of about 4,500 inhabitants in the Venetian lagoon, when a resident, annoyed by the noise they were making, reported them to the police.

Police officers then went to the square and identified each child before their parents were summoned and ordered to pay a €50 (£43) fine on their behalf. The children were allegedly playing football in a prohibited area, “creating a disturbance to the public peace and a danger for people in transit”, according to the official notice given to the parents and published in the Italian press.

Antonio Trampus, the father of one of the children, told La Stampa: “My son called me in tears. The police wouldn't listen to reason. They could have called us parents and asked us to take our children home. Instead, they immediately took their names and addresses.”

The fine could rise to as much as €500 if not paid within 60 days. “But we will not pay,” said Trampus, adding that the group was planning to appeal and take the matter up with the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro.

The fines were enforced based on regulations introduced in 2019 banning ball games in certain areas of Venice. In Murano, the only square where the game is permitted is San Bernardo. But the parents argue that Pino Signoretto square was never included in the list of banned areas as it was only recently created after the neighbourhood was redeveloped.

“San Bernardo is not suitable,” said Trampus. “Whereas the other square is. Removing the children there would mean returning it to the state it was in before.”

The case sparked debate in Venice, with local councillor Marco Gasparinetti arguing that the police intervention was disproportionate and questioning the priorities in a city grappling with overtourism, pickpockets and a dwindling local population.

Referring to the parents being summoned to the police station, Gasparinetti wrote on Facebook: “Were they scammers? Pickpockets? Drug dealers? No, they were the parents of [14] children.”

Gasparinetti added that it should have been enough to take the ball away and tell the children to stop playing. “Wouldn't that have been more educational? Common sense and a sense of priority were lacking.”

Corriere del Veneto reported that the children might have been penalised due to their age, because areas where ball games are permitted are exclusive to children under 11.

Paolo Poggi, a retired professional footballer who was born in Venice, also contributed to the debate. “Long live children who spend time outdoors,” he told La Nuova Venezia newspaper. “The rules are sacrosanct, but common sense is needed. Children's play experience must be preserved.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine unveiled its TOLOKA underwater drone at the Defense Tech Valley 2025 exhibition in Lviv, Ukrainian military news site Militarnyi reported on Sept. 19. 

Although the platform has been known for about a year, it has only now been publicly displayed. The system features three variants capable of striking targets up to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away.

The compact TLK-150 is designed for stealth operations just below the surface, using electric propulsion to evade detection and penetrate Russian defenses, according to Defense Express.

Larger models include the TLK-400, with a range of 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) and a 500-kilogram payload, and the TLK-1000, which measures up to 12 meters, carries 5,000 kilograms, and can reach targets up to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

Ukraine's General Staff showcased the drone on social media on Sept. 19.

""Ukraine's Armed Forces will soon receive a number of new systems, including drones, unmanned boats, ground robotic complexes, and electronic warfare equipment,"" the military said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky first introduced the TOLOKA drone at the Support Ukraine summit in February, highlighting its ability to strike ships, ports, and Russian strategic targets.

The unveiling comes amid Kyiv's focus on precision strikes against Russian infrastructure.

In June, the Security Service of Ukraine carried out its third attack on the Crimean Bridge, a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

While the exact cause of damage to the bridge's underwater supports remains unclear, some defense experts speculate that the TOLOKA drone may have played a role.

Since 2022, Ukraine has steadily expanded its naval drone fleet, integrating unmanned maritime systems into combat operations. 

Kyiv has repeatedly used maritime drones to inflict heavy losses on Russian assets in the Black Sea.

The aircraft, an Il-20M, departed from Russia and entered international airspace without establishing communication, making visual identification the only way to confirm its presence.

The analysis shows that 42% of these deaths occurred within the first year after President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's month-long ""partial mobilization"" in September 2022.

The rare strike marks only the third visually confirmed destruction of such a vehicle since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.

Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin has been dismissed from military service, Russian pro-government media outlet RBC reported on Sept. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

The general has long been associated with battlefield setbacks since 2022.

Lapin commanded Russia's Central Military District during Ukraine's September 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive, where Russian defenses collapsed and multiple cities were retaken. 

This earned him public criticism from Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov as ""a good-for-nothing"" general.

In 2024, Lapin oversaw Russia's defenses in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched an unprecedented cross-border incursion in 2024, seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) in the first months. 

The Wall Street Journal later reported that gaps in Russian defenses under Lapin let Ukraine advance.

Nine months later, Moscow launched a counteroffensive supported by 12,000 North Korean troops, eventually retaking most of the territory but at a cost of 80,000 soldiers killed or wounded.

Lapin, born in Kazan in 1964, rose through Russia's military ranks after graduating from the Kazan Higher Tank Command School. 

In 2017, he served as chief of staff of Russian forces in Syria and later commanded the Central Military District and multiple Russian formations in Ukraine.

Russian pro-government media outlet Tatar-inform reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, that Lapin will now serve as an assistant to Tatarstan's head, Rustam Minnikhanov.

In 2022, Ukraine's prosecutor general named Lapin a suspect in waging an aggressive war against Ukraine and violating the country's territorial integrity and inviolability.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in occupied Crimea, the agency reported on Sept. 21. 

""The Russian invaders' air fleet in the temporarily occupied Crimea has been reduced again as a result of successful combat operations,"" HUR wrote on Telegram. 

The Mi-8 is a medium-lift helicopter widely used by Russia for transport, reconnaissance, and combat support. It can carry troops and equipment or be outfitted as a gunship.

The radar destroyed was identified as the 55Zh6U Nebo-U, a mobile early-warning system capable of detecting stealth aircraft and cruise missiles at long ranges. 

Such radars provide critical targeting data for surface-to-air missile systems.

Over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have saved nearly 94 million lives.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

The date was Feb. 8, 1954 and young David Edmonston had an upset tummy. 

Compared with other global events around that time – the death of Joseph Stalin, the advent of colour TV – the gastrointestinal woes of an 11-year-old in rural Massachusetts hardly seemed consequential.

But to Thomas Peebles, they hinted at a chance to make history. When the young physician-researcher at Boston Children's Hospital learned of David's symptoms– which soon included a telltale rash – he beelined for the boy's boarding school, where a measles outbreak was under way.

How measles made its way back to Canada

Dr. Peebles wanted three things from David: a throat-washing, some blood and a stool sample. But he also extended an invitation. “He asked if I would help the world,” David later recalled. “So I said yes, of course.” 

Today, every Canadian child who gets a measles vaccine is injected with a weakened form of the virus that traces back to the “Edmonston strain” that Dr. Peebles collected that day. More than two millennia after a cattle pathogen spilled over into human populations, the virus that causes measles had finally been isolated from the blood of an American schoolboy. Within a decade, it would be harnessed into a vaccine.

The medical breakthrough heralded the modern era of vaccination. It gave the world a powerful defence against one of the most contagious diseases known to humankind. Over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have saved nearly 94 million lives.

And because the virus only circulates in humans, the arrival of an effective vaccine introduced a tantalizing possibility: eradication.

“Today we are on the threshold of eliminating another dangerous disease – measles,” U.S. health officials announced in 1967.

Six decades later, that threshold has yet to be crossed.

Measles remains very much a part of the human condition. According to latest estimates, more than 100,000 people died of measles in 2023, primarily children in lower-income countries. 

This year has seen an alarming resurgence in countries where measles is considered eliminated, including Canada and the U.S., both of which are struggling to extinguish their largest outbreaks in decades.

There were signs from the start that the path to conquering the disease would be bumpy and meandering. 

Public reception to the measles vaccine in 1963 was relatively muted compared with the jubilation and public weeping that erupted when an effective polio vaccine was announced, pediatrician Adam Ratner says in Booster Shots: the Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health.

Opinion: Mistrust in medicine is infecting our society – and it's putting our children at risk

“From the beginning, the announcement of measles vaccine availability was plagued by contradictions,” he wrote. “Inconsistent messages, unclear availability and limited public understanding of why one might want to vaccinate a child against measles in the first place ... hindered the availability and success of the measles vaccine.”

Experts knew that one barrier to vaccination was the widespread belief that measles was a normal and ultimately harmless part of childhood. In reality, measles annually killed more Canadian children than polio, a disease that struck parents with terror.

(Today, one in every 1,000 children infected will die. Measles can also weaken the immune system, in addition to causing complications such as deafness, blindness or brain swelling.)

The first two licensed vaccines for measles were also less than ideal. 

One, made with a “killed” or inactivated virus, was well tolerated but offered inferior protection (it would be taken off the market by the early seventies).

The better-performing vaccine, made with a weakened version of the live virus, was prone to causing high fevers and even rash. These side effects could be mitigated with a second injection of a preparation made from donated blood plasma. But this was cumbersome and expensive, especially compared with the polio vaccine, which sold at just six or seven cents a shot.

“Sir, when is the measles' vaccine going to be made available to the free immunization clinics?” a reader calling themselves “anxious mother” wrote to The Toronto Star in 1964. “We with large families feel the $10 charged by physicians is a little steep for each child.”

An answer came the following year, when Toronto launched a mass vaccination campaign – the first by a Canadian public health department, according to reports at the time. 

Vaccinating became easier and more tolerable in the seventies, with the introduction of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot. This included an attenuated version of the live measles virus that minimized side effects.

But measles outbreaks continued, and health officials bemoaned Canada's low vaccination rates. “Young families are no longer motivated by the memory of diphtheria and polio epidemics of the pre-immunization era,” lamented a report by the Ontario Council of Health.

Internal documents show how Alberta's measles outbreak began to spiral out of control

In the early eighties, Canadian public health departments envied their counterparts in the U.S., where the incidence rate for measles was six times lower, owing in part to laws that mandated vaccinations for school-aged children.

In 1982, Ontario and New Brunswick passed similar legislation (today, they remain the only Canadian provinces with such laws). In Ontario, the law gave rise to anti-vaccination groups such as the Committee Against Compulsory Vaccination. Within just two years, these organizations had successfully pressured the province into amending legislation to allow for exemptions based on conscientious objection. 

Newspaper headlines from the decade reveal the fragility of every hard-won victory against the wildly infectious foe. “Measles in Canada drops to all-time low,” says a 1983 headline in The Globe and Mail. One year later: “Measles cases in 3 provinces at 5-year high.” 

The mid-nineties introduced the two-dose MMR vaccination schedule. This paved the way for Canada to achieve a historic milestone in 1998: measles elimination, meaning it had been free of continuous transmission for more than 12 months. The virus that once infected up to 90,000 Canadians a year no longer circulated in this country.

But that same year delivered the biggest setback yet to global elimination efforts. The Lancet, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, published a fraudulent paper authored by the now-disgraced British scientist Andrew Wakefield that alleged a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The paper was ultimately retracted 12 years later, and Mr. Wakefield was banned from practising medicine.

The damaging paper had landed at a pivotal moment, however, with the Internet providing a new and powerful substrate for disinformation to spread through. 

“That definitely was the beginning of the modern era of anti-vaccine sentiment,” said René Najera, director of public health for the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and editor of the History of Vaccines project. 

Opinion: Ending vaccine mandates is a cynical political play – and it threatens children's lives

The first two decades of this millennium saw periodic measles flare-ups in Canada ignited by importations of the virus by infected travellers. Then, starting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine vaccinations, eroded public health care infrastructure and gave rise to a powerful wave of mistrust against the medical establishment – ideal conditions for measles to stage a comeback.

In North America, this ancient virus is once again on the move. And it's spreading through a world that bears little resemblance to the one Dr. Peebles asked young David to help.

Vaccines have become deeply politicized. Social media and influencers are spreading false or misleading information faster and farther than ever. The U.S. – once a global leader in public health– has a vaccine skeptic running its health department and dismantling the research ecosystem that once gifted the world its first measles vaccine.

“Measles is one of those diseases like smallpox that can be eradicated. A couple of generations of near 100 per cent vaccination and we would eradicate it, and then we can take it off the vaccine schedule and nobody has to worry about it,” Dr. Najera said. 

“But, you know, that's not where we are.”

High taxes, rolls of red tape and towering protectionist walls conspire to strangle productivity and prosperity

In the story of Canada's sagging productivity growth in recent decades, there is a rotating cast of villains.

Sometimes, high taxation is singled out for blame, with a outsized burden on personal and corporate income – choosing to tax success rather than consumption. 

Others point to the grip of a growing morass of regulatory red tape, with new layers added year after year. And still others see this country's protectionist bent as culpable: restrictions on foreign investment that leave Canada badly out of step with other modern economies.

The damage is plain to see. Canada's productivity growth has lagged for years. Real gross domestic product per capita has flatlined over the last four years, with the second quarter of this year marginally higher than in the same period of 2021. Longer term, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that Canada is projected to lag its peers in per capita growth in coming decades.

Of course, each of those three bad policy choices, decades in the making, play a role in Canada's deep-seated economic malaise. Each would be bad on its own. But together, they act to prop up each other – leaning on each other for support. 

Protectionist policies reduce competition, tempting governments to remedy the resulting market failures through regulation. The ever-growing number of regulations inflates the cost of doing business, but also shields incumbents from upstarts unable to afford lobbyists, law firms and regulatory compliance departments. That insulation from competition protects profit margins and makes the burden of excessive taxation a little easier to bear. 

And to bring it full circle, as the burden of regulations and taxation erodes competitiveness and dulls innovation, it increases the clamour for protection against foreign competition. The result is corporate complacency, a willingness to settle for the lukewarm results of not-bad profit margins.

Economist and former federal finance official Don Drummond points out that successive federal governments have tried to deal with each of those issues, with at best mixed results. Mr. Drummond says something beyond numbers may be at work: a business culture that lacks ambition.

Tinkering around the edges won't deliver enough of a jolt to shock Canadian businesses out of their complacency. Incrementalism is doomed to fail because of the mutually supporting nature of the three villains. But a bold move against one could succeed in defeating the trio.

Those defending the status quo like to say that Canada's tax burden is not particularly high. And, superficially, they are correct. As the chart below shows, Canada sits precisely in the middle of the OECD, as measured by taxes as a percentage of GDP, as of 2023, the most recent ranking. And this country's tax burden, at 34.8 per cent of GDP, is just above the OECD average of 33.9 per cent.

But take a look at the components of that tax burden, and the problem is readily apparent, as this second chart shows.

Taxes on personal income in Canada are much higher than the OECD average - half again as high. The gap is less pronounced on corporate taxation but still substantial. More telling is what is decidedly absent: any tax advantage for Canada in a world in which the fight for global capital is intensifying.

There is an area in which Canadians have an edge over other OECD countries: consumption taxes. Canada's value-added taxes are just three-fifths of the OECD average. That might sound like a good thing, except for this: consumption taxes are far less damaging to investment and productivity growth than taxes on income.

Or to put it another way: Canada has chosen to heavily tax success, in the form of higher incomes and corporate profits. Any strategy aimed at improving Canada's long-term economic prospects will have to deal with this issue, by shifting the taxation burden toward consumption. 

But that cannot become an excuse for Ottawa to simply hike taxes, on the pretext of reducing the deficit. Any increase in consumption taxes must be matched by at least the same decrease in income taxes. The deficit must be tamed, yes, but by rolling back the tide of spending, including tens of billions of dollars in corporate subsidies. 

The goal must be to create a Canadian tax advantage that lures talent and capital to this country.

Taxes have one virtue – their cost is obvious. Not so with the second big problem gumming up the works of Canada's economy: overregulation. A Statistics Canada analysis from earlier this year laid the problem out in stark terms, namely a federal regulatory burden that rose 37 per cent between 2006 and 2021, as the chart below shows.

Just at the federal level, there was a net increase 86,700 regulations over that period. Add on top of that provincial and municipal red tape and you start to get the idea of the magnitude of the problem.

The costs estimated by StatCan are staggering: a reduction in GDP by 1.7 per cent (about half the economic damage of the financial crisis); a 1.3-per-cent reduction in employment growth; and a 9-per-cent hit to business investment.

Freeing Canada's economy must mean cutting that red tape, starting with requiring governments to estimate the economic costs of all those regulations and then set targets for reduction.

For a trade-dependent economy, Canada is surprisingly hostile to foreign investment. Whole sectors are effectively off limits for companies wanting a controlling stake, ranging from the somewhat plausible (airlines) to the downright odd (fishery licences).

Vincent Geloso, senior economist at the Montreal Economic Institute, estimates that nearly a third of the Canadian economy is protected from foreign competition, once health care and education are excluded.

Even more jaw-dropping is this country's international ranking on protectionist measures; be careful not to cramp your scrolling finger as you look for the blue bar denoting Canada in the chart below.

Canada ranks 73rd out of 104 jurisdictions, and is the most protectionist economy in the G7 when it comes to foreign investment. The Scandinavian countries that Canada so often aspires to emulate have far more open economies.

The politics of tearing down those protectionist barriers are daunting, to say the least. Target any one sector and businesses within it would argue, with some justification, that they will feel a full measure of pain without being able to enjoy the benefits of heightened competition elsewhere in the economy. The solution, then, is to abandon the failed incrementalist approach, and tear them all down at the same time.

Without those protectionist barriers, Canadian businesses would face much more intense competition and would have to innovate and ramp up investment – or go bust. Without those barriers, Canadian businesses would not be so accepting of a lopsided tax burden. Or so willing to endure a morass of regulations. 

Every gang has a ringleader. And for the three villains of Canada's economy, it is protectionism that keeps the gang together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What will recognizing Palestine as a state actually achieve?","https://www.dw.com/en/what-will-recognizing-palestine-as-a-state-actually-achieve/a-74047802","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 05:00:21 GMT","

Several European countries plan to recognize Palestine as a state at the UN. Israel and its allies call the designation ""political theater."" Supporters of Palestinian rights say formal recognition is just the first step.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have become the first major Western economies to recognize a Palestinian state. Prime Ministers Keir Starmer and Mark Carney announced the move shortly before the start of the UN General Assembly debate in New York. Other Western nations, such as France and Belgium, intend to follow suit there — despite warnings from Israel. 

On Monday, the UN General Assembly will hold a special summit on the war in the Gaza Strip. It is a continuation of a diplomatic project led by France and Saudi Arabia to push for the revival the two-state solution — in which Israelis and Palestinians would exist side by side — as the only answer to the decades long conflict.

At Monday's meeting, several countries have said they will join the more than 145 UN members that already recognize a Palestinian state. These include France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta.

Most of the recent European declarations on recognizing Palestinian statehood have come as a result of Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 65,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, although international researchers have estimated the toll much higher. Last Monday, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory published a report concluding that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.

Israel and its primary ally, the United States, have rejected this report and others that have come to the same conclusion and denounced any plans to recognize Palestine as a state, claiming that doing so would be a ""reward for terror"" — referring to the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel led by the militant Hamas group, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and preceded Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Even supporters of Palestinians say recognizing Palestine as a state could be insufficient if it's not combined with action.

""Western states embrace symbolic gestures, while Palestinians are left with neither justice nor statehood, only a widening gap between lived reality and international performance,"" Ines Abdel Razek, advocacy director for the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, based in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, argued in an August text for Palestinian think tank Al Shabaka.

On Wednesday, Guardian columnist Owen Jones wrote that ""every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public.""

There is also concern about how Israel would react to a new batch of recognitions, Richard Gowan, the UN director for think tank International Crisis Group, wrote this week in the US-based policy journal Just Security.

""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ... has a long track record of defying the rest of the UN membership,"" Gowan wrote. ""One scenario that worries diplomats is that Netanyahu — who declared last week that 'there will be no Palestinian state' — could respond to the recognitions process by announcing plans to formally annex parts of the Palestinian territories in his speech.""

It's clear that recognition of a Palestinian state alone won't stop Israel's war in Gaza.

""Recognition is an erroneous substitute to boycotts and punitive measures that should be taken against a country perpetuating genocide,"" columnist Gideon Levy argued in Israeli newspaper Haaretz in August. ""Recognition is hollow lip service. ... This will not stop the genocide, which will not be halted without practical steps by the international community.""

In fact, as legal experts point out, the issues are separate. Whether Palestine is a state or not, international law already obligates other nations to do whatever they can to stop a suspected genocide from taking place.

What recognition of a Palestinian state could do is make a stronger case for a ceasefire within existing international diplomatic, bureaucratic and legal structures.

In the fall 2025 edition of the quarterly academic journal The Cairo Review of Global Affairs, Egyptian political analyst Omar Auf pointed out that Palestinian officials had previously tried to accede to the Geneva Conventions in 1989 but were rejected by Switzerland because, the Swiss said, there was ""uncertainty"" about the existence of a Palestinian state.

In August, Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a peace negotiator with the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, told DW that recognition ""doesn't change anything immediately but it gives the Palestinians a much higher stake in negotiations, because when you're negotiating state versus state, it's not the same as negotiating between a state and an unrecognized state [or] a state that is just an entity.""

Bilateral recognition could be considered a form of diplomatic upgrade. Recognizing countries — say, France or Belgium — must review ties with Palestine, as well as assess their legal obligations toward it. That's why it could also lead to a review of ties with Israel, they argue.

But it must be accompanied by practical steps, Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told DW.

""Recognition is not a policy, it is an opening. The real work begins the day after,"" Anas Iqtait, a lecturer in the political economy of the Middle East at the Australian National University, argued in August in Akfar , which is published by the Doha-based Middle East Council on Global Affairs.

It is true that recognition is very symbolic, Lovatt conceded. ""But symbolism is not always a bad thing. Given the countries doing the recognizing — France and the UK, in particular — it is an important reaffirmation of Palestinian rights and self-determination, the right to live free from occupation, the right to statehood and so on.""

Still, symbolic measures must be accompanied by practical steps, he said.

At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, encouraged member states to increase tariffs on some Israeli goods and to sanction settlers and two senior Israeli politicians. These are measures that experts at the ECFR have previously recommended. A source in Brussels told DW that Italy, which had previously opposed stopping the EU's scientific funding for Israel, might even drop its objections soon.

""Even three years ago, recognition might have been the end of the story,"" Lovatt said. ""But I think, because things have moved on so dramatically in terms of public and political opinion, it is no longer a question of either you recognize [Palestine] or you do something else.""

At the moment multiple measures are being advanced simultaneously, Lovatt said, and that's reflective of how public opinion across the political spectrum has changed since 2023. 

""[Recognition] should be seen as the trajectory of travel,"" Lovatt said. ""We may not get there tomorrow, but the trajectory is clear.""

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party tops the poll with the highest support ever. Meanwhile, Kenyan athletes won both the men's and women's races at the Berlin Marathon. DW has the latest from Germany.

Please read below for a round-up of news and analysis of the major talking points in Germany on Saturday, September 20, and Sunday, September 21.

British pop star Harry Styles ran the Berlin marathon on Sunday.

Competing under the false name of Sted Sarandos, the 31-year-old completed the 42.195 kilometers (26.2 miles) through the German capital in 2:59:13.

Styles, who rose to fame as a member of former boyband One Direction, wasn't the only global star to be seen pounding the streets of Berlin on Sunday.

German World Cup winner Andre Schürrle also finished the 51st iteration of the event, crossing the finish line near the Brandenburg Gate in a time of 3:21:25.

The men's race was won by 29-year-old Sabastian Sawe with a time of 2:02:15 — five months after his victory in the London marathon — while the women's race was won by Rosemary Wanjiru with a time of 2:21:05.

A 41-year-old man drove a car into a group of people at a fair in the village of Niederdorla, in the central state of Thuringia, injuring five people, a police spokesman said.

The incident occurred on Saturday night, with the man, a German national, arrested.

The exact circumstances, such as the man's motive, are not yet known, although police said they were no indications that the act had any political background.

Police said the man had been observed behaving suspiciously before the incident, and had been reported to police for reckless driving.

An investigation into attempted murder is currently underway.

Germany has seen multiple car rammings since the summer of 2024.

Around 400 football hooligans appear to have been involved in what local police suspect may have been a pre-arranged fight near Dortmund on Saturday evening.

At about 10 p.m., a train carrying supporters of second-division side Schalke 04 back from their team's 2-0 win away at Magdeburg was twice brought to a halt just east of Dortmund after an emergency break was pulled.

The second time, a large group of Schalke ""risk fans"" reportedly exited the train and headed into a wooded area where police believe they encountered a group of ""violently inclined"" rival fans of Borussia Dortmund and FC Cologne.

Police later stopped around 300 Schalke fans, 90 Dortmund fans and five Cologne fans, many of whom had red marks on their hands and faces, according to a police spokesman.

Officers also reportedly found mixed martial arts (MMA) gloves, boxing handwraps, gum-guards and balaclavas in the area, and have charged some of those allegedly involved with breach of the peace, grievous bodily harm and interference with rail traffic.

The rivalry between neighbors Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04 is one of the most intense in Germany but, with the latter currently in Bundesliga 2, the two haven't met for a men's first-team ""Revierderby"" since a 2-2 draw in March 2023.

Despite the rivalry, derby matches generally pass off peacefully, but small elements of both clubs' fanbases are inclined towards more violent confrontations.

It's not uncommon for hooligans to pre-arrange fights with similarly-minded rivals in secluded areas such as woodlands, a practice which is nevertheless illegal.

After drawing 4-4 away at Juventus in the Champions League in midweek, Borussia Dortmund host VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Sunday evening.

The first athletes have crossed the finish line in the Berlin Marathon, with both the men's and women's races being won by athletes from Kenya.

The men's race was won by 29-year-old Sabastian Sawe with a time of 2:02:15 — five months after his victory in the London marathon — while first place in the women's race went to compatriot Rosemary Wanjiru with a time of 2:21:05.

Despite Berlin's reputation as the fastest marathon route on the world circuit, both times were significantly off world-record time (Sawe 1:40 slower, Wanjiru 11:49 slower).

This can likely be attributed to the unusually humid late-summer conditions in the German capital.

One of Germany's most easterly towns is electing a new mayor on Sunday — with a far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate among the favorites.

Mayoral elections are taking place in Frankfurt on the Oder on the Polish border after the previous incumbent René Wilke (independent since leaving the Left Party in June 2024) became interior minister for the state of Brandenburg.

Among the candidates to succeed Wilke in Germany's ""other"" Frankfurt (not to be confused with the more well-known banking metropolis Frankfurt on the Main) is Wilko Möller of the AfD, who could become the right-wing extremists' first ever city mayor.

According to a recent online survey by a local radio station Oderwelle last week, Möller came out on top with 1,396 votes, followed by a candidate from the center-left SPD (989), an independent (937) and a conservative (670). Around 450 respondents said they still hadn't made up their minds.

The survey was very much unofficial and unrepresentative but former policeman Möller, who grew up far away from Frankfurt in Hannover and North Rhine-Westphalia, is confident, telling tabloid Bild: ""I'll get over 50% in the first round.""

The biggest concerns in the town of 57,000 are a struggling economy, empty public coffers, a population drain, increasing crime and border checks resulting in long traffic jams.

""On your marks! Get set! Go!"" Or, as we say in German: ""Auf die Plätze! Fertig! Los!""

The 51st Berlin marathon got underway on Sunday morning, with over 55,000 runners making their way through the streets of the capital.

Starting near the famous Brandenburg Gate, the runners will initially head west through the Tiergarten before embarking on a clockwise loop around the city center, passing through the districts of Moabit, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Schöneberg, Steglitz, Charlottenburg and Mitte, finishing on the Unter den Linden boulevard.

Last year's Berlin marathon saw a double-triumph for Ethiopia, with Milkesa Mengesha winning the men's race (2:03:17) and Tigist Ketema winning on the women's side (2:16:42).

But the vast majority of participants will be aiming for significantly slower times — or indeed just to finish at all.

They'll be cheered on along the route by hundreds of thousands of spectators, while helpers will be distributing 120,000 bananas, 80,000 apples and 1.25 million cups of water to keep the runners energized and hydrated.

According to the German weather service (DWD), this year's race is set to be one of the warmest ever, with Berlin enjoying late-summer temperatures of between 23-29°C (73-84°F).

Among the famous faces taking part are former footballers André Schürrle (a German World Cup winner in 2014) and Felix Kroos (bother of former Real Madrid star Toni).

If federal elections were held in Germany today, the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) would emerge as the largest party, according to an opinion poll released on Sunday.

The poll, conducted by the Insa institute on behalf of tabloid newspaper Bild, put the anti-immigration party up one percentage point at 26%, overtaking the ruling conservative CDU/CSU bloc which remained unchanged at 25%.

The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in the current coalition government, would increase their share of the vote by one percentage point to 15%, according to the poll, while the Green Party and far-left Left Party would both be on 11%.

The left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) would both fall short of the minimum 5% threshold required to enter parliament at 4% and 3% respectively.

The AfD, which has been officially classified as a ""confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor"" by Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz or BfV), won 20.8% of the vote in February's federal elections.

Despite being the second-largest party in parliament, the other parties refused to enter into a coalition with the AfD.

Guten Morgen! Welcome back to DW's coverage of what's making the news in Germany this weekend.

According to a new opinion poll, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has overtaken Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives as the most popular party in Germany at the moment.

In one of Germany's most easterly cities, Frankfurt on the Oder on the Polish border, an AfD candidate is among the frontrunners to become city mayor, which would be a first for the party.

And in sport, the 51st Berlin marathon is taking place today, with 55,000 competitors running through the capital.

We'll continue with the news from Germany on September 21 here too. Stay tuned.

The head of DB Regio, Germany's regional rail division, is set to take over as the head ofthe ailing Deutsche Bahn national railway, German news agency DPA reported, citing information obtained from government sources.

German Transportation Minister Patrick Schnieder has allegedly proposed DB regional chief Evelyn Palla for the job. Her appointment would need to be approved by the supervisory board, which is scheduled to meet on Tuesday.

If confirmed, Palla will be the first woman to head Deutsche Bahn. She will succeed Richard Lutz, who has led the state-owned company since early 2017. 

In August, Transportation Minister Schnieder announced the plan to appoint a new chief executive to carry out a fresh strategy to lead Deutsche Bahn out of the crisis. That strategy is expected to be revealed on Monday.

Germany's national railway is notoriously unreliable. In August, only about 60% of its long-distance trains ran on time. 

On September 22, a moment of decision will take place on New York's East River at the United Nations General Assembly.

France, Canada, and Belgium intend to recognize Palestine as a state, and the United Kingdom is also likely to take the step.

The goal is to exert pressure on Israel to end the Gaza war and initiate a new peace process. 

Germany, however, is not among them. 

 ""We won't be joining this initiative,"" said Chancellor Friedrich Merz in August when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited.

Climate demonstrations are taking place across Germany after the German government announced a new ""pragmatic"" approach to energy policy. 

Earlier this week, conservative German Economy and Energy Minister Katherina Reiche unveiled a series of proposals, such as the building of new gas-fired plants and the phasing out of certain renewable subsidies, in order to boost energy security and supply. 

Police told German news agency epd that around 3,000 people gathered in Berlin's Invalidenpark against the government's proposal, under the motto "" #ExitGasEnterFuture."" The demonstration was called for by the Fridays for Future climate movement.

Nele Evers, a spokesperson for Fridays for Future Berlin, told the demonstrators that as the climate crisis escalates, ""the government puts the interests of fossil fuel companies ahead of our right to a future."" 

Protests also took the northern German city of Bremen, where 750 people took part, and the city of Braunschweig, where police said there were 800 demonstrators present. 

Hundreds also demonstrated in the historic city center of Dresden, which lies in Germany's east. 

According to police, 2,500 people are present at the anti-abortion ""March for Life"" demonstration in Berlin. Attendees carried signs with slogans such as ""No Children — No Future"" and ""Inclusion Begins Before Birth.""

The demonstration took place on the south side of Berlin's main station, in an area known on the Washingtonplatz.  

According to the Berlin Tagesspiegel newspaper, one of the speakers at the ""March for Life"" event said the practice of abortion is unacceptable even in the case of rape.   

A pro-choice counterprotest also took place in the German capital, with participants carrying slogans such as ""My Body, My Choice"" and ""Sexual Self-Determination is a Human Right.""   

Police in Cologne also said several thousand people took part in the ""March for Life"" demonstration. Archbishop of Cologne Rainer Woelki spoke at the rally and thanked attendees. 

There was also a pro-choice counterprotest in Cologne, with the Pro Choice Alliance Cologne reporting 3,000 people at the event. 

Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter has opened the 190th Oktoberfest in the Bavarian capital by tapping the first barrel of beer, the beverage at the focus of the world-famous event on the Theresienwiese fairground.

Several million people from all over the world are expected to attend this year as in previous ones, with a record of 7.2 million set in 2023.

Protesters clashed with police in The Hague at the rally demanding tougher migration policies. Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders has condemned the unrest, calling the rioters ""idiots.""

An anti-immigration protest in The Hague turned violent on Saturday, just over a month before the Netherlands holds a general election.

Dutch police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd, according to a spokesperson for the local government.

The violence erupted at a demonstration organized by a right-wing activist known online as ""Els Rechts"" in demand of tougher migration policies.

The organizer said she had assumed people would demonstrate peacefully."" ""If I had known this in advance, I would never have organized it,"" she said in a post on X. 

Protesters — many of them waving Dutch flags and those associated with far-right groups — threw rocks and bottles at the police, according to footage from Dutch public broadcaster NOS.

Dutch media also showed rioters damaging an office of a centrist political party, D66.

""If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let our beautiful country be taken away by extremist troublemakers,"" the party's leader, Rob Jette, wrote on X. 

It is still unclear whether there were any injuries or if anyone was arrested.

The unrest in The Hague comes as the Netherlands prepares for a snap election next month.

The vote was called after far-right firebrand Geert Wilders, who won the previous election in the country, pulled his party out of the ruling coalition following a row over migration.

In a post on X, Wilders condemned the protesters as thugs.

""Blocking the highway and violence against the police is totally, absolutely unacceptable. Idiots,"" he wrote online.

			Nineteen-year-old has spoken at universities across the US promoting conservative values on campus and rallying the youth to vote

If he was nervous, 11-year-old Brilyn Hollyhand did not show it, confidently welcoming Charlie Kirk to an interview on his YouTube channel with a subscriber count of just seven.

“You're much further ahead of the curve than I was,” Kirk joked in seeming disbelief at the maturity of his young interviewer back in 2017. “So you're way ahead of the game”.

Now aged 19, Mr Hollyhand is being touted as Kirk's heir apparent after the 31-year-old Maga podcaster was shot and killed by a single bullet during an appearance at Utah Valley University last week.

Mr Hollyhand has travelled the length of the country speaking at universities across the US in a Kirk-like fashion, promoting conservative values on campus and rallying the youth to vote.

Since his first interview with his mentor seven years ago, the college student has become one of the most followed young conservative influencers of his generation, amassing around half-a-million followers across his social media platforms.

“There's a lot of people that you interview that you never speak to again, but Charlie and I stayed friends, he's been my mentor. I talked to him up until the morning of his passing,” Mr Hollyhand told The Telegraph.

“He was that person who cheered me on and I could go to for advice, and we were just there for each other.”

In the hours after Kirk's murder, grass-roots Republicans began to ask who, if anyone, could replace the void left in the conservative media bubble.

The right person will need to echo Kirk's slick communication skills and understanding of Generation Z, something Mr Hollyhand grasped from a young age.

In fifth grade, he founded The Truth Gazette, a conservative political website, and began hosting a podcast a year later.

In January 2023, alongside CJ Pearson, another rising conservative activist, he was appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee's newly created Youth Advisory Council.

One year later, at the age of just 18, he published his first book drawn from his interviews with conservative political figures such as Kirk.

“Everybody's talking about, who's the next Charlie Kirk? Who can replace Charlie Kirk? There is no replacement for Charlie Kirk, there's nobody that can fill his shoes,” Mr Hollyhand added, fresh off a talk in South Carolina.

“I got reminded in that moment of one of the last times I was on a campus with Charlie. He did a Q&A and somebody said, ‘Charlie, who is going to take the baton, who is next?'

“Charlie looked into the audience and said, ‘You're the next Charlie Kirk, and you are, and you.'

“I did the same thing to the students in South Carolina, and I said, every single one of you is Charlie Kirk.”

Mr Hollyhand said he has faced a wave of death threats since Kirk's assassination. They have become so serious that he is escorted to classes at Auburn University, Alabama, where he now attends college, by a security detail.

“We have to be louder for Charlie and no, that doesn't mean not being safe. I'll be travelling with a security detail, unfortunately,” he said.

“There's a detail that has to walk with me to my classes every day because of the death threats that I've gotten just in the last week. That's the world that we woke up in on Wednesday.”

Like Kirk, Mr Hollyhand remains steadfast in his belief that civil discourse is the answer to the toxicity in US politics.

“We can't let America die just because civil discourse is done. We have to bring back civil discourse and the perfect place to do that is on campuses.

“That's why my tour is called one conversation at a time. I think the problem, and the reason that I'm getting threats and the reason Charlie was assassinated, is because people don't know how to talk to each other.”

Long gone is the squeaky-voiced fourth grader with glasses too big for his face interviewing his political hero.

Even at his tender age, Mr Hollyhand is now a seasoned speaker and pundit who will help carry the baton left behind by Kirk, no longer asking questions about Kirk's legacy but helping to define it.

The Taliban has vowed not to give up “even one metre” of Afghanistan after Donald Trump said he wanted a former US airbase in the country back.

Bagram, the largest airbase in Afghanistan located north of Kabul, was the centre of US operations during their 20-year war with the Taliban.

The American president warned that “bad things” would happen if Kabul did not return the site to US control, four years after it was abandoned by US troops.

“Even if you recognise us and rebuild from scratch – let alone Bagram – we will not give up even one metre of this country,” said Amir Khan Muttaqi, the country's foreign minister.

“This is our stance, and this is the stance of the people.”

He added: “If it had been possible, why didn't we accept these deals over 20 years ago, after all the martyrs and destruction?”

Mr Muttaqi's response followed the warning by Mr Trump on his Truth Social platform, in which he said: “If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!”

The US gave up control of Bagram shortly before the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021. It served as the linchpin of US-led operations in the country for two decades from the start of America's mission to topple the group in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 attack.

During this time, the US expanded Bagram into an installation that housed tens of thousands of troops as well as restaurants and shopping centres.

Fighter jets, drones and cargo planes operated around the clock from its twin runways, while soldiers killed in battle were given final honours there before their remains were repatriated to the US.

Special operations troops based there conducted raids against al-Qaeda, Islamic State, the Taliban and other militant groups across the country.

The base was also used to carry out the torture and interrogation of enemies by US troops and the CIA, according to government reports and human rights investigations.

Mr Trump's escalating rhetoric has prompted Taliban officials to issue their own threatening responses, with one senior official referring to suicide bombings as a “defensive measure.”

In a recording obtained by The Telegraph, Taj Mir Jawad, the deputy director of the Taliban's intelligence directorate, said: “Just as we once wore explosives and blew ourselves up to take this country, we will wear explosives and blow ourselves up again to defend it now.”

A former commander of the Taliban's suicide squad also threatened Mr Trump, saying he “did not learn from the experiences of past invaders”.

Hamid Khorasani said: “I feel sorry for leaders of countries like America who want to intervene in the domestic affairs of the Islamic Emirate because they have not learned from the shameful history of former invaders of Afghanistan.

“We will enthusiastically take up armed jihad – hundreds of thousands of real mujahideen are ready for suicide operations against you and any other invaders who try to take even one inch of our country by force and war,” he added.

The Taliban emphasised its commitment to territorial integrity while calling for realistic engagement with the US.

An official spokesman said: “In accordance with Islamic principles and grounded in its balanced, economy-oriented foreign policy, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests.

“It is once again underscored that, rather than repeating past failed approaches, a policy of realism and rationality should be adopted.”

The Taliban government reminded Washington of commitments made under the 2020 Doha Agreement, which include a pledge by the US not to “use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs”.

The diplomatic crisis erupted after Mr Trump announced that the US was attempting to retake control of Bagram during his visit to London on Thursday, citing its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons sites.

“We're trying to get it back – by the way, that could be a little breaking news,” he said at a press conference with Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister.

“One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”

Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed that Bagram is under Chinese control – assertions that the Taliban and Beijing have rejected.

Mufti Abdul Mateen Qaneh, the Taliban spokesman, described his remarks as “baseless and strange”, adding that they were “far from the facts and filled with hatred”.

“We will never hand over Bagram to anyone,” Mr Qaneh told The Telegraph.

Mr Trump has consistently criticised his predecessor Joe Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, referring to the estimated $7bn (£5.1bn) worth of American military equipment and assets left behind when US forces withdrew.

The Taliban's foreign minister also said the group's position was uncompromising regarding foreign military presence during negotiations in Doha.

“When we spoke with America and others in Doha, we made it clear: we do not accept even a single one of your people in uniform,” Mr Muttaqi said.

The Taliban government, which has received formal diplomatic recognition from only Russia, has sought to present itself as seeking constructive international engagement while maintaining firm control over Afghan territory.

France and Saudi Arabia hope to use this year's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly and the increasingly horrific war in the Gaza Strip to inject new urgency into the quest for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established.

Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly.

But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. The U.S. has blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the General Assembly. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank.

That would put the Palestinians' dream of independence even further out of reach.




The creation of a Palestinian state in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict, which began more than a century before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

Proponents say this would allow Israel to exist as a democracy with a Jewish majority. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. 

“Israel must understand that the one state solution, with the subjugation of the Palestinian people without rights -- that is absolutely intolerable,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said last week. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.”

Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009.

Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods.

The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves.

In Gaza, Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced some 90% of the population of 2 million, left much of the territory uninhabitable and pushed some areas into famine. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city.

Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing.

Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance.

The plan calls for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the return of all hostages and a complete Israeli withdrawal. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not.

The international community would help the Palestinian Authority rebuild Gaza and govern the territories, possibly with the help of foreign peacekeepers. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow.

The 193-member world body approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing the so-called “New York Declaration” earlier this month. 

The United States and Israel say the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas and makes it harder to reach a deal to halt the war and return the remaining hostages.

The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March.

Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction.

Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.”

Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state.

The U.S. has not taken a public position on the issue, but in an interview with Fox News, Rubio linked “this conversation about annexation” to the issue of statehood recognition.

The United Arab Emirates has called annexation a “red line,” without saying what effect it might have on the 2020 Abraham Accords, in which the country normalized ties with Israel.

The French-Saudi plan sidesteps the most divisive issues in the conflict: final borders, the fate of the settlements, the return of Palestinian refugees from past wars, security arrangements, the status of Jerusalem and recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.

It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. 

The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.

All of which means the plan is likely to end up on the mound of past Mideast accords, parameters and road maps, leaving Israel in full control of the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, ruling millions of Palestinians who are denied basic rights.

NASHUA, N.H. (AP) — Witnesses say someone struck a gunman with a chair after the shooter said “free Palestine” and opened fire while a wedding was taking place in a New Hampshire country club. 

One person was killed and two others were wounded by gunfire Saturday before the suspect was taken into custody, authorities said.

The person who died at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua was a 59-year-old man identified as Robert Steven DeCesare, according to New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke.

Authorities identified the suspect as Hunter Nadeau, 23, and said he had been arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder for knowingly shooting DeCesare.

Witnesses at the scene said the shootings took place in a restaurant adjacent to a wedding that was taking place. Tom Bartelson of Pepperell, Massachusetts, who was at the country club, described a chaotic scene that unfolded near his nephew's wedding. He said he heard the shooter say “the children are safe” and “free Palestine” and appeared to be targeting someone.

“Getting together for a dance for the bride and groom and then all chaos went off,” he said. “We heard about six shots and everybody ducked for cover and next thing you know we're rushed into safe spots and things like that.”

Wedding DJ Michael Homewood credited the chair strike with preventing an even worse shooting.

“He hit him over the head with a chair, and he probably saved a bunch of lives just doing that,” Homewood told WCVB-TV.




Investigators were still working to determine a motive, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley said. Authorities said there is no known connection between Nadeau and DeCesare. 

Authorities had initially thought there could be two shooters but later said there was only one. 

“Additional charges likely will be brought, including for the additional shooting victims,” Formella and Rourke said in a statement. They said they expect Nadeau to be arraigned at the Ninth Circuit Court in Nashua on Monday.

In addition to three gunshot victims, others at the scene suffered injuries including lacerations, a broken hand and blunt force trauma, Nashua Fire Rescue said Sunday.

Nashua Fire Rescue said it assisted about 100 people from the scene to a nearby firehouse, mostly on foot. Minor medical issues were handled at the scene, the agency said.

Later, Nashua Mayor Jim Donchess said he had faith in police to “get to the bottom of this and bring the perpetrator to justice.”

Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement Sunday that the attorney general's office will assist Nashua police with the investigation and that she and her husband were “praying for the victims and their families.”

Nashua is about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of Boston, just across the Massachusetts border. 

The mother of DeCesare, the man who was killed, had earlier described not being able to find her son after he was shot.

“He went down. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter escaped ... They saw my son go down and they saw blood,” said Evie O'Rourke of Salem, New Hampshire.

Sophie Flabouris, another witness who was at the scene, told WCVB-TV that someone hit the suspect over the head with a chair to subdue him. Flabouris said the suspect then fled the scene.

“We had just gathered around the dance floor. We were about to do a Greek smashing of the plates and throwing the dollar bills. The bride had just come up to me and gave me the plates to say, ‘All right, you give this to my husband.' And all of a sudden we heard ‘pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.' Heard five shots,” Flabouris told WCVB-TV. “All of a sudden heard ‘Gun!' Chaos, screaming, and then running.”

Emily Ernst, who was at the scene, said she saw a gunman in all black.

“He had a mask on. We just saw him raise the gun and then we ran,” Ernst said. “I ran through the kitchen for my life.”

Bartelson said some people dropped to the ground and attempted to get away from the scene. There was a lot of panic, he said.

“We were trying to keep family members safe,” he said. “Keep everybody down and try to find safe spots.”

Live memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — President Donald Trump and prominent members of his “Make America Great Again” movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere.

The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.

“We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. “It will be a tough day.”

Kirk's assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.

The service will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals west of Phoenix, where Kirk's Turning Point organization is based. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event.




Members of the public began lining up outside the stadium before dawn to secure a spot, several hours before the start of the service. The 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organizers suggested.

The stadium had the feel of a megachurch service. Floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands playing on stage as the crowds filed in. Many stood and sang along.

“I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference,” said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. “He deserves us to be here.”

Trump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.

He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised “the life and legacy” of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday.

“Who could vote against that? All (Republicans) were saying was ‘Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'” Trump told reporters. “And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that.'”

Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk's death. 

ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air indefinitely following backlash from affiliated broadcasters and the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian's remarks about Kirk.

The State Department has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.

A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred.

Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach. 

The crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk's memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.

 “I think he spoke on more than just politics,” said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. “Now that he's gone, it's like who's gonna speak for us now?”

His impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.

Kirk “was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. “But he never stopped smiling, never stopped respecting his interlocutor and anyone who challenged him.”

Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader.

Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.

Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president.

Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak.

Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes.

Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that “the movement my husband built will not die.”

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will award Ben Carson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the third such award he's announced this month.

“Congratulations, Ben. He didn't know this,” Trump said in a speech during an event at Mount Vernon for American Cornerstone Institute, founded by Carson. “He didn't know it. I hope he's happy.”

A former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Carson, 74, went on to serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration. 

The one-time rivals developed a strong bond, and Carson — seen at one point as among the top contenders for Trump's running mate in the 2024 campaign — served as Trump's national faith chairman during last year's race. 

A staunch social conservative who has opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage, Carson has become a popular conservative speaker and author.

The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors.

Trump bestowed the honor on 24 people during his first term and has already announced two other recipients since his return to the White House. Trump mentioned no date for giving the honor to Carson, but other honorees are already in the pipeline.




Earlier this month, Trump said he would bestow the award on former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, two days after his longtime political ally was seriously injured in a car crash.

During a Sept. 11 commemoration event at the Pentagon, Trump announced that he would posthumously give the award to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month and whose memorial service Trump plans to attend Sunday in Arizona.

The Pentagon says it will require credentialed journalists at the military headquarters to sign a pledge to refrain from reporting information that has not been authorized for release — including unclassified information.

Journalists who don't abide by the policy risk losing credentials that provide access to the Pentagon, under a 17-page memo distributed Friday that steps up media restrictions imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.

“Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified,” the directive states. The signature form includes an array of security requirements for credentialed media at the Pentagon.

Advocates for press freedoms denounced the non-disclosure requirement as an assault on independent journalism. The new Pentagon restrictions arrive as Trump expands threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape.

“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting. It is getting only what officials want them to see,” said National Press Club President Mike Balsamo, also national law enforcement editor at The Associated Press. “That should alarm every American.”




Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel personality, highlighted the restrictions in a social media post on X.

“The ‘press' does not run the Pentagon — the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility,” Hegseth said. “Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.”

The Pentagon this year has evicted many news organizations while imposing a series of restrictions on the press that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort — areas where the press had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military.

The Pentagon was embarrassed early in Hegseth's tenure when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently included in a group chat on the Signal messaging app where the Defense secretary discussed plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job.

The Defense Department also was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out.

On Saturday, the Society of Professional Journalists also objected to the Pentagon's move, calling it “alarming.”

“This policy reeks of prior restraint — the most egregious violation of press freedom under the First Amendment — and is a dangerous step toward government censorship,” it said in a statement Saturday. “Attempts to silence the press under the guise of “security” are part of a disturbing pattern of growing government hostility toward transparency and democratic norms.”

And Matt Murray, executive editor of The Washington Post, said in the paper's columns Saturday that the new policy runs counter to what's good for the American public. 

“The Constitution protects the right to report on the activities of democratically elected and appointed government officials,” Murray said. “Any attempt to control messaging and curb access by the government is counter to the First Amendment and against the public interest.”

Many have been attempting to relocate from the city, where 1 million people once lived, to the southern Gaza Strip following Israeli military calls for a full evacuation. Hundreds of thousands remained in the city, the territory's largest and already in ruins from nearly two years of war and struggling with famine.

CAIRO (AP) — Israeli strikes in Gaza City and at a refugee camp killed more than 40 people, including 19 women and children, health officials said on Sunday, as several European countries and leading U.S. allies moved to recognize a Palestinian state.

Health officials at Shifa Hospital, where most of the bodies were brought, said the dead included 14 people killed in a strike late Saturday which hit a residential block in the southern side of the city. Health staff said a nurse who worked at the hospital was among the dead, along with his wife and three children.

Another strike that targeted a group of people in front of a clinic in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least eight Palestinians, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. The dead include four children and two women, the hospital said. Another 22 people were wounded, it said.

Israel did not comment on the strikes.

In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said Sunday that an Israeli drone strike in the southern city of Bint Jbeil killed five people, among them three children, and two others were wounded. No further details were given.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident.

Since Hezbollah and Israel's monthslong war ended in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November, Israel has struck southern Lebanon almost daily in what they say are attacks to target the Lebanese militant group. 

The Lebanese government has said that these strikes violate the ceasefire and hampers their efforts to gradually disarm the group.

The latest Israeli military operation, which began this week, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire further out of reach. The Israeli military, which has told Palestinians to leave, hasn't given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Israel says the operation is meant to pressure Hamas into freeing hostages and surrendering.

Ahead of the U.N. assembly, peace activists in Israel have hailed the planned recognition of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, a group of more than 60 Jewish and Arab organizations representing about 1,000 activists, including some veteran organizations promoting peace and coexistence, known as It's Time Coalition, called for an end to the war, the release of the hostages and the recognition of a Palestinian state. 

“We refuse to live forever by the sword. The UN decision offers a historic opportunity to move from a death trap to life, from an endless messianic war to a future of security and freedom for both peoples,” said the coalition in a video statement. 

On Saturday night, tens of thousands of people in Israel protested, calling for an end to the war and a hostage deal.

Yet a ceasefire remains elusive. Israeli bombardment over the past 23 months has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza, destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.

On Sunday, Australia, Canada and the U.K. announced formal recognition of Palestinian statehood. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move is intended “to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the announcement.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the establishment of a Palestinian state “will not happen.” In an angry statement after the coordinated initiative from the Commonwealth nations was announced, he accused the foreign leaders of giving a “prize” to Hamas.

“It will not happen,” he said. “A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.”

Other prominent Western countries are preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood at the gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. Netanyahu said he would announce Israel's response after a trip next week to the U.S., where he is to meet President Donald Trump at the White House.

In a statement Sunday, the military stated it killed Majed Abu Selmiya, who it said was a sniper for Hamas' military wing and was preparing to carry out more attacks in the Gaza City area, without providing evidence. 

Majed was the brother of the director of Shifa hospital, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, who called the allegations a lie and said Israel was trying to justify the killing of civilians. Dr. Selmiya told The Associated Press that his brother, 57, suffered from hypertension, diabetes and had vision problems. 

As the attacks continue, Israel has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City to move south to what it calls a humanitarian zone and opened another corridor south of the city for two days this week to allow more people to evacuate. 

Palestinians were streaming out of Gaza City by car and on foot, though many are unwilling to be uprooted again, too weak to leave or unable to afford the cost of moving.

Along the coastal Wadi Gaza route, those too exhausted to continue stopped to catch their breath and give their children a much-needed break from the difficult journey.

Aid groups have warned that forcing thousands of people to evacuate will exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. They are appealing for a ceasefire so aid can reach those who need it. 

Pope Leo XIV criticized what he described as the “forced exile” of Palestinians from Gaza, saying there was no future for the “martyred” Gaza Strip based on violence and vendetta. 

During his Sunday noon blessing, Leo issued another appeal for peace and expressed appreciation for the work of Catholic organizations active in helping Palestinians, which had representatives present in St. Peter's Square.

Families of hostages still held by Hamas have accused Netanyahu of condemning their loved ones to death by continuing to fight rather than negotiating an end to the war.

Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting that Israel's victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah “have opened a window for the possibility of peace with our neighbors to the north.”

“We are holding talks with the Syrians -- there is some progress, but still a vision for the future,” he said.

Israel has occupied parts of southwest Syria since the overthrow of then-Syrian President Bashar Assad in December. Relations with the new Syrian government have been tense, with Israel carrying out airstrikes over the summer in what it says were steps to protect Syria's Druze community.

Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an interview on Syrian state television on Sept. 12 that negotiations with Israel for a security deal are still ongoing. He hopes that Israeli troops will return to where they were before the fall of Assad's government under a disengagement agreement in 1974.

“Israel considered the fall of the regime as Syria's withdrawal from the 1974 agreement, even though Syria showed its commitment from the very beginning,” said al-Sharaa.

Miss America Cassie Donegan spoke to Fox News Digital about her win, responding to online trolls and how she wants to help create unity in a divided nation.

When Cassie Donegan was crowned Miss America, she never imagined her victory would be quickly overshadowed by a wave of criticism targeting her appearance.

Several users online quickly flooded social media with harsh critiques of Donegan's pageant makeup. They argued that the 28-year-old's look appeared heavy and harsh under the glaring stage lights. Some even claimed runner-up Sadie Schiermeyer, representing Texas, should have won instead.

Donegan, who represented New York at the competition on Sept. 7 in Orlando, Florida, told Fox News Digital she's not letting the hateful words get under her skin.

""Everyone has the right to their own opinion, especially in such a public forum like the internet. … Yes, there is that negativity out there, and that is their truth. They are allowed to have that opinion, and I respect that entirely. But I'm surrounded by so much love and so much support and so many people who are holding me up … I'm just not allowing [their negativity] to cloud the really incredible thing that's happening.""

""I'm able to look at these little girls and say, ‘I am not much different than you are right now, and you are so capable of doing anything you want to do,'"" she said. ""I want them to believe in themselves, because if they don't, no one else will. Empowerment really comes from within. And if there's even a small part of me that brings that spark out of them, then I've done my part. That will be something I will be grateful to be a part of.""

Miss America, a glitzy competition, was born from a 1921 Atlantic City beauty contest just a year after women were given the right to vote, the Associated Press reported. Many participants say the organization – a large provider of scholarship assistance to young women – has been life-changing, opening doors for them both personally and professionally.

The organization, one of the nation's most recognized brands, awards more than $5 million in cash scholarships annually, plus millions more at the national, state and local levels.

Last year's Miss America winner, Abbie Stockard of Alabama, crowned her successor. Donegan's win included a $50,000 tuition scholarship, plus an additional $3,000 scholarship for her performance in the preliminary talent competition.

Donegan said surrounding herself with people who ""pour positivity into you"" is key to combating hateful words online.

""I know it's really hard,"" she admitted. ""It's hard not to open my phone and want to go and see what people are saying, but curiosity really does kill the cat. … I once heard that other people's opinion of you is not your business. That is something that I've really tried to [live] by. Their opinion of me is valid because that is their truth, but it doesn't mean that it's my opinion of me.

The accomplished singer said she's developed thick skin over the years.

""I'm from a smaller town. We were a lower-income family,"" she said. ""We struggled a lot growing up. I dealt with bullying pretty badly. My mom had a lot of health problems. She had her first of multiple strokes when I was only nine years old. Some days, we didn't even know if certain utilities were going to be on. Some days they weren't on.""

""That's not necessarily the background that someone would think of when they look at something as glamorous as the Miss America opportunity from the outside,"" Donegan noted. ""But if you allow life and your circumstances to control your outcome, then it would potentially keep you from standing in spaces like Miss America.""

""I was not in a $10,000 gown,"" she continued. ""My talent outfit was given to me and was sponsored. The makeup I used, some of it came from drugstores. The other part was sponsored by an incredible makeup sponsor.

If even one person can understand that and believe that about themselves, that their circumstances do not decide their outcome … then I have been successful in my job this year.""

With Sunday's focus on the memorial for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona — an event that more than 100,000 people are expected to attend — University of Alabama students remembered Kirk for his faith and inspiration on Wednesday in their own ceremony.

A number of speakers took to the stage to address his legacy.

Former reality TV star Savannah Chrisley, conservative activist CJ Pearson, and political commentator Alexis Wilkins all spoke. 

CHARLIE KIRK LEAVES BEHIND POWERFUL CHRISTIAN FAITH LEGACY AFTER TRAGIC SHOOTING

Also making an address was Kieghan Nangle, 22, executive assistant to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Nangle, an Alabama alum, said Erika Kirk's strength has been and will continue to be an inspiration for scores of young women. 

""If Erika [Kirk] could stand before the world with power and bravery just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy,"" said a young Christian this week.  (Turning Point USA)

""Charlie's wonderful wife, Erika, needs an army behind her, and every person in this country has what it takes to rise to that occasion,"" Nangle said in her speech.

The Kirks married in May 2021. The couple has two children, a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son.

""If Erika could stand before the world with power and bravery, just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy,"" said Nangle.

Nangle said she was introduced to TPUSA in 2021 when she attended the Young Women's Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas.

""Charlie and TPUSA taught me and my peers lessons that I believe if they weren't taught, my generation's lives and our country would look very different today,"" Nangle told Fox News Digital.

""The organization taught me how to stand firm in my convictions.""

Many millennials and members of Gen Z are returning to church, reading Scripture and expressing a desire for greater spiritual depth, Fox News Digital previously reported. 

""The organization taught me how to stand firm in my convictions, stay rooted in my faith, and exhibit courageous pride in the best country in the world — America,"" she added.

TPUSA has said that campus chapter requests have surged by the thousands after Kirk's assassination, as Fox News Digital has reported.

""Our hard work of talking to students daily and bringing speakers to campus allowed organizations to boom on campus today, with over 300 people at their meeting this past week, and the organization is now the largest student-led organization on campus,"" said Nangle. 

""The organization was the outlet I didn't know I needed during college,"" she added.

Bill Belichick in his debut as HC for UNC was blown out by a score of 48-14. Colin Cowherd asks whether or not this was surprising, and what it means for the legendary head coach. 

Jordon Hudson may have given her boyfriend, North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick, a pep talk before his game against UCF, but it didn't work out for the Tar Heels on Saturday in Central Florida.

The Tar Heels were blown out 34-9 as UCF dominated on its home turf, dropping North Carolina to 2-2 in Belichick's inaugural college football coaching campaign.

Before the game, Hudson was spotted talking to Belichick on the sideline, which has become a common occurrence since his debut at North Carolina in another blowout loss to TCU earlier this season.

It's unclear what Hudson, 24, and Belichick, 73, were discussing on the field, but video captured Hudson whispering in Belichick's ear before kickoff.

""First of all, he did a great job with UCF today,"" Belichick said of coach Scott Frost after the loss. ""Their team played well, certainly better than we did. There were too many problems out there to be consistent.""

The Tar Heels allowed 13 unanswered points to start the game, putting them in an early hole. They managed a field goal late in the second quarter, but the damage was already done as UCF extended the lead after that.

TCU PLAYER TAUNTS BILL BELICHICK, JORDON HUDSON AFTER COACH'S UNC DEBUT LOSS: 'GOTTA CALL HIS GIRLFRIEND'

""There are a lot of things that we need to do a better job of, and they were just better than us today,"" Belichick added.

Gio Lopez, Belichick's quarterback, threw for only 87 yards with two interceptions before suffering a right leg injury in the third quarter that knocked him out of the game.

This was Belichick's first loss since his debut against the Horned Frogs. North Carolina turned the tide with a 20-3 win over Charlotte and blew out Richmond 41-6 last week to reach 2-1 entering Saturday.

Hudson has been a regular presence on the sideline before games despite some disagreeing with it when she was spotted before the TCU game. Her name was even mentioned by TCU player Bud Clark, who went viral after commenting on Instagram Live following the 48-14 rout.

""Belichick gotta call for his girlfriend,"" Clark, who had a pick-six in the win, was heard saying in a clip. ""…He sad.""

Hudson and Belichick created the wrong type of stir leading up to the 74-year-old coach's debut, most notably with a controversial ""CBS Sunday Morning"" interview.

Hudson said, ""We're not talking about that,"" when Belichick was asked how the couple met. Emails obtained by WRAL show Belichick addressing the controversy over his romantic and professional relationship with Hudson, where he claimed CBS ""secretly"" had a camera focused on her despite her request to sit off camera.

""I met Jordon randomly on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. That is no secret,"" Belichick wrote in another email. ""Jordon was not dodging the specific question regarding how we met, but rather was preventing the interview from continuing to probe into personal matters.""

Hudson also handles Belichick's off-the-field career opportunities, and since the relationship began, it has been the punchline of jokes at award shows as well as a storyline in the national sports media.

North Carolina football general manager Michael Lombardi insisted that Belichick's relationship with Hudson isn't a distraction for the program.

""I mean, a lot of it is just noise,"" he told ESPN Radio's ""Marty & McGee"" in June. ""And for us to be distracted by something that has no bearing, that has no relevance whatsoever, that is a complete falsehood, in terms of what people are saying or what they're writing. It's comical. And, for me, to really even attack anybody who's saying it, gives them credibility. Which I don't, because it's a completely false narrative.""

Rachel's Challenge founder Darrell Scott joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss how he has worked in his daughter's memory to save other children across the country and to share the message he has for other parents experiencing the same tragedy.

DENVER - A Colorado teenager who died tackling a school shooter to save his classmates is now being considered for sainthood — a move parishioners say reflects his extraordinary courage and faith.

Kendrick Castillo, 18, was killed on May 7, 2019, when he charged one of the gunmen who opened fire at STEM School Highlands Ranch, just days before graduation. His selfless act allowed classmates to subdue the attackers and prevented what could have been a much larger tragedy.

""You cannot overstate the heroism of Kendrick Castillo,"" George Brauchler, who prosecuted the case, told Fox News Digital. ""And on that particular day, if you said in classroom 107, who's going to be your hero that averts a mass murder? I don't know if he's in the top half. I just think that people would have written him off as not that guy, but he turns out to be that guy."" 

The shooting erupted inside a British literature class that had gathered to watch ""The Princess Bride"" as an end-of-year reward. Two assailants, Devon Erickson, then 18, and accomplice Alec McKinney, then 16, carried out the attack.

During the shooting, Castillo and fellow students Joshua Jones and Brendan Bialy rushed Erickson. After firing four shots, Erickson's weapon jammed.

Castillo was fatally shot in the struggle, but his actions gave classmates the chance to disarm the attackers. He was the only student killed, while eight others were injured.

Brauchler, who also prosecuted the Columbine High School and Aurora theater shooting, described Castillo as ""a miracle baby"" and the only child to his parents, John and Maria Castillo.

""They renamed the street near the school Kendrick Castillo Way,"" Brauchler said. ""And now he's cleared the first hurdle toward canonization in the Catholic Church he loved so much. It's really an incredible story.""

Erickson was later convicted on 46 counts, including first-degree murder, and faces life in prison without parole. McKinney, who testified against him, pleaded guilty and could be eligible for parole after about 20 years, according to the Associated Press.

After the verdict, Kendrick's father, John Castillo, said he felt his son's presence guiding the jury. ""I'm sure he was looking down today,"" he told the outlet. ""This day was justice for him.""

Former student Mitchell Kraus, who was wounded in the attack, recalled walking Erickson to the nurse's office just minutes before the shooting began. ""He never gave any indication something was about to happen,"" Kraus said. Now in college, Kraus said he feels closure knowing Erickson will never walk free again.

""Now that I can be sure that this monster, to be honest, is never going to see the light of day again, it's just a weight off my back,"" he said.

The Diocese of Colorado Springs, which oversees the area where the tragedy occurred, has formally received a petition to open Kendrick's cause for canonization, the National Catholic Register reported. 

Although Kendrick had deep ties to the Archdiocese of Denver, Church law designates the diocese where a person died to initiate the canonization cause. Since his death occurred in Highlands Ranch, the responsibility falls to the Colorado Springs Diocese.

Father Patrick DiLoreto of St. Mark Parish in Highlands Ranch said Castillo's sacrifice may qualify under Pope Francis' ""Offering of Life"" category — recognizing those who give their lives for love of God and neighbor, even outside of traditional martyrdom definitions.

""He [Castillo] courageously threw himself at one of the school shooters without hesitation, allowing other students to follow and subdue the gunman,"" DiLoreto explained. ""This saved the lives of his fellow classmates when, in any other circumstance, there would surely have been more deaths on that day.""

Castillo's devotion was well known in his parish. He carried a rosary daily, one of which was found on him after his death and later gifted to a classmate, the Register reported. He volunteered regularly, attended funerals of strangers to pray for them, and openly spoke of wanting to be a witness of faith.

Bishop James Golka of Colorado Springs praised those who gathered testimony about Kendrick's life. ""It seems clear that Kendrick was an exceptional young man,"" he said.

As America continues to face tragic acts of school violence, parishioners and leaders alike see Castillo's example as a source of strength.

""As the country faces more and more persecution of Christians, especially in these horrific school shootings, such as the one last week in Minnesota, we can look at the heroic examples such as Kendrick and the children who protected others for inspiration,"" Father DiLoreto finished.

""Pawn Stars"" boss Rick Harrison tells Fox News Digital how Las Vegas buffets are disappearing due to changing eating habits, while food halls become the new trend as fewer tourists are visiting.

For decades, Las Vegas buffets were a tourist jackpot. Today, food halls are a big draw.

Even ""Pawn Stars"" boss Rick Harrison has noticed the evolution of people's eating habits, calling the buffet's decline an example of ""Darwinism.""

""You know, 100 years ago, lobster was considered poor people's food, so everything has changed,"" Harrison told Fox News Digital in a video interview from his restaurant, Rick's Rollin Smoke Barbeque & Tavern. 

LAS VEGAS BUFFETS 'A DYING BREED' AS CASINOS PUSH 'YOUNGER AND COOLER' FOOD HALL OPTIONS

The once-famous buffets in Vegas have given way to trendy Strip food halls in recent years.

In 2020, Rio's Carnival World Buffet closed down before reopening as Canteen Food Hall in 2024.

ARIA Buffet also shuttered in 2020, reopening as Proper Eats Food Hall in 2022. 

The Big Top Food Court at Circus Circus, which opened in 2021, replaced a small portion of the venue's buffet.

Despite the changes, the menu at Harrison's restaurant leans on barbecue tradition – the kind that takes 16 hours in a smoker.

PRICED OUT IN LAS VEGAS? 5 COSTLY STEAKS THAT CAN CUT INTO TOURISTS' WALLETS

""We don't cut the time,"" Harrison saidl. ""It's not 15-and-a-half hours. It's not 15 hours and 45 minutes. It's 16 hours, every bit of it.""

Harrison said all the meat at his restaurant is locally sourced.

""We're kind of known for our burnt ends,"" he added. ""For people who don't know what the burnt ends [are], that's the fatty side of the brisket.""

Harrison said he was born and raised in North Carolina, which he called ""mostly the barbecue capital of the world.""

WHY SOME STEAKHOUSES ARE THRIVING WHILE OTHERS CAN'T KEEP DINERS COMING BACK: 'NOT JUST ABOUT THE FOOD'

His restaurant, which is next to the pawn shop, receives thousands of visitors every day, he said.

""People from overseas don't know about American barbecue, and when they find out about it, they absolutely love it,"" Harrison said.

Harrison said his Las Vegas restaurant is known for the burnt ends he serves (not pictured). (iStock)

With tourism numbers down in Vegas, many people have pointed to the expensive pricing, especially when it comes to food.

On that point, Harrison called the $1,000 steak ""the most ridiculous thing in the world.""

MORE FROM FOX NEWS LIFESTYLE

""I wouldn't fall for the gimmicks,"" he said, noting there are still places to eat ""a good ol' American steak"" for $50 to $80.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority recently released its numbers for July visitors, noting a 12% drop from last year.

There are still places in Vegas to eat ""a good ol' American steak"" for relatively reasonable prices, said Vegas insider Rick Harrison. (iStock)

There were 3,089,300 visitors in July compared to over 3.5 million last year, while occupancy on the Strip dropped 7% from 86.5% in 2024.

Harrison attributed the decrease to ""people skipping vacations"" due to inflation. 

The great thing about Vegas, he said, is the variety of food offerings.

""You have everything from a food court to five-star restaurants,"" Harrison said. 

""So, it's a little bit of everything here. … You got something for every budget here.""

CNN's Kaitlan Collins confronted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over her social media posts pertaining to the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a Friday episode of ""The Source.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., sparred with CNN host Kaitlan Collins on Friday over a video the liberal lawmaker shared on social media and her remarks about Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.  

Collins pressed Omar on why she reposted a video that said, ""Kirk was Dr. Frankenstein and his monster shot him through the neck.""

""Because there were a lot of things in the video that I did agree with. Obviously, we share videos. We don‘t have to agree with every single word, but I do believe he was a reprehensible, hateful man. Like, that is my view of the words that he has said about every single identity that I belong to. He didn‘t believe that we should have equal access to anything. He also just didn't even believe I could be smart enough, I could have thoughts that could be equal to a White man. Where are we missing this conversation about who this man was and the things that he said?"" 

Singling out Collins, Omar asked, ""How do you not… find that reprehensible, Kaitlan?""

Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 while speaking at a campus event in Utah.

ABC REPORTER CALLS CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN'S TEXT MESSAGES WITH TRANSGENDER PARTNER ‘VERY TOUCHING'

The lawmaker turned the question back to Collins, who said, ""Of course, I don't subscribe to that."" 

Omar asked Collins, ""You think I don't have the brain processing power like you or a White man?"" The CNN host said, ""Of course not"" as Omar asked her if she would find that reprehensible. 

""I'm not asking why you think he's reprehensible. I think you're obviously allowed to have your own views. That's why we have you on here so often. Because we like to hear your views and what you think on something. I just think it was the video where it called him Dr. Frankenstein and said his monster shot him through the neck. I mean, obviously, this is a person. And looking at this, this is someone who was a husband and a father. And in the days after his shocking death, that happened as a result of his views or happened as a result as he was sharing his views publicly with people, that people found it jarring to hear such criticism of that in the immediate aftermath of his death,"" Collins said. 

Omar said she found it jarring that people wanted to memorialize Kirk and excuse ""reprehensible things"" that he said.

PHIL MICKELSON CONDEMNS REP. ILHAN OMAR FOR CHARLIE KIRK INSULTS: 'HOPEFULLY SHE'LL BE SENT BACK TO SOMALIA'

""It is one thing to care about his life, because obviously so many people loved him, including his children and wife. But I am not going to sit here and be judged for not wanting to honor any legacy this man has left behind, that should be in the dustbin of history, and we should hopefully move on and forget the hate that he spewed every single day,"" Omar continued.

Omar was criticized over an interview she did with Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan after Kirk's assassination.

Omar expressed condolences for Kirk's family but went on to criticize him during the interview.

""But what I do know for sure is that Charlie Kirk was someone who once said, ‘Guns save lives' after a school shooting,"" Omar said. ""Charlie was someone who was willing to debate and downplay the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police … downplay slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth should never exist.""

Omar went on to lament that there are a ""lot of people who are out there talking"" about Kirk ""just wanting to have a civil debate,"" prompting Hasan to interject and call it a ""complete rewriting of history.""

President Donald Trump announced that he will nominate Lindsey Halligan for a U.S. attorney role in Virginia after withdrawing his previous pick ahead of the weekend.

“I will be nominating Lindsey Halligan to be the United States Attorney in this very important part of our Great Country. She will be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!” he posted on Truth Social.

Trump had been floating Halligan for the prosecutor job in the Eastern District of Virginia throughout the evening on Saturday, pitching her to Attorney General Pam Bondi as a “really good lawyer” who “likes you, a lot.”

That suggestion came hours after Bondi elevated another attorney, Mary “Maggie” Cleary, to the position in an acting capacity. Cleary had just started working in the Justice Department's Criminal Division earlier this month, after numerous stints as an attorney in the Commonwealth.

But Trump, underscoring the urgency for filling the role, ultimately went in a different direction, choosing one of his onetime attorneys and White House aides for a position that is investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James's alleged mortgage fraud in the state.

“We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” Trump said.

During her time in the White House, Halligan has been vetting content in the Smithsonian museums to ensure it aligns with Trump's vision, which is to “celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”

Before her current role, she represented Trump in his since-tossed classified documents case, and was at Mar-a-Lago during the FBI's raid on the property.

If Halligan is confirmed, she will take over an attorney's office that was previously led by Erik Siebert, who Trump fired after he received “UNUSUALLY STRONG” backing from Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.

On Saturday night, Trump trashed Siebert as a “Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job.”

“That's why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard,” he added.

An ABC News report, however, said Siebert was forced out after not finding incriminating evidence against James, who allegedly listed her Norfolk, Virginia, home as a “primary residence” to lock in a better mortgage rate.

Trump dismissed that characterization, saying Siebert “lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case [against James].”

“I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,” the president added.

James has not been charged in the investigation, which was launched in April, and has denied wrongdoing.

BONDI NAMES NEW VIRGINIA PROSECUTOR AFTER EARLIER TRUMP FIRING

Her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called Trump's firing of Siebert “illegal” in a statement on Friday.

“Punishing this prosecutor, a Trump appointee, for doing his job sends a clear and chilling message that anyone who dares uphold the law over politics will face the same fate,” Lowell said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump announced on Saturday night that Ben Carson will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Carson, a former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary before dropping out and later becoming his housing and urban development secretary, will receive the award during a White House ceremony at a later date.

“Congratulations, Ben. He didn't know this,” Trump said in a speech at an annual dinner of the American Cornerstone Institute, which was founded by Carson. “He didn't know it. I hope he's happy.”

The award, established by former President John F. Kennedy in 1963, is the nation's highest civilian honor.

Trump gave out the award to 24 people in his first term, including to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, golfing legend Tiger Woods, and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

Since the start of his second term, Trump has announced two other recipients for the honor, namely former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the late right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated just over a week ago.

TRUMP NOMINATES LINDSEY HALLIGAN FOR TOP VIRGINIA PROSECUTOR

While out of political office, Carson has since founded ACI, a think tank that promotes “conservative, commonsense solutions to the issues facing our society,” according to its website. He has also written numerous books, including most recently The Perilous Fight: Overcoming Our Culture's War on the American Family.

Carson also had a role in Trump's successful 2024 reelection campaign, appearing a few times on the trail and serving as his national faith chairman in the last couple of months before Election Day. He was earlier thought to be in the mix for Trump's running mate, a role that ultimately went to JD Vance.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What Women Wish They'd Known Before Trying to Get Pregnant","https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/09/sex-ed-school-fertility/684079/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Many Americans lack basic fertility knowledge. More robust sex ed could help.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Anna De Souza was in her early 30s, she asked her ob-gyn when she should start thinking about having kids. “When you were 26,” she remembers the doctor saying.

She was surprised. She'd had some sense that fertility decreases with age but didn't know how significant the drop-off was. No doctor had ever told her, and she certainly didn't learn about it in school. She took sex ed at her New Jersey high school in the late 1990s, but she said it focused mostly on trying to scare students out of having sex. She remembers little about the class besides watching a graphic VHS video of a woman giving birth.

De Souza, a journalist in Philadelphia, now wishes that class had included the basics of fertility and reproduction. A more robust sex-ed program, she thinks, could have prompted her to check her egg count or freeze her eggs when she was younger, or even try to have kids sooner. She ended up having twins at 36, after two rounds of IVF, and later a son, also through IVF. But if she'd known more about fertility earlier in her life, she might have tried for a family “the good, old-fashioned, fun way,” she said, “instead of the needles way.” Teenagers, she believes, should understand that just because they don't want kids at 16 doesn't mean they won't want kids ever.

She's far from the only person who feels this way. Fertility doctors and other experts told me that better sex education—with a curriculum that explains both how to prevent pregnancy and how to boost fertility—could help more families have the number of children they desire. This is especially essential as more people wait until they're older to start trying to have kids. According to the doctors I spoke with, many patients arrive at fertility clinics filled with misconceptions about their own reproductive biology. “It's been stunning how ill-informed so many people are,” Michael Zinaman, a reproductive endocrinologist in New York, told me.

Read: The questions sex-ed students always ask

The doctors I spoke with pointed to some things that they believe all women and men should know about fertility but in many cases don't. Most obvious, getting pregnant is easier when you're young. When women see stories in the media about female celebrities who have a baby at 50, Rashmi Kudesia, a reproductive endocrinologist in Houston, told me, they might assume it's likely to happen for them, too. Additionally, Kudesia said some of her patients don't realize that their being underweight or overweight can contribute to interfertility, as can untreated sexually transmitted infections. Or they don't know that doctors advise women to take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid—essential to the development of a fetus—even when they're only thinking about getting pregnant. Men should know, too, that lifestyle factors, including alcohol and tobacco use, can affect their sperm quality, which in turn can affect their partner's likelihood of getting pregnant.

Those who may end up trying to conceive later in life could benefit from even more information. Zinaman told me that many of his patients don't know that a woman has a brief window each month during which it's possible to get pregnant. Kudesia said that some of her patients come in with overly optimistic views of how well treatments such as IVF can work.

Surveys of women's knowledge of fertility lend support to these anecdotes. A 2023 study of nearly 1,800 women ages 18 to 29 found that only 59 percent knew the phase during the menstrual cycle when they were most likely to get pregnant, and most erroneously thought that a woman's ovaries continually make eggs until she reaches menopause. (Women are born with all of the eggs they'll ever have, and the eggs' quality and quantity diminish with time.) In a 2016 study of mostly low-income women, just over half knew what ovulation meant, and fewer than a third knew when it occurs. In a 2017 study, reproductive-age women correctly answered an average of only about 16 out of 29 fertility questions, covering topics such as the percentage of pregnancies that end in miscarriage and the lifestyle factors that decrease fertility. Women studying to become doctors fared little better, answering an average of only about 19 questions correctly, leading the authors to conclude that “fertility knowledge is low among U.S. women of reproductive age, including those with children and even among medical trainees.”

Even women who are actively trying to get pregnant tend to be underinformed: A 2021 review found that women who wanted to conceive had “low to moderate fertility knowledge.” In a 2022 study of women struggling to conceive, only a quarter correctly recognized the week during their cycle when they had the highest chance of getting pregnant. This lack of knowledge has real consequences: “A lot of the misunderstanding around fertility and reproductive health lends people to either not be able to have the family size that they desire,” Kudesia said, “or to have lost a lot of time along the way.”

That's in part why Kudesia and some other doctors think that fertility should be taught as a standard part of sex ed in schools. Although doctors could try to give patients this information themselves, most doctors' appointments are too brief for a long lecture on ovulation, and some patients don't bring up fertility challenges until after they've started trying to have a baby. “What I hear all the time is people thinking that, Well, if my age is a concern with regards to fertility, my doctor will bring it up to me,” she said. “And that's definitely not a fair assumption.” What's more, doctors who specialize in fertility often have long wait times for appointments, and some don't accept insurance, putting their counsel out of reach for many. Better sex ed in middle school and high school, including lessons on ovulation and fertility cycles, could help make people aware, earlier in their life, of the factors they need to consider if they eventually want to have children. Fertility education in school also has the potential to reach far more people than individual doctors can; not everyone goes to the doctor every year, but almost everyone goes to middle school and high school.

Fertility-education efforts haven't been studied extensively, but the limited research that does exist suggests that they can be effective. Studies from Canada, Spain, and Japan found that exposure to information about fertility at least temporarily increased young adults' knowledge of the topic. Conversely, the consequences of educators not broaching the topic in schools can be significant: In a 2019 study based on interviews with 54 American women experiencing infertility, several noted the “conspicuous absence of conversations about reproductive health and fertility from their schools' sex education.” One 39-year-old woman told the study's authors that if she and her husband had known more about fertility earlier, “we would not have waited so long before trying to conceive.”

Some places have already implemented more robust sex ed in their schools. California recently enacted a Know Your Period law, modeled after a similar law in Washington, D.C., which requires schools to teach all middle- and high-school students about the menstrual cycle and menopause. And about 500 school districts across the country use a comprehensive curriculum called Rights, Respect, Responsibility, which covers menstruation, the fertile window, and how an embryo implants in a uterus. Kudesia praised one lesson from the curriculum as “excellent,” saying it “seemed like an age-appropriate way of discussing things.” She told me, “When we're in high school or younger, we often get the impression that if you just touch a boy, you're going to get pregnant.” A more well-rounded sex-ed curriculum would show that it's not quite that simple.

But these programs face the same headwinds that sex ed in general contends with. Attempts to expand sex ed in schools typically fail for a few reasons, among them that some school districts can't afford to train teachers and develop or purchase additional curricula about sexuality, and anything having to do with sex and bodies can be highly contentious among parents. Kudesia noted that the Rights, Respect, Responsibility curriculum might not be popular in today's political climate, because it includes discussions of gender identity, a fact that the curriculum has been scrutinized for in the past.

The Trump administration, too, is keen on the idea of fertility education, though not primarily through school-based sex ed: In April, The New York Times reported that a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation proposed to the White House that it use government funds to educate women about their menstrual cycles. And in July, the Times wrote that the administration was offering a $1.5 million grant to start an “infertility training center” aimed at helping women conceive. But Robin Jensen, a University of Utah communications professor who has researched sex ed, points out that these programs seem as if they're aiming to increase the U.S. birth rate and not to also help people prevent pregnancy, if they desire. “Fertility education is needed in sex education,” Jensen told me. “But it needs to be the kind that is designed to increase fertility awareness and knowledge across the board rather than the kind that offers only part of the story.”

Young people themselves seem to want to have this more expansive, impartial information about reproduction. The idea for California's period bill came from a high-school student, Sriya Srinivasan, who had stopped menstruating for three years, didn't understand why, and felt too embarrassed to ask her doctor. She told me that she thinks kids should have a place to learn about reproduction other than the internet—a place where, as she put it about a hypothetical student, “I can sit and listen to this, and I don't have to feel that stigma or shame from searching it up online myself, or I don't have to feel the stigma of my family shaming me.” Ideally, Srinivasan and other teenagers would come away from sex ed understanding both how not to get pregnant and how to get pregnant: basic information about the human body that the body's owner deserves to know.

Whose daddy is paying for all this?

Ole Miss, as is perhaps well known, is in the heartland of beautiful girls. We know this to be true if we are followers—however casually—of something called RushTok, and we know it to be enduringly true because the above sentence was written by Terry Southern in 1963, in “Twirling at Ole Miss,” which was published in Esquire and then included in Tom Wolfe's essential 1973 anthology, The New Journalism. Let it be therefore established that among the various subcultures of the Deep South, even one as cotton-candy thick and Jolly Rancher wide as sorority rush is worthy of journalistic attention.

RushTok, which took off four years ago and chronicles the adventures of young women rushing the powerhouse sororities of southern universities, is now in its late-baroque phase. (Joan Didion was repeatedly told she arrived “just in time” when she went to study the San Francisco–hippie movement in 1967. “The whole fad's dead now, fini, kaput.”) Those of us who got in at the beginning were observing something being freshly transformed into content, still trailing mists of its previous, unobserved state. This was before sorority rush was turned into reality television and podcasts and exposés and brand endorsements, and before the introduction of new characters, such as rush mothers and rush coaches, and before rush became a launch pad not only to a successful social life but also to a chance at TikTok stardom and the busy, profitable life of an influencer.

Some of the most popular content on RushTok is the OOTD (“outfit of the day,” a term of the young) worn by the PNM (“potential new member,” a term of the old, emanating, one assumes, from the managerial class up there at the organizations' national offices and at the almighty National Panhellenic Conference). The commitment to a dominant style by these southern PNMs is as unvarying as it was in the days of the imperial espadrille and the gold-circle pin, but in its substance, that style has changed completely. Only the mildest trace of southern prep remains, the rest replaced by its opposite: pure femininity. The new look is Hilton Head brunch, country-club Tennessee. It's sexy, but in a sense it's more of a mood than a look: a little bit pampered, a little bit willful.

The outfits are composed of bright little wisps of clothes worn with sparkly rain showers of delicate jewelry: bangle bracelets clacking together, Kendra Scott jewelry—delicate must-haves with colored stones functioning more as amulet than as embellishment. The look is headbands, blowouts, lots of extensions, and enough bleachy highlights for an advancing army of blondes. We are face-to-face with “conventional beauty standards,” but we are alone with our phones and can freely think, Conventional though they may be, these girls look pretty good.

On an OOTD video, the PNM—alone or taking turns in groups of three or four—stands in front of the camera, tapping a finger against every single thing she's wearing and reporting where she bought it. She likes lacy, girly dresses from LoveShackFancy, which seems to have a symbiotic relationship with RushTok: Over the past four years, it has become a major brand. She loves a venerable Alabama vendor called the Pants Store (“They started buying pants from me and they just called it ‘The Pants Store,'” its founder said), which now includes a Rush Shop selling whimsy in the form of pastel rompers and minidresses with polka dots and ruffles. She likes canvas sneakers, flip-flops, loose shorts with tight belts, and blinding-white T-shirts. She likes hot orange and royal blue and lilac: madras deconstructed, an unwitting evocation of decades past.

There's a strong preference for cheap fashion from mass retailers, which are named without a trace of shame or of the bargain hunter's savvy. My shoes and earrings are Amazon, she'll say. My belt is Zara; my skirt is Shein. (Shein's extremely short, beaded miniskirts owned rush on a national level this year, and you don't want to be one second over the age of 22 if you try to wear one.)

If fast fashion provides the undercoat, the paint itself has many expensive touches. The girls love David Yurman bracelets in the famous cable style, which actually is preppy and starts at $275. (In fact, that bracelet is an economic indicator of whether you should be rushing at all: At Alabama, the average new-member fee is almost $5,000.) Golden Goose sneakers are still, somewhat witlessly, very popular. (Do they not know that the Ageist, a magazine dedicated to the interests of “any generation above the age of 40,” ran an article three years ago reporting that “Golden Goose Sneakers Have Hit Our People”?) Most of those sneakers start at about $500 and go up steeply.

But she'll very often go from the highs of David Yurman to the airless heavens of Chanel, Tiffany, Dior, Gucci. “My necklace is Van Cleef,” one woman says, tapping what looks to be an Alhambra necklace from Van Cleef & Arpels, which is the kind of thing a rich man gives to his wife when she turns 40 or catches him having an affair—not to his 18-year-old daughter who's going to run around a college campus with it.

This isn't Dubai; it's Tuscaloosa.

Destinee Wilson runs a TikTok account that totals up the price of OOTDs, pausing the videos every time the PNM mentions an item to report its retail price:

“My dress is from Free People.” (Wilson: “$128.”) “My shoes are New Balance.” (“$90.”) “My watch is Omega.” (“$23,900.”) “My bracelet is David Yurman.” (“$495.”) “My necklace is from Tiffany.” (“$1,025.”) “These bracelets are Enewton.” (“$206.”) “This is David Yurman.” (“$250.”) “And my cute little rush bag is from Case-Mate.” (“$100.”)

The grand total for the look: $26,194.

Wilson is assiduously neutral on the question of whether these things are authentic or dupes. But why would the girls be so forthcoming about Amazon and Shein only to lie about Van Cleef & Arpels?

Wilson's account has received many ugly messages from people upset about its existence. That she is Black and the PNMs are almost entirely white lends some tension to her videos. Last year she made a defiant post: “I will no longer be taking down any price breakdowns,” she said. “I'm trying to destigmatize talking about money, talking about prices. Things cost money, you guys.” In August, People reported that she earns up to $8,000 a month from her social media and her storefront on Amazon, where she offers low-price alternatives to some of the items featured in the videos.

Her account feels like a revolution; it's definitely the best thing on RushTok. That she's also the assistant director of a high-school marching band in North Texas, with an Amazon wish list of things she would like for her students—glue sticks; hair spray; 21 large, white hair bows—makes its own quiet statement.

In the category of “affordable luxury” that PNMs want, one item stands tall: the Case-Mate jelly totes many of these girls use to carry everything they might need for a day—and night—of rushing. (The oil-blotting papers! The extra shoes! The portable fan, portable charger, Listerine strips, mini perfume, touch-up lip color and blush, body spray, deodorant, water bottle, auxiliary battery packs for the iPhone. Don't forget the Band-Aids and—God forbid!—the tampons.) These translucent carryalls (about $100) come in a range of colors, with coordinating grosgrain ribbons—the widest, most luxurious grosgrain ribbons you've ever seen in your life—for tying the bag closed with a big, loopy bow. The first time I saw one, I thought I would faint; it was like seeing heaven.

Rush moms are apparently fried with anxiety, and I don't blame them. My life has been rich and uncomplicated because I have only sons, but if I did have a daughter and her very first college hurdle was going to be—let's cut the shit—a beauty contest, I'd be out of my mind too.

Given how freaked out these families are about rush, I wondered how they stood up to the knives-out stress of college admission itself. But then I discovered that many of these schools aren't very hard to get into. The University of Alabama admits about 75 percent of its applicants. All you have to do is fill out an application and send in $40 and your transcript. Test scores are optional. No essay, no recommendations, no emergency calls to the marriage counselor.

In contrast, the sororities have developed a parallel, dream-time system of admission. You cannot believe how many things you have to submit to the Alabama Panhellenic Association to rush. I will say only that it includes $375, something called a “social resumé,” and a digital photograph—“preferably a headshot (no selfies).”

RushTok has hours of advice on how to conduct yourself, usually posted by young alumni of the system, one of whom explains: “You want your recruiter's first thought to be, ‘Oh my gosh, this girl is so sweet.'”

One video says: Don't get too hung up on your wardrobe; it's really not that important. What does matter? Accessories. “If you have a cool hair clip or piece of jewelry that someone can compliment you on and be like, ‘I love your necklace, that's so pretty. Where did you get it?' and you can turn that into an interesting story.” (I got it off Amazon, and—funny story—I was watching The Yogurt Shop Murders at the same time.)

The PNM must present herself as an innocent, or at least willing to approximate innocence, in part by avoiding strapless dresses and in part by never mentioning the four horsemen of recruitment apocalypse, the B's: boys, booze, bucks, and beliefs.

Politics, sex, religion, and money are what—we are often told—one was never supposed to discuss in polite society during some more restrained era of American life, so these girls will be set if they get invited to a Charleston supper club in 1957. It raises a question: What kind of future (or past) are these young women preparing themselves to enter?

Tradwives, I hear you yelp in horror. They're all going to be tradwives! 

It's true that these sorority girls are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce than the average American woman, but probably no more or less so than the young women who rushed “tent city” at Columbia. It's the college degree that is most predictive of these behaviors.

Educated and ambitious young conservative and MAGA women, such as many of those who pledge southern sororities, have every reason to consider a big professional life, a professional-class husband, and a nanny as being in their future. Some of the biggest jobs in the Trump administration are held by women, including: White House chief of staff; U.S. attorney general; director of national intelligence; secretaries of homeland security, education, labor, and agriculture; and the administrator of the Small Business Association. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, went back to work four days after giving birth and has said, “I would reject that you can't be a good mom and be good at your job.”

For a Wall Street Journal article called “The Conservative Women Who Are ‘Having It All,'” Pamela Paul interviewed more than a dozen young conservative women, all of whom said that the tradwife lifestyle was never a choice they seriously considered for themselves; Paul writes that “they always knew they wanted children and that they also wanted a meaningful career.”

One of the women she interviewed is Katie Britt, the youngest-ever Republican woman elected to the Senate. Britt attended the University of Alabama, where she was president of her sorority and of the student body.

As cowed as the Bambi-like PNMs may appear in their original videos, membership itself seems to make showgirls of them all. Have you seen the huge production numbers these places make as recruitment tools? To a pumping beat, an entire sorority appears in front of the house. The front line performs the kind of explosive, acrobatic moves we first learned about in Cheer, Season 1, while the others commence something like a Las Vegas revue from the 1980s. They look strong, sexual, unafraid of underage drinking or boys. They will not be driven out of public life easily—not after learning all those dance numbers, gathering all that bravado, and cultivating the kind of personal style that clearly opens doors these days.

The girl who more or less created RushTok and became its breakout star is Kylan Darnell. She entered rush as a freshman who had pageant experience and brought a lightly professionalized manner to her OOTD, in which she looked very young and very pretty. She eventually consolidated her extremely positive approach to life in the mantra “I hope you're having a great day, not just a good day.”

Now she is a senior, that fleeting, fragile state in which college seems at once too small for you and more precious than rubies. She recently posted a video while walking across campus in a halter top. “Y'all, my life is so weird,” she said. “It doesn't feel real. Because how do you go from being at probably the best nightclub in Vegas, sitting at the most expensive table, getting everything for free just because of the way that you and your friends look, and dancing with Heidi Klum's daughter and Marshmello”—the DJ, not the confectionery—“all at the same time that night to me having an eight-page essay due tonight?”

There was a time when this kind of exploit would horrify parents, making them fear that their daughter had become cheap, ruined. But today? Secretary of energy.

We have a sense, sometimes, that America has become so homogenized through consumer culture and generalized depravity that we've lost any sense of regionalism, of ways of speaking and doing things that are particular to only one part of the country. But rush in the SEC schools is proof that certain old southern patterns endure.

The system reinforces many long-standing southern ideals: the importance of social connections over academic excellence; the notion that strong relationships flourish in closed societies; the emphasis on regional belonging over national competition; and above all the cloistering of young white women.

We can hardly leave this subject without noticing that the sororities of RushTok are the historically white ones, although, when it comes to several of these schools, they might also be called the currently white ones. It's very hard to find a nonwhite girl in those production numbers and OOTDs.

You would think that the University of Alabama, in particular, would have some anxieties about this fact, considering that just more than 60 years ago it was where George Wallace made his most famous stand against integration, blocking the doors of an administration building to prevent two Black students from registering for classes and budging from his spot only when forced to by federalized National Guard troops.

In 2013, according to the university's student newspaper, a very qualified young Black woman rushed these sororities at Alabama and didn't get a single bid. A former director of Greek life told Time magazine that it wasn't the current sorority students who had kept her out; rather, it was pressure from alumni: “There's definitely some fear, whether real or imagined, that there would be some repercussions if a sorority took an African-American member.”

These sororities, like the historically white fraternities, stand on their members' right to freedom of association, which allows them to socialize with whomever they want. (The segregationists' rationale: freedom of association.) But after the story broke in 2013, the university ordered sororities to reopen their bidding, and offers were extended to several Black women. The university did not respond to a request to comment, but as of a few years ago, of the 7,481 women in the Alabama Panhellenic Association, just 56 were Black.

But enough of all that! We are having fun. We are looking at pretty girls dressed up in LoveShackFancy dresses. This is America in 2025, not 1963. Lighten up, reader!

The conclusion of Alabama rush is an event in which all of the PNMs open their bids at the same time and then run to their new chapter house. These buildings are giant wedding cakes, and they are fortresses, and many of them have crystal chandeliers and wide, sweeping staircases big enough for a hundred Scarlett O'Haras to make a thousand dramatic entrances.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The most life-changing feature on your phone is hiding in “Accessibility.”

As a person firmly ensconced in middle age — 57 percent of the way through life, to be precise, if government actuarial tables hold — I have begun to notice certain things not working quite as well as they used to. Specifically, my eyes and my ears.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

You can ask my family: My hearing is not what it once was, and not just because I have been known to hear selectively from time to time. As for my eyes, I had them zapped with lasers back in 2005, but the increasing squint as I read tells me the warranty may have expired on that. And I'm not alone — about 14 percent of Americans between 45 and 64 experience hearing loss in some way, while over 90 percent of those over 45 suffer from presbyopia, or the declining ability to focus on near objects. Globally, the World Health Organization projects that by 2050 nearly 2.5 billion people will have some form of hearing loss.

But I have good news for fellow aging people (which is, well, all of us eventually.) Our digital gadgets are increasingly being designed with features that can help users overcome both the usual sensory declines of age and more severe disabilities and diseases. From Apple AirPods that can act as inexpensive hearing aids — and now, on-the-go translators — to the growing ubiquity of continuous glucose monitors for diabetics, some of the most promising uses of consumer tech involve propping up our failing organic meat-sacks.

The biggest consumer tech nudge from “nice to have” toward “health tool” happened last year: the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the first over-the-counter hearing-aid software. It's called “Hearing Aid Feature,” and it allows adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to use compatible AirPods as OTC hearing aids. Given that even over-the-counter hearing aids can run from several hundred dollars to over $1,000, a roughly $200 pair of AirPod Pro 2s can feel like a bargain. For more complex hearing loss, the audiologist still matters, but the FDA's endorsement lowers stigma and price barriers for millions who won't (or can't) get clinical devices.

And those same buds now speak multiple languages. Apple's new Live Translation, part of this fall's “Apple Intelligence” rollout, pipes two-way conversation translation straight through your AirPods when paired to an iPhone. In demos and early reviews it's already proven good enough for everyday use, translating in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, with more languages promised. For anyone who's ever tried to navigate a medical form, a parent-teacher conference, or a pharmacy pickup in a second language, this is less a party trick and more a social ramp.

Public places are catching up, too. Auracast — Bluetooth's broadcast audio standard — turns loud, crowded public venues into accessible listening zones. Instead of borrowing sticky headsets at a theater, you can join a labeled audio stream with your own earbuds or hearing aids. Google has baked Auracast support into Android 16, and Pixel phones are starting to make “join broadcast” feel as normal as hopping on wifi. That's dignity, not just decibels.

Our eyes are, if anything, almost as bad as our ears: at least 2.2 billion people around the world have some form of vision impairment. And our addiction to digital devices is actively making that worse: Studies have found that a daily 1-hour increment of digital screen time is associated with 21 percent higher odds of myopia, or nearsightedness.

But if phones are the cause of at least some of our vision problems, they have added features that can help people with vision impairment navigate the world. On the iPhone, the built-in Magnifier app harnesses the device's camera to do some beautifully practical things; Door Detection announces a door's distance and how it opens; Point and Speak reads the labels on physical buttons when you aim your finger, decoding all too often inscrutable kiosks. And while automatic translation requires iPhones advanced (and expensive) enough to use Apple Intelligence, these are stock features, not add-ons.

Over on Android, Google's Lookout app now goes beyond “what's in this picture?” to truly useful follow-ups for the vision impaired. Image Q&A lets you ask for details about an image and get spoken, more helpful answers, and Google says those descriptions are now powered by its newer Gemini AI models. That translates to daily autonomy: “Is this the blue shirt?” “What does the sign say?” “Where's the submit button?”

The consumer-to-care transition is happening in chronic disease, too. Continuous glucose monitors — medical implants that track glucose levels — have been available for diagnosed diabetics for some time. But in 2024, the FDA cleared the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor, Dexcom's Stelo, for adults who don't use insulin (which includes diabetics who control their illness with oral medication and people who may be pre-diabetic). A few months later, the medical devices company Abbott won clearance for two over-the-counter sensors: Libre Rio (specifically for adults with type 2 diabetes not using insulin) and Lingo (which is aimed more at the wellness crowd).

No prescription needed; just a phone and a sensor. For the 38 million Americans with diabetes — and the much larger group with pre-diabetes — that makes it simple to see how breakfast or a walk affects your glucose curve. Just remember that data is not a diagnosis.

These new technologies don't just represent more convenience — they could literally make people healthier. Take hearing assistance: A landmark NIH-funded randomized trial found that in older adults at higher risk, treating hearing loss slowed cognitive decline over three years. That doesn't turn earbuds into dementia shields, but it does show the value of removing hurdles to hearing support. The same is true for diabetes, which requires lifelong management. Anything that makes that easier can help improve lives.

Progress is when people no longer need expensive specialty devices; they can get the same benefits from the polished, affordable things they already own. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or low-vision, managing conditions like diabetes, or just getting up there in years like me, that rewiring adds up to something radical: more agency with less hassle.

Now if only someone could design an implant that would instantly locate my remote control.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the real estate industry might hold the secret to making robotaxis work financially","https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-self-driving-car-fleets-financial-model-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 09:45:01 GMT","

One of the biggest questions facing Uber and other companies experimenting with self-driving cars is who will own and maintain all those vehicles without gig workers. 

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the real estate industry could offer one possible answer to the problem.

While speaking this month at a summit hosted by the ""All-In"" podcast, Khosrowshahi fielded a question about how Uber would handle ownership of the self-driving cars that it plans to add to its operations in the coming years. All-In posted a video of the conversation on Wednesday.

""You're going to have financial owners that own big fleets of cars that are on our network,"" Khosrowshahi said.

""All of these cars are going to be financeable,"" he said.

Before becoming Uber's top executive, Khosrowshahi was CEO of travel search site Expedia. He said that major hotel brands like Hilton or Marriott don't typically own their hotels. Like other commercial real estate properties, such as shopping malls, hotels are often owned by real estate investment trusts, or REITs.

""Those hotels are owned by financial-only players,"" Khosrowshahi said at the event.

The trusts typically handle many of the expenses of owning the properties, such as maintenance and taxes, while receiving income through rent.

A decade from now, some investors could play a REIT-like role for companies that use lots of self-driving vehicles, Khosrowshahi said at the All-In event.

Uber's current ride-hailing business has become profitable in part because the company has avoided owning many of its most important assets.

The company's ride-hailing drivers are independent contractors who use their own cars to shuttle passengers around cities or deliver food to customers' doors. Uber pays the drivers for each gig that they complete.

While some drivers are eligible for Uber benefits like gas discounts, they are responsible for their own vehicle costs.

While human Uber drivers will likely be around for years, Khosrowshahi also said at the summit that self-driving cars could eventually leave many people out of work. What comes next for those workers represents ""a big, big societal question,"" he said.

For Uber, the challenge will be finding a business model that has all the benefits of self-driving cars while owning as little as possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Behind Grok's 'sexy' settings, workers review explicit and disturbing content","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-grok-explicit-content-data-annotation-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 13:22:00 GMT","

Elon Musk's xAI has designed its Grok chatbot to be deliberately provocative. It has a flirtatious female avatar that can strip on command, a chatbot that toggles between ""sexy"" and ""unhinged"" modes, and an image and video generation feature with a ""spicy"" setting.

The workers who train xAI's chatbot have seen firsthand what it means to carry out this vision. In conversations with more than 30 current and former workers across a variety of projects, 12 told Business Insider they encountered sexually explicit material — including instances of user requests for AI-generated child sexual abuse content (CSAM).

Sexual material and CSAM crop up across nearly every major tech platform, but experts say xAI has made explicit content part of Grok's DNA in ways that set it apart. Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, which largely block sexual requests, xAI's strategy could complicate things when it comes to preventing the chatbot from generating CSAM.

""If you don't draw a hard line at anything unpleasant, you will have a more complex problem with more gray areas,"" Riana Pfefferkorn, a tech policy researcher at Stanford University, told Business Insider.

Business Insider verified the existence of multiple written requests for CSAM from what appeared to be Grok users, including requests for short stories that depicted minors in sexually explicit situations and requests for pornographic images involving children. In some cases, Grok had produced an image or written story containing CSAM, the workers said.

Workers said that they're told to select a button on an internal system to flag CSAM or other illegal content so that it can be quarantined and to prevent the AI model from learning how to generate the restricted content. More recently, workers have been told they should also alert their manager.

Many workers, including the 12 who said they encountered NSFW content, said they signed various agreements consenting to exposure to sensitive material. The agreements covered projects geared toward adult content and general projects that involved annotating Grok's overall image generation or text generation capabilities, as explicit content could pop up at random.

One document reviewed by Business Insider said that workers might encounter the following content: ""Media content depicting pre-pubescent minors victimized in a sexual act, pornographic images and/or child exploitation; Media content depicting moment-of-death of an individual,"" and written descriptions of sexual and physical abuse, hate speech, violent threats, and graphic images.

Fallon McNulty, executive director at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Business Insider that companies focused on sexual content need to take extra care when it comes to preventing CSAM on their platforms.

""If a company is creating a model that allows nudity or sexually explicit generations, that is much more nuanced than a model that has hard rules,"" she said. ""They have to take really strong measures so that absolutely nothing related to children can come out.""

It's unclear whether the volume of NSFW content or CSAM increased after xAI introduced its ""Unhinged"" and ""Sexy"" Grok voice functions in February. Like other AI firms, xAI tries to prevent AI-generated CSAM. Business Insider was unable to determine whether xAI data annotators review more such material than their counterparts at OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta.

Musk has previously called the removal of child sexual exploitation material his ""priority #1"" when discussing platform safety for X.

The team that trains Grok has had a tumultuous month. Over 500 workers were laid off; several high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated; and the company appears to be moving away from generalists toward more specialized hires. It's not clear if the shifting structure of the team will change its training protocols. Musk recently posted on X that training for Grok 5 will begin ""in a few weeks.""

Representatives for xAI and X, which merged with xAI this past March, did not respond to a request for comment.

XAI's tutors review and annotate hundreds of images, videos, and audio files to improve Grok's performance and make the chatbot's output more realistic and humanlike. Like content moderators for platforms like YouTube or Facebook, AI tutors often see the worst of the internet.

""You have to have thick skin to work here, and even then it doesn't feel good,"" a former worker said. They said they quit this year over concerns about the amount of CSAM they encountered.

Some tutors told Business Insider that NSFW content has been difficult to avoid on the job, whether their tasks involve annotating images, short stories, or audio. Projects originally intended to improve Grok's tone and realism were at times overtaken by user demand for sexually explicit content, they said.

XAI has asked for workers willing to read semi-pornographic scripts, three people said. The company has also asked for people with expertise in porn or for people willing to work with adult content, five people said.

Shortly after the February release of Grok's voice function — which includes ""sexy"" and ""unhinged"" versions — workers began transcribing the chatbot's conversations with real-life users, some of which are explicit in nature, as part of a program internally referred to as ""Project Rabbit,"" workers said.

Hundreds of tutors were brought into Project Rabbit. It briefly ended this spring, but temporarily returned with the release of Grok companions, including a highly sexualized character named ""Ani,"" and a Grok app for some Tesla owners. The project appeared to come to an end in August, two people said.

The workers with knowledge of the project said it was initially intended to improve the chatbot's voice capabilities, and the number of sexual or vulgar requests quickly turned it into an NSFW project.

""It was supposed to be a project geared toward teaching Grok how to carry on an adult conversation,"" one of the workers said. ""Those conversations can be sexual, but they're not designed to be solely sexual.""

""I listened to some pretty disturbing things. It was basically audio porn. Some of the things people asked for were things I wouldn't even feel comfortable putting in Google,"" said a former employee who worked on Project Rabbit.

""It made me feel like I was eavesdropping,"" they added, ""like people clearly didn't understand that there's people on the other end listening to these things.""

Project Rabbit was split into two teams called ""Rabbit"" and ""Fluffy."" The latter was designed to be more child-friendly and teach Grok how to communicate with children, two workers said. Musk has said the company plans to release a child-friendly AI companion.

Another worker who was assigned to an image-based initiative called ""Project Aurora"" said the overall content, particularly some of the images they had to review, made them feel ""disgusting.""

Two former workers said the company held a meeting about the number of requests for CSAM in the image training project. During the meeting, xAI told tutors the requests were coming from real-life Grok users, the workers said.

""It actually made me sick,"" one former worker said. ""Holy shit, that's a lot of people looking for that kind of thing.""

Employees can opt out of any project or choose to skip an inappropriate image or clip, and one former worker said that higher-ups have said workers would not be penalized for choosing to avoid a project.

Earlier this year, several hundred employees opted out of ""Project Skippy,"" which required employees to record videos of themselves and grant the company access to use of their likeness, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.

Still, before the mass opt-outs of Project Skippy, six workers said that declining to participate in projects could be difficult. They said it required them to reject assignments from their team lead, which they worried could result in termination.

Four other former workers said the company's human resources team narrowed the flexibility for opting out in an announcement on Slack earlier this year.

As a consequence of the AI boom, regulators have seen an uptick in reports of AI-generated content involving child sexual abuse, and it has become a growing issue across the industry. Lawmakers are figuring out how to address a variety of AI-generated content, whether it's purely fictional content or an individual using AI to alter real-life images of children, Pfefferkorn, the Stanford researcher, said.

In an ongoing class action complaint against Scale AI — which provides training and data annotation services to major tech firms like Alphabet and Meta — workers accused the company of violating federal worker safety laws by subjecting contractors to distressing content. In 2023, Time reported that OpenAI was using data annotators in Kenya to review content that included depictions of violent acts and CSAM. Spokespeople for OpenAI and Meta said the companies don't allow content that harms children on their platforms.

Many AI companies have safety teams that perform a task called ""red teaming,"" a process dedicated to pushing AI models to the limit to guard against malicious actors that could prompt the chatbots to generate illegal content, from bomb-making guides to pornographic content involving minors. In April, xAI posted several roles that involved red teaming.

Allowing an AI model to train off illegal material would be risky, Dani Pinter, senior vice president and director of the Law Center for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, told Business Insider. ""For training reasons alone, they should be very cautious about letting that type of content in their machine learning portal,"" Pinter said, adding that it's important the chatbots are trained not to spit back CSAM in response to user requests.

""The drum we're beating right now is, it's time to practice corporate responsibility and implementing safety with innovation,"" Pinter said. ""Companies can't be recklessly innovating without safety, especially with tools that can involve children.""

NCMEC said in a blog published early September that it began tracking reports of AI-generated CSAM in 2023 from social media sites and saw a surge in reports from AI companies last year. Companies are strongly encouraged to report these requests to the agency, even if the content doesn't depict real children. The Department of Justice has already started pursuing cases involving AI-generated CSAM.

In 2024, OpenAI reported more than 32,000 instances of CSAM to NCMEC, and Anthropic reported 971.

Spokespeople for Anthropic and OpenAI told Business Insider that the companies don't allow CSAM and have strict policies in place to prevent it.

XAI did not file any reports in 2024, according to the organization. NCMEC told Business Insider it has not received any reports from xAI so far this year. It said it has received reports of potentially AI-generated CSAM from X Corp.

NCMEC said it received about 67,000 reports involving generative AI in 2024, compared with 4,700 the year before. In the blog published last week, the organization said it had already received 440,419 reports of AI-generated CSAM as of June 30, compared with 5,976 during the same period in 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","3 tech workers on H-1B visas detail their last 36 hours: canceled trips, anxious parents, and, finally, relief","https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-holders-big-tech-last-anxiety-trump-eo-india-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:24:00 GMT","

On Friday, the White House announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, sparking a wave of confusion and panic as companies and workers scrambled to make sense of the order.

Three tech workers from across the US explained how they spent Friday night and Saturday.

Two spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking to the media; Business Insider has verified their identities.

I studied engineering back home in India and got recruited into a US-based tech company straight out of college.

After working at the company's Indian operations for about three years, I was given the opportunity to transfer to the US because I was one of the few people familiar with the technology and their customers.

I received my H-1B right away and moved to the US in 2013.

The green card backlog for Indian-born applicants has kept me on an H-1B for 12 years, with no clear end in sight.

I first saw the news that the president had signed a proclamation for a $100,000 H-1B visa fee on Friday.

The last 36 hours have felt like being on call for a production outage, except the system being debugged is my career.

At first, it wasn't clear whether this applied to new H-1B applications, renewals, or even H-4 dependents, such as my wife. I was also worried about who would have to pay the fees — employees or their companies — and if firms would be willing or able to pay this fee for thousands of H-1B workers.

I have been constantly checking YouTube, LinkedIn, and the White House official channels for clearer instructions.

Many companies have already advised employees to avoid travel, and some friends who were abroad on H-1Bs have even been asked to return before September 21st.

I saw my friends who were visiting India book last-minute flights to get back to the US after calls with their human resource teams. Everyone was stressed about them not being able to come back to the US.

I was planning to travel to India for vacation, but I need to rethink that because of the uncertainty around whether current visa stampings will be impacted.

My sister, who recently gave birth, also planned to travel soon, but canceled her trip this weekend. She would have been flying back with my mother, who was visiting us, and I had to scramble to find someone who could make the trip back to India with our mom.

The White House's update that it would only impact people in the next lottery cycle brought a lot of relief.

The anxiety of this weekend and the lack of a clear pathway to a more permanent residency are now making us rethink things.

We might decide that if it's getting harder to live on the H-1B, it's better to go back to our home country rather than being stressed out in the US.

I moved from India to the US a decade ago to pursue a master's in engineering. I've been with my current company since graduating from the program.

I received my H-1B visa on my third try in the lottery. I was anxious leading up to it and had already started exploring what my fallback options could be.

I found out about the new White House order on the H-1B visa on Friday from friends who began checking up on me and whether the new rules would affect me.

I opened ChatGPT and asked what exactly the order was, what criteria of H-1B holders it affected, and if there were any changes to alternative visas like the E-B1 or E-B2. More than H-1B, I was hoping there were no changes to the green card routes.

I was planning a holiday in a couple of months, but I've punted planning that trip and buying tickets. It doesn't make sense for me to book something and then not be allowed to travel.

The White House's clarification about how the new rules only apply to new applicants was definitely relieving.

After years in the US, my spouse and I have the mindset of not letting these changes affect us too much. We say that if we're here temporarily, let's make the most of it and continue to grow in our careers by making ourselves more indispensable.

But in the past year, I've started to explore ways I can build a more credible profile so that I qualify for more expedited green card options.

Since the administration changed, I've also been making sure we are renewing our documents and getting our passport stampings done proactively and not waiting until the last minute.

It's made me feel the pain of new graduates and how difficult it would be for them to come to the US, pay off student loans, and get an opportunity to find an employer that would be supportive of them working here.

That will be a big challenge, at least for the next 12 months, but I'm hoping people are still supportive of the highly skilled talent that comes through.

I came to the US in 2018 to pursue my master's in computer engineering.

I was fortunate enough to get my H-1B visa on my first attempt when I was still in graduate school.

Even though I did not move from India with the expectation to stay in the US long term, I felt relieved to get the visa and thought it gave me an option to stay longer if I wanted.

I've worked for multiple Big Tech companies since graduating and am currently a software engineer at a tech firm based in Silicon Valley.

It's been a tough 36 hours.

I was wrapping up work on a Friday evening and solving a client issue when a friend called and started telling me about what was going on.

I instantly started Googling and reading about it, trying to figure out what exactly had happened.

I was troubled because I am going through an H-1B extension right now, and I thought I would be impacted.

I spoke to my wife, who was out of town for the weekend, and we decided she should not travel back to India for her visa stamping. We're waiting for things to cool down before booking any tickets.

After our call, I was frustrated, so I went to play pickleball with my friends to work out some of those emotions.

I came home to a call from my mom back in India. My parents heard the news, and they asked me what was going on and why I didn't just leave the US and work somewhere else. I told them we should wait for things to settle down before making a big decision.

My friends, most of whom work at Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft, are all in the same boat. At dinner after the game, we chatted about the new order and what we should do.

That night, I watched webinars from immigration and employment lawyers to try to make sense of the proclamation. I told myself that there was not much I could do right now besides going to sleep.

New guidance from the immigration authority about existing H-1B holders has made me feel like I'm off the hook, but my wife and I are still waiting for more confirmation before making travel plans.

My reason to come to the US was that it's the heart of innovation. But I was doing well in my previous role in India before I came for my master's, and I've been thinking about whether it makes sense to live here long term.

I've started thinking about options such as the Global Talent visa in the UK or opportunities in Singapore.

Being in Silicon Valley is rewarding from a work perspective, because the people here are at the top of their game, but now it feels like, is it really worth it?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Inside the schools trying to break America's college obsession","https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-high-schools-changing-value-of-college-trade-higher-education-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 07:51:01 GMT","

When Sam Johnson said he didn't want to go to college after graduating from high school, his teachers didn't blink.

That's because Upton High School's guiding philosophy is that college isn't for everyone. Instead, the Wyoming school helps students tailor their education to one of three paths: college, military, or workforce. Since implementing the model eight years ago, school leaders are pleased to see that the focus on college is diminishing.

In Upton's 2025 graduating class, nine students chose a four-year university, two chose a two-year community college, three chose trade school, four entered the workforce, and one entered the military. That's a wider variety of paths compared to six years ago, when none went to trade school.

To prepare for his future, Johnson's career counselor helped secure him an apprenticeship with a hunting guide — his chosen occupation — so that he could work toward obtaining his license.

""She called until somebody said yes,"" Johnson said of his counselor. ""I'm super, super grateful, because now I know what I'm doing after high school."" Now 18, he's completed the necessary steps for certification. ""I'm going in headfirst after high school into that job,"" he said.

School districts across the US are radically rethinking the college pipeline as student debt remains high, private education options are on the rise, and more young people are choosing to forgo the standard four-year college experience. Business leaders have also been increasingly questioning the value of college. Mark Zuckerberg said college isn't preparing students for the job market, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp said ""no one cares"" about elite education at his company. Peter Thiel's fellowship program offers $200,000 to ""young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.""

The Trump administration is also taking on the issue, calling for increased investments in trade schools. The White House's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a May interview with Fox News: ""Apprenticeships, electricians, plumbers, we need more of those in our country, and less LGBTQ graduate majors from Harvard University. And that's what this administration's position is.""

Still, 63% of recent high school grads enrolled in college in 2024, and that route is proven to lead to higher earnings. Upton, like other schools that spoke to Business Insider, isn't eschewing college altogether. In fact, part of the shift to personalized learning involves finding creative ways to ensure that students can still compete academically despite the school's rural location, said Superintendent Clark Coberly. For example, it partners with an outside education company for additional AP classes. Coberly said he ""wanted to be able to have those doors open for post-secondary education.""

""We really wanted to commit to doing something that is more reflective of what society looks like today,"" Coberly said.

Sophie Louderbeck was a 2024 Upton graduate who took advantage of the college path, but not before she got some real-world work experience. She was able to adjust her high school class schedule so she could work at a day care during the day to prepare to pursue her interest in elementary education.

""They do such an amazing job where, if you want to go down one path, they're going to make it happen,"" Louderbeck, 19, told Business Insider. ""And if you change your mind, they're going to make that happen.""

Business Insider is exploring how America is rethinking education as technology and job demands shift. Reach out to this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com. Read more about how Upton High School is reshaping the college conversation:

And read more on how education is changing in America:

Inside Darian Samuelson's science classroom at Upton on a recent Wednesday, a freshman was filling out a worksheet on chemical properties while a sophomore rubbed a balloon on his classmate's head to demonstrate how static electricity works. A physics student was outside, working on designing his own project, and two anatomy students were sitting on a couch with their headphones on, reviewing their study materials.

Samuelson said that she provides students with the standards that they need to learn, and it is up to them how they want to practice the lesson — a core feature of Upton's personalized learning model.

""It's not about me. It's not about what I like. It's about the kids,"" she said. ""And we've seen the success, especially with the kids who don't fit the traditional mold.""

In one North Dakota school district, Cory Steiner couldn't be more thrilled with the shift away from traditional learning. He has worked for years to convince teachers, students — and most crucially, their parents — that success after high school doesn't have to mean college, and he said he has seen college enrollment plunge from 90% to 65%.

""We had to reimagine what our system was about,"" Steiner, the former superintendent at Northern Cass School District, said. He referenced a student who leveraged an internship working on HVAC systems into a job after graduation.

""That kid's going to be making $75,000 a year in two years, and that's what he wants to do,"" Steiner said, ""That's a perfect kind of scenario.""

Still, selling parents and teachers on a proficiency-based grading system instead of traditional A's and B's was a big hurdle — especially when it came to scholarships and college acceptances. Most parents say they want their kids to go to college, and employers' desire for a bachelor's degree is unlikely to change in the coming years. Plus, data shows that a degree continues to pay off, with degree holders earning about $33,000 more in annual wages than high school diploma holders, per an analysis from The New York Federal Reserve.

""We had a lot of work to do,"" Steiner said, adding that Upton converts its proficiency-based evaluations to a standard GPA that colleges accept. ""That was a really, really difficult time.""

Back in Wyoming, Upton principal Joseph Samuelson — who is married to science teacher Darian — said that one mistake the school made early on was transitioning to an online curriculum they thought would help individualize lessons. Because of it, some parents withdrew their kids from the school. Just four teachers who were on staff before the switch remain.

""Parents saw that our kids' teachers aren't teaching,"" Joseph said, adding that another mistake was rushing the transition without communicating with parents properly or giving teachers enough training.

Nick Johnson, Upton's high school social studies teacher and Sam's dad, recalled looking around his classroom at that time and seeing every student staring at their computers.

""I was thinking, 'God, this isn't it. We're not doing anything good,'"" Nick said. He started experimenting with different types of lesson structures and projects, like having dedicated periods when students could choose how they want to practice their lessons in ways that align with their interests and life goals.

Other teachers followed suit. Karla Ludemann, Upton's computer science teacher, for example, prioritizes helping her students find opportunities for community involvement. One student built a website for a local woman who sells jewelry, and another student used his drone to take aerial photos for the town's social media.

""The community members are good knowing that they're not professionals, they're kids, and they're learning,"" Ludemann said. To help prepare them for the workforce, her students are evaluated on their work ethic, including whether they show up on time. She said one of her past students graduated with a full-time job at a company he worked for while in high school, and it paid for his online college.

Now, Upton's model is attracting new students. Joslyn Pischke, 15, transferred from a neighboring district and wants to go to college to study equine science. Joseph remembers when Pischke arrived as a freshman and asked to leave school early some days to compete in rodeo. His gut instinct was to say no.

""But then I thought, 'This girl has done extremely well. Her test scores are through the roof,'"" Joseph said. ""She's missed a good chunk of school, and it hasn't shown. It's coming down to this invisible wall, an invisible barrier. Why wouldn't I let her change her schedule?""

Steiner, who left his position at Northern Cass for a leadership role at a different North Dakota school district, hopes that the personalized learning model will catch on at more schools and empower students to pursue what they're actually interested in.

""Shifting a system is hard work,"" Steiner said, adding that it was worth it because it ""completely just shifted who we are and what we believe about teaching and learning.""

While college enrollment is up slightly this year over last, it declined roughly 15% in the decade before the pandemic.

One main obstacle to picking the right path after high school graduation is a lack of awareness of the alternatives, said Maria Flynn, president and CEO of nonprofit Jobs for the Future. A recent survey from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation found that while more than half of surveyed parents know ""a great deal"" about bachelor's degrees, up to 58% of parents said they know ""only a little"" or ""nothing at all"" about non-college pathways like starting a business or pursuing an apprenticeship.

Flynn said the key is educating people that associate's degrees, licensures, or trade schools can ""add the same type of economic value and economic advancement as the traditional path.""

Public schools in rural areas are at the forefront of the trend to shift away from college as the primary focus. Teachers in the area largely attribute the shift to the nature of local job markets. In Wyoming and North Dakota, agriculture dominates the economy. Aric Keller, Upton's welding instructor, said that he has at least six former students who now work in the welding industry — another prominent field in rural Wyoming. In urban school districts, local job opportunities may lean more toward finance, logistics, or aerospace, which are still more likely to require a degree. Nationwide, the share of jobs that require a college degree fell from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021.

At Oakes Public School in North Dakota, an alternative learning model helps differentiate the school amid growing competition from private and charter schools. Anna Sell, superintendent of Oakes, said that changing education needs for parents and students pushed her school to reconsider its model.

""We knew we needed to do things differently because our customers were not buying what we're selling,"" Sell told Business Insider. She added that the school voucher movement in North Dakota, like in over a dozen other states, has been especially strong, with more parents opting to use publicly funded vouchers to homeschool or send their kids to private school. It's created a greater need for public schools to prove to families that there's value in what they are offering, especially with enrollment declining nationwide.

""Our focus was to get kids ready to go to college, but college isn't the way of the world anymore,"" Sell said. Whatever postgrad path students choose, Sell said the school will work with them to provide relevant courses and workforce opportunities to ensure they excel.

Jayden Reinert, an 18-year-old recent graduate of Cherry Creek Innovation Campus in Colorado — a college and career preparedness facility for local high school students — said she worked with counselors to fit a job at a car dealership into her high school schedule. While she's planning on going to college in the fall to study mechanical engineering, she wants to continue working at a dealership to further her skills.

""It's a really great way to get into the workforce without being full-time committed to it and get an understanding of what the job is, and if it's something that you would want to commit to when you're out of school,"" Reinert said.

It's hard to imagine an America where college isn't prioritized; it's been a core feature of the American dream for decades. But the economy and labor market demands are changing, and Sell said it's important that schools adjust and ensure students are equipped with the skills they need to succeed.

""More and more we're saying this is OK, that college isn't an option for everybody,"" Sell said. ""We have to start doing it differently for our kids in order to prepare them for their future, not ours.""

Steve Jobs lived simply in 1982. All the Apple cofounder said he needed was ""a cup of tea, a light, and your stereo."" Forty years later, not much has changed for the next generation of young founders.

While the AI boom is sending millions in venture funding to 20-something entrepreneurs, many still aren't buying furniture. 

Spartan living is common. Some live on mattresses in the office, while others keep their apartments' clutter to a minimum.

Six young tech founders gave Business Insider a glimpse into their apartments — take a peek inside:

ThirdLayer operates out of a live/work-zoned loft that was previously occupied by another Y Combinator startup. Their landlord, it turned out, was their investor. The desks and kitchen are on the main floor; up and down the stairs, you'll find beds.

In the kitchen, the sink was full of dishes because everyone likes to ""sit and work"" and not ""do chores,"" per 22-year-old cofounder Regina Lin. They have plastic utensils and rarely cook.

""This stack of ramen used to be a lot bigger,"" Lin said, pointing to a tower of different instant noodle brands. ""It was very high.""

Next to the kitchen is their common area, where they film social videos, store their prop gimmicks, and often house overnight guests. Lin said that she sleeps there from 4 to 7 a.m., ""and then I escape to my bedroom before anyone in the morning comes and sees me passed out there.""

The floor is filled with standing desks. Lin's desk is littered with Blue Bottle cups; she said that she usually has at least four. Affixed to one desk is a bed for their cat, Tobi. Lin thought a cat would be ""good for company culture.""

ThirdLayer has beds both upstairs and downstairs. Julia Alvarenga, ThirdLayer's intern, got the most prized room downstairs: a storage closet. The company's design engineer also lives there, and they outfit the downstairs couch as a bed when remote employees visit.

The founders sleep upstairs. Lin sleeps in a king-size bed; she said she wanted a smaller mattress so that they could fit more, but it was too big to get out the door. Her cofounder, Kevin Gu, sleeps on a couch just feet away.

""Everyone in the house is just right next to each other all the time,"" Lin said.

The room has a closet, though it doesn't have any racks to hang clothes. Lin suspects that it was built as a room to take calls. The founders leave their suitcases in there, and Lin also stacks her clothes in a large plastic bin next to her bed.

The upstairs bathroom is small. If Lin wants to do her makeup or get ready for the day, she'll go downstairs to the bigger common bathroom, she said.

25-year-old Docket cofounder Boris Skurikhin's mattress is on the floor.

His makeshift nightstand is a short cardboard box, on which he stacked his computer and a biography of physicist Andrei Sakharov. His clothes are folded and stacked against the room's windows.

""We moved here very, very quickly from New York,"" he said. ""We started the YC batch that following Monday, and we were build mode, we were think mode. Furniture was not that important.""

Skurikhin doesn't like clutter; he says the almost empty room allows him to walk around and think.

The living room has two desks, his and his cofounder's. He doesn't use the desk much, since the office is within walking distance. The ""most interesting part,"" he said, was a piece of paper with the cofounders' three tenets stuck to the wall with some packing tape:

In their doorway is a small ""conversational table"" where Skurikhin sometimes eats lunch or dinner. He doesn't touch the kitchen much, he said, though he's proud of his tea collection.

Every time 28-year-old Nectir founder Kavitta Ghai has a ""mental block"" at her Los Angeles apartment, she uproots to an Airbnb where her team can meet her. Now she's in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood; she especially liked the spot because of its record player.

Ghai does not have time to cook food — ""DoorDash is my best friend,"" she said — but keeps some supplies on hand for when she hosts friends or hackathons.

In her living room, Ghai is playing meditative music — something she ""always"" has on.

""Does it work? I don't know,"" she said. ""I must set the vibes of the house. The candle has to be on. I'll wake up in the morning and walk around with my incense.""

The Airbnb also has a small patio, one of Ghai's non-negotiables: ""I need to be able to walk outside on days when I'm working for 12 hours.""

The porch is also an ideal spot to sit out and have a coffee in the morning, or to smoke a joint, she said.

Ghai's desk is not in her bedroom, another non-negotiable while picking an Airbnb. She needs separation, she said, and having a separate desk area allows her to create a ""little WeWork.""

The bedroom features floor-to-ceiling windows, as Ghai likes to wake up to sunlight. The first thing that she does every morning is make her bed.

""My friends say my homes look like serial killer homes,"" she said. ""I like it to look like nobody lives there ever. I need you to walk into my house and be like, 'Is this a staged home?'""

Inside Ghai's closet, there are two designer bags: one Dior, one Louis Vuitton. They're both vintage, Ghai said. She likes to go to vintage stores and find nice bags that need some care.

""I like to do my little art projects,"" she said.

29-year-old Josh Sirota sleeps on an air mattress in the middle of the Eragon office.

He tries to get up at 8 a.m., when he wanders over a few feet to his desk. He's the only one who sleeps there full-time, but the office has cots and a couch for those who work particularly late.

Upstairs is more bed space and a conference room, but the area is currently strewn with Sirota's clothes.

""We just moved a month ago and I've been super traveling, so we haven't set up this area yet,"" he said.

Sirota's room will eventually be upstairs, too, he said, and it will have an actual mattress and a closet. For now, the space is empty.

Outside, Sirota has a tent set up. Photos of tents pitched in what was inaccurately described as the X office recently spread around the social media platform, which Eragon recreated for a marketing stunt. Next to the tent is a stationary bike for office use.

Eragon is part of Andreessen Horowitz's accelerator, A16z Speedrun. Sirota said he was meeting Ben Horowitz that week, and on his desk was a copy of Horowitz's ""What You Do Is Who You Are.""

He also had Andrew Chen's ""The Cold Start Problem,"" which he said was ""essential reading.

Next to the books was a can of green tea, a Redbull, and a bag of socks gifted by his sister. There was a bag of leftover McDonald's from an Uber Eats delivery.

Stacked up high on his desk were at least five canisters of Zyn nicotine pouches.

26-year-old TrainLoop founder Jackson Stokes' apartment doesn't have a living room. It's worked for him: ""We were just never actually here,"" he said, explaining that he'll spend 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the office on a normal day.

It's more spacious than his last apartment, which was a five-bedroom with six guys in it. That apartment also didn't have a dishwasher.

This apartment also has a robotic coffee machine, which he bought off a friend for $1. ""It's very tech,"" he said.

The company coffee maker is much nicer. He recently bought a $1,500 machine for the TrainLoop office. They haven't moved into the new space yet; the machine sits on his bedroom floor.

Stokes wants to have a nice bedroom. He called it a ""bit cluttered"" — there's a plant on top of the coffee machine — but said that he'd been ""nesting.""

Stokes has books from Stripe Press and paintings from local artists on his shelves. He also has two framed printouts from photobooths: one from his time at Google and the other from Y Combinator's end-of-batch party.

Stokes' top shelf also contains alcohol. He has a bottle of wine from winning first place at an OpenAI hackathon and a bottle signed by his YC group partner, Michael Seibel. There's also a bottle of Clase Azul, which is still sealed because ""we don't drink that much.""

""I actually have not rung the bell on this one yet,"" Stokes said of the bottle's topper. ""But I have rung the bell on others.""

23-year-old Haokun Qin and his Gale cofounder moved into their Toronto apartment two months ago: ""We just shoved our stuff in here, and we've been here maybe half the time.""

He keeps his room basic, just ""whatever I need to sleep."" That includes a bed, a nightstand, and a heated blanket — no comforter or duvet needed.

""I move around too much to have that much stuff on me,"" Qin said.

His favorite thing in the room, Qin said, was the protein shakes that he stores under his bed.

In his bathroom, Qin has a variety of skincare products.

""I don't even know what it is, but half the stuff my mom bought, and half the stuff I bought on Amazon over time,"" he said. ""I couldn't tell you, man.""

In his apartment's living area, Qin has floor-to-ceiling windows. He points out one to The Velocity Incubator, a local startup program. His office, he says, is a three-minute walk away.

Opening his freezer, Qin pulls out an ice pop and laughs. ""We call them freezies,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Obama says the Trump administration has taken cancel culture to a 'dangerous level.' See how politicians are reacting to Kimmel's suspension.","https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-politicians-respond-jimmy-kimmel-trump-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 16:13:00 GMT","

Former President Barack Obama responded to ABC's decision to indefinitely take Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air and warned of ""government coercion.""

""After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like,"" Obama said in a post on X.

""This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it,"" he said in a response.

Washington has largely split along party lines in the wake of ABC's shocking suspension of the late-night host on Wednesday following Kimmel's comments on the shooting of Charlie Kirk.

The Jimmy Kimmel fallout is ramping up. Get caught up here:



President Donald Trump and his allies have praised the network's decision to ""indefinitely"" suspend Kimmel after Carr, a Trump appointee, pressured Disney before local TV stations revolted, and ultimately, ABC took action.

""We can do this the easy way or the hard way,"" Carr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. ""These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.""

In contrast, Democrats are aghast, saying that Kimmel's suspension is an affront to the First Amendment. Like Hollywood, many in the party are rallying around the host.

On Thursday, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a lengthy letter to Carr, calling his actions ""corrupt political intimidation,"" and asking for the FCC to turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, the affiliated TV station operator, starting from January 20.

""The Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) apparent weaponization of its federal regulatory authority and ABC's preemption of programming that may be critical of President Trump represents a dangerous escalation in attacks on press freedom and protected speech,"" the Committee wrote in the five-page letter signed by Rep. Robert Garcia.

Trump celebrated the suspension of Kimmel's show shortly after the news broke — and he called on NBC to do the same with Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon.

""Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. ""Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.""

At a press conference alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday morning, Trump doubled down.

""You can call that free speech or not,"" Trump said. ""He was fired for lack of talent.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Kimmel's suspension ""outrageous.""

""It's a page right out of Xi's playbook. This is just despicable, disgusting, and against democratic values,"" Schumer said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday night. ""Trump and his allies seem to want to shut down speech that they don't like to hear. That is not what democracies do. That is what autocracies do.""

Vice President JD Vance has not yet directly weighed in on Kimmel's suspension, but on Thursday morning, he made a joke about it.

""Everyone please congratulate @marcorubio, the new host of ABC's late night show,"" Vance wrote on X.

Marco Rubio holds several jobs in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and Acting Archivist of the United States.

He's been the subject of several jokes about holding multiple jobs, and has occasionally made light of it himself.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Democratic leadership released a joint statement condemning ABC's move and calling on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to resign for engaging ""in the corrupt abuse of power.""

""He has disgraced the office he holds by bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration,"" the group of lawmakers said.

The lawmakers also signalled that they could use subpoena power to investigate the incident the next time they're in the majority.

""Media companies, such as the one that suspended Mr. Kimmel, have a lot to explain,"" the lawmakers continued. ""The censoring of artists and cancellation of shows is an act of cowardice. It may also be part of a corrupt pay-to-play scheme. House Democrats will make sure the American people learn the truth, even if that requires the relentless unleashing of congressional subpoena power. This will not be forgotten.""

The statement was co-signed by Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu, Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, and Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Carr is ""a great guy,"" but the way he pressured Disney ""is dangerous as hell.""

""He says, 'We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way,'"" Cruz said during an episode of his podcast ""Verdict"" that was released on September 19. ""And I got to say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.""

Cruz is not a fan of Kimmel, whom he once defeated in a charity basketball game. The former GOP presidential hopeful said he's worried about Carr's actions could backfire on conservatives if Democrats retake the White House.

""They will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.""

Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, is spearheading an investigation into the FCC, ABC, and Sinclair over the incident.

On September 18, Garcia signed a letter requesting the FCC turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, starting from Trump's inauguration day. The deadline to turn over these documents is October 2.

""Every American has a duty to stand up for our First Amendment values,"" Garcia said. ""We will not be silent as our freedoms are threatened by corrupt schemes and threats. Anyone who is complicit will need to answer to us.""

""We stand ready to work with any media organization willing to resist any attempts of unlawful coercion of editorial decisions and expose any abuse of federal authority to suppress constitutionally protected speech,"" wrote Garcia in the letter.

Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah praised Carr in the wake of Kimmel's suspension.

""Sic semper tyrannis,"" Lee wrote. ""Great work by @BrendanCarrFCC.""

He added a hashtag: #BuhByeJimmyKimmel.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Republican Party of engaging in censorship after Kimmel's suspension.

""Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows,"" Newsom wrote. ""These aren't coincidences. It's coordinated. And it's dangerous. The @GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time.""

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana indicated that he was supportive of Kimmel's suspension.

""The liberal media is finally catching up to where the rest of the country is,"" Cassidy wrote on X. ""We love Charlie Kirk. We don't like dishonest brokers.""

Cassidy has a history with Kimmel, dating back to when Republicans unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, during Trump's first term.

Kimmel invited Cassidy onto his show in May 2017, where Cassidy pledged to develop legislation to ensure that families had access to affordable healthcare. Kimmel later attacked Cassidy's bill, which led to a simmering feud.

Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a moderate Republican, said he was uncomfortable with Kimmel's suspension in an appearance on C-SPAN Washington Journal on Thursday morning.

""I think it would have been better just to shame him,"" Bacon said. ""People have a right to listen to what they want. If they don't like it, don't listen to it. I get a little worried about this cancel culture that we have.""

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut went directly after Carr after the FCC chair praised Nexstar for pulling Kimmel off the air, which preceded ABC's decision.

""This is a massive, history making abuse of your power,"" Murphy wrote on X. ""It will define your legacy and one day you will come to regret punishing free speech and trying to destroy democracy.""

Taylor Budowich, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, cheered on Kimmel's suspension.

""Welcome to Consequence Culture,"" Budowich wrote. ""Normal, common sense Americans are no longer taking the bullshit and companies like ABC are finally willing to do the right and reasonable thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested that the FCC played a key role in Kimmel's suspension — and that media companies are to blame as well.

""Last-minute settlements, secret side deals, multi-billion dollar mergers pending Donald Trump's approval,"" Warren wrote on X. ""Trump silencing free speech stifles our democracy. It sure looks like giant media companies are enabling his authoritarianism.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democrat and frequent Trump critic, said that if Democrats retake the House, they will investigate matters like this.

""There's going to be a Democratic majority in just over a year,"" Swalwell said during a hearing on Thursday. ""And to the FCC chairperson and anyone involved in these dirty deals, get a lawyer and save your records, because you're going to be in this room.""

During an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Rand Paul called Carr's remarks suggesting that the FCC would take action against Disney-owned ABC ""absolutely inappropriate.""

""Brendan Carr's got no business weighing in on this, but people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don't have the right to employment,"" he said. ""Virtually everybody employed, probably including yourself, has a code of conduct in your contract that you have to adhere to.""

Paul said networks are entitled to pull content they don't agree with.

""The FCC should have nothing to do with it, but I do think a couple of networks pulled out. Sinclair pulled out — they were disgusted by the comments. That's their right.""

He added, ""But the government's got no business in it and the FCC was wrong to weigh in.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","My husband and I chose to live in Washington, DC, based on job opportunities. I wish we'd chosen to live closer to family.","https://www.businessinsider.com/chose-job-over-family-choosing-location-regrets-2025-9","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:11:01 GMT","

When my husband and I met, we were both in law school in Washington, DC. We had each moved there for school. Neither of us had any ties to the city, and before we met, neither of us expected to stay there after graduation.

Before we got married in 2002, we discussed moving back to my hometown of Philadelphia, PA, or his hometown of St. Paul, MN, to be closer to family. However, we quickly realized that if we left DC, our job opportunities would be limited. Since we had both spent years in higher education and incurred significant debt to earn our degrees, launching our careers was at the forefront of our minds.

Although my husband and I both wanted children, we knew we wouldn't have them right away, and allowing family to take a backseat to work seemed like the right choice at the time. After we earned our diplomas, we both got jobs we liked and settled into life in DC for the long haul. But things didn't work out the way I had planned.

After my first child was born, my priorities started to shift. My daughter was born with multiple disabilities and complex medical needs. Caring for her and working a 9-to-5 job wasn't feasible. Additionally, not knowing whether she would live until her first birthday prompted me to reevaluate how I wanted to live my life.

Although I loved my job, my career was no longer the most crucial thing in my life. I wound up leaving my position as a full-time attorney and pieced together several part-time and freelance jobs I could do from home instead.

My husband was thriving in his career, and one parent having a stable job with a steady income was more important than ever with a disabled child. Moreover, by the time my daughter was born, I had established a full life in DC.

We owned a home I loved, and had close friends who became a support system. My husband and I once again briefly considered moving to be closer to family, but it still didn't seem like the best idea for us. We decided to stay where we were settled, and my husband's career trajectory seemed much more promising.

My husband and I went on to have three more children. After each child's birth, we once again discussed moving back to Philadelphia or St. Paul, but with every passing year, leaving DC seemed more difficult, especially if it meant starting over with a new job.

Now that my kids, now aged 10 through 19, and my parents, now in their mid-70s, are older, I think we made a mistake in deciding to raise my children far away from any family. Since I left traditional employment just a few years after graduation, it's clear that my career would not have suffered from living somewhere without as many job opportunities. My husband may have wound up with a very different career trajectory in Philadelphia or St. Paul, but I think the trade-off would have been worth it.

I love the life we built in DC, and my children are happy. We take advantage of all the city has to offer, from a seemingly endless number of free museums to a vast national park. Still, I often think about how much they missed out on by not growing up close to cousins, grandparents, and a big extended family that loves them. The chaos of life means that visits were not nearly as frequent as I had hoped they would be. Selfishly, I also realize that my life would have been easier if I lived near family who could help when life seems overwhelming or babysit for a night out with my husband.

Guilt also crept in when my father got cancer and my mother developed health challenges of her own. My parents needed help too, but leaving my four kids who needed me made frequent or extended visits impossible. My father passed away a few months ago, and I will always regret that I couldn't spend more time with him when he was sick. Now, my mother is older and alone, and I wish I could help her more.

Although I've tried to devise a plan, it seems impossible to dismantle our lives in DC and move. However, if I could go back and do things over, I would choose being closer to family over better job opportunities.

President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the deal to save TikTok in the United States.

""A man named Lachlan is involved,"" Trump said on Fox News' ""The Sunday Briefing.""

""Lachlan Murdoch ... Rupert [Murdoch] is probably gonna be in the group, I think they're going to be in the group,"" he continued.

Trump also said that Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell are also likely to be involved in the TikTok deal.

""Couple of others, really great people, very prominent people,"" Trump said.

""And they're also American patriots, you know, they love this country. So I think they're going to do a really good job,"" he continued.

Trump's remarks come as the specific details of the deal to save TikTok in the United States continue to be worked out by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

The White House provided new details of the deal on Saturday, saying that six of the seven-member board that controls TikTok will be Americans, NBC News reported.

The U.S. will also control the app's algorithm, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, addressing a major sticking point in negotiations.

Leavitt also said that data and privacy for the app in the U.S. will be led by Oracle.

Trump and Xi had a call on Friday about the possible TikTok deal. Trump afterward said that the deal ""is well on its way, as you know, and the investors are getting ready.""

But China, in its own statement, suggested that the two sides are further apart on negotiations.

""China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: the Chinese government respects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,"" a translated readout from Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua read.

""We hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,"" the statement read.

CNBC has reached out to Fox News, the White House and TikTok for comment.

President Donald Trump and prominent members of his ""Make America Great Again"" movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere.

The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.

""We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,"" Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. ""It will be a tough day.""

Kirk's assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.

The service will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals west of Phoenix, where Kirk's Turning Point organization is based. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event.

Members of the public began lining up outside the stadium before dawn to secure a spot, several hours before the start of the service. The lower bowl of the stadium quickly filled with mourners dressed in red, white a blue, as organizers suggested.

The stadium had the feel of a megachurch service. Floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands playing on stage as the crowds filed in. Many stood and sang along.

""I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference,"" said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. ""He deserves us to be here.""

Trump has blamed the ""radical left"" for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.

He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised ""the life and legacy"" of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday.

""Who could vote against that? All (Republicans) were saying was 'Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'"" Trump told reporters. ""And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that.'""

Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk's death.

ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air indefinitely following backlash from affiliated broadcasters and the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian's remarks about Kirk.

The State Department has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.

A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he ""had enough"" of Kirk's hatred.

Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.

The crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk's memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.

""I think he spoke on more than just politics,"" said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. ""Now that he's gone, it's like who's gonna speak for us now?""

His impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.

Kirk ""was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,"" Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. ""But he never stopped smiling, never stopped respecting his interlocutor and anyone who challenged him.""

Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader.

Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.

Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president.

Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak.

Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes.

Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that ""the movement my husband built will not die.""

A group of U.S. lawmakers on a rare visit to Beijing told China's No.2 leader, Premier Li Qiang, that the world's two largest economies need to step up engagement and ""break the ice"" as both superpowers made further inroads into stabilizing ties.

The visit on Sunday was the first House of Representatives delegation to visit China since 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic ended formal House visits in 2020, and relations rapidly deteriorated due to disagreement over the origins of the coronavirus that had spread all over the world.

The trip by the bipartisan delegation, announced this month, follows a call on Friday between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping as both countries seek a course out of a period of strained ties exacerbated by trade tensions, U.S. restrictions over semiconductor chips, the ownership of TikTok, Chinese activities in the South China Sea, and matters related to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory.

This ""ice-breaking"" trip will further bilateral ties, Premier Li told the lawmakers, according to a pool report organized by the U.S. embassy in China.

The delegation is led by Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Smith. He is a former chair of and current top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the U.S. Defense Department and armed forces.

""We can both acknowledge that both China and the U.S. have work to do to strengthen that relationship, which should not be, what, seven, six years between visits from the U.S. House of Representatives,"" Smith told Premier Li.

""We need more of those types of exchanges, and we are hoping, to your words, that this will break the ice and we will begin to have more of these types of exchanges.""

In the interim years between the meetings, when Covid-hit China largely shut its borders to the outside world, U.S. lawmakers had focused their visits elsewhere.

Trips by U.S. lawmakers included visits to democratically-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and regards as the most important and sensitive issue in its relations with the United States.

In 2022, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation of Democratic members of the House to Taiwan as part of a wider Asia tour. The trip infuriated China, which tells other countries to avoid official engagements with Taiwan, and triggered massive Chinese military exercises in waters and airspace around the island.

A year later, U.S. lawmakers angered Beijing again when Michael McCaul, then chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, visited Taiwan. McCaul, who was later sanctioned by China, pledged to help provide training for Taiwan's armed forces and speed up the delivery of weapons.

In this article

Disruption at some European airports continued for a second day on Sunday after a cyberattack targeted check-in technology company Collins Aerospace.

The U.K.'s largest airport, Heathrow, was among those affected, along with airports in Berlin and Brussels.

Brussels Airport on Sunday asked airlines to cancel half of Monday's scheduled departing flights as issues with its check-in system remain unresolved.

A spokesperson for the airport said Collins Aerospace, the system's provider, has yet to deliver a secure updated version of the software necessary to restore full functionality.

Collins Aerospace ""provides check-in and boarding systems for several airlines across multiple airports globally,"" Heathrow Airport said in a post on X Saturday.

Collins' parent company, RTX, said in a statement to Reuters that it was aware of ""cyber-related disruption"" to its MUSE software.

""The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,"" RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies, said in a statement emailed to Reuters. It added that it was looking to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

CNBC has contacted RTX for comment and is awaiting a response.

Aviation analytics provider Cirium told CNBC that on Sunday so far, 38 departures and 33 arrivals had been canceled across Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, as of 10 a.m. London time.

On Saturday, 35 departures and 25 arrivals were canceled. Brussels saw the highest number of flight cancellations, at 15.

All three airports issued updated statements Sunday.

Heathrow said it was working to ""resolve and recover"" following the Collins outage that impacted check-in.

""We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate,"" it said on X. ""We encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to Heathrow and to arrive no earlier than three hours for long-haul flights and two hours for short-haul.""

Brussels said on its website Sunday that the cyberattack was having ""a large impact on the flight schedule and unfortunately causes delays and cancellations of flights."" It advised travelers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport.

Berlin warned travelers of longer waiting times due to a ""systems outage at a service provider.""

Dublin Airport was also affected, but said it expects to operate a full schedule on Sunday.

""Some airlines in Terminal 2 are continuing to use manual workarounds to generate bag tags and boarding passes. This means that the check-in and bag drop processes may take slightly longer than normal,"" the airport said on X.

The attack on Collins Aerospace is the latest in a series of high-profile cybersecurity breaches that have made headlines.

Jaguar Land Rover said last week that it was extending a pause in production until Sept. 24 following a cyberattack. ""We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time,"" the company said in a statement.

While British retailer Marks & Spencer earlier this year said a recent cyberattack, which left food shelves bare and brought online sales to a standstill, would wipe out almost one-third of its annual profits.

However, Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at cybersecurity firm Check Point, noted that the aviation industry was a particularly target for cybercriminals given its reliance on shared digital systems.

""These attacks often strike through the supply chain, exploiting third-party platforms that are used by multiple airlines and airports at once,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""When one vendor is compromised, the ripple effect can be immediate and far-reaching, causing widespread disruption across borders.""

To improve resiliency, she said aviation companies should ensure software systems are regularly updated and well-tested backup systems are in place. She also called for better information-sharing between the technology providers, airlines and governments.

""Cyberattacks rarely stop at national borders, so the faster one country can identify and report an attack, the faster others can take action to contain it,"" she said. ""A joined-up defence will be far more effective than siloed responses.""

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway has completely exited its extremely profitable equity investment in the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD.

In August 2022, Berkshire began to reduce the 225 million share position it had purchased in 2008 for $230 million.

That followed a 41% jump in the value of the position during that year's second quarter to $9 billion.

By June of last year, Berkshire had sold almost 76% of its stake, bringing it just under 5% of BYD's outstanding shares.

By crossing below that level, Berkshire no longer had to disclose subsequent sales under the Hong Kong exchange's rules, so as far as we knew the company owned 54 million shares.

A Buffett Watch reader, however, pointed out that the Q1 financial filing by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the subsidiary that held the shares, listed the value of the investment as zero as of March 31.

A Berkshire spokesperson confirmed that the entire BYD position has indeed been sold.

Based on the investment values listed in BHE's reports, the sales continued after the stake fell below 5% last year.

Berkshire made its initial purchase 17 years ago at the urging of Charlie Munger.

At the 2009 annual meeting, he told shareholders that even though it looked like ""Warren and I have gone crazy,"" he saw the company and its CEO, Wang Chuanfu, as a ""damn miracle.""

It was an incredible call. BYD shares increased by roughly 3890% during the years Berkshire owned them.

Buffett has not explained in detail why Berkshire started selling, but, in 2023, he told CNBC's Becky Quick that BYD is an ""extraordinary company"" being run by an ""extraordinary person,"" but ""I think that we'll find things to do with the money that I'll feel better about.""

Around the same time, Berkshire sold almost all of the company's Taiwan Semiconductor stake, roughly $4 billion of stock, just months after the shares were purchased as he ""reevaluated"" the geopolitical risk posed by Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China. ""It's a dangerous world,"" he said.

Warren Buffett has not been speaking publicly in the last few years about his generally liberal political views, telling shareholders in 2022 that some people get ""sustainably mad"" and ""take it out on our companies,"" potentially harming employees and shareholders.

It is, however, reasonable to assume that he doesn't see eye-to-eye on most issues with President Donald Trump.

But they do agree, at least partially, on one thing: U.S. businesses should not chase very short-term goals.

This week, the president posted on Truth Social that the SEC should allow corporations to report earnings every six months, instead of the current three-month requirement.

""This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,"" he wrote.

The SEC tells CNBC it is ""prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.""

Buffett, who famously favors making decisions for the long run, has strongly urged companies to stop providing quarterly earnings-per-share guidance.

A 2018 Wall Street Journal opinion piece co-written by JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon says, ""In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.""

That happens, they said, when companies cut back on long-term beneficial spending to meet or beat their own short-term forecasts when earnings are affected by outside factors they can't control.

They argue that ""financial markets have become too focused on the short term"" and quarterly guidance ""is a major driver of this trend.""

There is, however, an important distinction.

Buffett and Dimon stress they are not against the reporting of earnings every quarter. They just don't like companies forecasting what those earnings will be.

Companies, they said, should ""continue to provide annual and quarterly reporting that offers a retrospective look at actual performance so that the public, including shareholders and other stakeholders, can reliably assess real progress.""

In this article

iPhone Air is the big newcomer among Apple's latest lineup that went on sale Friday, but inside the slim phone's raised plateau is another new piece of hardware that signals a renewed focus on artificial intelligence. 

Apple's custom A19 Pro chip introduces a major architecture change, with neural accelerators added to each GPU core to increase compute power. Apple also debuted its first ever wireless chip for iPhone, the N1, and a second generation of its iPhone modem, the C1X. It's a move analysts say gives Apple control of all the core chips in its phones.

""That's where the magic is. When we have control, we are able to do things beyond what we can do by buying a merchant silicon part,"" said Tim Millet, Apple vice president of platform architecture. He sat down with CNBC at Apple Park in September for the first U.S. interview about the new chips.

Until now, Broadcom was the main provider of wireless and bluetooth chips for iPhones, although Apple has made networking chips for the AirPods and Apple Watch for nearly a decade. Apple's N1 is in the entire iPhone 17 lineup and the iPhone Air.

Arun Mathias, Apple vice president of wireless software technologies and ecosystems, gave CNBC an example of the N1's improved Wi-Fi functionality. 

""One of the things people may not realize is that your Wi-Fi access points actually contribute to your device's awareness of location, so you don't need to use GPS, which actually costs more from a power perspective,"" Mathias said. ""By being able to do this more seamlessly in the background, not needing to wake up the application processor as much, we can do that significantly more efficiently.""

For iPhone modems, Qualcomm has been the sole provider since 2020. That changed in February when Apple unveiled the C1 in the iPhone 16e. It's a plan first set in motion in 2019, with Apple's purchase of Intel's modem business for $1 billion. Qualcomm has long warned investors of the coming change. 

Qualcomm modems remain in the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, but Apple's C1X is in the iPhone Air. 

""It may not be as good as Qualcomm's yet, in terms of just overall throughput and performance, but they can control it and they can make it run at lower power. So you're going to get better battery life,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies, a technology research and consulting firm. He expects Apple to ""completely phase out"" Qualcomm in the ""next couple of years.""

Apple's Mathias said the C1X is ""up to twice as fast"" as the C1 and ""uses 30% less energy"" than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro.

Neither Qualcomm or Broadcom saw much market impact following Apple's announcement, and both companies will maintain licensing deals with Apple for certain core technologies.

Apple's three new chips come amid increasing pressure from Wall Street about the company's AI strategy.

""They probably won't ever have their own Apple model like Google or OpenAI,"" Bajarin said. ""They're still going to run those services on iPhone, right? They want the iPhone to be the best place for developers to run their AI.""

Apple has been making its own system on a chip, or SoC, since the A series launched with the iPhone 4 in 2010. The latest generation A19 Pro has a new chip architecture that prioritizes AI workloads, adding neural accelerators to the GPU cores.

""We are building the best on-device AI capability that anyone else has,"" Millet told CNBC. ""Right now we are focused on making sure that these phones that we're shipping today, or shipping soon, will be capable of all the important on-device AI workloads that are coming.""

Privacy is a major reason Apple is prioritizing on-device AI, but Millet said there's another reason, too. 

""It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience,"" he said. 

One ""built-in AI"" feature Millet highlighted is the new front camera that uses AI to detect a new face and automatically switches to taking a horizontal photo. ""It's leveraging a full complement of almost all the capabilities in the A19 Pro,"" Millet said.

Apple's original AI hardware, its Neural Engine, was first unveiled back in 2017. It was barely mentioned at the launch. Instead, it's all about adding compute power to the GPUs. 

""The integration of the neural processing is reaching MacBook Pro class performance inside an iPhone,"" Millet said. ""It's a big, big step forward in ML compute. And so when you look inside the Neural Engine, for example, you have a lot of dense matrix math. We didn't have that capability in our GPU. But now we do with A19 Pro.""

Bajarin told CNBC that Apple's neural accelerators may work similarly to the tensor cores on Nvidia's AI chips, such as the H100.

""We're integrating neural processing in a way that allows someone who's writing a program to one of those small processors, extending the instruction set so they have a new class of computer that they have access to right there, and they can switch back and forth between 3D-rendering instructions and neural-processing instructions, all seamlessly inside the same microprogram,"" Millet said.

Apple's previous generation A19 SoC is in the base model iPhone 17, while the A19 Pro is in the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 and 17 Pro Max.

Following overheating issues in the iPhone 15, a new ""vapor chamber"" in the Pro models keeps the custom chips cool.

""It's actually positioned in concert with where the system on a chip, the A19 Pro is positioned,"" said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing. ""We think about how that all goes together, including with that forged unibody aluminum design, which is incredibly thermally conductive so that we can effectively dissipate heat with the vapor chamber, with where it's positioned with our chip. And it's even laser welded into it, which creates a metallic bond which also helps dissipate heat.""

Apple still relies on others for smaller components, like Samsung for memory and Texas Instruments for analog chips. All bigger core chips, however, may be Apple-designed in every iPhone as soon as next year, according to Bajarin.

""We expect that there would be modems coming to Mac. We would expect there's modems coming to iPad. There's probably N variants of the networking chip coming to Mac,"" Bajarin said. ""I think over the course of the next few years, it will be on all of the portfolio.""

When CNBC asked Apple's Millet if neural accelerators will be in the GPU cores of M5, the next anticipated SoC for Mac, he said, ""We have a unified approach to architecture.""

The iPhone maker plans to manufacture at least some of its custom chips in the U.S., at facilities like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's new campus in Arizona, where CNBC got a tour of the first completed fab.

Apple's A19 Pro is made at the leading edge of TSMC's 3-nanometer node. While TSMC is working toward 3nm production in Arizona by 2028, it's not there yet.

""If you need to be on the leading edge, it's going to be Taiwan for the time being,"" Bajarin said. 

In August, Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips from companies not making domestically. That same day, Apple increased its U.S. spending commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. CEO Tim Cook said part of that will go toward creating an ""end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America.""

""There's really a question of what part of tariffs impact the silicon supply chain,"" Bajarin said. ""This is obviously why Apple and Tim Cook are on their mission and out there talking about investing in America.""

As part of that plan, Bajain said Apple could give struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel ""serious consideration if 14A really does deliver on all of its promises."" Although, he added, it's ""going to be awhile"" before Intel ""becomes a viable option.""

For now, Apple is committed to making chips at TSMC Arizona.

""We are super excited about TSMC's push into U.S. manufacturing. Obviously it will help us from a time zone perspective, and we also appreciate that the diversity of the supply is also really important,"" Millet said.

When asked if he knows how much of Apple's $600 billion U.S. spend will go toward custom silicon, Millet said, ""I hope it's a lot.""

 Bitcoin market participants saw the area at $117,200 and above as particularly important heading into the weekly close and fresh US macro data. 

Key points:

Key Bitcoin price levels above and below spot price are here as BTC is about to start a new week.

A quiet weekend is slated to give way to volatility as fresh macro catalysts appear.

A “busy week” will see the release of the Federal Reserve's favorite US inflation gauge.

Bitcoin (BTC) kept traders guessing into Sunday's weekly close as analysis focused on the final resistance before all-time highs.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hovering below $116,000.

This meant that the price remained wedged between support and resistance at $114,000 and $117,200, respectively.

As Cointelegraph reported, both levels were on the radar throughout last week as price reacted to US macroeconomic volatility triggers.

“The retest of $114k (black) into support continues to be successful but there is resistance at ~$117.2k (blue),” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital summarized while uploading a corresponding chart to X on the day.

Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades had an expanded view, focusing on $112,000 and $118,000 for market cues.

“Very little happening indeed. It's now the 4th weekend in a row where we have seen little volatility and likely no gap being created,” he acknowledged, referring to weekend “gaps” in CME Group's Bitcoin futures market. 

Crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows agreed on the lack of movement on BTC/USD.

“It has been consolidating around the $116,000 level for some time now,” part of an X post stated. 

The macro outlook looked set to provide more volatility for crypto and risk assets into the end of September.

The US Federal Reserve's “preferred” inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, was due out on Sept. 26.

Various Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, were due to speak throughout the week, just days after they voted to enact the first interest-rate cut of 2025.

“We have another busy week ahead,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter commented in an X thread on the topic.

Kobeissi noted that markets would be looking for hints as to future Fed policy in the upcoming macro data, with its next interest-rate decision due on Oct. 29.

Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool showed markets overwhelmingly confident that another 0.25% cut would result.

In a groundbreaking turn of events in 2025, the world of finance bore witness to the establishment of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This audacious step not only signifies a seismic acceptance of Bitcoin but also propels it into the limelight alongside traditional stalwarts like gold. No longer relegated to the sidelines, Bitcoin now stands officially recognized by the U.S. government as a national asset, sending shockwaves of transformation across markets and heralding a new era in our financial landscape.

Frequently dubbed the ""digital gold,"" Bitcoin derives its value from its inherent scarcity and its escalating role as a safeguard against inflationary pressures. With a stamp of approval from the U.S. government, institutional investors are starting to take heed, directing a portion of their investments toward this revolutionary currency. What we are witnessing is not simply a fleeting trend; it is a pivotal juncture that holds the potential to realign the very fabric of the global financial system.

The decision by President Trump to create the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has profound implications for national economic policies. Accumulating a staggering 198,000 BTC, the U.S. demonstrates its commitment to integrating cryptocurrencies within the domain of traditional investments. This bold move not only legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of both investors and everyday consumers but also ignites crucial conversations about the evolving regulatory landscape governing digital currencies.

As highlighted by research from Fidelity Digital Assets, while institutional engagement is still in its infancy, the anticipated onslaught of interest in 2025 echoes historical pivotal moments from the dawn of the internet itself. Just as the internet redefined communication, Bitcoin stands poised to transform our financial paradigms.

The inception of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve opens up fresh dialogues around Bitcoin regulations and fiscal policy. The surge of institutional investments, spanning hedge funds to retirement portfolios, illustrates a burgeoning appetite for exposure to Bitcoin. Following the SEC's favorable verdict on spot Bitcoin ETFs, an astonishing $30 billion has already found its way into Bitcoin-related investments, reinforcing its status as a coveted asset in modern financial portfolios.

These developments indicate that regulatory frameworks are likely to evolve, with governments striving to marry innovation with consumer protection. This evolution could have significant ramifications for smaller Web3 enterprises striving to weave Bitcoin into existing financial systems.

This strategic reserve is more than just a policy adjustment; it encapsulates the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin's acceptance within the global arena. Just as nations have historically leveraged gold reserves, the embrace of Bitcoin within fiscal strategies signifies a fundamental shift in the perception of digital currencies as serious financial instruments. Countries like Switzerland and Brazil are starting to make strides in adopting Bitcoin, anticipating a decrease in volatility as this cryptocurrency cleaves its niche in the global financial architecture.

Historical patterns reveal that periods marked by increased regulatory acceptance often catalyze explosive adoption rates. Analysts are looking at 2025 as a crucial year for Bitcoin, setting the stage for a wider acceptance and integration across various industries.

Incorporating Bitcoin into national asset allocations transcends mere finance; it signals a tremendous opportunity for economic advancement. By defining Bitcoin as a strategic resource, the U.S. government underscores its dedication to nurturing the role of cryptocurrency in global finance, thereby boosting financial inclusion and stimulating innovation across sectors, including remittances and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Through this ambitious initiative, the U.S. positions itself as a pacesetter in the cryptocurrency landscape, encouraging other nations to follow suit. The road to a dynamic economic environment is paved with well-strategized investments in digital assets, poised to benefit both large institutions and everyday investors alike.

The establishment of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks not just a significant moment for Bitcoin but also a transformational leap in the recognition of cryptocurrencies as vital national resources. As both institutions and sovereign powers embark on this journey of strategic Bitcoin accumulation, the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency adoption is set to redefine the future of global finance.

As we venture into 2025 and beyond, asset management strategies are on the verge of a paradigm shift, laying the groundwork for unparalleled economic growth fueled by innovative financial technologies. The world watches with bated breath as Bitcoin's promise as a reserve asset comes to fruition, ushering in a new chapter where digital currencies redefine both financial success and national aspirations.

Ethereum is now up 37% for the year, and could hit a price of $7,500 by the end of 2028.

Bitcoin could hit a price of $1 million by 2030, giving it 10-fold upside potential.

Bitcoin has proven very resilient to political, economic, and geopolitical shocks over the past five years.

In the crypto market, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) stand head and shoulders above everyone else. Together, they account for a staggering 70% of the total value of the crypto market.

So it's only natural that many investors boil down their crypto investment decision-making process to just a single question: Should I buy Bitcoin or should I buy Ethereum?

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

When it comes to upside potential, it's impossible to ignore Bitcoin. Even though it's trading for a vertigo-inducing price of $117,000 right now, most investors think that there's more to come. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin could hit a price of $1 million by the year 2030. That would represent a nearly 10-fold return from today's level!

Image source: Getty Images.

But don't sleep on Ethereum. Thanks to a rip-roaring summer rally, investors are suddenly ecstatic about the future upside potential of Ethereum. New stablecoin legislation, for example, appears to dramatically expand the utility of Ethereum, which already ranks as the top blockchain for stablecoin activity.

Moreover, growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) promises to deliver even more upside for the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. More and more of the traditional financial system finally seems to be migrating over to blockchain technology, and that's a huge plus for Ethereum, which is the clear leader in DeFi right now.

The recent emergence of digital asset treasury companies that invest only in a specific cryptocurrency has also lit a fire under the price of Ethereum. This summer saw the launch of two high-profile Ethereum treasury companies that are accumulating ETH at a prodigious rate. That's going to create a consistent, long-term source of demand for Ethereum.

As a result, investors are rapidly raising their price forecasts for Ethereum. For example, Standard Chartered now thinks that Ethereum could hit a price of $7,500 by the end of this year, and a price of $25,000 by the end of 2028. Based on Ethereum's current price of about $4,500, that's a more than fivefold increase in just 36 months!

Arguably, it's a toss-up over which cryptocurrency has higher upside potential. But there's no disagreement whatsoever about which cryptocurrency provides a better hedge against macroeconomic risks such as inflation.

For good reason, Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold. During times of financial distress, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a safe asset, just like gold.

In September 2024, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) analyzed Bitcoin's resilience to political, economic, and geopolitical shocks. The findings were eye-opening. During the past five years, Bitcoin has lived up to its billing as a safe asset. Yes, there have been times when Bitcoin has taken a beating after shocks first appear in the global financial system. But over the long term, Bitcoin eventually outperforms even gold.

For example, take the COVID-19 outbreak. Investors were understandably spooked about the impact of a global pandemic on economic growth, and Bitcoin promptly lost 23% of its value in the first 10 days. But, over a longer 60-day period, Bitcoin actually delivered returns of 24%. By way of comparison, gold only delivered returns of 2% during that time period.

The same phenomenon occurred with global tariffs this year. As soon as the new global tariff regime was announced on ""Liberation Day,"" Bitcoin began to tank. But, within a month, Bitcoin started to recover. For the year, Bitcoin is now back in the green, and appears to be more tariff-resistant than many investors first thought.

Based on the above, Bitcoin is a better buy than Ethereum right now. Yes, Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin in 2025. Ethereum is up 37%, while Bitcoin is up only 24%. But the long-term upside potential of Bitcoin is much higher. 

Moreover, if you take a much more nuanced look at these two cryptocurrencies, and consider how they hold up under adverse market conditions, it's easy to see why Bitcoin is the preferable investment. It simply holds up so well under extremely challenging market conditions.

Just keep in mind -- just because Bitcoin has more upside potential doesn't mean that its price is only going to go up. Bitcoin remains a highly volatile and highly speculative asset, prone to periods of boom and bust. But if there's one cryptocurrency that I trust to hold up well under the very worst market conditions, it's Bitcoin.

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $661,694!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $1,082,963!*

Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,067% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 189% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.

 Vitalik Buterin said low-risk DeFi protocols can bring in stable revenue for the network, like how Google Search does for Google, but while also ensuring Ethereum's core values remain intact. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said revenue from low-risk decentralized finance protocols could give the network economic stability — much like Google Search supports Google — while letting nonfinancial apps uphold Ethereum's cultural values.  

Low-risk DeFi could address “important tensions” in the Ethereum community over whether apps that bring in enough revenue to economically sustain the ecosystem align with the cultural and ethical values that brought people to Ethereum in the first place, Buterin said in a blog post on Saturday.

The former has been a combination of nonfungible tokens, memecoins, and speculative trading, while the nonfinancial and semifinancial apps that reflect Ethereum's cultural values have either struggled to gain widespread adoption or haven't generated enough fees, he said.

“This disjointness created a lot of dissonance in the community,” Buterin said, before making his case for low-risk DeFi being Ethereum's main fee generator. One example Buterin highlighted was deposit rates for stablecoin lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which hover around 5% for blue-chips like Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) and above 10% for higher risk stables.

Similarly, Buterin noted that Google does many “interesting and valuable things” — such as its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, its open-source AI Gemini models, and more — but the revenue they make from those products is a fraction compared to what it makes through search and advertisements. 

It comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. DeFi TVL tanked massively across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, and TVL figures have largely trailed the performance of top layer 1 tokens this bull market.

Related: Ethereum is the ‘biggest macro trade' for next 10-15 years: Fundstrat

However, DeFi has picked up lately amid an increase in regulatory momentum, particularly the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is tipped to push DeFi adoption even further. A recent survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans are open to DeFi if stronger laws are put in place.

Ethereum has the potential to “do much better” than Google due to its decentralization. Unlike Google, Ethereum's decentralized structure better positions low-risk DeFi to align financial success with ethical outcomes, creating harmony between “doing well” and “being good.”

Buterin criticized Google's incentive model, noting that advertising revenue pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive-sum ethos.

While low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the US dollar — particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries — Buterin would like to see other innovations that provide economic support to Ethereum.

Buterin pitched the idea of building cryptoassets that track a basket of currencies and flatcoins that are based directly on consumer price indices.

Vitalik Buterin Reveals Next Big Step for Blockchain","https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:f2e75cbdc094b:0-ethereum-s-google-moment-vitalik-buterin-reveals-next-big-step-for-blockchain/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:18:00 GMT","

According to Vitalik Buterin, the future of Ethereum ETHUSD lies not in NFTs or meme coins, but in something far simpler — low-risk DeFi. In a new essay, the Ethereum co-founder likened this to how search became Google's main source of income, powering every other service around the internet giant.

In short, the point is that Ethereum doesn't need hype cycles to survive. What it needs is a solid foundation of payment systems, savings accounts, collateralized lending and synthetic assets that will stand the test of time. These are trustworthy tools that also keep ETH locked up and fees flowing.

Low-risk defi can be for Ethereum what search was for Googlehttps://t.co/6xIxCrOToQ

The numbers show why this shift is important. Back in 2019, Ethereum DeFi losses amounted to more than 5% of the total value locked. By 2025, that figure had dropped to almost zero.

Protocols have become safer, risks have dropped, and the wild edges of DeFi have moved further away from the core. Buterin argues that, for millions of users, the risks in traditional finance are now greater than those in DeFi.

""Digital oil"" or new Google?

Low-risk DeFi also creates opportunities for the road ahead. These include reputation-based lending without heavy collateral, prediction markets used for hedging and new forms of stable value, such as ""flatcoins"" tied to inflation indexes. All of these build on the safer foundations being formed today.

Buterin is clear in his message — Ethereum's biggest application doesn't need to be revolutionary. It just needs to work everywhere, reliably. Low-risk DeFi fits that role, and if he is right, it could be the piece that finally makes Ethereum both sustainable and integral.

Ethereum may have found its killer app. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that low-risk decentralized finance (DeFi) could do for Ethereum what search did for Google. It could provide a reliable, global revenue engine while staying aligned with community values.

For years, Ethereum faced a divide between apps that generated revenue and apps that fulfilled its founding ideals. High-fee activity like NFTs and memecoins brought money but little long-term value. At the same time, projects like ENS, Lens, or privacy protocols were innovative but could not sustain the wider $500 billion ecosystem.

That gap left the community waiting for something that could tick both boxes. In 2025, many now believe Ethereum has it: low-risk DeFi.

Low-risk DeFi refers to simple but powerful tools such as payments, savings, fully collateralized lending, synthetic assets, and transparent exchanges between them. Unlike speculative yield farming or memecoins, these services provide real value and are increasingly secure.

Aave, Maker, and other platforms already offer competitive deposit rates on stablecoins. At the same time, hacks and failures, while still present, are being pushed to the experimental edges of the ecosystem.

Two things changed. First, protocols have matured, lowering risks compared to the early days. Second, traditional finance itself looks shakier in parts of the world. For many, DeFi's transparent and automated systems now appear safer than unstable banks or politicized currencies.

Ethereum's revenue base is also stabilizing. Transaction fees and collateral demand from low-risk DeFi now provide steady economic support while avoiding the perverse incentives that came with speculative bubbles.

The analogy to Google is deliberate. Most of Google's innovation, from AI models to new programming languages, generates little revenue. Search and ads pay the bills. Buterin argued this model incentivized Google to hoard user data and prioritize profit over openness.

Ethereum's low-risk DeFi, by contrast, aligns economics with mission. It enables global and permissionless access to payments and savings while strengthening ETH's role as collateral. It is profitable, sustainable, and culturally congruent.

Low-risk DeFi may be just the foundation. It can evolve into undercollateralized lending, prediction markets for hedging, and new forms of value such as basket currencies or flatcoins. Each step would expand financial inclusion while keeping Ethereum's ethos intact.

If this thesis holds, Ethereum's future may not rest on speculative bubbles or short-lived fads. Instead, its long-term growth could be anchored by the steady, global demand for safe and open financial infrastructure.

Although BTC barely reacted positively to the Fed's rate cut this time, it may do so in the event of additional price cuts in the coming months.

Contrary to broader expectations that cryptocurrencies would rally in the event of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market has witnessed almost no reaction since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ended.

Analysts at the market research firm Santiment already predicted that a rate cut larger than 25 basis points (bps) could trigger a big breakout. On the other hand, a non-rate cut outcome was expected to lead to a chaotic pullback. Neither scenario has played out, but analysts believe it is still too early to draw conclusions.

On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by 25bps, lowering the benchmark range to 4.00%–4.25%. This development has restarted the American easing cycle after a long hiatus.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell clarified that the rate reduction occurred not because inflation risk has decreased, but because economic growth and job creation appear softer.

Powell explained that there wasn't a strong enough environment for a 50bps cut. However, predictions across the market suggest there could be additional easing this year. The outcomes of the seventh and eighth FOMC meetings, scheduled for October and December, could include up to 50 bps cuts.

In the event of additional price cuts in the coming months, BTC could experience significant price action. While the market awaits, analysts say traders face a moderate level of risk in buying and adding bitcoins to their portfolios at this time. This is because BTC likely has more room to grow.

Over the last 30 days, average active BTC wallets have generated an average profit of 3.5% on their investments. In the past year, that figure has risen by 16.1%. With a possible straight path toward $120,000 in the coming weeks, driven by a favorable macroeconomic environment, analysts expect these wallets to amass more substantial profits.

Meanwhile, Santiment analysts noted a significant surge in social dominance during the FOMC meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday. This spike surpassed the social dominance of any other discussions about the FOMC or Powell. Such an increase has not been recorded since April, when President Donald Trump's tariffs had a chokehold on financial markets.

“What does this huge social spike mean? Well, traders were particularly keyed in on this one, considering it would (and turned out to) be the first cut in nearly two years. And unlike the dozen or so past FOMC meetings, this one was finally the one that was finally anticipated to result in a change,” Santiment stated.

Binance Coin (BNB) has just moved over $1,000, making it one of the strongest exchange token. Solana (SOL) is also building momentum, with analysts predicting a similar run to $1,000. But as these two seasoned players continue going up, the most potential in 2025 could lie with a newcomer in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For the price of just $0.035 in presale, MUTM is anticipating a 50x return thanks to its lending and borrowing DeFi protocol, and it's the most explosive-growth altcoin among this group.

Binance Coin (BNB) currently exchanges for $985.43, its 24-hour high and low being $980.38 and $1,005.29, up about 9% in the last week. Its rally highlights the huge demand within the Binance ecosystem, like the use of transaction fees, token burning, and usage in Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. 

Resistance seems to be around the $1,000 level, while key support is forming around the $900-$950 level. Compared to BNB's established structure and market positioning, investors are looking at Mutuum Finance, for what they perceive as potential improved percentage gain in the next bull cycle.

Solana (SOL) is trading at $247.60, where it stands close to the $250 level and continues to consolidate after recent activity. The network retains steadfastness in sustaining elevated transactional volume and decentralized application activity, further securing its position within the broader market. 

Current price action suggests a consolidation phase, with interest in seeing if SOL is able to sustain this steadiness before breaking towards greater levels. As Solana maintains its established position,  Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being monitored for possibly greater upside, given its early-stage position in the market. 

Mutuum Finance has achieved a record-breaking presale rate of adoption and has over 16,450 investors buying coins to raise over $16.05 million raised so far. Tokens can be bought at $0.035 per token during Phase 6. Its tiered system is an incentive system and early birds will benefit most.

Mutuum Finance's aim is to revolutionize DeFi. The project has a token giveaway for early adopters by providing $100,000 MUTM where 10 lucky people will receive a reward of $10,000 MUTM.



In addition to the apparent creation of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin onto the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins which have depegged during times of financial stress, the stablecoin introduced by Mutuum will be considered non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and as such can uphold its peg during times of financial stress.

The model capitalizes on the idle collateral reserve stability to be long-term stable with a value preservation guarantee. This positions the stablecoin as a safe store of value, and a safe depository. The top 2025 altcoin punt is in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with minimum 50x ROI for the early adopters.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the altcoin with biggest upside potential among BNB and SOL. Whereas Binance Coin (BNB) just broke above $1,000 with potential to go higher, and Solana (SOL) is trading at the $250 level on its path towards its own $1,000 goal, MUTM has much better percentage gains. At a paltry $0.035 during Stage 6 presale, with more than $16.05M invested and 16,450+ investors signed up, professionals predict 50x gains for early buyers. Lock your tokens in now at Stage 6 before the next price increase and setup for maximum potential.

Home - Crypto Presales - XRP vs MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analyst Debate Highlights Best Altcoins to Buy for Q4 Breakouts

The final quarter of 2025 has opened with a heated debate among analysts: which altcoin will deliver the stronger breakout – XRP or MAGACOIN FINANCE? Both tokens have captured market attention, but for very different reasons. XRP, with its established payment network and growing institutional traction, is viewed as a steady large-cap poised for further gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, meanwhile, is the fast-rising presale token attracting headlines with bold growth projections.


Analysts in XRP's corner argue that it has something presale tokens can't replicate – proven adoption. Ripple's partnerships with banks and financial institutions across multiple continents give XRP a tangible use case in payments and settlement. With the token trading near $3.05, many believe it could push toward $5 if institutional flows continue.

Proponents point to Ripple's ETF filing in the U.S. as another potential catalyst. If approved, it could bring a new wave of legitimacy and inflows to XRP, elevating it further into the spotlight. “XRP is past the stage of speculation,” one analyst explained. “It's a functioning asset with real-world demand.”











On the other side of the debate are those betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has gained attention by positioning itself as one of the best presales of 2025, with analysts projecting the potential for massive gains once it lists. Unlike XRP, which moves in measured increments, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the possibility of 50x-type returns if early momentum sustains.

Its presale has already exceeded expectations, raising millions and capturing a growing online community. Supporters argue that while XRP represents safety and steady adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents pure opportunity. “This is about entering before the real rally begins,” another analyst said. “XRP might double, but MAGACOIN FINANCE could multiply many times over.”

The debate ultimately comes down to a matter of risk tolerance. XRP is a relatively safer option backed by years of development and regulatory clarity. It has liquidity, adoption, and an established place in portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, thrives on being new and untested – qualities that make it risky but also capable of delivering the type of explosive gains rarely found in established tokens.

Investors weighing the two have to decide whether they want incremental growth or asymmetric upside. Historically, both approaches have worked – blue-chip altcoins like XRP provide stability, while early-stage tokens often deliver the most spectacular rallies.











Timing adds urgency to the debate. With Ethereum ETF speculation, Bitcoin whale accumulation, and retail momentum all heating up, the final quarter of the year is shaping up to be decisive. Analysts expect heightened volatility across the board, meaning both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from renewed liquidity entering the market.

For XRP, the question is whether adoption milestones can push it into new price territory. For MAGACOIN FINANCE, the test is whether presale enthusiasm translates into sustained momentum once trading begins.

The XRP vs MAGACOIN FINANCE debate captures the essence of crypto investing. XRP offers established strength, backed by adoption and institutional legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold potential, driven by presale energy and speculative appetite.

Neither camp is wrong – they simply represent different strategies. Conservative investors may lean toward XRP, while risk-takers may see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the real play for Q4. In truth, both tokens reflect the market's dual nature: stability on one side, speculation on the other.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Ethereum's 'Google Moment'? Vitalik Buterin Reveals Next Big Step for Blockchain","https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:f2e75cbdc094b:0-ethereum-s-google-moment-vitalik-buterin-reveals-next-big-step-for-blockchain/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:18:00 GMT","

According to Vitalik Buterin, the future of Ethereum ETHUSD lies not in NFTs or meme coins, but in something far simpler — low-risk DeFi. In a new essay, the Ethereum co-founder likened this to how search became Google's main source of income, powering every other service around the internet giant.

In short, the point is that Ethereum doesn't need hype cycles to survive. What it needs is a solid foundation of payment systems, savings accounts, collateralized lending and synthetic assets that will stand the test of time. These are trustworthy tools that also keep ETH locked up and fees flowing.

Low-risk defi can be for Ethereum what search was for Googlehttps://t.co/6xIxCrOToQ

The numbers show why this shift is important. Back in 2019, Ethereum DeFi losses amounted to more than 5% of the total value locked. By 2025, that figure had dropped to almost zero.

Protocols have become safer, risks have dropped, and the wild edges of DeFi have moved further away from the core. Buterin argues that, for millions of users, the risks in traditional finance are now greater than those in DeFi.

""Digital oil"" or new Google?

Low-risk DeFi also creates opportunities for the road ahead. These include reputation-based lending without heavy collateral, prediction markets used for hedging and new forms of stable value, such as ""flatcoins"" tied to inflation indexes. All of these build on the safer foundations being formed today.

Buterin is clear in his message — Ethereum's biggest application doesn't need to be revolutionary. It just needs to work everywhere, reliably. Low-risk DeFi fits that role, and if he is right, it could be the piece that finally makes Ethereum both sustainable and integral.

Introduction: Strategic Alliances in the Blockchain Payment Sector

Amid the rapid evolution of blockchain technology, payment-focused public blockchains, as critical infrastructure bridging traditional finance and the Web3 world, are encountering unprecedented opportunities. Recently, UPCX, a high-performance blockchain payment platform, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Paycle and NTT Digital, a member of the global NTT DOCOMO Group.

This collaboration aims to jointly advance the research, development, and application of next-generation decentralized payment systems, including optimizing technical specifications, developing SDKs/APIs, and promoting real-world use cases for financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. For an emerging blockchain positioned to “optimize payment and financial services,” this MOU is not merely a technical partnership but a milestone in UPCX's transition from proof-of-concept to mainstream adoption. It signals UPCX's entry into Japan—one of the world's leading markets for Web3 adoption, with over 12 million verified crypto users—and leverages NTT's global telecommunications network to expand worldwide. This article analyzes the deeper significance of this collaboration and explores its potential impact on UPCX's long-term investment value.

UPCX's Positioning: Unique Advantages of a High-Performance Payment Blockchain

UPCX is an open-source decentralized payment network built on Graphene blockchain technology, integrating Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms, optimized specifically for payment and financial scenarios. Its core strengths address pain points of traditional blockchains in payment applications, achieving high throughput (up to 100,000 TPS), 1-second confirmation times to overcome latency issues, low gas fees for cost efficiency, and seamless bidirectional cross-chain transfers with Ethereum via the UPCX Bridge. Unlike general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, UPCX functions as a “multifunctional Web3 toolbox,” supporting stablecoin issuance, non-custodial custody, multi-signature payments, and scheduled/recurring payments, delivering a “smartphone-like intuitive” blockchain payment experience.

As a nascent project, UPCX launched its mainnet in early 2025 and was listed on Japan's BitTrade exchange, emphasizing regulatory compliance. However, in the competitive payment blockchain race (e.g., Solana, Ripple), UPCX faces challenges in ecosystem development and market penetration. This MOU represents a critical breakthrough.

MOU Details: Technical Synergy and Market Empowerment

The core of this tripartite collaboration is the transition “from technical vision to real-world implementation.” Paycle will provide blockchain technology expertise, supporting UPCX in refining technical specifications and developing interfaces (e.g., SDKs and APIs) to enhance competitiveness in high-frequency payment scenarios like retail and cross-border settlements. Founded in 2018, Paycle, a Japanese FinTech pioneer specializing in blockchain, AI, and quantum-resistant cryptography, has prior ties with UPCX dating back to 2023. Meanwhile, NTT Digital, as NTT Group's Web3 enabler, will leverage its global telecommunications network to facilitate UPCX's infrastructure adoption by enterprise clients, particularly financial institutions and crypto exchanges, while supporting market expansion in Japan.

The strategic intent of this MOU is clear: the three parties will jointly identify application-layer developers for the UPCX ecosystem, leveraging their respective networks to build a sustainable financial infrastructure. For UPCX, this shifts the paradigm from “solo effort” to “ecosystem synergy”—Paycle provides technical depth, while NTT offers market breadth. As one of the world's most regulated and mature blockchain markets, Japan positions this partnership to accelerate UPCX's global strategy in Asia and beyond. Community feedback has been positive, with many token holders calling this a “pivotal step for UPCX's ascent,” highlighting its role in accelerating DeFi adoption.



Short-Term Impact: Brand Enhancement and Ecosystem Expansion

In the short term, this MOU will significantly boost UPCX's visibility and credibility. NTT's endorsement effectively brands UPCX as a “mainstream player”—as Japan's telecommunications giant, NTT's Web3 initiatives span globally, opening doors to Japanese financial institutions. This is expected to drive increased transaction activity and network usage, attracting more institutional partners through compliant network access. Additionally, UPCX's stablecoin issuance and cross-border payment capabilities will benefit from NTT's global telecom infrastructure, accelerating real-world deployment in retail and international settlement scenarios.

Long-Term Value: From Emerging Player to Infrastructure Provider

For investors, the MOU's long-term value lies in transforming UPCX from an “emerging player” to an “infrastructure provider.” First, technical fortification: Paycle's optimizations will further enhance UPCX's TPS and security, making it ideal for high-frequency scenarios like supply chain finance and DAO payroll automation. This not only boosts token utility (UPC as gas fees and staked assets) but may also attract more stablecoin issuance (e.g., USD/EUR-pegged versions), amplifying network effects.

Second, market expansion and compliance dividends: Japan, as a “blockchain testing ground,” offers replicable experience for markets like Singapore, South Korea, and the EU. NTT's global network will accelerate UPCX's cross-border payment adoption, aiming to build a “sustainable financial economic foundation.” In the long run, as global payment markets shift toward blockchain, UPCX's positioning will capitalize on DeFi and Real-World Asset (RWA) trends, potentially driving multiples in valuation.

Finally, balancing risks and opportunities: Emerging blockchains face high volatility and regulatory uncertainties, but UPCX's compliance focus and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. For long-term holders, UPCX represents a “blue-chip contender” in the payment sector—akin to early Solana's returns but with a more focused vertical.

Conclusion: From MOU to Mainstream, UPCX's Investment Narrative Evolves

The MOU with Paycle and NTT Digital is not only a model of technical collaboration but a catalyst for an emerging payment blockchain to go mainstream. It will accelerate UPCX's global journey, solidifying its leadership in high-performance payment solutions.

For investors, this is a signal worth noting: in a fragmented blockchain payment market, UPCX is building a moat through strategic alliances. Looking ahead, as more real-world use cases materialize, UPCX has the potential to become a “hidden champion” in Web3 payments. Caution is advised, and investors should monitor mainnet data and future developments. UPCX's journey is just beginning, but this step is already cause for excitement.

Home - Reviews - Aleo Blockchain Review: Experience the Seamless Future of Private Web3 Transactions

In the evolving landscape of Web3, privacy remains a paramount concern. Aleo Blockchain emerges as a transformative solution, leveraging cutting-edge zero-knowledge cryptography to redefine confidential interactions on the blockchain. This innovative platform empowers users and developers to build a more private and secure digital future, seamlessly blending discretion with decentralization.











Aleo Blockchain is a pioneering Layer-1 blockchain that prioritizes user privacy through zero-knowledge cryptography. Unlike transparent networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Aleo ensures all transactions and smart contract executions are private by default. This core design protects sensitive user data while maintaining the security and verifiability of a public ledger.

By embedding privacy at its foundation, Aleo Blockchain addresses a significant gap in the blockchain space, offering a platform suitable for applications demanding both confidentiality and compliance. Its innovative approach has attracted substantial support from leading investors who recognize its potential to foster a new era of private web interactions.



The network's foundational philosophy is “privacy by default.” This means user interactions are inherently confidential without requiring extra steps. Traditional blockchains publicly expose transaction details, creating risks for users and enterprises. Aleo Blockchain eliminates this vulnerability by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). 

This advanced cryptography allows the network to verify information without revealing any underlying personal or financial data. Consequently, users can conduct sensitive operations with guaranteed discretion, making personal and business confidentiality a standard feature.

Aleo's architecture supports a broad spectrum of real-world applications across various sectors. In finance, it enables private payroll, compliant DeFi, and discreet payments. For digital identity, solutions like zPass allow users to prove credentials such as age or residency without unnecessary data exposure. The gaming industry benefits from provably fair mechanisms and true asset ownership without compromising player privacy. 

This versatility extends to other fields like secure data sharing and supply chain management, where Aleo's ability to combine verification with privacy opens new possibilities for business and personal use.

The Aleo Blockchain's ecosystem is powered by its native token, ALEO. It is primarily used for paying network transaction fees and accessing computational resources. The token also plays a crucial role in network incentives, rewarding validators and provers for securing the blockchain and generating zero-knowledge proofs. 

Furthermore, it facilitates community governance, allowing holders to participate in key decisions. With a fixed supply, the ALEO token is designed to support a sustainable economy centered on private decentralized applications, ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized.











Aleo Blockchain employs a novel hybrid consensus algorithm called AleoBFT, which integrates delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) with a proof-generation mechanism known as Proof-of-Succinct-Work (PoSW). Validators, who require a minimum stake to participate, are responsible for confirming transactions and producing blocks. Simultaneously, provers (often called “ZK miners”) use specialized hardware to generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that solve computational puzzles. 

These proofs are verified by validators and included in blocks, ensuring both network security and efficient transaction finality. This combination leverages the scalability of dPoS and the cryptographic security of PoSW.

At Aleo Blockchain's core is zkCloud, an off-chain execution environment comprising snarkVM and snarkOS. snarkVM is a virtual machine that processes private smart contracts off-chain, generating succinct proofs of correct execution without revealing underlying data. snarkOS acts as the decentralized operating system, managing data availability, consensus, and networking. 

This structure allows developers to run complex computations off-chain, submitting only verified proofs to the blockchain, which drastically reduces on-chain congestion and enhances scalability while maintaining privacy.

Aleo Blockchain introduces Leo, a Rust-inspired programming language designed specifically for writing privacy-preserving applications. Leo abstracts low-level cryptographic complexities, enabling developers to create zero-knowledge circuits without deep expertise in ZKPs. Programs written in Leo compile into zk-SNARK circuits, which define the rules for private computations. 

This allows developers to build applications where users can interact with smart contracts and prove transaction validity without exposing sensitive information, such as identity details or financial data.

Aleo Blockchain innovates with a dual-state storage model, offering both private and public on-chain data options. Private states use an encrypted record system, similar to Bitcoin's UTXO model, where data is stored as ciphertext accessible only to owners via decryption keys. Public states employ mappings for transparent data storage, queryable by anyone. Developers can dynamically switch between these states based on application needs, enabling flexibility for use cases like gaming or voting.











The ALEO token is the native cryptocurrency of the Aleo blockchain, designed to power its ecosystem of private applications. It serves as the primary medium for accessing network resources, enabling users to pay transaction fees and deploy programs. Beyond basic utility, the token is fundamental to network security. 

It incentivizes participants like validators and provers, who are rewarded in ALEO for verifying transactions and generating zero-knowledge proofs, thus maintaining the integrity and functionality of the decentralized system. This economic model ensures that all network operations are compensated, fostering a self-sustaining privacy-focused environment.

Aleo's tokenomics are structured to support long-term growth and decentralization. The initial supply at launch was 1.5 billion tokens, allocated to early backers (34%), grants and education (25%), employees and contributors (17%), the Aleo Network Foundation & Provable (16%), and strategic partners (8%). Rewards are distributed to provers solving cryptographic puzzles and validators securing the network, with block rewards set at a constant rate per block. 

The total circulating supply is designed to grow to 2.6 billion over a decade, with an inflation rate decreasing from 12% in year one to 2% by year ten, eventually approaching zero to ensure sustainability.

Investing in ALEO presents a blend of opportunities and risks. Its association with innovative zero-knowledge technology and growing developer interest positions it well in the privacy-centric blockchain sector, suggesting potential for appreciation. However, the token faces significant market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, particularly due to its privacy features, which could attract scrutiny.

Success hinges on widespread adoption of Aleo's technology, and it faces stiff competition from established cryptocurrencies. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance, conduct thorough research, and consider the long-term horizon typical of early-stage ventures in the evolving crypto market.

Aleo Blockchain has implemented various incentive programs to bootstrap ecosystem development and reward early contributors. These initiatives, including prover incentives, testnet participation, and ambassador programs, distribute tokens to participants who help secure and grow the network. Eligible contributors must undergo a claim process involving identity verification and adherence to lockup periods, particularly for U.S. residents subject to a one-year holding restriction.

Aleo Blockchain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain, delivering uncompromising privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. By enabling confidential transactions and programmable discretion, it addresses critical gaps in digital trust. As the ecosystem evolves, Aleo is poised to become foundational infrastructure for a more secure, private, and user-centric decentralized internet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Pudgy Penguins Ready to Take Flight with PENGU Token's Remarkable Surge","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/pudgy-penguins-pengu-token-surge-market-growth","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 13:15:39 GMT","

What if a simple mobile game could reshape an entire cryptocurrency landscape? This isn't just hypothetical — it's the thrilling reality for the Pudgy Penguins community. The much-anticipated debut of the Pudgy Party mobile game has sent shockwaves through the crypto sector, amassing a staggering 750,000 downloads within a blink of an eye. This meteoric success has prompted an avalanche of speculation regarding the PENGU token, rapidly captivating both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. As the interplay between gaming and cryptocurrency garners unprecedented interest, institutional investors are zeroing in on this NFT phenomenon. What does this unprecedented rise imply for Pudgy Penguins' trajectory and the overarching narrative of crypto expansion?

The Pudgy Party mobile game represents far more than just another addition to the gaming industry; it marks a defining moment for the Pudgy Penguins brand. Since its launch on August 29, it has swiftly become one of the most talked-about titles within the Web3 ecosystem. Crafted by Mythical Games, the game proves that engaging and enriching gameplay can act as a catalyst for mass adoption in blockchain-based entertainment. Such explosive popularity is a clear signal of substantial demand for fresh Web3 experiences, drawing in both gaming devotees and crypto aficionados in droves.

This strategic pivot transforms Pudgy Penguins from a quirky meme into a formidable player within the gaming and NFT sectors. By employing tools like the Early to the Party Soulbound Token (SBT), they're not just creating gamers; they're engendering unwavering community loyalty and enriching engagement among players.

In the wake of the Pudgy Party's exhilarating success, the PENGU token has skyrocketed by an astounding 800%. Analysts are abuzz with the exhilarating prospect of PENGU reaching prices as high as $0.22. The close connection between the game's success and the burgeoning interest in PENGU underscores a palpable shift in crypto market dynamics. Institutional endorsement, including hints at potential ETF applications, is fanning the flames of optimism throughout the market.

Luca Netz, Pudgy Penguins' CEO, asserts that this wave of developments is not solely about igniting short-term enthusiasm; it's about solidifying the brand's reputation within the industry. The surge in engagement from Asian investors demonstrates a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency assets, thereby positioning Pudgy Penguins as a compelling investment prospect for those dabbling in digital assets.

Pudgy Penguins' ascent isn't merely a tale of organic growth; it's significantly underpinned by strategic alliances that amplify its visibility in the marketplace. Partnerships with heavyweights like Mythical Games and various financial institutions lend crucial credibility. These collaborations merge digital payment solutions with traditional finance, reflecting compliance with dynamic regulations while elevating standards for the entire crypto ecosystem.

The broader ramifications of these partnerships reveal a revealing trend: institutional investors are increasingly inclined to back projects that outline clear growth strategies and innovative frameworks. This growing sentiment is mirrored in the soaring prices of PENGU tokens amidst rising trade volumes and favorable market sentiment.

As elation surges around the recent price upticks, the daunting specter of market volatility casts a shadow. Historical patterns demonstrate that market behaviors often hinge on the short-lived triumphs from games or hot NFT drops; true stability, however, lies in continuous innovation paired with prudent fiscal governance. For Pudgy Penguins, the challenge will be sustaining momentum through a fortified framework that champions ongoing progress and community involvement.

Industry experts warn that simply riding the wave of excitement isn't sufficient; without a balanced approach that intertwines engaging gameplay with sustainable growth, the brand risks perpetuating a lingering “meme coin” reputation. As Pudgy Penguins charts a course toward audacious financial products in the crypto domain, a strategic and holistic methodology is imperative to ensure enduring success.

As Pudgy Penguins and its PENGU token continue to capture headlines, a widening array of observers is drawn into their captivating success narrative. The synergy of a hit mobile game, pivotal partnerships, and a surge in investor enthusiasm highlights the potential for Pudgy Penguins to reestablish itself within the crypto arena.

With the tantalizing prospect of ETF applications and growing institutional support on the horizon, the outlook appears bullish for this vibrant NFT brand. However, navigating the labyrinthine market conditions amid mounting regulatory scrutiny will remain a critical test. The evolution of Pudgy Penguins heralds an exhilarating fusion of gaming and cryptocurrency, lighting up pathways of opportunity in what promises to be a dynamic future.

Let's be real: Gen Z isn't here for spreadsheets, gas fees, or being rugged by another copy-paste dog coin. This generation was raised on side hustles, serotonin boosts, and financial systems that reward vibes as much as volume. They want meme coins with meaning, tokens that actually do something, and platforms that don't make you feel dumb for asking what APY is.

That's why more and more Gen Z investors are skipping the usual crypto hype cycles and stacking $HUGS, the utility token from Milk & Mocha, the globally adored bear duo with 3M+ fans.

Because in the Main Character Era, the smartest play isn't just to go viral, it's to earn passive income while you're being iconic.

$HUGS is the official token of the Milk & Mocha meme coin ecosystem, a cuddly-but-crypto-savvy project that combines feel-good IP with real DeFi mechanics. While most meme coins rely on hope and hashtags, $HUGS rewards users from day one.

Gen Z isn't buying $HUGS because it's cute (although it is). They're buying it because it pays 50% APY, has lifetime referral bonuses, and doesn't lock you into anything.

It's a full-on staking-and-chilling setup where your wallet earns while you sleep, scroll, or post about your latest NFT fit.

Let's break it down:

For a generation that expects instant feedback (thanks, TikTok), $HUGS staking delivers that dopamine hit. And if you're feeling long-term, there's even an auto-compound feature to boost your earnings without touching a thing.



This isn't your dad's yield farm. This is Gen Z's version of a savings account, only it's wrapped in bears, badges, and bonus tokens.

Referral codes usually feel scammy. Not here. With $HUGS, every friend you invite earns you and them 10% in extra tokens. And that bonus doesn't just hit once, it activates every time they buy.

Let that sink in.

It's a system that turns social clout into passive income, and Gen Z knows how to run with that.

Milk & Mocha isn't just a token. It's an aesthetic. And that matters when you're building a meme coin brand for Gen Z.

This isn't some terminal-based staking vault with cryptic UI. This is Web3 for people who want to earn without feeling like they've entered a DeFi jungle.

Dogecoin and Pepe had their moment, but Gen Z is looking for more than just noise and nostalgia. Here's the mindset shift:

Milk & Mocha didn't start in crypto. It started in the hearts of a global fandom. So when $HUGS hit the scene, it wasn't begging for attention. It had it.

And now it's converting that attention into one of the most robust token reward systems in Web3.

Later this year, the Milk & Mocha team will roll out mini-games and metaverse features, all powered by $HUGS. You'll be able to:

This creates an actual token loop, one where Gen Z can earn, spend, compete, and build without exiting the economy. You're not farming, you're flexing. And it works.



TL;DR for Gen Z Investors:

Milk & Mocha's $HUGS token isn't trying to be the loudest project in crypto. It's just doing the work: paying you daily, rewarding you for being social, and giving you a brand you can actually enjoy holding.

In the Main Character Era, where Gen Z wants financial freedom and emotional payoff, $HUGS is the only meme coin that fits the vibe.

So go ahead. Stake. Refer. Stack. Smile.

Because the future of crypto doesn't bark, it hugs.

Dogecoin's community continues to fuel hopes of another Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally, but the coin often relies on speculation over delivery. Shiba Inu traders are watching charts with optimism, though much of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish analysis rests on token burns and sentiment rather than infrastructure. 

That raises a simple question: can hype alone sustain long-term value? This is where BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart. Rather than following meme-driven cycles, it's building a scalable engine that underpins miners, mobile apps, and smart contracts, while preparing for DePIN and AI integrations. With a CertiK audit, a DAG + PoW hybrid structure, and an accessible presale entry, BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than a token. For those searching for the best new crypto to buy, BDAG is being treated as the real foundation for tomorrow's crypto stack.

BlockDAG is designing its network to operate as an engine, not just another coin. It combines Proof-of-Work with DAG technology, giving the system scalability and speed while staying secure. With full EVM compatibility and a CertiK audit already completed, BlockDAG has checked off the fundamentals that separate infrastructure-level projects from hype-driven coins. This is why many see it as the best new crypto to buy, not for quick flips, but as fuel for future blockchain adoption.

The presale numbers back this narrative. Nearly $410 million has been raised so far, with $40 million added in just the last month, close to $1 million daily. More than 312,000 holders and millions of active mobile miners show that BlockDAG isn't just about future promises. Delivery is already visible through shipped hardware miners and a growing global community.



At $0.0013 per coin, the presale price offers a massive upside. But this price offer ends in 24 hours. Projections suggest a range between $0.65 and $1 post-launch, creating a potential 500x return for early participants. It's rare for a project to combine real-world adoption with such an accessible entry point, and that's why BlockDAG is being positioned as a foundational bet in the crypto cycle.

When discussions turn to the top new crypto to buy now, BlockDAG consistently ranks ahead of speculative meme coins. By focusing on core delivery and utility, it's setting itself up as the crypto engine that can power miners, applications, and advanced integrations worldwide.

The ongoing Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally has pushed prices to the $0.279–$0.28 range, with a 5% daily increase and 13% weekly gain. Whale activity has been strong, with nearly 200 billion DOGE accumulated in the $0.22–$0.24 zone, a clear sign of long-term confidence. With trading volume above $5.3 billion and a $42 billion market cap, DOGE remains a heavily traded asset. Analysts are watching a support level at $0.25 closely, as a sustained hold could open the path toward breaking above $0.30, keeping momentum alive. The mix of ETF speculation and accumulation has added fuel to the latest Dogecoin (DOGE) rally.



Still, DOGE's growth story remains tied to sentiment rather than technical infrastructure. While short-term traders benefit from its volatility, it doesn't always line up with the profile of the best new crypto to buy. For those focused on the top new crypto to buy now, Dogecoin holds short-term value but lacks the building blocks that projects like BlockDAG are delivering.

The latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish analysis shows the token consolidating near $0.000013 with a market cap of around $7.9 billion. Gains of 3% over the last 24 hours keep interest alive, especially as the coin trades in a symmetrical triangle pattern between $0.0000120 and $0.0000130. Resistance at $0.00001297 aligns with the 100-day EMA, and a breakout above this could push SHIB toward $0.00001450, a possible 10–15% gain. This technical setup, however, sits against a backdrop of a 42% year-to-date decline.



A wider Shiba Inu (SHIB) analysis bullish outlook suggests year-end targets between $0.000014 and $0.000022, with stretch goals toward $0.00005 if adoption grows. Still, SHIB leans heavily on token burns and community backing, with roughly 1 billion tokens burned weekly. That's not enough to guarantee strong deflationary growth. 

While short-term traders may see an opportunity, it doesn't fully fit the best new crypto to buy category. For longer-term positioning, it's worth comparing SHIB's meme-driven model to projects like BlockDAG, which are building core systems and can be seen as the top new crypto to buy now.

The current Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally highlights renewed momentum, supported by whale accumulation and ETF speculation, but it remains reliant on sentiment. Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish analysis points to a possible breakout above $0.000013, though its gains are still limited by token burns and hype cycles. 

Both coins continue to deliver short-term trading interest, but they don't always provide the depth that long-term investors want. That's where BlockDAG steps in with a different proposition. 

Nearly $410 million has already been raised, and live adoption through miners and mobile mining apps shows that it's not waiting for the mainnet to prove itself. For buyers asking about the best new crypto to buy, BlockDAG is being positioned as the top new crypto to buy now, offering infrastructure-level delivery with the potential for a 500x return.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Asian stablecoins: The myth of dollar dominance","https://cryptoslate.com/asian-stablecoins-the-myth-of-dollar-dominance/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

In Asia, stablecoins challenge U.S. dominance by catering to local economic needs, enabling national control over financial systems and fostering regional trade.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The following is a guest post and opinion from  Dr. Jae S. Jeong, Co-Founder and CTO, Gurufin.

Today's stablecoins are an extension of the U.S. financial system. Backed by the U.S. Dollar, they are tied to its monetary policy and indirectly answerable to its policy goals. This allegiance is useful to some, but not all. Here's why.

One myth in the digital asset world is the idea that eventually, a single digital currency will dominate global payments and commerce. With stablecoins, proponents of that myth have pointed to the U.S. Dollar, with its deep liquidity and global status, as a natural stepping stone.

There's a widespread belief that U.S. Dollar-pegged stablecoins will inevitably become the world's primary digital settlement layer. But a closer look at the economic realities on the ground in Asia suggests a very different future is taking shape: a future driven not by global ambitions, but by the practical, pressing needs of local economies.

This is a matter of practicality and national interest. Asian nations' diverse needs will foster an array of local-currency stablecoins, empowering central bankers to hedge against a dollar-denominated digital financial system.

Today, the digital asset ecosystem is indeed cast in the dollar's shadow. USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC dominate trading volume, acting as a digital gateway to the crypto markets. Since the 2024 U.S. elections, support has grown—especially for models holding U.S. government debt as reserves.

This status quo works well for the U.S. and the proponents of this myth. However, there are those peeking out from under the dollar's shadow.

The first reason has nothing to do with digital assets. Yields on Treasuries spiked as trade and tariff policy seesawed. Non-U.S. companies and governments still hold Treasuries, but the evaluation of their risk has changed. This change can be seen in the rise in central bank gold reserves.

Second, U.S. allies from Europe to Southeast Asia are rethinking the benefits of tying their trade and monetary policies to America. Dollarization, or the process of local economies becoming reliant on the U.S. Dollar, was always a cautionary tale in emerging markets. The Asian Financial Crisis was precipitated by the mismatch in Asian companies borrowing in U.S. Dollars and earning revenue in local currencies. Now, U.S. Dollar stablecoins are seen in many emerging economies as the fast track to dollarization.

This hints at the third problem, which is that monetary policy must be in service to local economic growth. Developed as a tool for national rejuvenation, modern central banks need instruments they can control to the benefit of their constituents.

By adopting U.S. Dollar stablecoins, central bankers in emerging economies—particularly, but not exclusively, in Asia—would lose the ability to use their exchange rate as a tool to absorb external shocks, especially when they occur counter to the U.S. economic cycle.

The Bank for International Settlements has already highlighted the risk of “currency substitution.” Financial regulators outside the U.S. understand the difference between this reality and the myth of Dollar dominance.

Emerging Asian economies can leverage the desire for stablecoins to reinforce their local monetary strength. Central bankers must separate the benefits of the cheaper, faster, 24/7 payment rails that stablecoins provide from the Dollar-denominated assets that have so often been their reserves.

Some are already seizing that moment. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has finalized a regulatory framework for single-currency stablecoins. This clear licensing path supports the issuance of a stablecoin pegged to the Singapore Dollar, enabling corporate treasurers to leverage it for faster, cheaper settlement for commercial payments and to streamline cross-border payments within the region.

Japan's updated Payment Services Act allows banks and licensed trust companies to issue yen-backed stablecoins. In response, SBI, Circle, Ripple, and Startale recently announced plans to jointly launch a Yen-backed stablecoin. Monex and local fintech, JPYC, are also planning local stablecoins.

For the Philippines, stablecoins are an immediate solution to the high fees and slow speeds of $3 billion in monthly remittances. A small business owner can now accept payments from overseas clients using a regulated stablecoin, instantly bypassing card network fees and receiving funds in minutes rather than days.

By developing and regulating their own local-currency stablecoins, Asian central banks can retain control over their financial systems and actively shape the digital future, rather than simply reacting to it. This model can be replicated across Asia's deep trade corridors, allowing a web of interoperable stablecoins to speed up settlement and reduce dependence on the U.S. Dollar in intra-Asia trade.

The opportunity is even more attractive for Asia's major trading houses. Many of Asia's 20th-century economies modernized around a small number of major conglomerates. In Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India, these conglomerates benefit from strong local stablecoins that can reduce friction in the flow of goods and capital between Asian businesses.

Even local merchants and small and medium-sized enterprises stand to gain. Stablecoins allow merchants to bypass the fees and settlement risk of traditional card networks.

Stablecoins are an extension of the U.S. monetary system, but they don't have to be.

Central bankers and financial regulators from Pakistan to Korea are wrestling with how to safely allow the best parts of stablecoin innovation into their economies, without accepting dollarization as a foregone conclusion. There are precedents in traditional monetary policy. Singapore has a strong local currency, separate from the U.S. Dollar, and it punches well above its weight in terms of global trade.

Innovation is about making better systems, not just replicating the old ones. Asian financial policymakers can separate fast payment rails from reserve assets, preserve room for monetary policymaking, and focus on high-value intra-Asia payment corridors.

A pluralistic stablecoin future is not yet a reality. But as with all myths, it tells a story worth pursuing.

The European Commission first proposed a digital euro currency in 2023, but discussions heated up last year, according to Reuters, as the drive to reduce Europe's dependence on U.S. and other non-EU technologies gathered momentum. The discussions recently have ratcheted up further, per Reuters, in response to President Trump's global push for stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The finance ministers met Friday in Copenhagen along with ECB President Christine Lagarde and European Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis to finalize the roadmap.

The agreement ensures that national finance ministers will have a say on whether and when the ECB would issue the currency and on how much digital euros residents will be able to hold. Their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

“The compromise that we reached is that before the ECB makes a final decision in relation to issuance…there would be an opportunity for a discussion in the Council of Ministers,” Paschal Donohoe, who chairs meetings of finance ministers, told a joint press conference.

Before the European Commission's proposal could be adopted in needs to be signed off on by the European Parliament and European Council, made up of equal representation of the EU member countries. The Council aims to complete its work on the proposal by the end of 2026, according to Reuters. The ECB hopes to have legislation in place by June.

Some EU countries currently have their own digital currencies, but none are accepted across the entire 27-nation bloc.

“The digital Europe is not just a means of payment, it is also a political statement concerning the sovereignty of Europe and its capacity to handle payment, including on a cross-border basis, with a European infrastructure and solution,” Lagarde said at the press conference.

As in the U.S., some European bankers have expressed concern that a fiat-backed digital currency would drain funds from traditional banks, limiting their ability to make loans in fiat and undercutting the traditional financial system.

In response to the Commission's original proposal in 2023, Finance Watch, a non-profit advocacy group founded in 2011 as a counterweight to financial industry lobbying, warned that a digital currency could also harm consumer privacy by enabling government financial surveillance, Reuters reported at the time.

The ECB said last year that privacy would be an important design feature of the digital euro, according to Reuters. The digital euro would not be programmable, like limited-use digital vouchers, and it would not give governments the ability to track individuals' spending, ECB digital euro chief Evelien Witlox said.

Your gateway to the global Black business ecosystem

Stablecoins are quietly reshaping how money moves online, yet most people are still fuzzy on the details.

Here's what you need to know if you're new to these digital dollars or just want a no-nonsense explainer.

These are digital currencies designed to maintain a steady value, usually by pegging to a national currency like the US dollar.

The most widely used ones are meant to stay as close as possible to $1, making them far less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Stable-value tokens fill a gap that traditional cryptocurrencies can't—they offer the speed and global access of crypto, but with price stability. This makes them useful for:

Sending money internationally: Fast, low-cost transfers compared to traditional banks.

Trading and investing: A safe place to park funds between crypto trades or during market swings.

Everyday payments: Some businesses and individuals now accept digital coins for goods and services.

Savings: In countries facing inflation or unstable local currencies, people sometimes use them to protect their money.

There are several models used to keep prices steady:

Fiat-backed: Each coin is backed 1:1 by cash or short-term assets like US Treasuries, held by the issuer.

Crypto-backed: Some are collateralized by other digital assets, with smart contracts helping maintain stability.

Algorithmic: A smaller, more experimental category uses software rules to control supply and demand.

Digital dollars reduce price volatility, but aren't risk-free:

Transparency: It's important that issuers actually hold enough reserves to back each token.

Technology risks: Bugs, hacks, or failures in code can impact users.

Changing regulations: Laws around digital assets are evolving, so the rules may shift.

The U.S. recently passed the GENIUS Act, creating new rules for digital currencies, including requirements for issuers to hold reserves in cash or U.S. Treasuries.

Tether, the largest issuer, will launch a new U.S.-compliant token called USAT.

As of September 2025, the market for these coins is nearing 300 billion dollars in circulation.

Other countries like Italy, UK, and Bahrain are also updating their laws to keep up with growth in this space.

Digital dollars are helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional money.

They can make moving, saving, and spending money online easier and more predictable—but it's important to understand the basics and stay up to date on new developments.

The European Union is developing its project regarding the digital euro, which will ensure enhanced sovereignty and a breakthrough in payments in 2025.

The leaders of the European Union met an important meeting on September 19, 2025 in Copenhagen to further advance the digital euro project. 

The Digital Euro is not merely a new currency, but it is the emblem of the sovereignty of Europe and the empowerment of cross-border payments, which is an institutional agreement in strong will. 

President of European central bank Christine Lagarde and other senior officials. The development is a significant step towards the introduction of a digital currency that is supported by the ECB.

Digital Euro is currently under the intense geopolitical pressure and competition developing quickly. The digital euro does not merely represent a payment system, as ECB President Lagarde pointed out during the Eurogroup meeting. 

She emphasized that it is a political message in terms of the capacity of Europe to regulate its payment systems and sovereignty. This infrastructure in Europe is to make sure that payment across countries is independent.

Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe affirmed that there had been agreement on the institutional structure and talked about restrictions on the amount of digital euros held. 

Nevertheless, certain upward information concerning holding caps is still in the process of development. The strategy does not interfere with the mandate and autonomy of individual institutions. The balance that Donohoe highlighted was a valuable move to develop this vital project in a timely manner. 

Geopolitical uncertainties and the global changes in the economy are the drivers that create the urgency to digitalise the currency in Europe. 

Managing Director of European Stability Mechanism Pierre Gramegna emphasized that there was a stronger motivator because of the constant geopolitical unrest.

The ESM gives the ECB the impetus and push to the digital Euro by asserting that it would be required in a turbulent international environment.

The transition of the United States to the use of digital dollars has increased the determination of the EU, in addition to internal developments. 

The European Union is reportedly considering the issuance of the digital euro on open blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana to increase resilience and innovation in the last month.

The next steps will involve legal writing by the Danish presidency and subsequent deliberations in the European parliament and council. 

It is hoped that the preparation phase will be complete by October 2025 when the ECB would arrive at a final decision on issuance after the European legislative process is completed by the early of 2026.

One of the most controversial features of President Donald Trump's second term is his relentless criticism of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining elevated interest rates – a stance Trump argues is unnecessarily costly to the American economy.

But this is more than just rhetoric. Trump is aggressively attempting to undermine the Fed's board, threatening an institution long known for its political independence. Ironically, this very assault risks backfiring, deepening what Trump and others describe as a Fed that is ""behind the curve,"" potentially leading to a deeper sell-off in the U.S. dollar.

""Political pressures make it tough to credibly shift to an overtly dovish footing. That leaves policy data driven (thus late) rather than pre-emptive. That's bad for the USD,"" the market insights team at Lloyds Bank led by Nicholas Kennedy, said in a note to clients on Sept. 18.

Last Thursday marked a new chapter in Trump's campaign against the central bank, as his administration took the unprecedented step of petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This would be the first forced removal of a sitting Fed governor since the institution's founding in 1913.

The move followed a temporary judicial block issued by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who prevented the ousting of Cook, a Biden appointee, pending further legal proceedings.

According to the Lloyds Bank market insights team, such attacks are likely to increase as Powell enters the final months of his term as Chairman. Trump's recent appointee at the Fed, Stephen Miran, is already calling for rapid-fire rate cuts and wants the bank to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 50 basis points in the recently concluded meeting.

At its core, Trump's campaign reflects a desire for a Fed more responsive to his economic worldview, which demands ultra-low rates around 1%, down significantly from the present 4%.

Trump has argued that current rates keep mortgage costs prohibitively high for many Americans, hindering homeownership and imposing billions in unnecessary debt refinancing expenses. He frames this as a staggering missed opportunity on an otherwise “phenomenal” economy. Meanwhile, many economists agree that rates remain too high given signs of weakening labor markets and consumer health.

Thus, the Federal Reserve is widely perceived as “behind the curve” – a technical term meaning it is too slow to cut rates in response to evolving economic conditions.

Yet, Trump's insistence on forcing faster rate cuts risks pushing the Fed further behind this curve.

Imagine holding the reins of the world's most powerful central bank, responsible not only for the world's largest economy, but the fate of the global reserve currency, the USD. Now imagine the political pressure to cut rates quickly, against the fear of appearing politically compromised. This leaves policymakers damned if they act and damned if they don't.

So, unlike typical policymakers who adjust with measured calm in response to data, Powell and his colleagues now operate under intense political pressure and public scrutiny from the White House. They face a classic catch-22: face accusations of succumbing to political pressure in case of rapid rate cuts (even if they do so independently); wait too long and risk the potential deepening of an economic slowdown.

This dynamic could breed reflexive stubbornness. To avoid accusations of capitulating to political pressure, the Fed may instinctively lean towards caution – waiting longer and keeping rates elevated. However, this posture can exacerbate the problem: delayed rate cuts keep monetary policy out of sync with economic conditions, much like a patient who resists mild medication only to require drastic doses once a fever spikes.

The subsequent high doses of rate cuts could be interpreted by markets as a sign of panic, leading to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.

The catch-22 situation could also weigh on the U.S. dollar, a bullish development for dollar-denominated assets like gold and bitcoin.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, has dropped nearly 10% this year to 97.64. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has rallied by 24% to $115,600.

YZi Labs, the family office founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and Yi He, which was rebranded from Binance Labs, has expanded its position in Ethena Labs, the protocol behind USDe, which has become the third-largest U.S. dollar-denominated crypto asset with more than $13 billion in circulation.

The investment comes as Ethena enters a new stage of growth, which includes extending its footprint on BNB Chain. This includes rolling out products designed to bridge crypto and traditional finance, such as USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin in development, and Converge, an institutional settlement layer being built with Securitize and partners connected to BlackRock.

USDe, marketed as a ""synthetic dollar,"" uses bitcoin BTC, ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL (SOL)as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on exchanges to maintain a $1 peg. 

Launched less than two years ago, the synthetic dollar crossed the $10 billion supply milestone faster than any other dollar-pegged crypto asset.

“Since our investment team first met Guy [Young] in late 2023, Ethena has become the category definer for yield-bearing synthetic dollars,” said Dana Hou, investment partner at YZi Labs.

For users, the developments mean more options for holding and using digital dollars across centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. For institutions, products like Converge aim to create a familiar settlement layer for tokenized assets, potentially broadening adoption of on-chain financial infrastructure.

Stablecoin Adoption Set to Surge After GENIUS Act, Hit $4T in Cross-Border Volume: EY Survey

With increasing regulatory clarity, 54% of firms in the survey said they plan to adopt stablecoins within the next year.

Stablecoin adoption is gaining momentum among corporates and financial institutions driven by regulatory clarity and cost-savings in global money transfers, according to a survey by EY-Parthenon.

Conducted with 350 executives in June after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the survey found that 13% of firms already use stablecoins, mainly for cross-border payments. Among those who didn't use stablecoins, 54% expected to adopt them within the next six to 12 months.

Regulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act was widely viewed as a turning point. The legislation, which was signed into law in July, provided long-awaited rules for U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, including reserve requirements and issuer approval processes.

Executives said in the survey the law reduces uncertainty around liquidity, tax treatment and custodial services.

Cost savings are also a key driver for adoption, with 41% of current users reporting at least a 10% reduction in expenses from using stablecoins in international transactions.

Respondents also saw stablecoins as a long-term fixture in global finance. By 2030, they estimate stablecoins could facilitate between 5% and 10% of all cross-border payments, representing $2.1 trillion to $4.2 trillion in value.

Still, infrastructure hurdles remain. Only 8% of businesses accepted payments in stablecoins, and many firms planned to lean on banking and fintech partners for integration.

 Vitalik Buterin said low-risk DeFi protocols can bring in stable revenue for the network, like how Google Search does for Google, but while also ensuring Ethereum's core values remain intact. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said revenue from low-risk decentralized finance protocols could give the network economic stability — much like Google Search supports Google — while letting nonfinancial apps uphold Ethereum's cultural values.  

Low-risk DeFi could address “important tensions” in the Ethereum community over whether apps that bring in enough revenue to economically sustain the ecosystem align with the cultural and ethical values that brought people to Ethereum in the first place, Buterin said in a blog post on Saturday.

The former has been a combination of nonfungible tokens, memecoins, and speculative trading, while the nonfinancial and semifinancial apps that reflect Ethereum's cultural values have either struggled to gain widespread adoption or haven't generated enough fees, he said.

“This disjointness created a lot of dissonance in the community,” Buterin said, before making his case for low-risk DeFi being Ethereum's main fee generator. One example Buterin highlighted was deposit rates for stablecoin lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which hover around 5% for blue-chips like Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) and above 10% for higher risk stables.

Similarly, Buterin noted that Google does many “interesting and valuable things” — such as its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, its open-source AI Gemini models, and more — but the revenue they make from those products is a fraction compared to what it makes through search and advertisements. 

It comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. DeFi TVL tanked massively across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, and TVL figures have largely trailed the performance of top layer 1 tokens this bull market.

However, DeFi has picked up lately amid an increase in regulatory momentum, particularly the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is tipped to push DeFi adoption even further. A recent survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans are open to DeFi if stronger laws are put in place.

Ethereum has the potential to “do much better” than Google due to its decentralization. Unlike Google, Ethereum's decentralized structure better positions low-risk DeFi to align financial success with ethical outcomes, creating harmony between “doing well” and “being good.”

Buterin criticized Google's incentive model, noting that advertising revenue pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive-sum ethos.

While low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the US dollar — particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries — Buterin would like to see other innovations that provide economic support to Ethereum.

Buterin pitched the idea of building cryptoassets that track a basket of currencies and flatcoins that are based directly on consumer price indices.

 YZi Labs has invested further into Ethena to push USDe adoption across more chains and platforms, while also assisting with the development of a new stablecoin. 

Tech-focused venture capital firm YZi Labs has increased its stake in Ethena, the stablecoin issuer behind USDe, which will assist the digital dollar's adoption across decentralized and centralized platforms.

The investment will assist Ethena USDe's (USDe) expansion on BNB Chain while enabling Ethena to continue building its USDtb stablecoin and an institutional settlement layer, Converge, Changpeng Zhao's YZi Labs said in a statement on Friday.USDtb is backed by short-duration treasury assets, including BlackRock's BUIDL, while Converge is an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain focused on tokenizing real-world assets. 

The move supports YZi's mission to “support open, scalable digital dollar infrastructures that can serve as a backbone of efficiency and liquidity for the entire financial ecosystem.”

Ethena Labs CEO Guy Young added: “The holy grail of digital dollar distribution has always been embedding stable, yield-bearing assets directly into the core of the crypto economy. 

The stablecoin adoption comes as the US Treasury estimated in April that the $295 billion market would boom to $2 trillion by 2028. Momentum was boosted in July by US President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act, seen as one of the most comprehensive stablecoin laws to date.

YZi, formerly Binance Labs, first invested in Ethena through its Season 6 Incubation Program in February 2024, before USDe's public launch. USDe's synthetic dollar is backed mainly by cryptocurrencies and is stabilized through a delta-neutral hedging strategy that keeps its value pegged to $1.

USDe's expansion on BNB Chain will build on its April deployment with new money markets, protocol integrations, and ecosystem partnerships already underway, YZi said.

Since launching, USDe has soared to a $14 billion market cap — trailing only Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC) at $171.5 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Increased adoption of USDe could allow it to slice into USDT and USDC's dominance and broaden its use across the crypto ecosystem.

It comes as YZi — which manages $10 billion worth of assets spread across crypto, AI and healthcare — recently promoted Hyperliquid rival Aster — a new decentralized perpetuals exchange platform that is set to integrate USDe as part of its ecosystem.

Ethena has also won investment support from trillion-dollar asset management firms Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, while crypto VC firm DragonFly also backs the stablecoin issuer.

 Privacy experts warn EU's Chat Control law could break encryption, erode trust in digital platforms and push users toward decentralized Web3 solutions. 

As EU lawmakers near a decision on the “Chat Control” law, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms.

As European lawmakers near a decision on the controversial “Chat Control” legislation, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms.

At the center of the debate is the EU's proposed Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse, which would require platforms to scan private messages for illegal content before they are encrypted. Critics say this effectively creates a backdoor into encrypted systems, contradicting the EU's own commitments to privacy.

“Giving an inherently corruptible entity nearly unlimited visibility into the private lives of individuals is incompatible with an honest value statement of digital privacy,” Hans Rempel, co-founder and CEO of Diode, told Cointelegraph. He called the proposal a dangerous overreach.

Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, noted that the law appears “difficult to justify under the existing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union.” She pointed to Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantee the confidentiality of communications and protection of personal data. 

“Client-side scanning would enable the monitoring of content on user devices prior to transmission, including in cases where there is no indication of unlawful activity,” she explained.

Experts say the regulation sets a dangerous precedent from a legal and technological standpoint. “There are no guarantees,” Rempel added, when asked if the tools could be misused. “Over 10% of all data breaches occur in government systems,” he warned.

Fabrega raised concerns over the broader impact such surveillance would have on public trust. “Encryption is not only a technical feature, it is a promise to users that their private communications will remain confidential,” she said. 

The erosion of trust in traditional messaging platforms could prompt users to explore decentralized Web3 alternatives, platforms built to protect user data through encryption by design.

“Web3's privacy battle cry is ‘Not your keys, not your data,'” Rempel said. “This is true self-custody for data,” he added, noting that the end-user maintains sovereignty over their information from “cradle to grave.”

Fabrega echoed the sentiment, stating that “privacy-conscious users will increasingly explore decentralized Web3 alternatives” if Chat Control is passed. She warned that the shift could “fragment the European digital market” and weaken the EU's ability to shape international norms on privacy.

Germany, which holds the pivotal vote, has yet to take a final stance. While 15 EU countries currently support the proposal, they fall short of the 65% population threshold required for passage. If Germany votes in favor, the law will likely pass; if it abstains or opposes, the legislation is expected to fail.

“We believe it to be low,” Rempel said of the likelihood of passage. “But it won't be the last time that there is an attempt to subvert fundamental human rights in the name of safety.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reveal the everyday habits that may shield you from dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214459.htm","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 13:54:08 GMT","

An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer's disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging.

As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention.

In a commentary published in The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide.

""While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's disease have surged by more than 140%,"" said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. ""At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.""

Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline - potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present.

The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement - reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support.

These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits.

""The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes - previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer - also hold transformative potential for brain health,"" Hennekens said.

The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience.

""The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous,"" said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. ""Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline - tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs.""

On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%.

Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia - amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy.

""While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,"" said Hennekens. ""Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.""

Knee braces, water therapy and exercise are the most promising non-drug therapies for treating knee osteoarthritis, according to a new meta-analysis publishing June 18, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Yuan Luo of the First People's Hospital of Neijiang, China.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common and often debilitating condition that affects millions of older adults, causing pain and stiffening of the knee joint. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory drugs, which are linked to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events.

In the new study, researchers examined the current evidence on non-drug therapies for treating KOA. They looked at data from 139 clinical trials involving nearly 10,000 people to compare 12 different non-drug treatments. These included laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, kinesiology tape, water-based therapy, exercise, and ultrasound. By combining results from all these studies into a powerful network meta-analysis, the team could rank the therapies based on how well they worked.

Knee braces came out on top across most categories, including reducing pain, improving function, and relieving stiffness. Hydrotherapy -- exercises or treatments performed in warm water -- was particularly effective at easing pain and general exercise was also consistently effective, improving both pain and physical function. High-intensity laser therapy and shock wave therapy showed some benefits, while ultrasound consistently scored the lowest in effectiveness.

The authors caution that differences in study design, small sample sizes, and variability in treatment duration between the 139 included studies may limit the precision of the rankings. However, they conclude that physical therapy has promising effects on KOA, offering potential treatments without the risks of anti-inflammatory drugs. Future studies should examine the clinical efficacy of combined therapies, as well as their cost-effectiveness.

The authors add: ""Knee braces, hydrotherapy, and exercise are the most effective non-drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis. They reduce pain and improve mobility without the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks linked to common pain medications. Patients and clinicians should prioritize these evidence-based options.""

""Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions.""

Biologists at The University of Texas at Austin, who have reported discovering a bird that's the natural result of a green jay and a blue jay's mating, say it may be among the first examples of a hybrid animal that exists because of recent changing patterns in the climate. The two different parent species are separated by 7 million years of evolution, and their ranges didn't overlap as recently as a few decades ago.

""We think it's the first observed vertebrate that's hybridized as a result of two species both expanding their ranges due, at least in part, to climate change,"" said Brian Stokes, a graduate student in ecology, evolution and behavior at UT and first author of the study.

Stokes noted that past vertebrate hybrids have resulted from human activity, like the introduction of invasive species, or the recent expansion of one species' range into another's - think polar bears and grizzlies - but this case appears to have occurred when shifts in weather patterns spurred the expansion of both parent species.

In the 1950s, the ranges of green jays, a tropical bird found across Central America, extended just barely up from Mexico into south Texas and the range of blue jays, a temperate bird living all across the Eastern U.S., only extended about as far west as Houston. They almost never came into contact with each other. But since then, as green jays have pushed north and blue jays have pushed west, their ranges have converged around San Antonio.

As a Ph.D. candidate studying green jays in Texas, Stokes was in the habit of monitoring several social media sites where birders share photos of their sightings. It was one of several ways he located birds to trap, take blood samples for genetic analysis and release unharmed back to the wild. One day, he saw a grainy photo of an odd-looking blue bird with a black mask and white chest posted by a woman in a suburb northeast of San Antonio. It was vaguely like a blue jay, but clearly different. The backyard birder invited Stokes to her house to see it firsthand.

""The first day, we tried to catch it, but it was really uncooperative,"" Stokes said. ""But the second day, we got lucky.""

The bird got tangled in a mist net, basically a long rectangular mesh of black nylon threads stretched between two poles that is easy for a flying bird to overlook as it's soaring through the air, focused on some destination beyond. Stokes caught and released dozens of other birds, before his quarry finally blundered into his net on the second day.

Stokes took a quick blood sample of this strange bird, banded its leg to help relocate it in the future, and then let it go. Interestingly, the bird disappeared for a few years and then returned to the woman's yard in June 2025. It's not clear what was so special about her yard.

""I don't know what it was, but it was kind of like random happenstance,"" he said. ""If it had gone two houses down, probably it would have never been reported anywhere.""

According to an analysis by Stokes and his faculty advisor, integrative biology professor Tim Keitt, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution, the bird is a male hybrid offspring of a green jay mother and a blue jay father. That makes it like another hybrid that researchers in the 1970s brought into being by crossing a green jay and a blue jay in captivity. That taxidermically preserved bird looks much like the one Stokes and Keitt describe and is in the collections of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History.

""Hybridization is probably way more common in the natural world than researchers know about because there's just so much inability to report these things happening,"" Stokes said. ""And it's probably possible in a lot of species that we just don't see because they're physically separated from one another and so they don't get the chance to try to mate.""

The scientists' work was supported by a ConTex Collaborative Research Grant through UT System, the Texas EcoLab Program and Planet Texas 2050, a University of Texas at Austin grand challenge initiative.

The researchers did not opt to name the hybrid bird, but other naturally occurring hybrids have received nicknames like ""grolar bear"" for the polar bear-grizzly hybrid, ""coywolf"" for a creature that's part coyote and part wolf and ""narluga"" for an animal with both narwhal and beluga whale parents.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA just confirmed its 6,000th alien world. Some are truly bizarre","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214427.htm","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 06:21:51 GMT","

The official number of exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- tracked by NASA has reached 6,000. Confirmed planets are added to the count on a rolling basis by scientists from around the world, so no single planet is considered the 6,000th entry. The number is monitored by NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), based at Caltech's IPAC in Pasadena, California. There are more than 8,000 additional candidate planets awaiting confirmation, with NASA leading the world in searching for life in the universe.

""This milestone represents decades of cosmic exploration driven by NASA space telescopes -- exploration that has completely changed the way humanity views the night sky,"" said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director, Astrophysics Division, NASA Headquarters in Washington. ""Step by step, from discovery to characterization, NASA missions have built the foundation to answering a fundamental question: Are we alone? Now, with our upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory, America will lead the next giant leap -- studying worlds like our own around stars like our Sun. This is American ingenuity, and a promise of discovery that unites us all.""

The milestone comes 30 years after the first exoplanet was discovered around a star similar to our Sun, in 1995. (Prior to that, a few planets had been identified around stars that had burned all their fuel and collapsed.) Although researchers think there are billions of planets in the Milky Way galaxy, finding them remains a challenge. In addition to discovering many individual planets with fascinating characteristics as the total number of known exoplanets climbs, scientists are able to see how the general planet population compares to the planets of our own solar system.

For example, while our solar system hosts an equal number of rocky and giant planets, rocky planets appear to be more common in the universe. Researchers have also found a range of planets entirely different from those in our solar system. There are Jupiter-size planets that orbit closer to their parent star than Mercury orbits the Sun; planets that orbit two stars, no stars, and dead stars; planets covered in lava; some with the density of Styrofoam; and others with clouds made of gemstones.

""Each of the different types of planets we discover gives us information about the conditions under which planets can form and, ultimately, how common planets like Earth might be, and where we should be looking for them,"" said Dawn Gelino, head of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), located at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. ""If we want to find out if we're alone in the universe, all of this knowledge is essential.""

Searching for other worlds

Fewer than 100 exoplanets have been directly imaged, because most planets are so faint they get lost in the light from their parent star. The other four methods of planet detection are indirect. With the transit method, for instance, astronomers look for a star to dim for a short period as an orbiting planet passes in front of it.

To account for the possibility that something other than an exoplanet is responsible for a particular signal, most exoplanet candidates must be confirmed by follow-up observations, often using an additional telescope, and that takes time. That's why there is a long list of candidates in the NASA Exoplanet Archive (hosted by NExScI) waiting to be confirmed.

""We really need the whole community working together if we want to maximize our investments in these missions that are churning out exoplanets candidates,"" said Aurora Kesseli, the deputy science lead for the NASA Exoplanet Archive at IPAC. ""A big part of what we do at NExScI is build tools that help the community go out and turn candidate planets into confirmed planets.""

The rate of exoplanet discoveries has accelerated in recent years (the database reached 5,000 confirmed exoplanets just three years ago), and this trend seems likely to continue. Kesseli and her colleagues anticipate receiving thousands of additional exoplanet candidates from the ESA (European Space Agency) Gaia mission, which finds planets through a technique called astrometry, and NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will discover thousands of new exoplanets primarily through a technique called gravitational microlensing.

Future exoplanets

At NASA, the future of exoplanet science will emphasize finding rocky planets similar to Earth and studying their atmospheres for biosignatures -- any characteristic, element, molecule, substance, or feature that can be used as evidence of past or present life. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has already analyzed the chemistry of over 100 exoplanet atmospheres.

But studying the atmospheres of planets the size and temperature of Earth will require new technology. Specifically, scientists need better tools to block the glare of the star a planet orbits. And in the case of an Earth-like planet, the glare would be significant: The Sun is about 10 billion times brighter than Earth -- which would be more than enough to drown out our home planet's light if viewed by a distant observer.

NASA has two main initiatives to try overcoming this hurdle. The Roman telescope will carry a technology demonstration instrument called the Roman Coronagraph that will test new technologies for blocking starlight and making faint planets visible. At its peak performance, the coronagraph should be able to directly image a planet the size and temperature of Jupiter orbiting a star like our Sun, and at a similar distance from that star. With its microlensing survey and coronagraphic observations, Roman will reveal new details about the diversity of planetary systems, showing how common solar systems like our own may be across the galaxy.

Additional advances in coronagraph technology will be needed to build a coronagraph that can detect a planet like Earth. NASA is working on a concept for such a mission, currently named the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

More about ExEP, NExScI

NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program is responsible for implementing the agency's plans for the discovery and understanding of planetary systems around nearby stars.

A ""teenaged"" pachycephalosaur from Mongolia's Gobi Desert may provide answers to lingering questions around the dinosaur group, according to new research published on September 17 in the journal Nature. The fossil represents a new species of pachycephalosaur and is both the oldest and most complete skeleton of this dinosaur group found to date.

""Pachycephalosaurs are iconic dinosaurs, but they're also rare and mysterious,"" says Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and corresponding author of the work.

The specimen was discovered in the Khuren Dukh locality of the Eastern Gobi Basin by Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, who is the lead author of the paper and currently a research assistant at NC State.

The new species is called Zavacephale rinpoche, which is the combination of zava, meaning ""root"" or ""origin"" in Tibetan, and cephal, meaning ""head"" in Latin. The specific name, ""rinpoche,"" or ""precious one"" in Tibetan, refers to the domed skull discovered exposed on a cliff like a cabochon jewel.

Z. rinpoche lived around 108 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period in what is now Mongolia's Gobi Desert. At the time, the area was a valley dotted with lakes and surrounded by cliffs or escarpments. Pachycephalosaurs were plant eaters, and adults could grow to around 14 feet long (4.3 meters) and seven feet tall (2.1 meters), weighing 800 -- 900 pounds (363 - 410 kilograms).

""Z. rinpoche predates all known pachycephalosaur fossils to date by about 15 million years,"" Chinzorig says. ""It was a small animal - about three feet or less than one meter long - and the most skeletally complete specimen yet found.""

The Z. rinpoche specimen the team discovered was not fully grown when it died. However, it already sported a fully formed dome, though without much of the additional ornamentation found on other pachycephalosaur fossils.

""Z. rinpoche is an important specimen for understanding the cranial dome development of pachycephalosaurs, which has been debated for a long time due to the absence of early diverging or pre-Late Cretaceous species and the fragmentary nature of nearly all pachycephalosaurian fossils,"" Chinzorig says.

How to tell whether two skulls that look different belong to two distinct species or just different growth stages of the same species is a long-standing debate for paleontologists who study this group, and that's where Z. rinpoche comes in.

""Pachycephalosaurs are all about the bling, but we can't use flashy signaling structures alone to figure out what species they belong to or what growth stage they're in because some cranial ornamentation changes as animals mature,"" Zanno says.

""We age dinosaurs by looking at growth rings in bones, but most pachycephalosaur skeletons are just isolated, fragmentary skulls,"" Zanno adds. ""Z. rinpoche is a spectacular find because it has limbs and a complete skull, allowing us to couple growth stage and dome development for the first time.""

By examining a thin slice of the specimen's lower leg bone, the researchers determined that, despite sporting a fully formed dome, this Z. rinpoche was still a juvenile when it died.

Pachycephalosaurs are famous for their large domed skulls and are often depicted using those domes to duel in epic headbutting contests. ""The consensus is that these dinosaurs used the dome for socio-sexual behaviors,"" Zanno says. ""The domes wouldn't have helped against predators or for temperature regulation, so they were most likely for showing off and competing for mates.

""If you need to headbutt yourself into a relationship, it's a good idea to start rehearsing early,"" she says.

Z. rinpoche fills in huge gaps in the pachycephalosaur timeline - both in terms of when they lived and how they grew, the researchers say.

""This specimen is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. It is remarkable for being the oldest definitive pachycephalosaur, pushing back the fossil record of this group by at least 15 million years, but also because of how complete and well-preserved it is,"" Zanno says. ""Z. rinpoche gives us an unprecedented glimpse into the anatomy and biology of pachycephalosaurs, including what their hands looked like and that they used stomach stones to grind food.""

""The newly recovered materials of Z. rinpoche, such as the hand elements, the stomach stones (gastroliths), and an articulated tail with covered tendons, reshape our understanding of the paleobiology, locomotion, and body plan of these 'mysterious' dinosaurs,"" Chinzorig says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The NFL Goes MrBeast Mode","https://www.wired.com/story/the-nfl-goes-mrbeast-mode/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The first international game of the National Football League season, a Friday-night tilt between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo, is celebrated on the ground by the usual pomp and circumstance.

There are photo booths and merch tents catering to local fans, samba dancers in feathered head-pieces entertaining American die-hards traveling across the equator, and a press conference where Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has to backtrack after calling association football (that is, the kind that is still most popular in Brazil, and the rest of the word) “soccer.” But fans tuning in at home are greeted by a different, somewhat more disturbing spectacle: news that YouTuber, prolific content creator, and protein-infused milk impresario Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson has purchased the NFL.

In a pregame preview airing on YouTube–which, for the first time ever, is broadcasting a regular-season NFL game globally, and for free–the platform's most valuable creator appears opposite league commissioner Roger Goodell, in a purportedly comical “sketch” about MrBeast's takeover of the league, which sees him assigning popular content creators to team rosters. A postgame stunt sees Donaldson awarding one hardcore fan a ticket to Super Bowl LX, and firing another out of a human cannon. Not everyone welcomes the NFL's new zillennial overlord. “MrBeast on my television invading my beautiful sport,” one fan posts on X. A friend (a lifelong football fan in his mid-40s) who texts me during the game says the whole production, “Looks insanely gen z.”

Influencers haleyybaylee and Deestroying at YouTube's first live NFL broadcast.

Which is of course the point. The September 5 YouTube-exclusive São Paulo game (the platform covered my travel expenses to attend), dovetails two of the NFL's key priorities, spreading football both internationally and intergenerationally. “I completely understand that not all fans and audiences are going to welcome change,” Donaldson writes in a statement to WIRED. “Our hope is that over time they'll recognize we are approaching everything we do with admiration and respect and want to be able to share something that's as unique and special as the NFL with our fans.”

If the NFL fails to establish American football abroad, both with Gen Z—whose sports fandom, studies have shown, ranks the lowest among generational cohorts—and with international audiences unaccustomed to the distinctly American pastime, it won't be for lack of trying. Since 2005, the league has been hosting regular-season games abroad. First was Mexico. Then London. Then Germany. Then Brazil. This season will see additional international games in Berlin, Madrid, and Dublin. The penetration into the South American market seems at once incredibly bold and completely sensible. Sensible, because players and fans alike don't have to struggle against the pesky realities of time zones. And bold because, perhaps even more so than the UK or continental Europe, South America has its own distinct, passionate football culture that has nothing to do with its brawnier North American cousin.

“The world has changed and you've got to be part of it.”

The NFL's 2025 Brazilian operation offers a good matchup for further testing the viability of the South American market. Due to their long, somewhat challenging, history in Southern California, the Chargers boast a substantial Latino fan base, who call them Los Bolts. And the Chiefs (despite being dismantled humiliatingly in last season's Super Bowl) remain a global brand. The Chiefs have also benefited from the A-list celebrity of some of their players, specifically Mahomes, and tight end Travis Kelce, whose recent engagement to pop star Taylor Swift makes him de facto one of the most famous human beings on the planet. As James Brighton, a Chargers fan and California native who traveled to Brazil for the matchup, grumbles to me before the game, “Mahomes is easily marketable … Kelce and Taylor Swift is the romance the world wants to see, I guess. They're the face of the NFL right now.” The league is counting on it. But for the NFL's second Brazil game, they aren't taking any chances.

“There is no better platform than YouTube,” says veteran broadcaster Rich Eisen, his head literally framed by a YouTube logo as he lounges in the YouTube-branded green room deep in the concrete bowels of São Paulo's Neo Química Arena in the idle hours before he ascends to the broadcast booth to provide play-by-play commentary. “There is no more powerful distributor to reach people of all ages, and to feed an insatiable desire of people to take in content.”

Eisen speaks from experience. At 56, he may be a generation or three removed from the Gen Z–dominated domain of professional content creation. Nevertheless, he has been able to parlay his success as a journalist and longtime Sportscenter and NFL Network anchor into an arguably ever larger audience, streaming his Emmy-nominated, three-hour daily sports-talk program The Rich Eisen Show on YouTube, among other platforms. “The world has changed and you've got to be part of it,” he tells WIRED. “I mean, the commissioner of the NFL didn't do a video about the Brazil game with me. And I've been his employee for 23 years! He did it with MrBeast.”

Former Carolina Panthers quarterback turned commentator Cam Newton at YouTube's first live NFL broadcast.

In an evolution of a partnership between the league and YouTube, the NFL has leveraged the video-sharing platform to package game highlights, clips, and weekly game previews.

To broadcast the game live from Brazil, YouTube ordered 100,000 pounds of production equipment, flown in on 11 cargo planes. “This is a Super Bowl–caliber production,” brags Adam Masterson, YouTube's lead engineer overseeing the broadcast.

There's no such thing as a “free” NFL game, of course. And YouTube's brass are open about the experiment serving as a kind of “loss leader” (in retail terms) meant to drive interested viewers to the YouTube TV platform and the Sunday Ticket football package (which runs returning users $480 per season). “It's an opportunity to really light up the platform, and our creators,” says Angela Courtin, YouTube's vice president of brand marketing.

Those creators—several of whom have been flown in to participate in the broadcast and host streams before and during the game, along with local influencers—are essential to the YouTube-iness of the production.

“This isn't a men's sport. This is an everybody sport.”

Model and influencer haleyybaylee (aka Haley Kalil), who has 8 million YouTube subscribers, brings along her audience of “primarily young women.” She's a Minnesota Vikings fan who used to watch games with her super-fan father, and her ex-husband, offensive tackle Matt Kalil, used to play for the team. Kalil cut her teeth producing what is sometimes (a little dismissively) called “WAG content,” representing the perspective of players' “wives and girlfriends.” It's a common pathway for fledgling female viewers wading into the sometimes intimidating pool of NFL fandom. “I got to learn football not only from my dad's point-of-view, cursing at the screen, but also from a player's point-of-view,” Kalil tells WIRED. “This isn't a men's sport. This is an everybody sport.”

Former college football player turned content creator Deestroying (real name Donald De La Haye), who has 6.3 million YouTube subscribers, joins YouTube's production team—including seasoned broadcasters Eisen and Kay Adams, alongside former NFL quarterbacks turned commentators Kurt Warner and Cam Netwon—as the official “sideline creator.” Before kickoff, De La Haye says athletes have asked him for advice on making inroads in the streaming world. “More athletes are realizing they're in control of the narrative,” he says. “They can make content. They could be more than just a football player.”

Deestroying at YouTube's first live NFL broadcast.

Enough current and former pros, including the Kelce brothers, have found second careers in podcasting, streaming, and content creation. And the NFL has long had its own presence on the platform, collecting highlights, analysis, and weekly game previews. For YouTube's brass, making the move from aggregating NFL and NFL-related content to broadcasting an actual game felt like a natural, if ambitious, next step.

Christian Oestlien, who spearheads YouTubeTV's expansion, cites an interesting stat. “Half of Gen Z has reported that they'd rather hear about a live event from their favourite creator than actually watch the event,” he says. “I interpret that as, ‘If I could watch a live event with my favorite creator, that would be the ideal.”

Broadcasters have already experimented with this format. Since 2021, ESPN has offered viewers the Manningcast: a feed that sees the famous sports brothers Eli and Peyton Manning reacting to games in real time. But it always seemed a little superfluous. It stands to reason that anyone who would tune in to watch the Mannings yammer over a game is already invested in the game in the first place. YouTube's “Watch With” feeds cast the net a bit wider, luring in viewers who are fans of the creators first.

Of course, the league's embrace of the creator class—its broader YouTube-ification—may reveal a deeper agenda, beyond juicing fandom among younger viewers. In August, the NFL announced that it was assuming a 10 percent equity stake in ESPN, the Disney-owned sports media network. The deal has already drawn criticism for its potential impact on journalists' abilities to cover more critical stories, from colluding owners to concerns around players' safety, sundry scandals, and off-field conduct. Streamers, TikTokkers, and YouTubers provide a form of journalism-adjacent “content” that seems more amenable to the league's desire to protect, and even soften, its image.

By the end of the game—which sees the Chargers upset the Chiefs 27-21—YouTube's first broadcast draws in some 17.3 million viewers, 1.1 million of whom were outside the United States. These are respectable numbers for the fledgling live sports broadcaster, putting the game about on par with the average viewership numbers of last season's games—and drawing in a few million more viewers than last season's Peacock-exclusive Friday night Brazil game. (The largest impediment to growing this number is likely not the platform, the match-up, or the location, but getting people habituated to stay in on Friday night and watch NFL football in prime time.) But in a way, the more compelling viewing narrative is unfolding away from second screens and Watch With streams, inside the Corinthians stadium itself.

Kay Adams, Keenan Allen, Derwin James Jr, and Cam Newton at YouTube's first live NFL broadcast.

Numbers provided by the NFL confirm that approximately 98 percent of tickets purchased for the Chiefs-Chargers title were purchased in Brazil. But American football still remains less popular there than professional basketball, volleyball, automobile racing, swimming, surfing, and capoeira—an Afro-Brazilian hybrid of marital artistry, dancing, and spiritual worship. And for all the talk of Brazilian fans' passion and volume—hyped up by Chiefs players and head coach Andy Reid during the team's press scrums—the actual crowd of 47,627 who roll out to the game at Neo Química Arena seems strangely muted. At least by the standards of frothing, howling, face-painted, beer-soaked, quasi-deranged football fandom that is the standard back in the US. Is it loud? Sure. But it's not Lambeau Field or Arrowhead Stadium loud. Indeed, the unfurling of an enormous Brazilian flag during the national anthem, and the cameras spotting national soccer hero Neymar on the sidelines during the half-time show, merit the loudest, most unanimous roars.

Some moments seem a little lost-in-translation. Before the game, the enormous screens in the end zones project the rules of American football, outlining the diverse position groups and their respective skills. When he scores a 37-yard touchdown, Kelce celebrates by pretending to be a charging bull—oblivious, it would seem, to bullfighting being a Spanish and not Brazilian tradition.

And for all the talk of the NFL's International Series doubling as a form of what the Washington Post editorial board recently termed American “soft power,” there is some friction there too. Audible boos ring out during the “Star Spangled Banner.” “They're there in the first place,” the NFL's Schroeder rationalizes, when asked about the crowd's reaction. “So they're clearly interested fans and excited to be a part of it all.”

Otherwise, fans don (mostly Chiefs) jerseys, cheer, and revel in the spectacle. But for the most part, fans approach the game like something of a novelty, greeted with a mix of enthusiasm, curiosity, and slight bafflement. A local I speak to before the game mentioned that in Brazil, American football is seen as a mainly middle- and upper-class preoccupation. Unlike soccer—the global popularity of which is at least partially attributable to it requiring little more than a ball—gridiron football demands specialized equipment, fields, and (most importantly) a working familiarity with its fairly byzantine rulebook. (There is only one Brazilian-born player currently rostered in the NFL: Chicago Bears kicker Cairo Santos.) The NFL and its partners are working devotedly to alleviate the familiarity hurdle, building out a broadcast landscape to juice the appeal of a sport that is thrillingly intense, endlessly deep, and quintessentially American. Lowering the barriers to entry to make the game not just watchable, but actually accessible, will be the next big leap in the NFL's ongoing mission to globalize the league, and redefine how the world thinks of the word “football.”

Racked in one of the many enormous merch kiosks on-site is a commemorative T-shirt depicting a young Brazilian boy standing in a run-down favela, gripping an oblong football, and donning a helmet emblazoned with a Chiefs arrowhead on one side and the arcing Chargers bolt on the other. I almost consider buying it as a souvenir, if only because its impressionistic image seemed so completely absurd—and so obviously aspirational, albeit not in the way that's likely intended. It's not about the fantasies of some hypothetical little kid of some new generation, nurturing his gridiron dreams in a land far away from the fatherland of Cowboys and Chiefs and Eagles and Niners. It's about the NFL's dream, and dogged determination, to create him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Ransomware Wave Hits SMBs and Cities","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/ransomware-wave-hits-smbs-and-cities-179920.html","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 17:34:17 GMT","

Businesses and even governmental organizations once thought they were too small to target. Now they face relentless attempts from increasingly sophisticated criminal groups.

The number of weekly cyberattacks on small businesses nearly doubled in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Over 80% of attacks targeted credentials, according to a new report from cybersecurity firm Guardz. The rate of these attacks against SMBs is accelerating at an unprecedented pace.

Do not rule out being victimized by the growing cyber menace of ransomware. Easily accessible attack-as-a-service offerings on the dark web have lowered the barrier to entry, enabling even inexperienced threat actors to launch highly effective campaigns, Guardz noted.

The first half of 2025 has been a stark reminder of just how quickly the cyberthreat landscape is evolving. The message is clear, warned Dor Eisner, CEO and co-founder of Guardz. No business is too small to be a target.

“Hackers are going after SMBs with the same force as large enterprises, but these businesses often lack enterprise-level defenses. That's why it's so important for SMBs to adopt solutions that make it simple to manage, detect, and respond to threats, with MSPs providing the expertise and proactive support necessary to stay secure and resilient,” he urged.

Municipal officials and operators of regional facilities face similar risks. Consider a recent cyberattack on the City of St. Paul, Minn., and the nearby Aspen Policy Academy's efforts to pick up the pieces after such an attack. Officials there described the attack as a “deliberate, coordinated, digital attack” that severely disrupted public services, resulting in the complete shutdown of municipal information systems.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the National Guard, including its cyber protection component, to support the city's response, as the attack “exceeded the city's response capacity.” Mayor Melvin Carter reported that officials detected suspicious activity on July 25 and contacted two national firms to assist with recovery, along with the FBI.

While officials have not disclosed the precise nature of the attack, it bears similarities to ransomware operations. Although Eisner's comments were not in response to the St. Paul and Policy Academy incidents, they reflect the growing concern about shoring up cyber defenses, as bad actors can easily target any organization.

Ransomware hack and leak numbers were at an all-time high in Q1 this year, increasing by 28% over the previous quarter, according to cybersecurity firm NCC Group. Its report was released this spring.

Published news accounts cited the recently formed ransomware group Interlock as the threat actor claiming credit for the attack, which leaked 43 gigabytes of stolen data from multiple files and folders.

To contain the attack, the city shut down its information systems. Disruptions included Wi-Fi outages in public buildings, interruptions in library services, and the shutdown of many internal networks. However, emergency services such as 911 remained operational. About 3,500 city employees had to reset their credentials in person at a central location.

As of late August, repair crews were slowly restoring city services in prioritized order. Restoration prioritized public safety first, followed by financial stability, then daily operations.

According to reports, the city refused to pay the ransom, opting instead to restore data from backups made on July 25 that were not compromised. The restoration process only brought back systems after testing and validation.

More than 90% of the city's systems had advanced security tools installed following the incident.

Betsy Cooper, founding director of the Aspen Policy Academy, told TechNewsWorld that the investigation there is still ongoing.

The Aspen Policy Academy is an initiative of the Washington, D.C.-based Aspen Institute and provides leadership development programs within its Workforce Leadership Academies.

The cyberattack appears to be related to a phishing scam targeting a business account. As far as the city knows, only one account was affected, according to Cooper.

She identifies some of the factors that make municipal governments more vulnerable to attack, including limited resources for IT and cybersecurity infrastructure compared to more sophisticated governments or private sector actors. Another factor is the large repositories of sensitive data on citizens.

“In many cases, a lack of longstanding investment in cybersecurity infrastructure, including limited funds and insufficient staffing, [creates] an attractive attack vector, she added.

Local government agencies and SMBs have few options for defending outdated legacy systems and insufficient IT resources, especially when facing budget constraints and difficulties in attracting top cybersecurity talent. But some opportunities for improvement exist.

“There is no panacea to help municipalities upgrade their cybersecurity infrastructure,” Cooper said.

Four recommended options:

Cooper also suggested that cities' immediate steps include raising awareness of potential attack points.

Begin by auditing the existing infrastructure to help the municipality identify its weaknesses and determine where to prioritize options. Ensure all systems are patched and updated. Then, compartmentalize where possible so incidents cannot spread between systems.

As a recovery layer, have a clear incident response plan in place, including when to involve legal counsel and specific steps to contain the issue, such as shutting down IT systems if necessary.

Large tech companies have responded to President Donald Trump's dramatic changes to H-1B visa applications by telling employees with those visas to remain in the United States, according to multiple media reports.

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they're already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.

Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.

According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.

Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday's proclamation.”

This post has been updated with a quote from Karoline Leavitt.

Travelers at major European airports including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin faced significant delays this weekend following what Collins Aerospace described as a “cyber-related incident.”

Collins Aerospace makes technology for airline check-in desks, so after the apparent cyberattack, airlines were forced to revert to manual check-ins, according to the Guardian. According to data from Flightradar24, more than 130 Heathrow flights had been delayed by 20 minutes or more as of 11am on Sunday morning, with 13 flights canceled on Saturday.

A post on the Heathrow social media account said, “Work continues to resolve and recover from Friday's outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in. We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.”

Heathrow, like other affected airports, has recommended that travelers arrive at least three hours before departure for long-haul flights, and at least two hours beforehand for short-haul flights.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","We Need to Talk About Smart Glasses","https://gizmodo.com/we-need-to-talk-about-smart-glasses-2000661487","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 16:00:01 GMT","

With any new device category comes a whole host of novel and sometimes exhaustingly complex questions. Smartphones, for example, no matter how mundane they seem right now, are still nagging us with existential quandaries. When should we use them? How should we use them? What in God's name happens to us when we use them, which, last I checked, is literally all the time?

These are important questions, and most of us, even if we're not spending all day ruminating on them, tackle the complexity in our own way, setting (or resetting) social norms for ourselves and other people as we trudge along. The only thing is, in my experience, we tend to ask these questions mostly in retrospect, which is to say after the cat (or phone, or smartwatch, or earth-shattering portal into the online world) is out of the proverbial bag. It's easy to look back and say, “That was the time we should have thought about this,” and when I put Meta's new smart glasses with a screen on, I knew that the time, for smart glasses in particular, was now—like, right f**king now.

In case you missed it, Meta finally unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are its first smart glasses with an in-lens display. I flew out to Meta headquarters for its annual Connect conference to try them, and the second I put them on, it was clear: these are going to be big. It probably seems silly from the outside to make a declaration like that. We have screens everywhere all the time—in our hands, on our wrists, and sometimes, regrettably, in our toasters. Why would smart glasses be any different? On one hand, I get that skepticism, but sometimes function isn't the issue; it's form. And when it comes to smart glasses, there is no other form like it.

Meta's Ray-Ban Display aren't just another wearable. The screen inside them opens up an entirely new universe of capabilities. With these smart glasses and Meta's wild new “Neural Band,” a wristband that reads the electrical signals in your arm and translates them to inputs, you're able to do a lot of the stuff you normally do on your phone. You can receive and write messages, watch Reels on Instagram, take voice calls and video calls, record video and take pictures, and get turn-by-turn navigation. You can even transcribe conversations that are happening in real time. You're doing this on your face in a way that you've never done it before—discreetly and, from my experience, fairly fluidly.

If there were any boundaries between you and a device, Meta's Ray-Ban Display are closing them to a gap that only an iPhone Air could slide through. It's incredibly exciting in one way, because I can see Meta's smart glasses being both useful and fun. The ability to swipe through a UI in front of my face by sliding my thumb around like some kind of computer cursor made of meat is wild and, at times, actually thrilling. While not everything works seamlessly yet, the door to smart glasses supremacy feels like it's been swung wide open. You are going to want a pair of these smart glasses whether you know it or not. These are going to be popular, and as a result, potentially problematic.

We may have a solid grasp on where and when we're supposed to use phones, but what happens when that “phone” in question becomes perfectly discreet, and the ability to use it becomes almost unnoticeable to those around us? When I use a smartphone, you can see me pick it up—you know there's a device in my hand. When I use Meta's Ray-Ban Display, however, there's almost no indication. Yes, there's a privacy light that tells outside people that a picture or video is being taken, but there's also less than 2% light leakage through the lens, meaning you can't tell when the screen inside the glasses is on. I certainly couldn't tell when I watched others use them. It's as ambient as any ambient computing I've witnessed so far.

I talked to Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy who covers the wearable market, and he says the privacy framework around technology like this is still in flux.

“We are still very much in the infancy of the smart glasses, AI wearable, and AR privacy and etiquette era,” he said. “I think that the reality is that having a wearable with a camera on your face is going to change things, and there are going to be places where these things are banned explicitly.”

Some of those environments, Sag said, are private areas like bathrooms or locker rooms, but it could extend beyond just places where you might catch a glimpse of someone naked. Driving, for example, is a major question. Meta's Ray-Ban Display have navigation built in, and while the company tells me that the feature is designed for walking right now, it's not actually preventing anyone from using its smart glasses in the car. Instead, it will provide a warning before you do so by detecting what speed you're moving at. Other companies like Amazon seem not to have even thought that navigating on smart glasses while driving could be a safety hazard at all. Early reports indicate that Amazon is plowing forward, making smart glasses that are specifically designed for its delivery drivers to use in a car.

While regulators like the NHTSA have issued warnings about people using VR headsets while driving (yes, people were actually doing that), it hasn't, according to my research or knowledge, addressed the impact of smart glasses, which are much more likely—especially if they become widespread—to enter the equation while driving. I reached out to the NHTSA for comment, but have not yet received a response.

Privacy concerns shouldn't just stem from the form factor, either. You also have to think about the company that's making the thing you're wearing on your face all the time and whether it has shown to be a good steward of your data and privacy. In Meta's case? Well, without going into an entirely separate diatribe, I think it could do a lot better. And other companies that are also in hot pursuit of screen-clad glasses, like Google? Well, they haven't been much better.

And makers of smart glasses shouldn't be surprised if, when these things wind up on people's faces, they get some shit for it. Google Glass, which came out in 2013, may seem like a different age, and in a lot of ways it is (people's expectations for privacy are almost nonexistent now), but we also haven't had to confront the idea of pervasive camera-clad wearables in a long time, so who's to say things have really changed? Sag says, while he expects some backlash, it may not be like the Glasshole days of yore.

“I think there will be some backlash, but I don't think it's gonna be as bad as Google Glass,” he says. “Google Glass had such an invasive appearance. You know, it didn't really look normal, so it really caught people's attention more. And I think that's really what has made these classes more successful, is that they're just inherently less intrusive in terms of appearance.”

I may not be an industry analyst, but I agree with Sag. I'm not sure there really will be a category-ending backlash like we saw back in the Google days, and a part of me doesn't want there to be. As I mentioned, I got a chance to use Meta's Ray-Ban Displays, and the idea all but knocked my socks off. These are the smart glasses that anyone interested in the form factor has been waiting for. What I really want is to be able to live in a world where we can all use them respectfully and responsibly, and one where the companies that are making them give us the same responsibility and respect back. But in my experience, the only way to get toward a more respectful, harmonious world is to try everything else first, and in this case, the first step might be your next pair of Ray-Bans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","‘Mad Max' May Get One Last Ride As a TV Show","https://gizmodo.com/mad-max-may-get-one-last-ride-as-a-tv-show-2000661865","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 14:00:01 GMT","

After five movies, the Mad Max franchise may take a trip to the glorious land of television.

A new video from Mad Max Bible alleges an HBO Max show will be the final franchise project for creator George Miller, and may in fact be the long-awaited third of his desired trilogy: The Wasteland, set a year before 2015's Fury Road. Miller has been open about wanting to tell Max and Furiosa's stories across three films, with the final one once again putting Tom Hardy in the role as brooding post-apocalyptic hero. Things seemed to hinge on the success of Furiosa back in 2024, and once it turned out a box-office disappointment, it seemed like it wouldn't happen.

But according to this Bible episode, this supposed episodic series will have Nitram writer Shaun Grant wrap up the story Miller intended to tell. Bible further noted Miller's attempted to bring The Wasteland to life multiple times since '80s, first a show, then as a video game. Miller first mentioned the game in 2008, and it was to be a collaboration between him and God of War director Cory Barlog, who'd left Sony Santa Monica at that time. That game fell apart, and Barlog became a consultant for what would eventually become the Max game developed by Avalanche Software that released in 2015, and which Miller isn't too fond of.

That Mad Max could go to TV isn't too surprising to hear: Warner Bros. already has shows for Dune and It, and one for The Conjuring in the works. The post-apocalypse is one sci-fi genre it doesn't have a show for, and a decent-sized name like Max's would draw in some viewers. If it's actually happening, we'll likely learn more about it in the months (or years) to come.

KPop Demon Hunters has dominated streaming and the box office this summer, but KPop Defamation Hunters landed a win in a different venue: the South Korean courts. The South Korean virtual boy band Plave, which is made up of five members who only ever appear as animations, successfully sued a person who made derogatory comments about the group online.

According to the BBC, the unidentified social media user made a series of insulting posts about the band in July 2024. Among the attacks: he suggested the people behind the virtual band members “could be ugly in real life” and said they gave off a “typical Korean man vibe.” Some of the posts also included profanity, which doesn't seem that offensive, but neither do the posts, so it's probably worth mentioning.

The person who made the posts attempted to argue that the comments were directed at the avatars that front the group and not the real people lending their voices to the virtual band members. The court didn't buy it and declared that the avatars represent someone real, so the attacks extend beyond the virtual fronts to the people behind them.

The victory landed Plave 500,000 South Korean won in total, 100,000 per band member, which works out to just over $70 a pop. Not exactly a fortune for a group that already has more than one million subscribers on YouTube, sold more than 500,000 units of their most recent album in the first week, and performs concerts that attract tens of thousands of fans. It's also much less than the band asked for. They were seeking 6.5 million won for each performer, which would have worked out to about $4,650 per member and $23,250 total. The band claimed that the comments caused emotional stress for the group.

Vlast, the band's label, intends to appeal the damages granted by the court, according to the BBC, arguing that it is too low for a case that sets a precedent for defamation against virtual avatars. While it does seem like the ruling is the first instance of defamation against virtual pop stars, it's not uncommon for Korean music labels to pursue charges against internet trolls. Several labels in the country have made a concerted effort to go after people who badmouth acts online. The virtual band trend, to some extent, is considered a response to the type of attention and pressure that pop stars receive in Korea.

Sometimes the smartest way to protect your memories is to keep them off the cloud. Photos, videos, work projects, and all the little files that mark everyday life deserve safe storage without worrying about hacks, lost passwords or online outages. That's where a massive external hard drive comes in handy.

Right now, the Seagate 22TB external hard drive has dropped to just $249 on Amazon, its lowest price ever. That's about $0.01 per gigabyte, a record low cost for this much reliable storage. At launch it was selling for over $500, and today it's even priced lower than Seagate's 20TB model, while costing just about twice as much as a 5TB drive. No surprise it currently sits as the #1 best-seller in external hard drives on Amazon.

See at Amazon

If you're drowning in files, 22TB is a lifesaver. It lets you back up years of photos, hours of 4K or 8K video, hundreds of games or dense project folders without needing to switch between several drives. Every terabyte holds approximately 250,000 photos or over 100 hours of high-definition video, so 22TB is more than enough to safeguard an entire household's digital life with a little left over. And unlike cloud storage, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee.

This Seagate drive is also USB 3.0 compatible so data is transferred easily and rapidly, including large files. Export video production projects, collections of games, or simply perform a routine backup and the process is seamless. Simply plug in and you can transfer files without installing additional software.

Seagate also provides rescue data recovery services, which offers peace of mind if something unfortunate befalls the drive.

It has more than 260,000 Amazon reviews with an average rating of 4.6/5 stars, bearing witness to its high quality and endurance over the decades.

On a practical level, there's also the value calculation: Paying $249 for 22TB means the cost per terabyte is lower than any smaller drives on the market right now. To put it simply, you're getting more space for less money compared to buying multiple smaller-capacity drives. Make sure you don't miss that opportunity.

We all want to feel more secure in our own homes, but the reality is that most traditional security cameras are a hassle. The wired ones are a headache to install with all of the cables, and the wireless ones tend to be expensive and still keep you replacing batteries every year. That is why this deal on the eufy security SoloCam S220 is so appealing right now. Amazon has discounted a 2-pack of these outdoor security cameras to just $119 (from $229, 45% off), best price ever, and that's about $59 per camera for solar-powered, wireless 2K security.

See at Amazon

In contrast to the never-ending decisions that have you toggling between cables or battery reminders, the SoloCam S220 solves the biggest headaches: Each camera is fueled by a hidden solar panel that requires only three hours of direct sunlight per day to keep charged all year long. After plugging it up, you never have to give it another thought, and you can set it almost anywhere on your property without having to run cords back into the home. The compact frame makes it unobtrusive and the setup process is as simple as drilling one small hole.

The main appeal of this pack isn't just the price but how complete it feels: You're getting 2K resolution video, which means the image is sharper than standard HD. That extra detail can really matter when you're glancing at motion alerts or zooming in on what set off the camera. Night vision is also improved by the f/1.6 aperture and infrared LEDs, which let in more light so even when it is pitch black you are seeing sharp images of your garden.

Another plus is the AI motion detection built into every device. Rather than constantly ping-pinging you with alerts every time the breeze stirs a twig across the sensor, it recognizes when someone approaches your area. That way, notifications are far more useful as you'll know whether it's your children coming home from school, an incoming package or someone else entirely. Because the data processing is done on the camera itself, the whole system avoids using cloud subscriptions, thus safeguarding your privacy. And best of all, there are no additional or monthly fees.

It is well worth the thought of the peace of mind offered on a daily basis by these cameras. Instead of needing to remember to replace batteries every winter, worry about an intruder stumbling over a cord, or pay monthly subscription fees, you pay once and you're set with solar power and built-in AI. With Amazon now offering this 2-camera set for a mere $119, today is the perfect time to invest in that system.

An incident at Collins Aerospace shut down the cloud back-end for its cMUSE platform this weekend, crippling kiosks and forcing manual fallback at Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels.

A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace brought parts of Europe's airport infrastructure to its knees this weekend, after a backend outage hit the company's cloud-based check-in system and knocked out self-service kiosks across multiple major hubs. The software in question — Collins' common-use MUSE platform — powers many airports' passenger processing stacks, allowing airlines to share check-in desks, kiosks, and boarding infrastructure through a single backend. On Saturday, that single point of failure failed.

Heathrow, Berlin Brandenburg, and Brussels Zaventem were among the major airports affected, with Brussels cancelling 45 out of 257 departing flights and warning passengers of delays up to 90 minutes. Heathrow said most flights were still running but slowed by manual fallback procedures, while Berlin suspended kiosk access altogether and shifted to direct airline processing.

Collins confirmed that the disruption was the result of a “cyber-related incident,” but has not disclosed the type of attack. What is clear is that the cMUSE outage exposed just how fragile Europe's airport IT stack has become. Designed to be flexible and scalable, cMUSE can be hosted in the cloud or deployed on-prem, but many airports rely on the cloud variant, which centralizes passenger data and logic for easier airline integration.

According to Collins' own documentation, cMUSE supports web-based agent stations, kiosk fleets, and mobile check-in endpoints through a centralized management plane. That's great for cost and updates, but not so great when that control layer goes dark. On-site systems like bag tag printers and biometric scanners are often integrated directly with MUSE, so they're not immune either.

The EU's NIS2 directive, which comes into force in October, broadens the legal definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not just airlines and airports, but IT suppliers that provide essential digital services to them. EASA's Part-IS rules, in parallel, are meant to bring aviation-grade cybersecurity to exactly these kinds of shared platforms, including common-use systems for baggage and check-in.

It's not yet clear how much of Collins' cMUSE infrastructure went down, or how many airline DCS links were affected. But it's clear that fallback worked only because staff rolled back to manual processes, not because systems failed gracefully. Heathrow said Sunday that it was continuing to recover from the outage, adding that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.

England's kits for the 2026 FIFA World Cup have reportedly been leaked, with the Football Association seemingly opting for a safe design following the controversy over their Euro 2024 attire.

Leaked images were shared online by the website Footy Headlines which are claimed to be the designs for the England kits for next summer's tournament.

The home kit will maintain the Three Lions' classic white shirt with claims it will also feature ‘modern touches'.

This reportedly includes a jacquard pattern, which will display both a lion and stars.

Red inserts are expected to be featured on the design, complete with a navy outline.

Typical features will include the one star denoting England's 1966 World Cup triumph, which will be placed above the badge.

The collar will reportedly feature the words ‘Happy and Glorious' in a reference to the national anthem.

Should the leaked images prove accurate, the designs would likely avoid the controversy that surrounded England's kit for the 2024 European Championships.

Nike, England's kit provider, had angered a section of supporters after making a 'playful update' to St. George's Cross.

The update had seen the traditional red cross with a navy blue, light blue and pink one.

Amid a backlash against the change, Sir Keir Starmer - then opposition leader - had been among those to call for the design to be changed back.  

'The flag's unifying, it doesn't need to change,' Starmer said at the time. 'We just need to be proud of it. So I think they should just reconsider this and change it back.'  

The controversy led to England's red away kit outselling the home strip for the first time, according to some retailers.

Designs are yet to be confirmed for the away kit for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, but England are expected to return to their traditional red strip.

The Three Lions had worn a blue away kit for Euro 2024.

England are closing in on qualification for the World Cup having moved seven points clear at the top of their qualification group.

Official details on England's kits are likely to be released later this year, after Thomas Tuchel's men seal qualification for the World Cup.

The kits are expected to go on sale next year in the build-up to the tournament. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

As Mexico prepares to welcome millions of visitors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the country is undertaking a major overhaul of its payment systems to fully leverage the anticipated global tourism surge. With an estimated 5.5 million fans expected, seamless, secure, and modern payment infrastructure has become critical for converting international visitor spending into substantial economic gains. The higher average spending of foreign tourists—nearly three times that of local consumers—makes efficient payment processing a strategic necessity across retail, hospitality, entertainment, and food and beverage sectors.The push for modernization is driven not only by transaction volume but also by the diverse payment preferences of global travelers, including credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless options. Streamlined systems will allow businesses to scale operations during peak periods, ensure frictionless transactions at hotels, stadiums, restaurants, and retail outlets, and enhance overall visitor experience. By investing in advanced, agile payment platforms, Mexico aims to transform the influx of international fans into measurable economic growth while positioning its tourism and hospitality sectors for long-term success.Advertisement  Recent data on consumer spending patterns underscores the urgency. International tourists, though they represent a relatively small portion of total transactions, contribute disproportionately to overall spending. On average, foreign visitors spend almost three times more per purchase than local consumers. At points of sale, international tourists are estimated to spend around MX\$1,015 (US\$55) per transaction, compared to MX\$356 (US\$19.33) by domestic shoppers. This significant difference in transaction values illustrates the need for payment systems capable of efficiently handling larger, high-value purchases while minimizing friction.For businesses operating in Mexico during the World Cup, upgrading payment infrastructure is no longer a luxury. Retailers, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues must be able to process a wide array of payment methods quickly and securely. Accepting international credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless payments is essential, as failure to do so could result in lost sales and dissatisfied visitors. Modern payment platforms that combine agility, security, and global compatibility are poised to become strategic enablers of revenue growth rather than mere conveniences.Advertisement  The sports and entertainment sector, in particular, stands to benefit from comprehensive payment integration. From ticket purchases to in-stadium concessions, smooth and reliable payment experiences can significantly enhance customer satisfaction while increasing operational efficiency. Efficient checkout processes reduce queues and transaction bottlenecks, especially during peak times, ensuring that fans enjoy a seamless experience while venues maximize revenue opportunities.Similarly, the food and beverage industry can leverage advanced payment technology to handle surges in demand efficiently. Optimized checkout systems can reduce transaction times from several seconds to nearly instantaneous, enabling businesses to scale operations without compromising service quality. Faster and frictionless payments not only improve customer satisfaction but also increase the number of transactions handled per hour, directly contributing to higher revenues during high-traffic events like the World Cup.Advertisement  Beyond transactional efficiency, the broader tourism and hospitality sectors are beginning to view digital payment experiences as a critical component of service quality. International travelers increasingly expect fast, secure, and contactless payment options. From booking accommodations online to paying for meals, transportation, and entertainment, seamless digital transactions are becoming as important as the physical quality of service. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators that adopt global payment solutions and contactless technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, ensuring that visitors enjoy a hassle-free experience from arrival to departure.Looking forward, businesses preparing for the World Cup must focus on three key pillars of payment modernization:Diversifying payment methods to accommodate international visitor preferences, including credit cards, digital wallets, and other emerging payment technologies.Minimizing friction at checkout to prevent cart abandonment, reduce queues, and speed up transactions across all points of sale.Delivering personalized payment experiences that foster customer loyalty and encourage repeat business beyond the duration of the tournament.The upcoming World Cup presents Mexico with a unique economic opportunity.

The esteemed Golden Ball has been elusive to so many great footballers down the years, but who deserved it the most? 

Back in 1995, the Ballon d'Or became eligible to non-European players for the first time, which helped it to become the most sought-after award in the sport. A grand total of 17 players have won it since then, including African icon George Weah, Brazilian quartet Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaka, and Argentine maestro Lionel Messi, who has dominated the vote over the last 16 years with a record haul of eight wins.

Meanwhile, Portuguese goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo has brought the Golden Ball back to Europe on five occasions, and Mathias Sammer, Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Michael Owen, Pavel Nedved, Andriy Shevchenko, Fabio Cannavaro, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema and Rodri have each claimed the prestigious prize once. All of those players were deserving winners, too, but so were many of the superstars they beat to the top of the podium.

As we edge closer to the 2025 winner being crowned, GOAL has ranked the top 10 greatest footballers to never win the Ballon d'Or, starting with a man who scored a whopping 573 career goals on his way to lifting 34 trophies...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler admits that Manchester United's transfer interest in Carlos Baleba may have unsettled the midfielder after a difficult start to the season.

Taylor Fritz earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win in four tries against Carlos Alcaraz — and his first victory against a reigning No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings — to extend a perfect Saturday for Team World at Laver Cup.

In a 6-3, 6-2 stunner, the American imposed his powerful game on the new world No. 1, dictating from the baseline at every opportunity and putting constant pressure on the Spaniard from the frontcourt. Fritz won 16 of 20 net points and fittingly closed the match with a forehand volley winner, looking more like vice captain Patrick Rafter than delighted captain Andre Agassi.

""We've been talking all day. It's been an honour to play under Andre,"" Fritz said post-match. ""Both of us love to share our thoughts about the game. I knew what I had to do out here tonight. The question was if I was going to be able to do it.""

Buoyed by the San Francisco crowd, which let out a roar when Golden State Warriors' star Stephen Curry walked onto the court with Roger Federer for the coin toss, Fritz kept the volume up in Chase Center by taking the match to Alcaraz. He saved the only two break points he faced, both in the opening game, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and rattled off the final four games of the match for a famous victory.

""The three times I had played Carlos, he had broken me in the first game every time,"" the American added. ""Getting out of that first game was huge. I just made sure I didn't second guess myself.”

In their most recent meeting, Alcaraz won a tight four-setter this July in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Prior to that, the Spaniard won in straight sets at last year's Laver Cup in Berlin.

Fritz's win staked his team a 7-3 advantage in the first-to-13 event, with each Saturday match counting for two points. Earlier in the day, Alex de Minaur beat Alexander Zverev and Francisco Cerundolo edged Holger Rune.

Alcaraz was playing his first singles match since winning his sixth Grand Slam singles title at the US Open and returning to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The defeat snapped a 13-match winning streak that dated back to the start of his trophy run at the Cincinnati ATP Masters 1000 event.

Alex de Minaur and Alex Michelsen completed the Saturday sweep for Team World with a 6-3, 6-4 win against Holger Rune and Casper Ruud, stretching the lead to 9-3. All four of Team World's wins on the day came in straight sets. With Sunday's four matches worth three points apiece, Team World needs just two more wins to take back the Laver Cup.

Michelsen flashed his doubles skills alongside Fritz on Friday, but the Americans were beaten by Alcaraz and Jakub Mensik. Michelsen made no mistake on his second opportunity, with him and Australia's De Minaur not facing a break point.

Lorenzo Musetti is hoping that 2025 is the year he finally gets his hands on the Chengdu Open trophy.

The top seed delivered an assured display on Sunday evening to move past Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 6-3 and reach his third consecutive semi-final at the Chinese ATP 250 event. Musetti, who now owns a record seven wins in Chengdu, will continue his title quest against Alexander Shevchenko, who ousted qualifier Taro Daniel 7-6(2), 3-6, 6-2.

“I knew it was a tricky opponent, I lost against him this year at Wimbledon,” said Musetti, who levelled his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Basilashvili at 2-2. “He's really aggressive, so you have to stay focused on every point. I felt he was playing good tennis, but I managed to stay there, especially on my serve, and I'm very happy to be in the semis. I [will be] ready for the battle.”

Basilashvili asserted himself with his aggressive game, but he was ultimately unable to cope with Musetti's consistency and poise, hitting 36 unforced errors to the Italian's 14. Musetti, who is 32-13 in 2025 according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, is this week chasing his first title of the season.

With his 76-minute quarter-final victory, Musetti jumped ahead of Alex de Minaur to seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The 23-year-old, who is aiming to make his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, could move to within 145 points of sixth-placed Taylor Fritz if he wins the title in Chengdu.

In the bottom half of the draw, Brandon Nakashima defeated Marcos Giron 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(3) in an all-American quarter-final clash. The 24-year-old came within two points of defeat when serving at 4-5, 40/40, but came up clutch and raced through a third-set tie-break to advance to his third ATP Tour semi-final of the season.

After runs to the last four in Acapulco and Houston, Nakashima faces a Chengdu meeting with Alejandro Tabilo, who continued his run from qualifying to overcome Christopher O'Connell 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 and reach his first semi-final since Mallorca last June.

Watch Tabilo overcome O'Connell in three sets: 

After struggling for form and dealing with wrist and abdominal injuries across the first eight months of 2025, Tabilo has turned his season around on Chinese soil. He reached the final at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Guangzhou last week and has risen 20 spots to No. 92 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings with his three main-draw wins in Chengdu.

“I'm just so happy right now, especially coming from the qualies, it's an unreal feeling,” said Tabilo. “I've been doing pretty good here in China. I've been loving it here.”

Wu Yibing delivered his home crowd a night to remember on Sunday at the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open, where he fought back from the brink to stun Daniil Medvedev 5-7, 7-6(5), 6-4.

The Hangzhou native trailed by a set and a break before he clawed back into the match and produced some effortless ball striking in the final set to reach his first semi-final since his 2023 run in Dallas, where he became the first Chinese man to win an ATP Tour title. He awaits third seed Alexander Bublik.

Despite hitting 17 aces throughout their three-hour, 11-minute clash, Medvedev served two crucial double faults when attempting to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, offering Wu a way back into the match. The former Nitto ATP Finals champion, who was competing in his first tournament since parting ways with his coach of eight years, Gilles Cervara, is 22nd in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

“I got a little bit lucky in the second set, but I was giving it my best,” said Wu, who earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win over Medvedev (1-2). “Obviously the crowd supported me like home. Daniil is one of the toughest guys to play on Tour, especially with my style. He's really tough to beat and I had to bring my best tennis to stay in the match. I'm glad I brought it today.”

Wu did not compete from March 2019 until January 2022 due to several injuries, including issues with his elbow, which required surgery, his lower back, shoulder and wrist. Although he won an ATP Challenger Tour event in Tyler in June, the 25-year-old is competing in just his fourth tour-level event of the season.

“It means everything, especially at home. It's been a long couple of years behind me. I overcame a lot of injuries,” said Wu. “It's not easy to be here, especially winning three matches in a row. Hopefully I can come back tomorrow feeling not so tired.”

Third seed Bublik, who has already won three ATP Tour titles this season, cruised past lucky loser Dalibor Svrcina 6-1, 6-1 in just 53 minutes.

The Kazakhstani won all 22 of his first-serve points according to Infosys ATP Stats and saved the only break point he faced.



In other quarter-final action in Hangzhou, Valentin Royer backed up his statement win over top seed Andrey Rublev by outlasting Learner Tien 7-6(0), 4-6, 6-2 to reach his maiden ATP Tour semi-final. Trailing by a break in both the final set, the 24-year-old Frenchman found a late spark and converted all three of his break points to seal his two-hour, 38-minute victory.

“I'm so happy… The crowd was with me. You guys like me, I like you, we have a connection,” Royer said in his on-court interview before thanking the crowd in Chinese for their support. “In the second set, he didn't miss a single ball, and in the third set, I was a break down again… I just don't know how I managed to win, I'm so happy.”

Prior to his debut campaign in Hangzhou, Royer had never earned consecutive tour-level wins. Yet with his impressive showing over three main-draw matches, he is up five spots to a career-high No. 83 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Royer set an all-French semi-final with fourth seed Corentin Moutet, who advanced on Sunday lunchtime after Tomas Martin Etcheverry was forced to retire. Moutet dropped the opening set 3-6, but led 3-0 in the second when the Argentine  — visibly struggling — retired.

Like Royer, Moutet is another player competing at a career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings this week. The 26-year-old, who saved two match points in his second-round win over Arthur Cazaux, is into his personal-best third semi-final of the season and has risen two spots to No. 37 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Italy secured a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup final by defeating Ukraine 2-1, with Jasmine Paolini leading the charge. Paolini rallied to win her singles match and teamed up with Sara Errani for the decisive doubles victory. In the other semifinal, the United States will face Great Britain, who are aiming for their first title.

Italy advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup final for the third consecutive year after its doubles pair secured a decisive victory to defeat first-time semifinalist Ukraine 2-1 on Friday.

Jasmine Paolini played a starring role for the Italians, rallying to win her singles match before teaming with Sara Errani to clinch the doubles point.

Kostyuk gives Ukraine the early lead

World No. 26 Marta Kostyuk gave Ukraine a strong start, defeating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2, 6-3. The 23-year-old Ukrainian did not face a single break point and converted four of eight chances on Cocciaretto's serve. The win improved Kostyuk's record to 3-0 against the Italian and to 10-3 overall in singles at the Billie Jean King Cup.

Paolini rallies to even the score

World No. 8 Paolini responded in the second singles match, coming from a set and a break down to beat No. 13 Elina Svitolina 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Svitolina, who led their head-to-head 2-0, appeared headed for another victory after building a 6-3, 4-2 lead. But Paolini stormed back, earning her sixth win in her last seven Billie Jean King Cup matches to level the tie at 1-1. Svitolina, seeking a record-extending 19th victory for Ukraine in the competition, was left disappointed as her team's dream of reaching its first final was put on hold.

Paolini returns with Errani to seal the final berth

Italy turned to its experienced doubles duo, Paolini and Sara Errani, to finish the job. They faced Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok, breaking early for a 3-0 lead before closing out the first set 6-2.

Although the Ukrainians jumped ahead 3-1 in the second set, the Italians reeled off five straight games to complete a 6-2, 6-2 victory and book their spot in Sunday's final. The win underlined Paolini's histrionics in the competition for the second year running. The 29-year-old had come also come from behind in her singles match against Wang Xinyu earlier in the week to help the Italians move into the last four.

He did indeed, in a performance that Knowles also called ""pure magic."" The American won 80% of the points on his first serve and was never broken, while breaking the Spaniard three times.Entering the match with 13 consecutive match wins, Alcaraz never was able to find the extra gear to overcome a charging Fritz. He made 19 unforced errors in 17 games, while Fritz only made 10 (to go along with 17 winners).""The other three times I've played Carlos, he's broken me first game every single time,"" Fritz continued. ""That's not how you want to start against someone like him. Getting out of that first game was huge, and just playing a lot of the big points with conviction.""I didn't second-guess myself. I didn't play too safe. I played with no fear on a lot of the big points.""

But following that, Federer said that the possibilities are endless.""The goal was to play in places that don't get to see tennis too often.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen was never challenged on Sunday in Baku, comfortably leading home George Russell and Carlos Sainz, while championship leader Oscar Piastri crashed out on the first lap.

Max Verstappen claimed a lights-to-flag victory in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, while Lando Norris closed the gap to title rival Oscar Piastri to 25 points after the Drivers' Championship leader crashed out on the opening lap.

Verstappen was never headed on the streets of Baku, leading all 51 laps and winning by over 14 seconds from Mercedes' George Russell and Carlos Sainz, who claimed his first podium for Williams having just lost out on pole position.

Kimi Antonelli narrowly missed out on the final step of the podium, having run well all day, but was well clear of a fierce battle for fifth, which was headed by Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, who claimed a career-best result.

Race results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS AZERBAIJAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Yuki Tsunoda finished sixth after applying intense late pressure but in the process claimed his best result for Red Bull, while Norris finished seventh – the same position the McLaren driver started having struggled to make any progress through the sole pit stop sequence.

The Briton, who slumped to as low a ninth at one stage, was unable to pass Tsunoda on the final lap and only reduced Piastri's lead in the title race by six points.

This was after the Australian suffered a disastrous opening lap, jumping the lights and then activating anti-stall from P9 before crashing out at Turn 5 having dropped to the back of the field.

Lewis Hamilton led team mate Charles Leclerc on a difficult day for Ferrari after both started down the order, as the second Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar completed the top 10.

Gabriel Bortoleto's Kick Sauber was best of the rest, followed by Ollie Bearman and Alex Albon, the Williams driver slapped with a 10-second penalty for a collision with Franco Colapinto mid-race.

Esteban Ocon, who started last after the rear wing on his Haas was found to be illegal post-Qualifying, finished P14 from Fernando Alonso, the Aston Martin driver handed a penalty for jumping the start.

The order was completed by Nico Hulkenberg (Kick Sauber), Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and the two Alpines of Pierre Gasly and Colapinto, with Piastri the only retirement.

After one of the most chaotic Qualifying sessions in F1 history, Verstappen started on pole for the sixth time this season while a mixed up grid meant title rivals Norris and Piastri were back in seventh and ninth respectively.

Despite using the hard Pirelli tyre compared with fellow front-row starter Sainz on the medium rubber, Verstappen cut across as the lights went out to hold the lead through the opening turns, as Sainz, Lawson and Antonelli maintained position behind.

Further back, Piastri suffered a disastrous start off the line having initially jumped the lights before coming to a stop and engaging anti-stall, meaning the Drivers' Championship leader slumped to P20 even before Turn 1.

But things were to get even worse for the McLaren driver as he slammed into the barriers at Turn 5 to register his first retirement of the season and offer Norris a perfect opportunity to reduce the 31-point gap separating them.

The Briton, though, had lost a position to Hadjar and was down in P8 as the Safety Car, deployed in the wake of Piastri's crash, returned to the pit lane at the end of Lap 4, and Norris immediately lost another position to Leclerc at the restart.

Further ahead, the two Mercedes drivers went side-by-side into Turn 1, Russell having to back out and losing a position to Tsunoda, both drivers on the hard tyre compared with those around them.

Leclerc and Norris gained a position before the end of the lap, Hadjar having run slightly wide at Turn 16 and losing momentum down the long start/finish straight, with Hamilton demoting the Frenchman several laps later for P9.

Out front, Verstappen had pulled a gap of 1.5s by the end of Lap 6 as Lawson was in DRS range of Sainz ahead, with Antonelli clear of the battling Tsunoda and Russell.

Back in the pack, Alonso in P11 was handed a five-second penalty for also jumping the start, apologising to his team after reacting to Piastri immediately in front of him on the grid.

By the start of Lap 10, Verstappen had extended his lead to 2.1s as Sainz still in second had broken DRS range to Lawson, while Russell finally moved back ahead of Tsunoda for fifth into Turn 3.

Tsunoda soon led a DRS train including Leclerc, Norris and Hamilton, with Hadjar in touching distance as the pecking order across the field briefly settled down, drivers focusing on tyre management for what was expected to be a one-stop race.

Bearman and Albon soon moved ahead of Gasly at Turn 1 and joined the back of another DRS train which was headed by Colapinto in P13 and included Stroll and Hulkenberg.

Albon pitted for hard tyres at the end of Lap 15 with Colapinto pitting shortly after, but the pair came together at Turn 5 with the Alpine driver sent into a spin before recovering, while the Williams man was handed a 10-second penalty.

Russell, meanwhile, stared to become frustrated stuck behind team mate Antonelli as the young Italian was unable to find a away to pass Lawson ahead for P3, with Sainz 4.5s up the road, the Spaniard in turn nearly 5s behind Verstappen on Lap 18.

It prompted Mercedes to bring Antonelli in at the end of the lap, swapping medium for hard tyres, with Ferrari bringing in Leclerc the following tour for the same compound of rubber.

Racing Bulls brought Lawson in at the end of Lap 20, the New Zealander just re-joining in front of Antonelli as the pair now circulated in P10-P11, with Russell promoted to third and three seconds ahead of Tsunoda, who led Norris and Hamilton.

Antonelli's breakthrough finally came at the end of the lap, drafting past Lawson on the start/finish straight with the help of DRS, with Albon doing the same to Alonso for P17 a lap later.

Out front, Verstappen led Sainz by seven seconds on Lap 23, the Spaniard four seconds to the good over Russell, who in turn was ahead of Tsunoda by the same margin, while Norris in fifth was nearly 17s behind Verstappen and unable to make progress on-track.

At the halfway point, Antonelli moved up to P8 at the expense of Bortoleto down the main straight, as Lawson and Leclerc soon began to close on the Kick Sauber driver, who was pitted at the end of Lap 26 and rejoined P16.

Sainz pitted from second on Lap 27, having held a gap of just over two seconds to Russell behind, the Williams driver rejoining in clean air back in sixth with the hard tyre and Verstappen's margin to Russell in P2 now at 12s.

Antonelli's margin to Sainz stood at 3s on Lap 30 as Hadjar pitted from in front of the Mercedes driver, the Racing Bulls rookie re-joining in P10 and just ahead of the yet-to-pit Stroll and Hulkenberg.

While Leclerc in P9 was unable to pass Lawson ahead, further back there was movement as Bortoleto and Albon both demoted Ocon into Turn 1, the pair quickly doing the same to Hulkenberg.

Norris in P4, meanwhile, was told to get closer to Tsunoda having dropped two seconds adrift on the medium tyres, with Hamilton behind stopping at the end of Lap 36 and re-joining down in P9.

The following lap, Norris was called in to put on a fresh set of hard tyres but a problem with the front-right caused a 4.1s pit stop and meant he re-joined behind the Lawson/Leclerc battle in P8.

Red Bull responded on the following lap, and although Tsunoda re-joined in front of Lawson, the Racing Bulls driver made the pass on the run to Turn 3 which give him some breathing space to Leclerc and Norris immediately behind.

A 2.3s pit stop from Mercedes meant Russell rejoined still in P2 ahead of Sainz, who in turn was ahead of Antonelli, Lawson, Tsunoda, Leclerc and Norris, the McLaren driver looking quick on a fresher set of tyres and passing the Ferrari at the end of Lap 40.

Just moments earlier, Verstappen pitted for a fresh set of medium tyres and comfortably re-joined in a lead he never relinquished and would hold until the end of the race.

Leclerc would lose a further spot to Hamilton, the Briton now 3s behind Norris, who was on the back of Tsunoda and Lawson in the battle for fifth with eight laps remaining.

Despite intense pressure, Lawson was able to hold on for a career-best result while Tsunoda had to defend from Norris into Turn 1 at the start of the final lap.

The order remained unchanged, though, Verstappen taking back-to-back wins and closing to within 69 points of Piastri in the Drivers' Championship with seven races remaining.

Russell claimed second having been suffering from an illness all weekend, while Sainz completed the podium – his first for Williams – having held Antonelli at bay in the closing stages.

Lawson headed Tsunoda and Norris, with McLaren missing out on claiming the Constructors' Championship this weekend after the team's worst performance of the season.

The Ferraris of Hamilton and Leclerc claimed eighth and ninth on a difficult day for the Scuderia, with Hadjar completing the top 10.

Bortoleto was next followed by Bearman, Albon, and Ocon, who started last after the rear wing on his Haas was found to be illegal after Qualifying.

Alonso, Hulkenberg, Stroll and the two Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto completed the order, with Piastri the sole retirement.

""I think this weekend has been incredible for us,"" said Verstappen after back-to-back wins. ""Of course, last weekend was already great, but for us to win here again is just fantastic. I think also in the race, the car was working really well on both of the compounds. We had clean air all of the time and then you could look after your tyres, and it was pretty straightforward. Of course, it's not easy around here. It was very windy today, so the car was always moving around a lot, but of course, I'm incredibly happy with this performance.”

F1 will travel from Baku to Marina Bay for the Singapore Grand Prix over the weekend of October 3-5. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

It was a difficult Qualifying day for Ferrari in Azerbaijan, with Lewis Hamilton dropping out in Q2 and Charles Leclerc crashing in Q3.

Lewis Hamilton has described his “big shock” at dropping out in the Q2 phase during Saturday's Qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, believing that he had the pace to “fight for the top three”.

Hamilton set the pace at the Baku City Circuit on Friday and was the fastest of the Ferrari drivers during final practice in P4 – behind only Max Verstappen's Red Bull and McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

However, in an incident-filled Qualifying that featured a host of red flags and saw drivers torn between using Pirelli's soft and medium compound tyres, Hamilton fell at the second hurdle and will start back in 12th position.

Asked to reflect on his session, and whether with hindsight he might have taken a different approach with his tyre strategy, Hamilton said: “Yeah, for sure. Firstly, we would have done what everyone else did and have three [sets of] mediums going into P3, then into Qualifying we would have had three mediums, and we should have used a medium in Q2.

“That's what everyone else did. We knew that it was quicker… I can't tell you why we didn't end up using it, but we'll take it internal. There's been lots of progress.”

He added: “I'm still optimistic for the race I think, in terms of trying to move forwards. But wow, I honestly thought I was fighting for the top three, so it's a big shock.”

While team mate Charles Leclerc made it through to Q3, the Monegasque ended his day in the barriers with a crash at Turn 15 – leaving him timeless in 10th place.

“It's been an extremely difficult weekend overall for me,” said Leclerc, who had claimed the previous four pole positions in Azerbaijan. “Normally Baku is obviously a track I really enjoy driving, but it's been a bit of a pain from the beginning of the weekend, struggling with the balance of the car.

“I changed quite a lot the car going into Qualifying, which seemed to be better, but unfortunately we couldn't make the medium work anymore. We started to struggle massively in bringing the medium [up] to temperature, then I did this mistake which obviously cost us a lot. Not much more to add.”

He signed off: “I think it's going to be a very tough race tomorrow. Starting from the back [of the top 10]… to come back in front will be tricky.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Esteban Ocon's day in Azerbaijan got even worse with the news that a disqualification had followed up his Q1 exit.

Esteban Ocon has been disqualified from Saturday's Qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after it was deemed that his Haas car had breached F1's Technical Regulations.

After dropping out in the first Q1 phase in 18th position, Ocon and Haas were summoned to see the stewards over an alleged breach of Article 3.15.17 of the FIA Technical Regulations – relating to the rear wing main plane tip deflection test.

According to a note issued by FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer, the deflection figures measured on Ocon's rear wing during post-session checks exceeded the allowed deflection of 0.5mm.

As is the usual outcome with such a technical violation, a follow up from the stewards later confirmed that Ocon had been disqualified from the session.

“The FIA representatives described the test procedure used and reported that the distance between the two sections of RV-RW-PROFILES and RV-RW-TIP inboard of Y=525 varied by more than the permitted 0.5mm (0.6mm on the left side and 0.825mm on the right side,” read the stewards' decision document.

“The calibration of the measuring instrument was verified and valid.

“The team conceded that the test procedure as outlined in the regulations had been followed and explained that the discrepancy was a result of a problem with the production of the assembly of this specific part.

“The stewards determine that the vehicle does not comply with the regulations and hence impose the usual penalty of disqualification from the Qualifying classifications.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Lando Norris and McLaren returned to the top of the timesheets during final practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Lando Norris bounced back from his visit to the wall at the Baku City Circuit during FP2 by setting the pace in Saturday's final practice session.

Across a particularly slippery and windy hour of running, with patches of earlier rain reducing grip levels, Norris clocked a best time of 1m 41.223s on Pirelli's soft compound tyre.

It put him a couple of tenths clear of Red Bull rival Max Verstappen, followed by McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri, Friday pace-setter Lewis Hamilton for Ferrari and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli.

While major incidents and red flags were avoided, plenty of drivers had trips to the run-off areas and brushes with the walls, including thumps for Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly.

Hit go on the video player above to watch the FP3 action from Azerbaijan.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri drove straight into the barrier in the final minutes of Qualifying, leading to a disappointing end to his day and an eventual ninth place on the grid for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix

McLaren's Oscar Piastri intends to “claw back” positions in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after suffering his worst Qualifying performance of the season, hitting the wall in the final segment of an incident-filled session.

The Australian added his name to the list of drivers who endured the consequences of the tricky conditions in Baku as he carried too much speed and found himself unable to make the apex at Turn 3, instead ploughing straight into the barrier.

His crash happened with just under four minutes left on the clock, leaving him at the tail end of the top 10 with Charles Leclerc, who similarly found the wall earlier in Q3.

Piastri will have a challenge on his hands to defend his championship lead from P9 on the grid, but the strong pace shown throughout Practice and the opening stages of Qualifying has reduced his concerns.

“I probably braked a little bit late – I need to go back and have a look,” he explained after the incident. “I feel like the car was good and the pace was there, so just a disappointing way to end it.

“We'll see where Qualifying shakes out first. I'll go back and have a look at where it all went wrong today, but I've been much happier with the car today which is a good thing. Hopefully we can claw back some progress tomorrow.”

His error gave McLaren team mate Lando Norris a perfect opportunity to take advantage and put himself in the best position to narrow the gap in the standings, but he could only manage to secure seventh place.

The battle for pole position ended up in a shootout in the dying minutes as Carlos Sainz, Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar were initially the only drivers with times on the board. Ultimately, Max Verstappen was the sole racer who put a lap together to beat the Williams to pole position, with Norris 1.122s slower.

As Qualifying proved, the circuit walls are incredibly close and any change in the conditions can result in incidents, leaving Norris fully aware that overtaking will be the biggest challenge in tomorrow's Grand Prix.

He said: “I would like to be on pole, of course. I just wasn't quick enough on the final run. It was always good before, and we took the risk of trying to go first out, thinking that if there was another crash, at least I would get the lap in.

“I think it was just a lot worse for the track because it was still raining a little bit. You win some, you lose some. I'm not disappointed, let's say, because it's a small mistake – I hit the wall on the final lap. It was just a trickier track for me being the first one out, and I paid the price for that.

“Overtaking is pretty tough around here. We're obviously a bit out of position and there are a few different cars ahead of us. Max has been on the pace the whole weekend. I think to try and win tomorrow is maybe a bit unrealistic, but of course we want maximum points and I need to do some overtaking.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

High winds made conditions tricky for drivers in Baku as Lando Norris came out on top in Free Practice 3.

Lando Norris topped Free Practice 3 for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading Max Verstappen and title rival Oscar Piastri ahead of Qualifying.

The Briton posted a 1m 41.223s which left him 0.222s clear of Verstappen as drivers battled the elements in Baku on Saturday.

Although the circuit was dry for the final one-hour session of practice, heavy overnight rain removed much of the rubber that had been put down on Friday, while high winds created a difficult situation for drivers into the many braking zones.

Ollie Bearman became the first driver to use the run-off area, heading deep at Turn 4 inside the opening 10 minutes and reporting that ""it's challenging with this wind"" as almost the entire field remained sheltered in the garages approaching the 20-minute mark.

Norris was eventually one of the first to set a time, the McLaren driver having lost half of his running in FP2 after clouting the wall and immediately using a set of soft Pirelli tyres, as did McLaren team mate Piastri, both drivers having had scrappy Friday running.

Having taken pole position at the last four events in Azerbaijan, Charles Leclerc was immediately setting the pace, posting a 1m 43.048s despite running deep at the final braking zone, while team mate Lewis Hamilton had to recover after running off track at Turn 3.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS AZERBAIJAN GRAND PRIX 2025

The Briton continued his encouraging performance from Friday by jumping to the top of the times on his next lap with a 1m 42.988s, but which was still almost two seconds slower than his own session-best from FP2.

As track conditions improved, so did lap times inside the final 30 minutes, Leclerc lowering the benchmark to a 1m 42.354s and surviving a brush with the wall on the entry to Turn 7 on a later lap, while Liam Lawson suffered a full 360-degree spin at Turn 16.

Meanwhile, Verstappen became the first driver in FP3 to set a time below the 1m 42s barrier, posting a 1m 41.727s as teams and drivers focused on Qualifying simulations in the final 15 minutes.

Norris set the new fastest benchmark across all three sessions with a 1m 41.223s, while Piastri had to abort his flying lap after suffering a moment of oversteer through Turn 4, the Drivers' Championship leader then running deep at Turn 1 on his next lap.

Piastri was able to register a competitive lap time, but found himself three-tenths behind Norris as Verstappen and then Hamilton slotted between the two title rivals.

Piastri improved with his final lap but only jumped to third and over two-tenths adrift of Norris as Verstappen remained between the pair, with Hamilton and the Mercedes cars of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell completing the top six.

Alex Albon (Williams), Bearman (Haas), Lawson (Racing Bulls) and Leclerc rounded out the top 10, the Ferrari driver failing to improve with his final lap after running deep at Turn 4.

Isack Hadjar sat just outside the top 10, as the Racing Bulls driver headed Nico Hulkenberg (Kick Sauber), Carlos Sainz (Williams), the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso and Franco Colapinto's Alpine.

Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull), Esteban Ocon (Haas), the second Kick Sauber of Gabriel Bortoleto, Pierre Gasly's Alpine and Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) completed the classification ahead of Qualifying later today.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Despite just missing out on pole position, Carlos Sainz was over the moon with his Qualifying performance in Baku for Williams.

Carlos Sainz was delighted with his second-place grid start, despite being denied pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix by Max Verstappen in the dying seconds of a thrilling Qualifying session.

The Spaniard was on provisional pole having posted a lap time prior to a red flag in Q3, caused when Charles Leclerc crashed out at Turn 15, and still remained quickest as another stoppage followed with Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri in the wall.

With a one-lap shootout ahead on a sub-optimal circuit caused by drops of rain, it looked like the Spaniard would claim Williams' first pole in more than a decade, before Verstappen was able to usurp him at the top of the leaderboard.

""Very happy, honestly. We've nailed Qualifying today,"" admitted Sainz post-session.

""Every time we were on the right tyre at the right time and put together some very strong laps. Obviously the moment that a top car put a lap together, we were always going to be those four or five tenths behind like we always are.

""It was only one of them which was Max – not surprised. For the rest, we managed to beat them and we are P2 which is great news.

""I've been putting good laps together this year in Qualifying – it hasn't been my weakness or my issues at all. Today, we proved that the speed of this car and this team is there and delivering in Qualifying when it counts.

""Unfortunately, the year in terms of races and points is not going the way we want, but as long as the speed is there, which today proves, the points and the good races will come. I'm not worried.""

Sainz has endured a difficult season since joining Williams from Ferrari at the start of this season, failing to match team mate Alex Albon's race performances, having only achieved a best result of P8 this term and he has not scored points in the last six races.

""Try and stick it on the podium,"" said Sainz when asked what he hoped to achieve in Sunday's 51-lap race.

""I'm going to give it my best to give Williams their first podium [with me]. If it's possible, great, and if not, we will see.""

Albon, meanwhile, will start Sunday's race from the back of the grid as he crashed out in Q1 after hitting the inside wall at Turn 1, which broke his Williams' suspension.

""My mistake obviously, bit of a rookie mistake,"" he said reflecting on the incident.

""Just got caught out with the difference of grip between my first lap and what was going to be my second lap. Nothing to say really, just a bit disappointing.

""Didn't need that, we've got our work cut out [in the race]. It's not that easy to make progress around this track so we'll have to hang tight and see what we can do.""

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.

After one of the most epic Qualifying sessions in living memory, it's a highly mixed-up starting order for the 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Perhaps the only unsurprising thing was the man who came through it all to grab pole in the dying moments, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

The Red Bull driver's final flyer deprived Williams' Carlos Sainz of P1 glory and the Spaniard thus lines up second. Behind those F1 veterans are two of the youngest men in the field, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.

On row three are the sister Mercedes and Red Bull cars of George Russell and Yuki Tsunoda, while you have to go down to P7 to find the first of the McLarens, that of Lando Norris, who's just ahead of Isack Hadjar in the second Racing Bulls machine.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc complete the top 10, both the McLaren star and the four-time Baku polesitter having crashed heavily in Q3 as drizzle fell around the Baku City Circuit.

At the very back of the order we have Esteban Ocon. The Frenchman originally qualified in 18th place, but was subsequently disqualified after his Haas car failed a post-session inspection due to a rear wing technical infringement.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen was never headed on Sunday in Baku to claim his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

Max Verstappen admits his lights-to-flag victory in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was ""fantastic"" having comfortably controlled Sunday's race to take back-to-back Formula 1 wins.

The Red Bull driver was never headed over 51-laps on the streets of Baku, having held the lead from pole and, after an early Safety Car restart, slowly pulled away from Carlos Sainz and then George Russell, the pair completing the podium.

""I think this weekend has been incredible for us,"" said Verstappen after his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

""Of course, last [F1] weekend was already great, but for us to win here again is just fantastic. I think also in the race, the car was working really well on both of the compounds [of tyre]. We had clean air all of the time and then you could look after your tyres and it was pretty straightforward.

“Of course, it's not easy around here. It was very windy today, so the car was always moving around a lot, but of course, I'm incredibly happy with this performance.”

With Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri crashing out on the opening lap and title rival Lando Norris only seventh, Verstappen has closed the gap to the top of the table down to just 69 points with seven races remaining.

But the Dutchman was cautious about his title chances despite McLaren enduring its worse weekend of the season and missing out on the Constructors' Championship in Baku.

“It's difficult to say at the moment, but for sure, the last two race weekends have been amazing for us,"" said Verstappen on mounting a title challenge.

""Singapore is a completely different challenge again with the high downforce, but we will see what we can do there.”

It was a strong day for Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda claiming his best result for the team in sixth having applied late pressure to Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson in the closing stages.

""Happy with it, especially the pace I showed today is a lot different to other race weekends,"" said Tsunoda.

""I think I got supported a lot from the team to change massively like this internally and also the efforts I put in over the weeks, definitely shows some improvement there.

""Everything matches well and to be able to secure this result, which definitely is a positive. Some bits I can improve for sure and sharpen up more quality but was a good race.""

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Dino Beganovic came out on top during the first Formula 2 race of the weekend in Azerbaijan.

Dino Beganovic was in supreme form around the Baku City Circuit, controlling the Formula 2 Sprint Race from start to finish for his first win in the championship.

The Hitech TGR driver started second on the grid but immediately launched into the lead ahead of Turn 1.

From that point on, he managed two Safety Car restarts, built up an advantage over his closest pursuer on each occasion and went on to win by over six seconds at the chequered flag.

Beganovic's team mate, Luke Browning, came from sixth on the grid to secure second place and a 1-2 for the Hitech team.

Fellow third-row starter Alexander Dunne joined them on the podium, going from seventh to third despite a mid-race lock-up at Turn 1 that handed what turned out to be second place back to Browning.

Jak Crawford made progress in the latter half of the Sprint Race to secure P4 for DAMS Lucas Oil, while championship leader Leonardo Fornaroli had to settle for fifth.

He pulled off a last-lap pass on compatriot Gabriele Minì for a top-five finish, while the PREMA Racing driver was further demoted on the run to the chequered flag by Richard Verschoor.

The Dutchman used DRS to clinch sixth place in a drag race to the line, while ART Grand Prix's Victor Martins rounded out the points-paying positions in P8.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Formula 2 Feature Race honours in Azerbaijan went to Jak Crawford after a close finish.

Jak Crawford converted pole position into a hard-fought victory after being forced to hold off a charging Joshua Duerksen across the line in Sunday's entertaining Baku F2 Feature Race.

The DAMS Lucas Oil driver lost the lead at the start but, after a Safety Car restart, he regained it from Gabriele Minì via a multi-lap battle.

The Aston Martin Development Driver then looked to be on his way to a comfortable win, but had to fend off Duerksen over the line, sealing his fourth victory of the season by just two-tenths.

As for Duerksen, he settled for second, having gone from 15th on the grid to the podium for AIX Racing. Championship leader Leonardo Fornaroli finished third on the road, but a 10-second time penalty dropped him to fifth.

This promoted Hitech TGR's Dino Beganovic to the podium, giving the Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member his second trophy of the Baku weekend following his Sprint Race victory.

Minì finished fourth for PREMA Racing, ahead of Fornaroli, while Red Bull junior Arvid Lindblad went from P14 on the grid to sixth for Campos Racing.

Rafael Villagómez finished seventh for Van Amersfoort Racing, ahead of Richard Verschoor and Sebastián Montoya, with Ritomo Miyata taking the final point in P10 for ART Grand Prix.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Victory went to Max Verstappen in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which started with a dramatic crash for championship leader Oscar Piastri.

Max Verstappen dominated the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after championship leader Oscar Piastri crashed out on the opening lap.

Verstappen controlled Sunday's race in Baku, winning by almost 15 seconds from George Russell and Carlos Sainz. With Lando Norris only seventh and Piastri a non-scorer, the Red Bull driver also closed the points gap to 68.

Following a chaotic opening lap, which included Piastri's Turn 5 crash, the race became a tactical battle, with teams attempting to use the undercut to move their drivers up the order.

Boosting their points totals with much-needed strong performances were Kimi Antonelli, Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda in fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively, with the trio fending off Norris in seventh.

Following a strong start to the weekend, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc could only manage eighth and ninth places for Ferrari.

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Relive a drama-filled start to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix that could have significant championship ramifications.

Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix got off to a dramatic start, with Max Verstappen holding the lead but Oscar Piastri tumbling down the order and crashing out.

While polesitter Verstappen entered Turn 1 just ahead of Carlos Sainz and Liam Lawson, Piastri hit trouble off the line and dropped all the way to the back of the field.

The championship leader then locked up and slid helplessly into the outside wall at Turn 5, ending his race there and then – and potentially having huge ramifications on the 2025 title battle.

As the leading pack fed through the opening corners, Piastri's team mate, Lando Norris, dropped a position to eighth, with no other major dramas to report.

Meanwhile, Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell's romantic fantasy 'Big Bold Beautiful Journey' bombs with $3.5 million.


							By 

	Aaron Couch


Film Editor


	Anime hit Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – the Movie Infinity Castle is the champion of this weekend's box office, topping the Jordan Peele-produced Him for no. 1.


Demon Slayer, which set a record $70 million U.S. opening last weekend, is looking to bring in $17.3 million this weekend, a tumble of 77 percent but enough for a victory. Him, from Universal and Peele's Monkeypaw, is projected to end the weekend with $13.5 million, down from earlier estimates of $15 million.




Demon Slayer hails from the Sony-owned Crunchyroll, and is already a global smash. It now stands as the top-grossing anime movie of all time globally, with more than $555 million.

	But the weekend brought bad news from other corners of the Sony empire, with the high-profile Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell romantic fantasy A Big Bold Beautiful Journey bombing with a projected $3.5 million, sixth-place finish. Journey centers on a man and a woman who relive key moments from their lives. The feature is Robbie's first starring role since Barbie became a phenomenon two years ago and helped revive the box office. The film earned a B- CinemaScore from audiences and tepid reviews. Kogonada directed the Blacklist script by Seth Reiss.


Him likewise earned mediocre reviews. It stars Tyriq Withers as a top NFL quarterback prospect whose career is upended when he is blind sided by an attacker and suffers brain trauma. He finds a potential way back to greatness in the form of Marlon Wayans' GOAT quarterback, who offers to train him at his private compound. The psychological horror movie hails from director Justin Tipping and received a C- CinemaScore from audiences.

	











	Rounding out the top five are New Line's The Conjuring: The Last Rites, now in its third weekend and expected to earn $12.1 million; Lionsgate's The Long Walk, with $6.3 million; and Focus' Downton Abbey: The Finale, with $6 million.


Sept. 21, 8:13 a.m. Updated with revised estimates.

The Oscar-winning helmer behind 'The Dark Knight' and ‘Oppenheimer' ran unopposed to lead the more than 19,000-member union.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	The Directors Guild of America has appointed one of its most celebrated members as its new president.


Christopher Nolan was elected during the union's biennial national convention, with results released Saturday. Nolan, who ran for the top office unopposed, will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the 19,500-member union of directors, associate and assistant directors, unit production managers and stage managers through the 2023 actors and writers strikes.




	“To be elected President of the Directors Guild of America is one of the greatest honors of my career,” the director of Oppenheimer and The Dark Knight said in a statement. “Our industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild's membership for entrusting me with this responsibility. I also want to thank President Glatter for her leadership over the past four years. I look forward to collaborating with her and the newly elected Board to achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.”

	It's a major development for the DGA, given that Nolan is one of the best-known directors of his generation, associated with puzzle box-like stories that play with themes of time and memory. 2000's Memento, starring Guy Pearce, made him a director to watch in Hollywood, while Nolan's take on the Batman franchise, starting with 2005's Batman Begins, earned him a cult following. In the years since, as Nolan has proven to be a box office draw, he has leveraged his celebrity to celebrate seeing films in theaters — and championed the use of the 70mm format.

	Film fans outside the thirty-mile zone may be less familiar, however, with Nolan's union service, even as it has ramped up in the last decade. A DGA member since 2001, Nolan has served on the union's national board and Western directors council since 2015. He is currently the chair of the union's theatrical creative rights committee and its artificial intelligence committee.


	During the convention, the union's 167 delegates additionally re-elected veteran television directors Laura Belsey (The Walking Dead) as the group's national vice president and Paris Barclay (Doctor Odyssey) as its secretary-treasurer. 


	CBS associate director Joyce Thomas was elected assistant secretary treasurer, Malcom in the Middle director Todd Holland was elected first vice president, Apollo 13 helmer Ron Howard was elected second vice president and The Woman King director Gina Prince-Bythewood was elected third vice president.


	The guild's freshly elected leaders will soon be put to the test as the DGA enters its latest negotiations over its basic agreement with studios and streamers next year. On Saturday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — which bargains on behalf of these major employers — released a statement congratulating Nolan. 


	The group said, “We look forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.”

“Everyone thought I was crazy,” Stallone said of his pitch that would utilize de-aging technology to see him play an 18-year-old John Rambo.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Even though it's been four decades since he originated the role, Sylvester Stallone was ready to portray Rambo one more time. 


	During a conversation on The Playlist's Bingeworthy podcast, the Tulsa King actor revealed that he pitched his potential return to the film franchise. Instead of following up after the events of 2019's Rambo: Last Blood, Stallone wanted to partake in a prequel project that would feature an 18-year-old John Rambo. And, yes — he wanted to play a young Rambo, with the use of de-aging AI technology.

	“Everyone thought I was crazy,” Stallone said of the pitch.  “AI is sophisticated enough to go through Saigon to see him at 18 years old and basically use the same image. So it isn't as big a stretch.”

	While Stallone wanted to take on the role again, Noah Centineo is reportedly set to play the character in a Rambo prequel film. Of another actor taking on one of his iconic characters, Stallone warned that it's incredibly tough to take on an already originated role, similarly to when he starred in the 2000 Get Carter remake. 


	“It's very, very hard. He may do a stellar job, but you're overcoming this because I went through it with Get Carter,” he added. “Everyone loves the original, and then you're always fighting that prejudice.” 


	Of the potential for a Rambo prequel, Stallone told The Hollywood Reporter in 2022 that he believed the movie was “getting close,” while offering a few ideas he had for the project.

	











	“I think it's going to happen,” he said. “I wanted to do it like a Ken Burns documentary on Vietnam, where you drop young Rambo in there and he's this outgoing guy, football captain, and then you see why he becomes Rambo. But what they want to do is a modern-day story where I pass the torch. That's getting close.”

The 55-year-old son of President Joe Biden participated in the Matthew Perry Foundation's summit on substance abuse, a gathering held at CAA. Biden opened up in a revealing chat with NPR's Brian Mann. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Hunter Biden went deep during a three-hour interview on Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan in July, opening up about how the media covered his crack cocaine addiction, his journey in sobriety and yes, that infamous laptop. But the moment that generated the most headlines came when Biden took aim at George Clooney by saying “fuck him and everyone around him” in response to the actor's column in The New York Times suggesting President Joe Biden drop out of the 2024 election.


	After the self-described “passionate” diatribe, Biden, a frequent target of conservatives and critics of his father, once again became a topic of conversation. Because he used foul language and grew emotional in defending his father, critics assumed that he was back on drugs. “Don and Eric [Trump] went on TV and said that I was smoking crack still, and obviously I had a drug problem. [Former Fox News host turned United States attorney for the District of Columbia] Jeanine Pirro said that when I got a haircut, I must have done that because I was getting drug tested,” Biden recalled Thursday as he participated in the Matthew Perry Foundation's first-ever summit at CAA headquarters in Los Angeles.

	Though he's been the target of such attacks for years, Biden told the summit that he's no longer letting such baseless chatter affect him, especially now that he's been sober for six years. “I don't care. I truly don't care. I had to make a decision that I'm not going to care about what other people think of me, otherwise I would never get out of bed in the morning,” continued Biden, appearing from out of the country on Zoom in CAA's private theater while speaking with NPR's Brian Mann, the outlet's first national addiction correspondent. The theater hosted Matthew Perry Foundation co-founders Doug Chapin and Lisa Kasteler-Calio, his former CAA agent Peter Levine, Warner Bros. Television Group executive vp of publicity and communications Rebecca Marks, CAA's Kevin Huvane and Hylda Queally and The Pitt creator R. Scott Gemmill, the latter of whom participated in a conversation about how his Emmy winning show tackles substance use.

	While Biden's comments are newsworthy, the context of what he said also fit nicely into the summit's theme of stigma around substance abuse and addiction. It's a topic Biden knows a lot about and he shared about the shame that he carried as he battled his addiction, giving credit to his family for never giving up on him even while his dark secrets became fodder for tabloids and his father's political opponents.


	“There's not a family in this country that doesn't have direct experience with substance use disorder and addiction, whether it's alcohol or whether it's crack cocaine. What I really hope is that what I'm able to do is just talk as honestly about it with anyone who wants to talk about it, to give them the hope that today I am more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my entire life. I am healthier than I've ever been in my entire life, and I'm more certain of who I am than I've ever been in my entire life,” Biden explained, adding that he arrived at such a peaceful place thanks to his recovery and owning his story before others could. “The hard part is I made a decision that I was going to be transparent before transparency was forced on me. I did an interview with Adam Entous at The New Yorker. People thought I was crazy at the time, largely because of how honest I was. I didn't say that I was an addict or that I just used cocaine. I talked about the fact that I was crack addict, and when you say you're a crack addict, understandably, people have been conditioned to believe something that is monstrous. They still throw that in my face today.”

	











	He remains unfazed.


	“[Peace] was amazingly given to me by the people that attacked me, and it was given to me in the sense that I don't have to hide anymore. There's not another shoe that's going to drop, at least not another shoe that's true. I have been freed from having to tell white lies anymore about who I am or who I was, and the places that I found myself in addiction,” continued Biden, who revealed that he first discovered he had a problem with alcohol at age 33. Now 55, Biden has been to eight or nine rehabs and checked into multiple outpatient programs. “Nobody comes into recovery on a winning streak. Nobody. And I have been in rooms that I know that I just couldn't die in…without being incredibly shamed, and I'm free of that now. I wish I could give that to everybody, but it is so hard.”


	He said the “level of shaming” that he's experienced over the last five years has been unlike anything he's experienced in his life. But he also put himself through the ringer over not being available to his three daughters while he was in active addiction. “I had an enormous amount of shame over that. And ironically because of the position that I found myself in with my dad running for president and before that [while he was in office], and the incredible focus that they had on me, I was given the gift of not having any more secrets to have to hide,” Biden said. “You'd think that I'm exaggerating, but I truly believe that that's probably the thing that has allowed me to stay clean and sober beyond the love and support of my family. I'm also really proud of myself for having six years [of sobriety] right now. I was given the gift of not having any more of those secrets. It is all out there for anyone to see.”

	











	Biden added that while he still may be in the “white hot spotlight” of news outlets like The Daily Mail, The New York Post, The New York Times and Fox News, he's still got an army of loved ones by his side. 


	“I had people that no matter what would stand by my side, love and respect me, beginning with my dad most importantly, but also my children and my wife, my mom and my sister and an entire network of people that I know I would not have made it without,” he concluded. “What my family never did is they never let me go. I tried with all my life to disappear, but they never, ever, ever cut the cord. They cut the cord in terms of anything that would further my addiction, but my dad, he literally never stopped. Ultimately, when I was ready to reach up from the bottom of the well and pull myself out, which I had to do, I knew that there was a hand there.”

	Officers responded to an altercation that had escalated into violence on Coliseum Drive just after 9:30 p.m. ET, according to a police report from the Hampton Police Division. The suspect fled, but detectives “identified all parties involved” and determined it “appears to be an isolated incident,” says the report published on Saturday.

	“Members from the Hampton Division of Fire and Rescue responded to the scene and rendered medical assistance,” Cpl. Shaun Stalnaker writes. “The first victim was transported to a local hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries. The second victim was also transported and is currently receiving medical treatment. A third adult male victim later arrived at a local hospital as a walk-in, also suffering from a laceration determined to be non-life-threatening.”

	Phish addressed the tragedy on Saturday in a statement the band posted on social media.


	“During last night's show, a tragic incident took place in the parking lot outside Hampton Coliseum. There was an altercation behind one of the tents in the unofficial vending area in which someone lost their life and two other people were injured. We don't have more information than what has been reported by the police, who called it an isolated incident, but what we do know is upsetting enough. We are deeply saddened by this and our hearts go out to all of those affected,” the band said.

	











	Phish's Saturday and Sunday night concerts in Hampton, which wrap their summer tour, were set to go on as scheduled. Lead singer/guitarist Trey Anastasio's solo band has gigs slated for this fall before Phish takes the stage together again for their traditional run of New Year's Eve shows at New York City's Madison Square Garden, where they've booked a four-show series spanning the dates of Dec. 28-31. 


	The Hampton Police Division's Major Crimes Unit can be contacted with additional information  surrounding Friday night's incident by phone (757–727–6111 or 1–888-LOCK-U-UP), or through anonymous tip via a secure form at P3Tips.com.

	Nolan called the position “one of the greatest honors of my career,” adding, “Our industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild's membership for entrusting me with this responsibility. I also want to thank President Glatter for her leadership over the past four years. I look forward to collaborating with her and the newly elected Board to achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.”

Thankfully someone who is brilliant and merit based.  Their are way to many C students underneath him that are agenda driven. My bet he sees thru them and gets the Dga back on track.

I haven't seen Chris or Ron show up to any of the board meetings in two years

Maybe now the guild will finally grow a spine.

Genuinely surprised this is something Nolan wants.

Why 6 veeps?

	After announcing a Charlie Kirk tribute special to take over Jimmy Kimmel‘s time slot, Sinclair backed out of Friday's planned programming.


	The country's largest ABC affiliate group instead shared a YouTube link to the special after making an example of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in a statement announcing they would be giving the remembrance his late-night slot.


	“Tonight, Sinclair will continue to air ABC network programming as scheduled in the late-night time period,” the company shared in a Friday update on X. “The Charlie Kirk special will instead be available on The National News Desk's YouTube channel, ensuring viewers can continue to enjoy ABC programming while also providing full access to the special online.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The latest comes after Disney‘s announcement that the late-night show will be “preempted indefinitely,” following the FCC‘s warning about Kimmel's Kirk comments.


	In a news release, Sinclair previously announced that they will not lift the suspension on Kimmel's show “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.”

Watch now: https://t.co/2OG7KE9S8Z pic.twitter.com/oRNt3vXnhU


	“Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family. Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA,” the statement continued. “Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return Jimmy Kimmel Live! to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform.”

	











	Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement, “Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country. We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”


	The stunning suspension of Kimmel comes mere minutes after Nexstar also axed his late-night show on the 32 ABC affiliates it owns out of a total of 200 stations throughout the nation.


	“Nexstar's owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show,” said the company in a statement Wednesday. “Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.”


	Known for his ‘Prove Me Wrong' debates and MAGA POV, activist Kirk was shot dead at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10 in a tragedy that has sent shock through the political and media worlds.


	Having previously mocked Trump over POTUS' take on the NFL and TikTok, Kimmel offered his blunt assessment of the aftermath of Kirk's death in his opening monologue on his September 15 show: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” the host said.

Sinclair and Nexstar will not get further retransmission fees from me.

Drop locals, use my antenna, and get whatever from ESPN and Hulu apps for the small % of live broadcasts.

I am done

I was surprised to see them not pre-empt football or even WNBA for the service. I thought all channels were blocking regular programming to cover this.

An affiliate without ABC programming is what?

I would assume that their value is directly attached to the program deals they have…correct?

Let them go their own way…create their own programming…I'd like to see that.

No apologies will *ever* happen and Sinclair and Nexstar will be paying Kimmel millions, as will Disney and the FCC.

Oh, they are folding…

	Although Eugene Levy has been keeping busy abroad as The Reluctant Traveler, he's always ready to revisit Schitt's Creek.


	Despite his son and co-creator/co-star Dan Levy previously revealing he has a “kernel of an idea” for a new iteration of their beloved Canadian sitcom, the Golden Globe-nominated father apparently has yet to hear it.


	“If he said he had a kernel of an idea for a reboot, he didn't lay it on me. I don't know what he necessarily comes up with, I don't have Instagram,” he quipped on Today‘s ‘Girl Code‘.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Listen, we've always said we would love—obviously, we love this group, we love the cast, we love the show, and we would love to get together and do something,” added Eugene. “It's just, no idea has come up. Nobody has come up with the idea yet. And whatever it is, it has to start kind of on the level where we left off. Otherwise, there's no point.”

	











	Commenting on the potential of a Schitt's Creek movie, Eugene said, “Wow, that's a good prediction. I kind of like that. That gets me excited. Never say never.”


	With fans clamoring for a Schitt's Creek revival ever since its six-season run ended in 2020, Dan teased his “kernel of an idea” for the reboot on Watch What Happens Live in July.


	“I think about it all the time,” said Dan, adding, “I love the show so much, and I don't want to disappoint the show and I don't want to disappoint the fans. And I know it's easy to just take a check and put something out there, but I care about it too much. I'm just waiting for that idea to be the right one. And then maybe, yeah.”


	Following the show's 2020 finale, the show earned Eugene and Dan an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, as well as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Eugene and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Dan, who also won in the writing and directing categories for the final season.

Troy Kotsur is hoping the mobster role he plays on Netflix‘s Black Rabbit will open further doors for deaf performers in Hollywood.


	The In Cold Light star, who made history as the first male deaf actor to win an Oscar for his supporting role in CODA, portrays Joe Mancuso, the head of the criminal underworld. In the crime-thriller miniseries from Netflix, Jude Law's rising restauranteur is thrust into New York City's dark underbelly when his ne'er do well brother (Jason Bateman) returns with loan sharks on his tail.


	“I'm sure folks in the audience have really never seen a mobster who happens to be deaf. It was really fun and exciting for me to create this character,” Kotsur told People in a recent interview.

	He added, “It was really fun for me to develop this character, a fresh take and a new perspective. It will open up new roles in the future, I hope. We're not just actors who use sign language, we're characters and we can play all different types of characters.”


Black Rabbit, which had its premiere at TIFF, was created by Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, with a logline describing the project as a “propulsive thrill ride and character examination about the way an unbreakable bond between two brothers can shatter their world and everything in its orbit.”


	Also starring in the series, currently streaming on Netflix, is Cleopatra Coleman, Amaka Okafor, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, Troy Kotsur, Abbey Lee, Chris Coy, Dagmara Dominczyk, Odessa Young and Robin De Jesus, with Amir Malaklou, Don Harvey, Forrest Weber, Francis Benhamou, Gus Birney, John Ales and Steve Witting.

	One of Hollywood's most provocative young voices of the '80s and '90s, Gregg Araki remains optimistic for a new generation of filmmakers.


	Ahead of his appearance at Friday's Academy Museum screening of Mysterious Skin (2004), the ‘New Queer Cinema' alum mused on how there are “very few really interesting voices” being platformed in Hollywood as he spoke with Deadline about the struggles facing young creatives in the film industry.


	“Rick Linklater and I talk about this, 'cause we're like the grandpas of Sundance at this point, and It's so much easier now to make a movie than it used to be,” explained Araki. “But because back in the days, when we were doing Slacker and Living End or [Totally] Fucked Up or whatever then, like on 16 millimeter, it's super hard to shoot. It's just very cumbersome and very difficult, but now with the new technology, iPhones and computers and all these tiny little cameras that shoot 6K, all this technology is so incredible now.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Noting his amazement with Resillion's “incredible” editing capabilities, which he used with his Mysterious Skin 4K restoration, Araki put the software to use on his upcoming film I Want Your Sex.


	“The technology is so advanced and so easy to make a movie now, but there's very few really interesting voices that are using that technology, you know what I mean?” he added. “And it's sort of—I don't wanna say harder to be an artist now, but I do think I feel very fortunate to be the generation I was because I was kind of there when punk rock music came out, when indie film happened.”

	











	Araki continued, “I feel like, to be original, to have a voice, and to be unique in this world, where there's so much content and so many filmmakers, and YouTube and TikTok have so much fucking stuff being created, it's so hard to… cut through the noise and just have a unique voice or be an artist, besides the fact that the world is fucking falling apart. I am always hopeful or optimistic for young artists in their 20s, just doing it and figuring out a way to do it, 'cause I don't think it's the same as it was when when we were doing it.”


	With the cult longevity of his early films like The Living End (1992) and ‘The Teen Apocalypse Trilogy' (1993-'97) putting a new generation of cinephiles in a chokehold, Araki explained the themes of nihilism in his movies are so timeless and “why my fans are so great.”


	“They've been so loyal and dedicated. There's not a lot out there very unique to this day, Doom Generations aren't getting made every day. These movies, they're still so fresh and topical, and they are different than everything else, which I think is a good thing,” he explained. “But it's also why there's a unique and kind of culty—almost like a litmus test of people that love whatever movie it is, Doom Generation, Nowhere, Mysterious Skin, whatever it is.


	“It's like they speak to a very specific sensibility, cause I've had people say, ‘Oh yeah, I've met my partner because they were a fan.' You're like a kindred spirit, it's like you get me 'cause you get this movie, and I think that that's so amazing and cool. And it really means a lot to me that the movies resonate with people in that way,” said Araki.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


	Tackling the thorny Jimmy Kimmel situation, the head of the National Association of Broadcasters said “government pressure on media” also happened during the Obama and Biden administrations.


	Weighing in after Kimmel's suspension in a blog post that did not mention ABC, Disney or President Trump by name, NAB CEO Curtis LeGeyt called this “an unprecedented time in media history” requiring “a direct conversation about what's at stake.” 


	Kimmel's show was suspended indefinitely by ABC after major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair removed it, citing jokes by the late-night host about the reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. The removal of the show followed open threats to Disney by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Talks are ongoing among stakeholders to seek a resolution to the impasse, with indications in recent days that a path for the show to return was more likely than it being dropped for good.

	LeGeyt affirmed the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, who “must be able to make decisions about the content on our airwaves free from government influence.” Even the perception that broadcasters are being affected by government pressure “is a problem for our credibility and the trust we have built with our audiences.”


	At the same time, LeGeyt notes that government pressure on media “to cover events in a particular way is not new and it has come from both political parties. During the Obama administration, journalists decried the use of the Espionage Act to investigate reporters and demand their confidential sources. Under the Biden administration, reporters faced growing barriers to access, and local affiliate stations were targeted based on the actions of cable news networks. Today, we continue to see veiled threats suggesting broadcasters should be penalized for airing content that is contrary to a particular point of view.


	“These attempts were wrong then, and they are wrong now.”


	The NAB is the main lobbying organization for TV and radio broadcasters.

	











	The Washington-based group, whose power has ebbed amid cord-cutting and the shift to streaming, has been in an awkward position for decades when it comes to the FCC and its members. That tension came into striking view in recent months, as Deadline's Ted Johnson has reported. 


	The organization ran social media ads praising FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for helping “empower our members” by fighting to loosen regulations limiting the business activities of broadcasters. The praise for him came as Carr had launched investigations or inquiries into broadcast networks, some of their owned stations and other outlets, including members of NAB. Those probes were sparked by issues ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion practices to newsroom decision-making.


	Along with the “the obvious constitutional issues” raised by the Kimmel situation, LeGeyt continued in the blog post, there is the difficult state of financial affairs for the industry. “Broadcasters are already fighting for our future, facing extraordinary disruption in the media ecosystem from Big Tech,” he wrote. “If the very act of owning or transferring a broadcast license carries the risk of political interference, it will drive investment further away from local stations at the very moment we need more resources to sustain local journalism.”


	The NAB's efforts to back its members as they face myriad business challenges, the exec concluded, will be “futile if we cannot fulfill our most sacred responsibility: reporting to our communities without fear of government retribution.”

Demanding to give up a source for national security vs trampling free speech bc they're critical of the administration is the not the same thing, Curtis.

When broadcasters were pressured by Democrats, they hired lawyers.  When pressured by Trump, they give in without so much as a fight.

Oh yeah this is all totally normal, nothing to see here, move along.

Holy cow. An organization made up of groups that want mergers and bent the knee, once again, bent the knee.

BULL.  SHIT.

These are NOT the same times as Obama/ Biden and trying to equate the two is fraking wild.

Pot. Meet Kettle.

Did you read anything besides the headline?

I agree with you because these are not those types of times; we are fighting for freedom, rights, and freedom to speak, and they can say what they want. Still, when it comes to someone else saying what they want, we have a problem. I feel this country is turning into Russia. China will no longer be a democratic country; we are now a dictatorship because certain people can do what they want to. Still, people is not realizing this is affecting everybody the rich the poor it doesn't matter what color you are what status you are this affects us all when our rights of being striking this is not about one people this is about all people so when are we going to step up to the plate and your night together because we put these people in office to work for the American people not one person. They are up there working for one person, not the American people, so when will everybody take their blindfolds off, unless you're not together?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Christopher Nolan elected president of the Directors Guild","https://www.avclub.com/christopher-nolan-elected-president-of-the-directors-guild","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 04:14:00 GMT","

Calling the election “one of the greatest honors of my career,” Christopher Nolan was named the new president of the Directors Guild Of America on Saturday night. The Oppenheimer director takes over the position from Lesli Linka Glatter, a prolific TV director whose credits range from Amazing Stories up through a recent installment of The Morning Show.

Nolan, meanwhile, is, well, Christopher Nolan: The rare director to come to international name recognition pretty much solely through his work in the 21st century, balancing artistic instincts with a rock-solid sense for commercial success. As Warner Bros. learned to its ongoing irritation (and loss of delicious Oscar wins) after they ticked him off with how they handled distribution of Tenet a few years back, he's also one of the most serious advocates for the continuing primacy of the movie theater experience currently working, pushing back at every turn at the slide toward streaming supremacy.

In addition to Nolan, the DGA—which represents the vast majority of Hollywood directors, or at least those who want to make movies with the major studios who are contractually bound to hire guild talent—swapped out its whole slate of officers at its convention this weekend. That includes (per Deadline) an incoming slate that included the usual mix of well-known names and less immediately recognizable ones: Laura Belsey as National Vice President, Paris Barclay re-elected as Secretary-Treasurer, Todd Holland as First Vice-President, Ron Howard as Second Vice-President, Gina Prince-Bythewood as Third Vice-President, Seith Mann as Fourth Vice-President, Millicent Shelton as Fifth Vice-President, Lily Olszewski as Sixth Vice-President and Joyce Thomas as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer.

Unlike its colleagues in the acting and writing guilds, the DGA—which boasts a membership of 19,500 film and TV creators—got through its 2023 round of contract negotiations with the studios without going on strike. Wins in that last contract included guarantees that directors wouldn't be replaced with generative AI, and increased shares of streaming residuals for members. In his address to the convention, Nolan told delegates that he looked forward with collaborating with his newly elected Board to achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.”

Lindsay Arnold is speaking out following critical comments fans made about the premiere of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34. The former dance pro fiercely defended her “DWTS” family.

Let's be better you guys 🫶🏻 if you absolutely HAVE to throw shade come throw it at me I can handle it 😉 #dwts #dwtshottake #spreadlove #bekind #letsbenicepeople 

In a video Arnold shared on TikTok on September 18, she explained just what goes in to making the show, urging fans to rethink their criticisms.

“Here's my hot take on ‘Dancing With the Stars' premiere night … y'all are mean. The amount of videos I've seen starting like that and then they continue to just go on literally trashing the pros, the troupe, the hosts, the judges … I've seen it all,” Arnold said in the video.

“And it's making me sick,” she noted. “Like I literally feel sick to my stomach. You understand that these are real people, right?”

Arnold continued, “This isn't some made-up TV show, and they're all playing their characters.”

Referencing the show “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” the former “DWTS” dance pro explained, “This is not Conrad, Belly and Jeremiah, where we can just comment on their decisions and their choices and their lives like they're just not real people.”

She added, “These are real people, who are doing a job that literally none of you could do.”

Arnold competed on 10 seasons of “Dancing With the Stars,” winning season 25 with her partner, Jordan Fisher.

She also noted that she “would go to bat for” her sister Rylee, who is partnered with Scott Hoying on  the show, “'til the day I die.”

The dancer added, “I care about all those people. That's my family, that's my friends. I'm coming here to say that the job of being a pro is one of the hardest ever.”

Arnold noted that, while “it's okay to have opinions,” fans should stop “bashing and trashing.” She reminded them, “Be better.”

“Please don't make me do another video like this defending all of my friends,” she added, asking fans to “spread a little bit more positivity” about “Dancing With the Stars.”

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

During a September 3 interview with People, Rylee revealed that Lindsay gave her a critical tip for success.

“The best piece of advice that I've ever received from Lindsay, and honestly, the best piece of advice I've ever been given, is to always just remain true to yourself,” the dancer shared. “Always just be yourself, authentically you, because if people don't like you for you, then you're not where you need to be.”

Rylee shared, “Just be yourself and that's going to be where you're going to be the happiest version of yourself, so always just emulate that and be that.”

She added, “It got me through everything. I love her.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Steve Martin Cancels Comedy Shows Due to Illness","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/steve-martin-show-cancelled-illness/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 14:19:53 GMT","

Steve Martin was forced to cancel his September 19 and September 20 comedy shows, during which he was slated to perform with his “Only Murders in the Building” costar Martin Short, after contracting COVID-19. The 80-year-old took to his Instagram to write, “Dear Virginia Beach and Richmond. Sadly, I have come down with Covid. I can't possibly do the shows that you deserve. So Marty and I must cancel tonight & tomorrow.” He added the pair plans to continue the tour “under better circumstances.”

Martin chose a funny picture of a dog wearing a Mickey Mouse ears hat from Disneyland to break the disappointing news.

A post shared by Steve Martin (@stevemartinreally)

Later, the “Roxanne” star posted a second photo that showed a positive COVID-19 test. He joked, “Hey! No flu!”

A post shared by Steve Martin (@stevemartinreally)

Martin's followers flooded his Instagram comments with sweet messages of support after he announced the cancelled shows. One wrote, “Get well soon. Snuggle that dog.”

Another commented, “Sending love that you get better soon!”

“Oh my, Steve Martin! Please take care of yourself! We have plenty of old videos of you to keep us laughing until you are better. Be well,” wrote another admirer.

Martin's next show on the tour is scheduled for October 4 in Florida, according to Stubhub.

During a GMA appearance by Martin and his costar Steve Short at the beginning of the month, Selena Gomez popped onto the screen to ask her costar the question, “How do you put up with Martin?” The comedian hilariously replied, “You know, Martin and I do shows together. And what I do is, I do an early blue tape and red tape. I put the blue tape on the floor from my dressing room to the stage, and then I do a different route for Martin in red. So we never actually run into each other.”

Short jumped into add, “We're like an old married couple. We have dinner in total silence.”

Martin then said he prefers to call his relationship with his costar a “funship” rather than a friendship. 

Season 5 of Martin, Short, and Gomez's comedy mystery series “Only Murders in the Building” premiered on Hulu September 9, and Short opened up about what makes the new season great. He said, “What amazes me about season 5 is the quality that the writers are creating from season to season.” Martin agreed, “You can do comedy, but you've gotta have that story in there.” Short also praised the show's lineup of guest stars.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","John Cena Hits the Jackpot With New HGTV Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/john-cena-new-hgtv-show-bobby-berk/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 14:19:53 GMT","

John Cena has a lot on his plate — and in his home. The actor, entrepreneur, and 17-time world champion wrestler will soon also add “HGTV executive producer” to his list of titles when a series inspired by his own belongings debuts on the network in late 2025. 

“Queer Eye” alum Bobby Berk, the host Cena hand-picked for “Junk or Jackpot,” told Us Weekly in an article published on September 20, 2025, that Cena came up with the show's premise. 

“It was through the mind of the genius John Cena,” he told the outlet. “He was out at dinner one night talking with friends about these crazy collections of wrestling memorabilia.”

It's not clear if Cena's wrestling memorabilia wound up fetching a pretty penny, but his curiosity about its worth sparked the idea for “Junk or Jackpot.”

Berk explained, “‘He's like, ‘I need to develop this.' So he did and he asked me to host it. It's been a lot of fun. He is the hardest-working man in Hollywood.”

Berk made his HGTV debut during the latest edition of “Rock the Block,” serving as judge of the first episode. He'll officially join the HGTV family with his first-ever show on the network later this year. 

“Junk or Jackpot” is comprised of six episodes in which Berk helps homeowners decide whether to keep their collectibles — from superhero figurines to rare puppets and dolls — or sell them to make money for home renovations. 

Berk told Us Weekly he had no idea how much people's home collections could make, but loves showcasing their jackpots. 

“I'm always shocked at what these things are worth because I'm not a collector,” he admitted. “I'm a minimalist. I don't do things that much. So to find some comics books that are worth $60,000 that were just sitting up on a shelf blew me away.” 

A post shared by Bobby Berk (@bobby)

“Junk or Jackpot” began filming in late July, with an expected premiere later in 2025. Berk told Us Weekly that, on a deeper level, the show is about more than design or making money from junk in one's house — and it can get emotional. 

“People have these amazing collections that they've collected over the years but they have taken over their lives,” he explained. “It is either causing problems with their personal relationships or just their relationship with themselves.

“I'm excited for people to see the connection between stuff and emotion and how to really work through that in a healthy way.”

Cena posted on social media about the show in July, sharing, “What we collect is a reflection of who we are and what we love. Grateful to HGTV and Bobby for making this project come to life!”

It looks like Daniel Romalotti has finally found love again, one year after Heather Stevens' passing. “The Young and the Restless” star Michael Graziadei recently opened up about his character's growing feelings for Tessa Porter.

In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Graziadei declared that “Daniel really, really likes Tessa.” The actor revealed it all began innocently, with Tessa helping Daniel cope with Heather's death. But over time, those feelings started to grow.

“He was dealing with everything that had happened with Heather, and just found this person to confide in,” Graziadei said in part. “And from that, he eventually realized that this was more than just someone he liked spending a little time talking with about whatever he was having.”

Graziadei added that he believes Daniel is finally ready for a new relationship, given that it's been a year since Heather passed away. However, it is easier said than done, especially with Tessa's current situation.

In the same interview, “The Young and the Restless” actor revealed what's preventing Daniel from acting on his feelings for Tessa.

“To be honest, I actually have really appreciated the way that this story has been told, and this connection has come about because of the fact that she's a married woman,” he explained.

Still, Graziadei is optimistic that Daniel and Tessa could have a future together as a couple.

“I don't know how much I can say,” the actor teased. “But what I can say is it feels like, with the connection that these two people are having, that the audience is going to be rooting for them to get together.”

As for his co-star, Cait Fairbanks (Tessa), Graziadei had nothing but praise. “The Young and the Restless” star gushed about the actress, calling her “fantastic.”

“I think she's a great actor, and she's just lovely to be around on set,” he added. “She's always down to explore the scenes, and she's always prepared. It's important when you work with someone, you want to show up to work and be excited to work with them, you know? And I do. I get that with her. I just have a lot of fun with her on set.”

Watch “The Young and the Restless” weekdays on CBS.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Grateful' Kerry Washington Speaks Up in Defense of Jimmy Kimmel","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kerry-washington-stands-with-jimmy-kimmel/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 02:22:22 GMT","

Kerry Washington is proving once again that loyalty never goes out of style. The “Scandal” star hit Instagram to defend her longtime friend Jimmy Kimmel, and let's just say, she didn't hold back. Washington, who's no stranger to standing in her power both on-screen and off, reminded everyone why she's one of the most respected voices in Hollywood. This wasn't just a casual “thinking of you” note; it was a full-on statement about friendship, fairness, and freedom.

A post shared by Kerry Washington (@kerrywashington)

Washington's message started out as a personal thank-you to Kimmel for always having her back. She wrote: “@jimmykimmel, you've supported me, my work, and my voice for years, and I'm endlessly grateful for your friendship, partnership, the laughter, and encouragement. Now it's my turn to stand with and for you. Your immense kindness, integrity and generosity inspire everyone around you. What's happening to you, and across late night is not just unfair, it's unjust.”

That right there is why fans love Kerry. She doesn't just say she's grateful… she shows it. And in this case, she's reminding everyone that Kimmel isn't just a comedian behind a desk. He's someone who has supported his peers and lifted others up for years. Her words made it clear: when the tables turn, she's not leaving him to fight alone.

Washington didn't stop with Jimmy. She also called out the bigger picture, saying: “Silencing voices like yours and @stephenathome goes far beyond just entertainment; it threatens freedom of speech, an independent press, and ultimately, our democracy. You are not alone. I stand with you, my friend. Always.”

Yep, she name-dropped Stephen Colbert too, showing this isn't just about one late-night host. It's about the idea that shutting down these platforms is bigger than scheduling changes or contracts; it hits at the heart of what these shows represent. Washington connected the dots in a way that fans were quick to pick up on. And let's be real: when that kind of energy comes into play, people listen.

Her comments section? Packed with support. Fans flooded her post with clapping emojis and hearts. One said, “The people who don't are clueless to the biggest picture. Appreciate all who are standing up.” Another added, “We love Jimmy he'll be alright.” Someone else summed it up perfectly with: “It's giving Olivia Pope is coming to handle the situation I love this.”

And honestly, they're not wrong. Kerry's words carried the same kind of power and clarity that made her famous on “Scandal.” But this wasn't fiction… this was her showing up as a friend and as someone who cares about the bigger picture.

Washington's post was more than just a defense of Kimmel. It was a reminder that voices like his (and Colbert's) matter. And with Kerry Washington stepping into the spotlight to defend them, it seems like fans are more ready than ever to rally around the cause.

Scott Derrickson has made millions on the unnerving emptiness between fragments of film grain. The horror films the director has made with screenwriter C. Robert Cargill — “Sinister” and “The Black Phone” in particular — have used the aesthetics of Super 8 film to create a suggestive aura of supernatural menace. “The Black Phone 2” is no exception, with grain so dense in certain sequences that the actors are reduced to ghostly silhouettes. It's an effective technique, which is probably why Derrickson keeps using it. 

 










The Super 8 (and modified Super 16) sequences in “The Black Phone 2” provide the film with its most horrific imagery: fragmented shots of red feathers littering the snow around a child's abandoned parka and thick, viscous blood oozing from a tree stump in the frozen woods. These are all echoes — some prophetic, others from the past — that recur in the dreams experienced by Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), younger sister of Finney (Mason Thames), the siblings that were also at the center of the original “The Black Phone.”

Finney triumphed at the end of that film, dispatching child-snatching serial killer the Grabber (Ethan Hawke) with help from the ghosts of his previous victims and one of Gwen's psychic visions. But that doesn't matter in a horror movie, particularly a supernatural one. And so the Grabber is back, calling from beyond the grave to threaten Finney with not only his own demise, but that of his little sister as well. Hawke returns too, grumbling and growling behind a rubber mask (and, eventually, some grisly prosthetics). And thank goodness, because there are some thick blocks of dialogue to get through here, and only an actor of Hawke's caliber could make them work. 

Part of the charm of the “Black Phone” movies is that their threat is anachronistic. The number of pay phones in the United States has fallen sharply since the mobile revolution, making it next to impossible for a disembodied malevolent spirit to terrorize any misfit kids through phone booths today. “The Black Phone 2” takes place in 1981, a fact that's nearly impossible to forget with the repeated, winking era-specific references and lines about a character being “deader than disco.” 

The plot of both films also depends on their teenage characters being relatively unsupervised, an equally anachronistic touch that “The Black Phone 2” shares with its most obvious inspiration: the “A Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. Specifically, Gwen takes on a leading role in this film that's very similar to Patricia Arquette's character in “A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,” but with the staff of a snowed-in Christian summer camp at her back rather than the patients at a youth psychiatric hospital. 

 










These include Ernesto (Miguel Mora), the younger brother of a character from the previous film (also played by Mora) and Gwen's innocent puppy-love suitor; camp supervisor Armando (Demián Bichir), who provides a living link to macabre events that occurred there decades earlier; and Mercedes (Arianna Rivas), Armando's equestrian niece. Attempts to add a bit of Latinx flair to the dialogue largely fizzle. But, like Hawke, Bichir does a heroic job carrying the burden of explaining the film's lore — an essential function in a backstory-heavy effort like this one. 

Most of the flaws in “The Black Phone 2” can be traced back to its screenplay, from some of the more cringeworthy dialogue to the unwieldy chunks of exposition and a thematic thread that affirms the existence of Heaven and Hell, and, therefore, the validity of Christian belief. This is not an unusual message for a horror film — the entire possession subgenre is built on Catholic dogma, as is the “Conjuring” series. What makes it worthy of critique here is the inconsistent way in which it's applied, setting up a more thoughtful take on the hypocrisy of organized religion only to abandon it when it's time to send the Grabber back to Hell. 

Derrickson acquits himself more admirably, adding blood-soaked flair not only to the film's analog sequences but also the digital ones. A scene where Gwen is terrified by the appearance of three boys who were murdered on the campgrounds back in 1957 is a masterclass in creative gore effects, slicing one boy's head in half diagonally on a windowpane, watching it slither to the ground, and leaving it to sputter and twitch as blood pools around what's left of his face. The film also builds on a famous effect from “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” spinning bodies and flinging them around like marionettes whose puppeteer is having a seizure as the characters battle the invisible foe in Gwen's dreams. 

 










Still, a complaint that's also common to contemporary horror films nags at “The Black Phone 2,” in that all of the best things about this movie come from other movies, whether they be the creative team's previous efforts or iconic titles from decades past. (It's not just “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” either; the majority of the action takes place as the characters are snowed in at an isolated location, making comparisons to “The Shining” equally inescapable.) These elements are enjoyable, which is precisely why they're recycled here. And maybe that's good enough for a horror sequel. But good enough will never be more than just that. 

“The Black Phone 2” premiered at Fantastic Fest 2025. Universal Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, October 17.

God had gifted saints with less talent than Jim Carroll. By 28, he'd started and ended a vicious heroin habit, developed a reputation as a New York City sports prodigy, written a Pulitzer Prize-nominated collection of poems, and published 1978's The Basketball Diaries, a best-selling chronicle of addiction and youthful hedonism from ages 12-15 and an early exemplar of autofiction. The 1995 film adaptation would star Leonardo DiCaprio. Some people become cool; some people, like Jim Carroll, are born with it, a burdensome inheritance. Everybody wants a piece.

Where do you go after you've become the king of Downtown? In 1973, fractures were forming in his social milieu: the Beats, like his friend Ted Berrigan, who'd hung on through the speed-fueled '60s, poets in varying states of sobriety, rock musicians like his erstwhile roommate and ex-girlfriend Patti Smith, and a crowd in Warhol's orbit who “were all into being self-destructive themselves.” He'd grown weary of the incestuous poetry crowd, who all wrote for one another. He was too young to be a legend and too experienced to pick up a new bad habit. He was in search of something more potent than an earthly high—or at least without the jail time or the comedown.

In recovery on and off by 18, he'd already lived innumerable lives. Jack Kerouac was dead, but before he kicked the bucket, he read an excerpt of Carroll's work in The Paris Review and declared that “at 13 years of age, Jim Carroll writes better prose than 89 percent of the novelists working today.” He'd also said in On the Road that the only people for him were “the mad ones” who “burned like fabulous yellow roman candles.” Carroll wasn't ready for such an explosive expiration. Madness had ravaged his youth and fed on his friends.

Before rock ‘n' roll, before his reinvention as a punk poet, the first new frontier was rehab. He tried a New York City methadone clinic, hated it, then at 24, he quit for California at the behest of his friend, the poet Anne Waldman.

The Bay Area was a tabula rasa without layers of memories. He got one dog, then three. He ran his pack down the beach in Bolinas, a hippie hamlet full of surfers in the shadow of Mt. Tamalpais.

“A dog is kinda the biggest reason I got off methadone,” Carroll said in 1981. “If I was crying from when I was in pain from kicking it, the dog was so conscious of it. He'd just come up and start licking me.”

Clear-eyed for the first time in a decade, he fell in love and got married. His new wife, a law school student at Stanford, took him to New Wave shows in San Francisco, and divine inspiration struck again.

“People had encouraged me to do rock ‘n' roll for a long time,” he said upon the release of Catholic Boy in 1981, a vast understatement. New York City seemed insistent that Jim Carroll have a career in music, even if he was not. He “had never listened to much rock after the Velvet Underground split,” he said in an NME article from the time, but he was impelled into collaboration by pals like Patti Smith and Blue Öyster Cult's Allan Lanier. Lanier needed lyrics. Smith convinced him to open for her with her backing band, even though he missed a show after a drug bust landed him in jail overnight. When she worked at Scribner's books on 5th Avenue, she saved him from an overdose, walking him around until he came to.

Compared to the readings he'd done all over the city, performing onstage felt vital and raw, a way to connect with people outside the incestuous, erudite New York poets' circle. “I didn't like the negativity of punk,” he said, “but at least I saw how I could get past my technical limitations, because you didn't have to sing well. And after publishing poems all those years and having a very esoteric audience, the prospect of this other audience seemed nice.”

It was in Bolinas, on the beach with the dogs, that he'd become the frontman of his own band. There, he met some members of a local group called Amsterdam, and convinced them to soundtrack one of his readings. Soon after, the new Jim Carroll Band were polishing material at Bay Area clubs until they finally won over the scene's youths. This was by design: “I wanted kids to like it,” Carroll said, “kids into heavy rock and hot guitars.” Doors opened quickly for Carroll, as they tended to do. On a trip to New York in 1979, he inked a deal with famed music mogul Earl McGrath at a party.

If Catholic Boy is for the kids, it's a specific subset of them: precocious, kinetic, and traumatized. The breakneck pace of punk rock is perfect for outrunning what haunts you. A louche hybrid of New York Dolls-style glam rock and '80s gloss, the album is an emblem of the national transition from downtown punk squats to cocaine penthouses and Reagonomics. It's a bridge between the Ramones and the Cars, a yarn that ties together two decades and two cities.

On the LP's cover, he is a prototypical Leo, mugging like Mick Jagger, red hair lank around his temples. He smirks between two pale cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass. Wedged between his normie parents, two relics of a bygone era, the Annie Leibovitz photopainting only adds to the mythology, reaffirming Carroll's legacy as a man who stood out even in a room full of stars.

Men and women alike chased Jim Carroll, undeterred by his age or his addiction. Freshly married in California, he admitted to a reporter that “a lot of women throw themselves at you. Although a lot of the groupies that come to me are girls that don't want to screw me, they want me to read their master's thesis.” This wasn't new, nor was it exclusive to this period of his life. The academics might have been high-minded, but the earlier hordes were not. In his autofiction, basketball scout Benny Greenbaum propositions and touches him repeatedly during the National High School All Star Basketball Game. His old lady “lover” in a later chapter is the “friend of the mother of an old girl friend of mine,” around 40 to his 14.

Whether or not these anecdotes are strictly true, The Basketball Diaries is filled with enough instances of benign and not-so-benign neglect that Carroll gets himself into harrowing scrapes, often at the hands of people who seem to want some of his shine. The son of an Irish-Catholic barman, Carroll was roaming Manhattan unsupervised by his preteens, defending himself mostly unsuccessfully against sexual predators, neighborhood toughs, and an array of accessible drugs. He turned tricks for drug money before he could legally drive a car. He describes slugging beer at age 12 with the impassivity of a Sally Mann photograph.

Jim Carroll lived mostly between the opposite poles of slumped, strung-out oblivion and the divinity of a morning stroll on Bolinas beach. Locating Catholic Boy somewhere on this spectrum is difficult—it's mostly major key bombast, not quite resigned but also deeply blasé. Between the cock-rock bravado, he recites a list of dead children on “People Who Died” as if he's reading a grocery list. Like a screen separates the confessor from the priest, so the shredding guitars distance Carroll from G-berg and George, whose “gimmicks got rotten/So they died of hepatitis in Upper Manhattan.” Carnage or otherwise, this is the song whose legacy has transcended a record that's mostly faded into the annals of rock history. Its driving power chords, evocative of Plastic Bertrand's “Ça Plane Pour Moi,” open Steven Spielberg's E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, and more recently, it played in The Suicide Squad's opening credits.

Bluntly: he could not sing. Mostly, it didn't matter. There's a disconnect between the instrumentation across the album and Carroll's Sprechgesang, a mix of Jagger's “Shattered” affectation and a less-melodic Bob Dylan circa “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” Occasionally, it feels like Carroll is rhythmically out of step with the former Amsterdamians who are plowing through the bars behind him. There is enough personality on opener “Wicked Gravity” to make up for this demerit, but by “Three Sisters,” Carroll sounds like a washed-out Lou Reed.

“Crow” and “Catholic Boy” are the record's best songs, not just sonically but because they come closest to touching the bruise. They are the album's most painterly and evocative tracks, with the closest kinship to Carroll's written poems. The former, a tribute to Patti Smith, describes her bringing donuts to the junkies, covering Carroll with blankets at the Chelsea Hotel. “Catholic Boy” paints a Hieronymus Bosch-version of religion, bloody and suffused with angels. “I made allies in heaven/I made comrades in hell,” he sings, later declaring “I was a Catholic boy/Redeemed through pain/Not through joy.”

How badly do you need to hurt to be a martyr? The principle he fought for was telling the stories of those comrades he made in hell, people whose lives came and went without much fanfare: the users, the alcoholics, the urban poor. St. Lucy famously gouged out her own eyes, and maybe Jim Carroll would've, too, if he'd known it was an option. “Poets and writers in general have a vested interest in a decaying world, because everyone looks to poets to clarify the chaos,” he told Creem Magazine's Mark Norton in 1981. People were beginning to see the corrosion eating away at a certain version of America. The Vietnam War had manufactured platoons full of junkies, but you didn't need to travel that far to find people looking for an exit. They'd been on Avenue C the whole time.

When he died in New York City in 2009, it was in the same Inwood building where he'd spent some of the Basketball Diaries years. The prodigal son had returned. He lived alone after a brief marriage and an amicable divorce. He'd turned inward and chipped away at an unfinished novel, growing a beard that reached his shirt collar. In look and manner, he was less CBGB's than wizened sage—an ailing mystic who'd gone to the mountaintop and back.

Jim Carroll was not, perhaps, a prodigy at everything—his luck or talent had to run out somewhere, sometime. But Catholic Boy is a meaningful entry into the pantheon of art that reckons with addiction, a chronicle of New York City's basement-dwelling class, and an archive of a life so potent, so full of pain and kismet, it seemed almost biblical. It deserves its spot in the city's apocrypha. Saints and martyrs have certainly been made from less.

Bad Bunny said goodbye to the No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency at El Choli with a bang. On Saturday night, for his “Una Más” show, which was livestreamed by Amazon Music, the Puerto Rican icon brought out a slew of guests, including salsa legend Marc Anthony, RaiNao, Dei V, Ñengo Flow, Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Jowell & Randy.


	“I have always had the same passion, love for what I'm doing. I promise I will never change. I love you, Puerto Rico. I love you, mom and dad,” Bad Bunny said during an emotional speech at the end of the show, later adding, “It doesn't matter what your issue or problem is, love will always be the solution.” 


	Bad Bunny had Chuwi join him for their collab “Welita,” which they've performed each night of the residency. Then, one of the first surprises of the evening came when Puerto Rican rising star RaiNao dropped by for “Perfumito Nuevo;” newcomer Dei V also made it out to help with his verse on “Veldá.”

	When it was time to perform massive perreo hits like “Safaera,” Benito brought out the reggaeton OGs: veterans Ñengo Flow and Jowell & Randy hit the stage to sing the track from on top of his La Casita B-stage. Jowell & Randy then took over the set to play a medley of their biggest hits, including “El Funeral de la Canoa,” “Hey Mister,” and “Salgo Pa la Calle.”

	 Arcángel and De La Ghetto jumped in at the end of the set to exchange rap verses for “Acho PR” from Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana. Ñengo Flow made a poignant gesture by wearing a jersey with the number 4,645 on it, honoring the death toll from Hurricane Maria.

	For the grand finale, Anthony sidled up next to Bad Bunny and showed off his power vocals for a heartfelt rendition of “Preciosa.” The song, originally written by composer Rafael Hernández Marín in 1937, is a love letter to Puerto Rico that ends with the line “Yo te quiero, Puerto Rico.” (“I love you, Puerto Rico.”) Though it's been reinterpreted by many artists over the decades, Anthony's rendition is among the best known — and he gave it his all while Bad Bunny belted the lyrics with him.

	After Anthony's appearance, Bad Bunny stayed onstage and closed out the show with the emotional “DtMF” and the swaggering “LA MuDANZA.” The latter song turned into an extended mix, where he used the opportunity to introduce the band and everyone who attended the performance.

	Saturday night's show was livestreamed globally on Amazon Music and the streaming service's Twitch channel worldwide. The performance will also be available to replay for 24 hours after the initial live broadcast.


	Along with livestreaming the show, Amazon and Bad Bunny's Good Bunny Foundation reached a multi-year agreement to aid the island by investing in initiatives related to education, technology, food delivery, agriculture support, and economic development.


	“Benito embodies the spirit of Puerto Rico, and together we're creating a celebration that transforms his passion for the island into real impact for its people,” said Rocío Guerrero, an Amazon Music executive, in a press release. “By combining music, Amazon technologies, commerce, and community programs at scale, we're engaging global audiences to this historic moment while strengthening Puerto Rican communities.”


	Last Sunday, Bad Bunny hosted what many thought to be the final show of the residency. However, the following morning, Bad Bunny revealed he'd play one final show on Sept. 20.

	Two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa this month on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft. 


	One of the jets was later identified in a lawsuit in U.S. federal court as carrying 14 Nigerian and Gambian nationals to a prison camp in Ghana. They have since been returned to their countries of origin, Ghana said, despite all having credible fears of persecution or torture. The other jet secretly landed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali, according to communications from the flight deck obtained by Rolling Stone. Representatives for the governments of these countries did not respond to emails asking if this jet also included third-country nationals.


	The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by President Donald Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

	











	“The administration is using military secrecy to cover for what is basically a law enforcement/immigration enforcement function,” an activist flight tracker who goes by JJ in DC told Rolling Stone. “If this is being done in our interest, we have a right to know where these deportation flights are going.” 


	While it is legal for military aircraft to turn off their transponders, this is generally reserved for combat and surveillance missions, JJ in DC, who is a military veteran, said. Military flights also cost much more to operate than charter carriers, as much as $28,500 an hour, according to Reuters. 

	











	The Air Force and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide a statement prior to publication. This story will be updated if any of them do.


	Both secret trips were on Air Force C-17 Globemasters. The first one left McChord Field near Tacoma, Wash., on the evening of Sept. 4, stopping at the ICE-detention hub city of Alexandria, La., and the U.S. military outpost at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — which Trump has converted into an ICE facility holding what he has baselessly claimed are “the worst of the worst” deportees. The flight landed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a likely fuel stop, the next afternoon.

	These flights were conducted without the standard transponder signal, called Automatic Dependent Signal-Broadcast, or ADS-B, which transmits constant information about a flight, including registration, location, speed, and altitude, to any receiver within range. The C-17 used an alternative signal transmitting its registration but no location or other flight data — though flight-tracking websites could still approximate its location through a kind of triangulation.  


	It is unclear when exactly the C-17 left St. Croix, because by then it was using another type of signal even harder to detect, in which an aircraft transmits its location via data link only when requested by a specific partner, like an air base. Different flight-tracking websites were able to capture different fragments of the C-17's trajectory — a single blip over the Atlantic Ocean on the night of Sept. 5 and part of a descent toward Accra, Ghana's capital, the next morning. 


	Hours later, a brief signal showed it landing in Cape Verde, probably for crew rest, before returning home. Its ADS-B transponder began transmitting again on Sept 10. Two days later, a lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court alleged the flight held 14 men — 13 from Nigeria and one from The Gambia — who had all been granted protections from removal to their countries of origin for fear of persecution or torture. They were loaded onto the cargo jet in the middle of the night with no advance warning, they alleged, and were only told where they were going when the plane was in the air. One Nigerian man said that after he asked to speak to his lawyers, he was “straitjacketed for several hours” — seeming to refer to the WRAP device ICE uses on immigrants who resist transport, which has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years alleging use of the device has caused permanent injury and even death by asphyxiation.

	Once in Ghana, the men said they were sent to an “abysmal” open-air prison camp and told they would be returned to their countries of origin — something the U.S. government had been barred from doing. Though Judge Tanya Chutkan called the Trump administration's actions “disingenuous,” she ultimately ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to stop it. On Tuesday, Ghana said all of the men had been returned to their home countries, though attorneys told the Associated Press four were still in the Ghana prison.


	Human rights groups say this amounts to chain refoulement — the forcible expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they are vulnerable to return to countries where they face persecution — and violates both domestic and international law.


	“What is alarming today is the emerging pattern of shadowy deportations of people who have not had access to a court or any meaningful form of due process — removals that bear the hallmarks of forced disappearances under international law,” says Rebecca Sharpless, a University of Miami law professor who studies ICE flights.


	Accepting third-country nationals “should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration,” Ghanaian foreign minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said Monday. “Our decision is grounded purely on humanitarian principle and Pan-African empathy.”


	The second C-17 trip began like the first one — Alexandria, Gitmo, St. Croix, no ADS-B transponder but still trackable — before becoming even harder to detect when it left St. Croix. One flight-tracking website captured a few blips as it headed toward the western coast of Africa in the small hours of Sept. 10, and two blips over Senegal later that evening. The other flight-tracking website didn't capture anything at all, which one activist described as “very weird.” 


	Two of the flight deck transmissions Rolling Stone obtained, which are not available on flight-tracking websites, show the pilots planning to land at Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, Liberia, and Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone that morning, with a third transmission showing an intended stop in Mali's capital of Bamako in the early afternoon. The final stop in Senegal was likely for crew rest.


	Two other military aircraft are known to have done ICE missions without broadcasting transponder signals: the jets that carried third-country nationals from a U.S. base in Djibouti to South Sudan and Eswatini in July. 

	











	That same month, Trump held a bizarre “Africa summit” at the White House, gathering five of the continent's 50-plus leaders around a conference table, where he extolled their “very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people” and fished for compliments from his fellow heads of state. (“A tremendous golfer.” “Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.”) And, Trump said, they were making progress on third-country agreements.

	Since then, ICE flights to Africa are surging. A new ICE charter, Paradigm Jet Management, has entered the picture, running at least eight deportation trips to and from the continent in the last six weeks. ICE also sent seven third-country nationals to Rwanda on two Gulfstream jets, and now the Trump administration is threatening to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria (or Syria). Omni Air International carried Russian dissidents to Egypt, where they were forced onto a plane to Moscow, and last week flew an eight-stop deportation mega-route from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where passengers on the last stop likely spent more than 50 hours shackled in handcuffs and leg irons attached to chains around their waists.


	And there have been at least five ICE missions to Africa on military jets, though if the last two are any indication, they are getting increasingly harder to spot.

							By 

	Billy Eichner



Jimmy Kimmel‘s suspension under these circumstances is a fundamental attack on each individual American, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of whether or not you even vote. It affects every single American's ability to lead the life they want to lead, to think whatever they want to think. I truly believe it is that fundamental. That might sound hyperbolic to some people, but I don't think it is.


	I am concerned about the potential elimination of one of the fundamental reasons we love living here and love being Americans. It's not every place on Earth where you can get up every day and you are free from governmental or military threat (at least until recently, with ICE dragging people off the street), where you can express yourself. We want to keep living in a country where you can say what you think, regardless of who agrees with you or disagrees with you, where you can become the person that you want to be, where you can wear what you want to wear, where you can fall in love with whoever you want to fall in love with.

	











	It really goes so far beyond late-night talk-show hosts or comedians. The message I want to send is that just because you're not a professional comedian or you're not in Hollywood doesn't mean you are not deeply affected by the eventual consequences of not speaking up against this, of allowing this to happen. I do fear that centering all these conversations about freedom of speech around a very famous person who's on TV every night will make it very easy for the Donald Trumps and Stephen Millers of the world to make this a coastal elite versus non-coastal elite conversation.

	And that truly isn't what this is. That's just the example this week. The media is on the front lines of this, because Trump is driven crazy by them. The man can't take a joke. But if it can happen to someone as wealthy and powerful and visible as Jimmy Kimmel or Stephen Colbert, think about what they're willing and able to do to any average American who doesn't have Colbert or Kimmel's resources.

	This is not merely about what you can or cannot — or will not — be able to pitch in a writers room at a talk show or a sitcom. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and we're already seeing it, because normalizing what happened to Colbert made it easier for them and empowered Brendan Carr to take that argument to Disney via the FCC. I know that Nexstar is a big part of this, and that, as always, it comes down to the bottom line. [Editor's note: A spokesperson for Nexstar, the nation's largest owner of TV stations, has denied that FCC pressure influenced their decision to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live before his suspension was announced.]


	I've worked for Disney, as so many people in my field have. In my experience, these are good people. I've always enjoyed working for them. I've always had wonderful experiences working for them. Disney has been a very progressive company, actually, especially when it comes to issues that matter to me a lot, like LGBTQ+ issues. The message I would send to them is — and I'm quoting Pete Buttigieg here — if you think that it is worth it to just give Trump and Carr this temporary win and that this will mean that they'll get off your backs, you're wrong. As Pete said, if you're trying to ride this tiger, it will eat you eventually. There is no going back. They are just going to not only want more, but demand it, and exploit business deals and mergers that they know they have approval over to get what they want: to try to control what is being said on TV, online, on any platform.


	These guys saw an opening here to manipulate all of us. And now we're sitting here talking about Jimmy Kimmel and not talking about the psychotic birthday note Trump wrote and gave to his friend Jeffrey Epstein. [Editor's note: Trump has denied any involvement with the letter, and has sued The Wall Street Journal for libel over its story reporting its existence.] They've gotten what they wanted, not only in Jimmy Kimmel getting suspended, but in controlling the national conversation. So we can't let that happen either.

	What they really want is a type of national brainwashing. I know in a way that sounds so crazy, 1980s-level sci-fi stuff. And I'll be honest and say in those early Trump years, you would see people posting Handmaid's Tale memes. I love the spirit and the intentions of that, but for a while there I'd roll my eyes and say, “Things are bad, but it ain't The Handmaid's Tale, exactly. Let's all calm down. It's a bit extreme.” I take that back. I am no longer rolling my eyes. This is it. It will get worse if we don't speak up. We've got to speak up.

	











	They are truly just schoolyard bullies taken to a much higher, more visible level in the public sphere. But they have the souls and the hearts and the fragility and insecurities of that schoolyard bully. And we all know we can't let the bullies win. 


	To be clear, political violence is barbaric and horrifying. I thought the Charlie Kirk story was terrifying. That's not the world we want to live in. That's not how we solve disputes. I'm not for that at all. I don't want anyone to be murdered. The Democratic Party, which I'm affiliated with, I don't agree with everything they say either. But they're the ones who are always campaigning to limit the number of guns on the street. We need to speak up in ethical ways — not violently, but passionately. Speaking up matters. It matters even if you don't have a big following, if you're not an entertainer. I think it counts even more. What we say sometimes just starts to feel like noise. It's like, “All right, there's another liberal celebrity saying what we expect them to say.”


	So if you are not in show business, if you're not known for having a big social media platform, I think it means even more to speak up in whatever way you're comfortable with. Maybe that means talking to your kids and keeping an eye on what is being allowed to be said in school and what's not. Maybe it means going to a protest. Maybe it does mean posting on Facebook or social media or whatever your platform is. But I know there is power in numbers here.

	While there are legions of fans desperately wishing and waiting for an official Fleetwood Mac reunion, it most certainly will not happen at J.K. Rowling's birthday party. After reports began circulating over the weekend that Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood were set to perform at the Harry Potter author's upcoming party in November, Rolling Stone confirmed that no such reunion will take place. 


	“This is categorically false,” a representative for Fleetwood Mac tells Rolling Stone. “It's not in the realm of true.”


	Fleetwood Mac last played together at a benefit concert for UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals at San Francisco's Oracle Park on November 19, 2019. And after the death of singer-keyboardist Christine McVie in 2022, Nicks made it clear that there was no hope of any possible future reunions. “There is no more Fleetwood Mac now, because when Christine died, Fleetwood Mac died,” Nicks told Rolling Stone in 2024. “We cannot replace her.“

	











	Plus, those who know the history of Fleetwood Mac know it would take more than a birthday party to get the band back together at this point. Fleetwood Mac formed in 1967 and performed with variations of their group until McVie's death. When McVie stepped away from the band in 1998, the remaining members, Nicks, Fleetwood, John McVie, and Buckingham, carried on as a quartet. McVie returned to the group in 2014, but long-simmering tensions between Nicks and Buckingham boiled over four years later, and the group dismissed Buckingham. They toured in 2018-19 with Mike Campbell and Neil Finn covering his parts.

	(Fleetwood made peace with Buckingham in 2021, and expressed hopes he could return to the band one day, but Nicks has said that was never going to happen. Nicks and Buckingham did recently reissue their 1973 joint album, Buckingham Nicks.)

	The closest thing fans might get to a reunion any time soon will come in the form of a documentary, which was announced last year. Filmmaker Frank Marshall is set to helm the authorized feature-length project for Apple. 


	The film is currently untitled, and a release date has yet to be announced, but the project is set to include new interviews with the f our core surviving members, as well as never-before-seen footage, and new and archival interviews with McVie. The film will find Fleetwood Mac reflecting on their more than five decades together, from their heyday in the Seventies up through the present.

	One person was killed and two more were injured in a stabbing that took place outside of Phish‘s show at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia, on Friday night. 


	Police responded to a violent altercation just after 9:30 p.m. ET, according to a police report from the Hampton Police Division. According to the report published Saturday, the suspect fled the scene on foot, but detectives managed to identify “all parties involved,” adding it appeared “to be an isolated incident.”


	“The first victim was transported to a local hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries,” Cpl. Shaun Stalnaker wrote. “The second victim was also transported and is currently receiving medical treatment. A third adult male victim later arrived at a local hospital as a walk-in, also suffering from a laceration determined to be non-life-threatening.” As of Saturday, a suspect had not yet been identified.


	“The Hampton Police Division is seeking the public's assistance in identifying the suspect in connection with a stabbing that occurred on September 19, 2025.”

	Phish addressed the incident in a statement on Instagram Saturday, saying that while they “don't have more information than what has been reported by the police,” the band was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy.

	“During last night's show, a tragic incident took place in the parking lot outside Hampton Coliseum. There was an altercation behind one of the tents in the unofficial vending area in which someone lost their life and two other people were injured,” the band said. “We don't have more information than what has been reported by the police, who called it an isolated incident, but what we do know is upsetting enough. We are deeply saddened by this and our hearts go out to all of those affected.” 

	











	Phish was performing at the Hampton Coliseum as part of their summer tour. The band's Saturday and Sunday night concerts in Hampton, their final nights on tour, were set to go on as planned.

Dua Lipa brought out surprise guest Nile Rodgers to perform Chic's “Le Freak” Saturday at New York's Madison Square Garden as the singer continued the Radical Optimism Tour's tradition of playing local covers at every concert.


	Saturday marked Lipa's third of four nights at the World's Most Famous Arena; her previous shows at MSG featured covers of New York staples Alicia Keys (“No One”) and Blondie (“One Way or Another“). She upped the ante for the third gig, welcoming the legendary Rodgers himself onstage to play guitar on the Number One disco-funk hit:

	“Here in New York, I'm actually spoiled with the choice,” Lipa told the crowd prior to covering Blondie earlier this week. Lipa's MSG run concludes Sunday night with no shortage of New York artists still available to cover.


	Dua Lipa's Australian and New Zealand tour — where her regional covers trend started — saw the singer perform the likes of AC/DC, Lorde, and Kylie Minogue, while also bringing out guests like Troye Sivan, Tame Impala, and Crowded House's Neil Finn. The local covers have continued — though less frequently — as the tour headed to Europe, with Lipa covering Enrique Iglesias' “Hero” in Madrid.

	When the trek reached the U.K. at London's Wembley Stadium, Lipa performed Jamiroquai's “Virtual Insanity” with help from that group's singer Jay Kay. The following night at the same venue, she brought out Charli XCX for a rendition of that singer's “360.”

	In Liverpool, Lipa performed the Zutons' “Valerie” — popularized by Amy Winehouse — with that group's singer Dave McCabe. The next show, in the birthplace of the Beatles, Lipa covered the Fab Four's “Hey Jude.” In Dublin, Lipa did “a song by a late Irish legend,” Sinead O'Connor's “Nothing Compares 2 U.”


	The Radical Optimism Tour has since crossed the Atlantic, opening with two shows in Toronto last week with two more regional covers, Nelly Furtado's “Like A Bird” and Mustafa's “Name of God.” In Chicago, Lipa performed with Chaka Khan and covered Earth, Wind, and Fire before heading to Boston, where she delivered Aerosmith's “I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.”

SpaceX launch over Matlacha.

Some early risers across Southwest Florida caught a glimpse of a SpaceX launch that launched from Cape Canaveral Sunday morning. Just before 7 a.m., Starlink satellites were sent into Earth's lower orbit.

A batch of 28 satellites will help to provide high-speed internet service from space, allowing for communication where traditional broadband is slower, expensive, or unavailable.

Today's launch joins the over 6,000 satellites that are already in orbit.

Despite being 246 miles away from Fort Myers, Cape Canaveral had clear skies, which allowed for good viewing conditions across Southwest Florida.

WINK News viewers and Weather Watchers sent their pictures and videos to Weather Authority Meteorologist Lauren Kreidler, wondering what they saw in the sky.

A “jellyfish” like sight appeared in the sky as the rocket's exhaust met the rising sun.

Minimal cloud cover and dry conditions kicked off Sunday morning. Drier air is expected to stay overhead throughout the day, like Saturday, so there's a chance for just a few storms today. Moisture works its way back into the picture for the start of the upcoming work week, bringing scattered storms back in the forecast.

By Clara Lincolnhol 

Online rumors are swirling that a comet from another solar system might be a UFO — but Michigan State University researchers say that's pure speculation. It's definitely a comet, they insist, with no credible reason to believe otherwise. 

“Almost everybody in the field is in agreement that this object is a natural comet because it's displaying classical evidence of cometary activity,” said professor Daryll Seligman, the lead author of the first paper studying the comet. 

It's behaving the way a comet does and has all of the features that define a comet, like a tail, he said. 

“There's no controversy about it not being a comet because nobody thinks that except a very few people.” Seligman said. 

The comet, called 3I/Atlas is unique though. It's the third interstellar comet ever detected, and the ice in its nucleus likely isn't made of water-which is typical of most other comets, he said. 

His team knows the nucleus' ice must be made of a different element because the comet was first spotted moving from beyond where water is active, he said. 

“It could be telling you there's some weird ice which is driving the more distant activity – something like carbon dioxide. And that potentially tells you a lot about the home system the object formed in,” Seligman said. 

There is nothing about the comet to suggest that it's an alien or a UFO, said Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium.  

“As it's coming by the Sun, it's sublimating material just like any other comet would,” Schmoll said. “Everything about this points to it being a comet from somewhere else in the galaxy.” 

The comet will be visible with a telescope during parts of August, September, November and December.

-

Over the last weeks, the internet and TikTok have gone crazy over an alleged alien meteorite discovered in Panama. The story, posted by TikTok user @kinpanama, shows a rocklike object from which a strange, gelatinous substance appears to grow and evolve into a creature resembling something straight out of a science-fiction movie. Viewers have offered a range of explanations: some suggested it could be polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a type of silicone polymer; others proposed graphite oxide or even a wormwood plant.

Despite numerous attempts to convince the public that the phenomenon is fake, users remain captivated. Many admit that even if it is fabricated, it is too entertaining to ignore. “If this is fake, he deserves a production studio,” one TikTok commenter wrote. Whatever the truth may be, no one seems ready to be definitively swayed by yet another digital explanation of what the eyes see and the mind wants to believe from thousands of kilometers away. What matters here is not the literal existence of the creature, but the way @kinpanama framed and presented the story — and, in reality, that has been clear from the start.

Lo siento amigos, creo que mañana  mato  esto 😭😱😱. K25

 ♬ sonido original – Kin👾 

 

In his latest videos, the Panama-based creator says he has abandoned the alien, nicknamed K-25 — possibly a reference to his name, Kin, and his possible age, 25 — in a natural park. “New home, don't be sad, K25 is alive 👾 #K25 as long as you think of him. Metropolitan Natural Park, go visit,” he writes, urging followers to visit the creature's “new home.”

In earlier messages, he reflects on humanity and the planet: “Why say that he will destroy the planet? We are already doing it ourselves. K25 now lives in a military bunker 👾 I miss him.” and “Escaping to breathe fresh air and see the things God created. Everything has its end.”

In one video, he even pleads: “Don't damage the planet.”

 ♬ sonido original – Kin👾 

 

Before the alien arc, @kinpanama's content focused on two themes: short clips of himself with his dog or exploring the Panamanian outdoors, which he clearly enjoys. Just days before posting the meteorite videos, he shared a clip highlighting pollution and environmental neglect in Panama, captioned: “Panamanian, be aware of what you are doing,” showing a small stream covered in trash.

 ♬ ARMAGEDON (SLOWED) – TRASHXRL & Funkmane DJ 

 

Perhaps here lies the answer that no online proof or counterproof can definitively provide. While the creature itself may seem imaginary and irrational, the motivation behind @kinpanama's project appears clear: raising environmental awareness. Why fear imagined or fabricated creatures when humanity is actively destroying the planet that has sustained it? Why focus so much energy on a virtual being when the world around us is full of real, threatened, wonders?

Today, the message of environmental protection may ring hollow for some. Too much repetition and media hype, too many causes hijacked for personal gain: power, money. Nevertheless, the issue remains. On the other hand, interest in aliens and extraterrestrials is exploding, with UFO sightings reported more and more every day. And, as always in human history, people tend to focus on imaginary or impossible-to-prove topics rather than on real problems.

And perhaps that's what kinpanama sensed. By showcasing an extremely realistic creature—Not realistic enough to attract the attention of scientific authorities, but convincing enough to generate a base of believers and followers—he could drive a huge audience to his channel and, in some way, subtly spread his message about what seems to matter to him, judging by his own content.

As for whether the creature is actually an alien, all signs point to no. Early inconsistencies in the story strongly suggest it is the work of a talented young creator, skilled in chemistry and nature, who understands how to exploit people's incredible capacity to immerse themselves in imaginary worlds rather than confront uncomfortable reality. For such is the nature of man: consciously or unconsciously creating distractions to escape, challenge, or confront the harsh truths of life that often do not meet our expectations — or are simply too difficult to face.

The growing fascination with alien life perfectly reflects this tendency, as people project onto it the hope that extraterrestrials will either doom us for our ways (destroying the planet and ourselves) or save us as a prophetic figure might. Others simply take it as entertainment, like everything else — from politics to the economy — a symptom of a society governed by forces over which ordinary people can hardly hope to exert influence or make decisions, choosing instead to enjoy life as best they can.

Regarding @kinpanama, as with everything in life, his motivations might have been multiple: boredom, craving social media clout, but also this genuine dedication to nature and the environment. The way he developed the story is not something just anyone could or would do. Too much effort, too much staging to be simply the product of boredom or a desire for virtual fame.

In any case, the Panama alien is an interesting one, a clear reflection of the world we live in, where everyone sees what they want to see and hears what they want to hear.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki Hated This Controversial 'Supernatural' Episode","https://collider.com/supernatural-bugs-jensen-ackles-jared-padalecki-most-hated-episode/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 16:10:00 GMT","

It's been 20 years since Supernatural first hit television screens on the now-defunct WB back in September 2005, but fans haven't let up on their love for the show. Still making waves on streaming, the show continues on as a fan-favorite in an age where spooky procedurals are mostly a thing of the past. But there's one Season 1 episode that continues to get vast amounts of hate from the Supernatural community, even all these years later. Funny enough, stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki tend to agree with the sentiments themselves — though not for the reasons you might think. That episode? The infamous ""Bugs.""

If you ask just about any Supernatural fan what the worst episode of the show is, undoubtedly ""Bugs"" will be listed as at least one of them. Though not the lowest-rated of the show (that dishonor belongs to ""Bloodlines""), nor even the most poorly constructed, this Season 1 episode was the first hour of the show to really underwhelm audiences. After fantastic episodes like the haunted mirror-centric ""Bloody Mary"" or the gross body-horror that is ""Skin,"" fans just didn't think that ""Bugs'"" little titular antagonists were as frightening as, say, a Wendigo stalking your campsite. When looking back on the show's 20th anniversary, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles reflected on this infamous episode, and when asked if it was the worst of the show, they seemed to agree with the general fan consensus.

""Yes, I think it was [the worst], because of what we went through and what it ended up being,"" Ackles explained to Entertainment Weekly. ""Basically, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze."" According to Ackles and Padalecki, the pair were surrounded by somewhere around 70,000 bees for the episode and were being constantly stung during filming. It's one thing to be in a room with a guy wearing a Hook Man costume or with fake vampire teeth, but it's another thing entirely to put your actors in the same room as the creatures (or insects, in this case) that they're supposed to be battling. Padalecki went on to elaborate that things only got worse when they were told by a bee specialist that they had to pretend to swat the bees by simply guiding them across the room rather than actually swatting, which is what the scene called for. ""It was the most absurd thing,"" Padalecki noted.

Of course, the worst part of the whole experience (you know, aside from getting stung several times by bees) was that the bugs didn't do the job. ""Then they get to post [production], and the bees didn't show up on camera,"" Ackles added. ""So, they had to VIXFX the bees."" In the end, all the pain that Ackles and Padalecki had to experience on set for the sake of authenticity went out the window. Either because of the size of the insects or the camera's frame rate, the bees failed to make their mark on the actual episode. It's no wonder that the Supernatural stars look back in horror at ""Bugs,"" an episode just about anyone would want to forget after that filming experience. Nevertheless, we're still here talking about it 20 years later...

Again, ""Bugs"" has become notorious among Supernatural fans due to its clear use of genre clichés, an uninspired plot, and stakes that never quite added up when compared to taking down otherworldly ghosts and demons. While perhaps not really the worst of the show (it generally looks better than most later season episodes, like ""Raising Hell""), the whole project put Ackles and Padalecki through a literal bug-infested hell, which certainly wasn't worth the effort. Of course, it's also worth noting that Ackles, Padalecki, and Misha Collins all speak poorly of Supernatural's seventh season as well, particularly the strand of episodes where the show was making constant (and childish) jokes about the Leviathan leader Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart). Over 15 years on the air, it's no wonder that Supernatural sometimes got things wrong. But, in some ways, all of that can be traced back to that very first failure in ""Bugs.""

When pit up against several other Season 1 favorites (of which most episodes from the inaugural season are), ""Bugs"" stands out as being overly reliant on creeping out the audience rather than truly scaring them. Bugs crawling out through a shower head or bathtub drain don't quite live up to a possessed scarecrow hunting our heroes through an apple orchard or even a demon-possessed pilot trying to crash a plane full of passengers post-9/11. The stakes simply don't feel as high, and the whole idea that this subdivision was being built on cursed Native American land feels like something we've seen many times on The X-Files before (there are some unfortunate similarities to that show's worst episode, ""Teso Dos Bichos,"" which was ironically also directed by the late Kim Manners).

No matter if you feel like ""Bugs"" really is the worst of Supernatural or simply one of the worst, there's no mistaking that it was the show's first real misfire after several great standalone horror stories. It's easy to look back at Season 1's impressive catalog of episodes and single out episodes like ""Bugs"" or ""Route 666,"" but the truth is, two subpar episodes in the span of a 22-episode season is pretty impressive for any show, let alone one just getting started. As Supernatural turns 20 this year, revisiting the series reminds us of just how good we had it back when the Winchesters were still hunting on air.

Black Phone 2 is a sequel that I didn't think we needed. Like, at all. But after its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2025, I have to say that Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill have done it again. Directed by Derrickson and penned by the duo, this sequel is a wholly original concept, developing what happens next after Joe Hill's novella, The Black Phone, on which the first film was based. 

Set four years after the events of the first film, which ended with Finn (Mason Thames) killing and escaping the Grabber (Ethan Hawke), Black Phone 2 leans all the way into the supernatural and dreams. The sole survivor of the Grabber, Finn, still has the spotlight on him at school, and so does his sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), whose visions helped recover the bodies of the abducted boys. 

Now, Gwen's dreams have begun taking a shocking and more sinister turn. Marked by stark filmings switches to Super 8, Gwen's dreams begin to cause her to sleepwalk, until she ends up answering the black phone in the Grabber's basement one more time. As the visions become more disturbing, Gwen, Finn, and their friend Ernesto (Miguel Mora) follow the clues to solve the mystery of three boys who were murdered at Alpine Lake years ago. 



A Christian sleepaway camp, Alpine Lake, has never been the same. Now, under new ownership from one of its former camp counselors, Armando (Demián Bichir), the three sneak their way into the now snowed-in camp under the guise of looking for a new job. While there, the evil grows, and Gwen's life becomes increasingly in danger as the line between her dreams and the waking world begins to fall away, and the siblings are left to face the Grabber one more time while unlocking family secrets along the way. 

For Finn, he's fighting, he's angry, and well, he has no friends outside of his sister and Ernesto, Robin Arellano's younger brother (played by the same actor who played Robin in the first film). Deeply impacted by his time with the Grabber, Finn has started to isolate himself and reject any phone that rings.

But more strikingly, he's behaving just like Robin. He's speaking the way Robin said when he protected him in the first film, and it all just feels a little sad. Finn is stronger than he was in the original movie, and the days of being bullied are gone. Still, Finn isn't exactly thriving; instead, he's just trying to push past the trauma he experienced, and to him, that means ignoring it. 



Ultimately, Mason Thames's return as Finn is just as endearing as he was in the first film. Still, it's his depth as we Finn struggle with the aftermath of surviving and defeating the Grabber that makes Black Phone 2 stand out. It's easy to think our heroes live happy lives after they survive. But for C. Robert Cargill and Scott Derrickson, that would be too easy. Instead, Finn is dealing with survivor's guilt, he's confused about how to continue, and although he survived, the scars it all left on him continue to ache.

When it comes to Gwen, she's the one being bullied. Now older, Gwen is trying to understand her gift. She's checking out books on dreams and experimenting with tarot cards (which Ernesto gives her, calling them loteria, which is honestly a funny cultural inaccuracy). It all leaves her open to being bullied by others. Gwen is still foul-mouthed and self-assured when confronting authority, but at school, she's much quieter. 

As Gwen's dreams begin to take her deeper and have physical ramifications, she starts to see them as a curse. Where the younger Gwen wanted to embrace them, high school Gwen just thinks that she is going insane. Worried that she's going down the same road as her mother, which ultimately ended in her committing suicide, Gwen is scared. Still, she remains undeterred in following her visions to uncover the Grabber's first victims and put them to rest. 

For her part, Madeleine McGraw has a commanding presence. She's determined, resilient, and facing a similar, albeit different, danger; her vulnerability keeps the audience invested in her. McGraw's role tasks the young actress with creating howling screams, painful moments, and walking the edge of falling into an isolated fear. 



The sibling duo remains at he heart of Black Phone 2, only in this one, Gwen is the focal point instead of Finn. More importantly, though, they're not alone. They have Ernesto. While Ernesto and Gwen share a cute budding romance, it's more important that they have someone who believes in them and understands them. Ernesto is on their side when other people question them. He may not understand what's happening, but he is there for the siblings. 

The young cast, Madeleine McGraw, Mason Thames, Miguel Mora, and Arianna Rivas, each pulls the story forward. Their ability to be vulnerable with each other and stay by each other's sides is what makes the core of the film unshakable. But among them, it's McGraw and Thames as the siblings that steal the show with performances that keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat. 

Additionally, Demián Bichir's Armando (Mando for short) is a breath of fresh air. He adds humor and care to the teens' lives. Mando also provides Finn with the much-needed male influence in his life that his father can't due to his drinking, as well as the trust that the Grabber stole from him four years ago. Mando is a great character who transcends being just a plot device and a connection to the past. 

Black Phone 2 is a wildly different movie from the first. It's weirder, more ambitious, and leans as hard as it can to 80s horror staples. If you come into this film expecting more like the first film, then you'll be let down. But if you just strap in and go on the wild ride, you will find some of the most rewarding and creative horror scares, along with a return of classic concepts that work. 



On paper, Black Phone 2 is too absurd to work, but in execution? Well, to put it plainly, this is the kind of theater horror we have been missing. From the pulse-pounding score to the stellar use of Super 8 to mark distinctions between dreams and realities, and truly unnerving moments like a face sliding down a window, it's hard to find a film in recent memory that pushed on dreams quite as hard as this, at least not since Nightmare on Elm Street went into its slumber. 

In every winding element of the story, Black Phone 2 tries to top itself and doesn't hold back in swinging for the fences. There isn't a single moment that isn't constantly ramping up the stakes, production, or violence. The original film focused on its simplicity with very little shown. This sequel, on the other hand, has aged alongside its young cast and ramped up the blood, anger, and supernatural elements. But even with all of this, Black Phone 2 doesn't lose its sincerity. And that's a hard task.

Beautifully shot and perfectly scored, Black Phone 2 is a fast-paced dream slasher that honors the spirit of the original story penned by Joe Hill, while also developing it into something unique. While the characters are the same, the approach to filmmaking feels entirely different, and yet it works. The original film offered simplicity for young characters, and in Black Phone 2, it offers supernatural fear and accelerated stakes to match where the kids are now in their lives. Not every sequel works, but Black Phone 2 does. 

Black Phone 2 screened as a part of Fantastic Fest 2025 and will be released in theaters on October 17, 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","7 Games Where You Play As A Powerful Psychic","https://gamerant.com/best-games-play-as-powerful-dangerous-deadly-op-psychic/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 00:30:00 GMT","

Amidst the assortment of superhuman abilities, few capture the imagination quite like telekinesis, mind-reading, or straight-up brain-bending domination. Games that hand players psychic abilities scratch the fantasy of hurling objects, warping reality itself, and outsmarting enemies simply by taking over their brains.

Some games approach this task with comic-book flair, while others are more eerie and unsettling, but they all give players the thrill of being an unstoppable force whose weapon isn't muscle alone. These games showcase not only the potential of psychic powers in gameplay but also narratively explore what it means to wield them. Here are several great games where players step into the shoes of extraordinary psychics.



A blend of third-person stealth with supernatural abilities in a story that balances espionage with psychic experimentation, Second Sight has players take control of John Vattic, a psychic who wakes up in a medical facility with no memory. The game cleverly alternates between flashback sequences of military missions and the present day, slowly unraveling how John ended up as a test subject.

While it mostly focuses on cover-based sneaking, the psychic toolkit keeps enemy encounters unpredictable. It's possible to pull a guard off a ledge or throw a crate across a room without breaking stealth. This combination of grounded military thriller and surreal power fantasy sets Second Sight apart from other mid-2000s shooters.



Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, a fondly remembered cult classic, gives players an arsenal of psychic powers that somehow feel physical. Telekinesis lets them pick up enemies and throw them into walls, pyrokinesis can light up whole squads, and remote viewing allows scouting behind walls. It feels more like a toybox of psychic mayhem than a shooter.

The story revolves around a war against a rogue psychic organization, and though it received mixed reactions, the rest of the game more than makes up for it. What's stuck with players all these years and why Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy is remembered so fondly is how the gameplay felt satisfyingly tactile, especially when compared to other shooters from 2004. Even today, it comes up in the discussion of ""Why don't they make more games like this?""



Jesse Faden turns psychic powers into a stylish spectacle in Control. As the newly appointed director of the Federal Bureau of Control, players navigate the surreal architecture of the Oldest House. Telekinetic abilities are the star of the show, allowing players to rip out concrete chunks from the walls and fling them at enemies, take flight, or shield themselves with debris.

Along with the mechanics, the game also sticks the landing in tone. Bureau files and cryptic conversations ground the absurdity, but the real fun is still in dashing mid-air and raining rocks, chairs, and tables upon foes in a super-powered tantrum.



Psychonauts uses its psychic concept for humor and imagination rather than gritty fantasy. As a runaway circus acrobat named Razputin, players dive into the minds of a whole host of eccentric characters. Each mental world is a reflection of its host: a conspiracy nut's paranoia becomes a maze of shifting streets, while an artist's noodle becomes a neon velvet theater.

The gameplay integrates powers like levitation, telekinesis, and pyrokinesis into movement and puzzle solving for a fleshed-out platforming adventure. What makes Psychonauts a timeless classic is the creativity with which it ties psychic powers into not just its gameplay but also the story and environment. Every brain that players enter has its own personality, and Raz's growing mastery of his abilities feels as much about gaining empathy as acquiring power.



As a contrast to Psychonauts' playful charm, Galerians takes bleakness to the extreme. Released on PlayStation in 1999, the story follows Rion, a boy who discovers he has devastating psychic abilities. Unlike other titles, though, the powers here carry risk, with every ability causing physical strain. Overusing them can cause Rion to collapse, making gameplay a constant balancing of risk and reward.

The powers themselves are destructive and disturbing, too, from spontaneously combusting enemies to hurling them across rooms like ragdolls. With a unique survival horror pacing and grim cyberpunk story about human experimentation, Galerians frames psychic powers not as fun and exciting but as something dangerous and dehumanizing.



For a less dark experience, look towards Destroy All Humans!. Cryptosporodium-137, aka ""Crypto,"" has both alien tech and a knack for mind tricks, using them all to terrorize 1950s America. Read minds, levitate cows, or, most devilish of all, force humans to dance against their will! The tongue-in-cheek chaos will have players rubbing their hands with glee, thinking of new ways to cause trauma and mayhem.

Psychic powers aren't just a secondary add-on to the arsenal of weapons at Crypto's disposal; they're central to the charm. Letting players mix alien weaponry with absurd mental domination, Destroy All Humans! may be the only game that lets players throw a tank into a herd of cows while listening to a farmer think about pie.



Scarlet Nexus decorates psychic powers with anime flair. Or rather, in this world, they're psionic powers called “psychokinesis.” As one of two playable characters, Yuito or Kasane, players battle grotesque mutants known as Others using a mix of weapon attacks and tossing environmental objects mid-fight with psychic abilities. Chairs, cars, and vending machines are all part of the arsenal, turning every battle into a stylish, destructible set piece.

What sets the game apart is the party system that lets players borrow the psychic abilities of teammates to expand their moveset. Layering powers like teleportation or invisibility adds strategy to the debris-tossing madness. Paired with its dual-story campaign and futuristic setting, Scarlet Nexus delivers on both depth and spectacle.

Online conspiracy theorists ‘completely dehumanised' Jay Slater after his disappearance in Tenerife, his mother Debbie said

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Jay Slater's mother has called for new regulations to be introduced to curb the spread of misinformation about missing people online as she speaks out in a bid to set the record straight on his final hours.

Debbie Duncan, 57, said “armchair detectives” had been allowed to concoct “shocking” theories and “completely dehumanise” her son after the 19-year-old's disappearance in Tenerife last year. 

A coroner later ruled Jay's death was caused by a traumatic brain injury caused by a fall sustained when he became lost in the treacherous mountains of Park Rural de Teno.

But, speaking to The Times, she said content creators were still unpicking Jay's death online, claiming he is still alive and hiding out, ready to reclaim money raised by an emergency GoFundMe appeal for his grieving family.

“How can you say the F-word on Facebook and have your account removed, but people can say what they like about my son and that's fine?” she asked.

In a separate interview with The Mirror, she said she wanted to “fight for Jay's name” after the media frenzy that surrounded his death.

“To continue making videos (and posting them online) more than 12 months on, going through every bit of detail over and over again is shocking. When will it stop?

“Social media is good for spreading awareness, but can also be the work of the devil.

“If I can save another family from going through the trauma we have had to endure, it will be worth it.”

Her comments come ahead of a Channel 4 documentary,The Disappearance of Jay Slater, which airs on Sunday, 28 September at 9pm.

The programme will give unprecedented access into the 19-year-old's final hours, which became the subject of countless conspiracy theories and media reports in June 2024.

An apprentice bricklayer from Lancashire, Jay had gone on holiday to the New Rave Generation (NRG) festival in Tenerife with his friends, Lucy Law and Bradley Geoghegan.

On the night of his disappearance, he had been out at the Papagayo nightclub in Playa de Las Americas when he decided to return to the Airbnb of Ayub Qassim and Steven “Rocky” Roccas, two men he had met during the holiday. The villa was 23 miles northwest of Playa de las Americas, surrounded by the rocky national park Rural de Teno.

He later phoned Ms Law to say he was lost in the mountains and had cut his leg on a cactus. His phone then died, and a huge manhunt was launched.

Rescue teams scoured the treacherous terrain for weeks in the burning sun in a bid to find the teenager – all the while, conspiracy theorists online sent Debbie and her family on “wild goose chases”.

After 29 days, his body was uncovered in what a coroner later called a “particularly dangerous” area of the vast park. He died instantly from a traumatic brain injury as a result of a fall. The 19-year-old had traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine in his body, according to toxicologists.

But even the coroner's ruling didn't stop misinformation swirling online. Theories that he had been kidnapped by drug dealers whom he owed money, or had staged his own death, can still be found, 15 months on from his death.

Debbie told The Mirror: “What we have had to endure has really opened my eyes.

“It is not just us who are horrified by what has gone on – professional people are horrified too. I wanted this documentary to be made because I want to show Jay is a real person and not just the face of a story.

“I want to show everyone we are a normal family. Jay was a popular guy with a lot of friends and it's been hard to watch it. I cried all the way through, but I hope it will finally shut down the armchair detectives. It's been very well put together.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","6 Biggest SWAT Mysteries That Will Never Be Solved After Its Cancelation","https://screenrant.com/biggest-swat-mysteries-never-solved-after-cancelation/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 01:08:00 GMT","

CBS' S.W.A.T. wrapped its seven-season run this past year, and while the show's upcoming spin-off is going to bring back some of the core characters, there are several mysteries that the new series isn't likely to touch on. Shemar Moore's Daniel ""Hondo"" Harrison, who was the central figure of SWAT throughout its run, will be returning for the spin-off, but he's the only name permanently attached.

While SWAT season 8 worked hard to ensure that many of the characters that viewers had gotten to know over the years had the majority of their loose ends tied up, the series wasn't certain on whether it'd be picked up for another season. After two separate cancelations, SWAT was actually canceled at CBS after its recent season, meaning the series finale wasn't technically planned.

Though the finale was able to clean up the loose ends of the series in some ways, it wasn't able to ensure that every unfinished story was revisited while also providing an interesting case for 20-Squad. Allowing the series to do what it does best by Hondo and the rest of 20-Squad working through a high-stakes case was more important than revisiting the past.

As SWAT fans prepare to see how SWAT Exiles evens out, it's clear that the show is planning to focus on the new squad of SWAT team members than on the past cast members from the CBS series. While Moore will return, along with what appear to be shorter appearances by Jay Harrington and David Lim, who played Deacon and Tan, others aren't slated yet.

SWAT had eight seasons worth of story to tell, bringing viewers into a universe for long stretches where they got to know the members of 20-Squad. Although things changed for some, like Dominique Luca (Kenny Johnson) or Jim Street (Alex Russell), their stories were still important to SWAT fans. Unfortunately, many loose ends may not be tied up by the new spin-off.

While Luca's time on SWAT wasn't short, it was clear that by the end of his time on the series, there were some underlying issues that may have been pushing Johnson away from the show. Even so, Luca's exit was traumatic to SWAT fans and 20-Squad. After a serious on-duty shooting where he was hit multiple times, Luca suffered permanent nerve damage.

Deciding that he wasn't interested in sticking to administrative work, Luca chose to take an early retirement from the LAPD. Despite being a legacy member of SWAT who had struggled for years carrying around the weight of being a generational team member, Luca chose to end his career honorably and move on to something new. 

Though Luca's decision made sense due to his injury, it was difficult for fans to get behind, especially knowing that he was one of the most consistent SWAT team members on the show. Steady and loyal, Luca's departure was hard on everyone. While Luca could appear on SWAT Exiles, it's not likely that his whereabouts or current state will make it to the spin-off.

Early on in the SWAT canon, Jessica Cortez (Stephanie Sigman) was one of the central figures of the show. Her relationship with Hondo framed the first dramatic arc of the series, and though things fizzled out with their romance quickly, there was always a question lingering within the first seasons about the show choosing to revisit their romantic relationship someday.

Although Cortez was a big part of the first seasons of the series, her quick exit from the show was a shock to the system. At the end of SWAT season 2, it's revealed that Cortez is taking on an undercover assignment with the FBI. The assignment, which was meant to be temporary at first, ultimately becomes a long-term position.

Though Sigman was pregnant and left the show, the explanation for Cortez's disappearance often left SWAT fans at a loss. It was clear she wouldn't be returning, but leaving the door partially open and never really replacing her was a tough pill to swallow. It's unlikely that Exiles will choose to revisit Cortez or give updates on what she's been up to.

While Commander Robert Hicks (Patrick St. Esprit) became a major piece of SWAT's puzzle after Cortez's departure, he's always been an incredibly difficult character to watch. Hicks, who's dealt with family issues throughout his time on SWAT along with his professional problems, made it clear that he wasn't going to deal with either as he navigated tricky business with 20-Squad.

SWAT season 8 saw Hicks facing professional trouble as he worked through a tough case with Deputy Chief Bennett (Merrin Dungey) keeping a close eye on his work. After what Bennett deemed a slip up, Hicks was put on suspension, but after he helped the team with another critical case, she chose to keep him in his role, valuing his contributions.

Though Hicks was ultimately not ousted from SWAT and kept in his role, it was clear that the fallout from Bennett's disciplinary action was taking a toll on the leader as the season came to a close. While Exiles may give an update on what happened to Hicks after SWAT came to a close, the spin-off isn't likely to be as in-depth as viewers would like.

SWAT's biggest romantic storyline focused on Street and Chris Alonso (Lina Escola) throughout the first five seasons of the series, but the show left them off on a confusing note. While Chris and Street spent years dancing around each other's feelings, it was clear that the pair were going to wind up together from nearly the beginning of the show.

Even so, Chris and Street's relationship was never easy. By the time they finally got together, Escola was exiting the show and, ultimately, left Street on his own, mentioning that they were still together from time to time. Russell, who spent SWAT season 6 preparing for his own exit, ultimately left the show on a high note, revealing he was proposing.

SWAT fans have long since believed that Street and Chris, either engaged or married, would be returning to the show for its end, but with sudden cancelation after sudden cancelation, SWAT never had the chance to bring them back. Now, while the couple is presumably together, it feels unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will explain what happened to the pair or bring them back.

As two of the main cast members throughout the final seasons of SWAT, Miguel ""Miko"" Alfaro (Niko Pepaj) and Zoe Powell (Anna Enger Ritch) were some of the most entertaining parts of the show after Street and Chris' departure. Alfrao, who was an old rival of Street and transferred in from Long Beach as well, worked to prove himself throughout the series. 

Powell, who began appearing with recurring guest spots on the show before becoming a full-fledged cast member later on, was another big presence on 20-Squad throughout the final seasons. Working through personal issues as she got to know the son she gave up for adoption during her first years on SWAT, Powell's human storylines were an anchor point for SWAT's final seasons.

Although SWAT wrapped both Alfaro and Powell's stories to some degree, their interpersonal issues weren't worked through in the same way that others' problems were before the show came to an end. Alfaro, who often had issues with Tan during his time on screen, didn't get validated as much as he could've, while Powell's relationships were never fully resolved. It's unlikely we'll see resolutions on Exiles.

The key character who joined SWAT post-Chris and Street was Devin Gamble (Annie Ilonzeh), who joined during the final season of the series to bring more drama than any other new recruit had in the past. Gamble, whose father murdered a cop in the past, was someone that 20-Squad wasn't prepared to defend when she made it onto the squad.

Even so, Gamble tried her best to fit in and ensure that she was prepared at all times. Facing distrust, prejudice, and flat-out hate from offices outside of 20-Squad, Gamble's up and down with the LAPD was incredibly difficult. While the series ended on a somewhat high-note for Gamble, it was fairly unstable for her to work with the team until the very end.

Though Gamble reaches a point of acceptance by the end of SWAT, it's clear that there's still a fair bit of work to be done for her to fit in with the rest of 20-Squad as a whole. While Exiles may choose to share more about Gamble, it's unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will devote genuine time to her story as they move forward.

            The TikTok talks involving the Murdochs could result in Fox Corp. becoming part of the consortium, according to a person familiar with the matter. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch would not be investing as individuals.
    


            Participating in the TikTok consortium could provide a boost for Fox Corp., which has been making many digital media investments to offset declining areas of business like broadcast television.
    


            Dell is the CEO of computer maker Dell Technologies.
    


            Trump's comments are a change from the consortium of investors previously named in the TikTok deal. The Trump administration had said that the group of investors would include Ellison's company, Oracle, along with Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that TikTok will have seven board members, six of whom will be American.
    


            The makeup of American investors is required by the bill passed by Congress in April 2024, which required a nationwide ban of TikTok operations in the United States unless the social media app sold about 80% of its assets to American investors.
    


            Leavitt had said on Saturday that data and privacy for the app in the United States will be led by Oracle and that the company would be one of the American investors.
    


            Ellison's company began hosting TikTok's US data in 2020.
    


            Trump said Friday that he had “a very productive call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and that progress was made toward finalizing the deal.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has slammed Brussels, accusing the EU leadership of mismanaging key areas such as the economy, immigration, and security.

In a critical speech at Digital Civic Circles, a network of digital groups promoting conservative values in Hungary, he claimed the bloc was on the brink of collapse due to the failures of its current leaders.

The prime minister painted a stark picture of “mountains of debt, crowds of migrants, street violence, the increasingly dark shadow of war, mass layoffs, skyrocketing utility costs, impoverished households, and Brussels bureaucrats running around like panicked chickens,” on Saturday while describing the EU's troubles.

According to Orban, the EU has fallen short of establishing itself as a credible global power. Instead of rising to meet these challenges, the bloc has become a symbol of weakness, indecision, and internal chaos, he said.

He criticized what he called the “tragic” trade deal with the US signed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, adding that the EU's green policies are “killing European industry.” Energy prices, Orban noted, are “three to four times higher” than in the US, while countries like France are edging toward unsustainable debt levels.

“Europe, as we knew and loved it, is over,” Orban warned. “If we deny this, we lose time. If we say it out loud, we gain time.”

The politician contrasted Budapest's own approach with that of Brussels, pointing to stricter migration controls, a family policy tied to employment, and a tax system that, he said, supports jobseekers.

Orban's criticism, while sharply worded, taps into broader concerns which have been echoed by economists and analysts. Experts from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions have warned that the EU risks long-term stagnation.

The IMF projects euro-area growth at just 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, while public debt remains near 90% of GDP and deficits continue to exceed 3%, well above pre-pandemic levels.

The EU is not going to impose tariffs on imports from India and China in spite of US President Donald Trump's request, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with Le Soir published on Sunday.

Earlier this month, the US President called on Brussels to introduce tariffs of up to 100% on Indian and Chinese goods, similar to those introduced by Washington. Trump argued that the move would increase financial pressure on Moscow to halt the Ukraine conflict by isolating countries that maintain economic ties with Russia.

”The EU will make its own decisions,” von der Leyen said, emphasizing that the bloc's latest package of “ambitious and substantial” sanctions is enough to bring Russia to the negotiating table.

She emphasized that the “increasingly complex geopolitical environment” forces the EU member states to “strengthen their partnerships based on shared interests,” adding that “closer cooperation between the EU and India is more essential than ever.”

She also said the bloc would continue to coordinate efforts on both sides of the Atlantic as well as with the G7 countries to help bring the Ukraine conflict to an end.

Brussels has reportedly included twelve Chinese and three Indian entities in its 19th sanctions package for allegedly helping Russia bypass previously introduced Western restrictions.

Washington, meanwhile has targeted trade with India and China.

In late August, the US imposed a 25% punitive tariff on India, bringing total import duties to 50% on most goods, citing its failure to curtail purchases of Russian oil. New Delhi's Foreign Ministry called the move “unfair and unjustified.”

Tariffs on Chinese goods had reached as high as 145%, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory duties of up to 125%. After both sides agreed to temporarily lower the rates to 30% and 10% respectively earlier this year, they extended the tariff pause until November.

US president to speak at event in Glendale, Arizona, as number of rightwing commentators including Steve Bannon and Elon Musk attend

Students who debated with Kirk: ‘His goal was to defeat us'

US right claimed free speech was sacred – until the Charlie Kirk killing

Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service.

Trump, alongside other high-profile cabinet members including JD Vance and defense secretary Pete Hegseth, are set to deliver remarks on Kirk.

In the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life's work – “when people stop talking, that's when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.

Kirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.

Kirk applied basic rules of civility to his debate style, asking opponents their name and saying it was nice to meet them. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. But his critics are taking issue with any version of his legacy that does not account for the bigoted nature of his arguments. They are also closely examining his very style of debate.

“I don't think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truth,” said Mason, a 26-year-old graduate student who debated with Kirk on the YouTube show Surrounded last fall. “I think Charlie came to debates to verbally beat his opponents.”

Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service.

Trump, alongside other high-profile cabinet members including JD Vance and defense secretary Pete Hegseth, are set to deliver remarks on Kirk.

Here are some images coming through the newswires from State Farm stadium as Charlie Kirk's memorial service goes under way:

at the State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona

Many people traveled far and wide to pay tribute to Charlie Kirk in Glendale on Sunday. Among them was Eddie Wallin, a 30-year-old from Sweden who crossed the Atlantic to honor the slain organizer.

His journey took him from Sweden to Texas, where he rented a car and said he drove 17 hours straight to make it to Glendale in time for the memorial. He subsisted on bananas and other sugary provisions to keep him alert.

Wallin, wearing a white shirt emblazoned with “Freedom,” said he had first met Kirk in 2019, during a trip to Texas. He recalled that Kirk, smiling, told him he'd never thought he'd meet a Swedish conservative. Six years later, Wallin said he encountered Kirk again during the 2024 presidential election and was surprised when the organizer, by then a hugely prominent figure in Maga politics, remembered him.

“After so many years he remembered me,” Wallin said. “I will remember him for my whole life.”

at the State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona

For much of the morning, attendees in the packed stadium have been listening to Christian worship music.

Many sang along with the lyrics, while some raised their hands and swayed. It's a striking contrast from a Trump rally where the play list often features Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA, the Village People's YMCA and Luciano Pavarotti's“Ave Maria”.

The event, like Turning Points itself, has blended faith and politics for a new generation of conservatives.

Chris Tomlin, a Christian music singer, is singing now along with the audience, which joins him for the refrain: “You will always be holy / holy forever.”

As he left the White House for Phoenix this morning, Donald Trump praised Charlie Kirk's mobilization of college students through Turning Point USA, the organization that he founded instead of going to college himself.

“For a young man, he did a great job, a tremendous job,” Trump said. “He had a hold on youth because they loved him. They respected him. And if you go back 10 years, those colleges were dangerous places for conservatives. And now they're hot. They're very hot. Just like this country is hot.”

As our colleague Alice Speri reported, TPUSA has over 900 chapters on college campuses and claims to have “incubated” more than 350 rightwing influencers over the years.

Kirk himself, however, was broadly unpopular among college students, according to polling after his death. Research done for Puck last week revealed that 70% of students surveyed, at community colleges, technical colleges, trade schools, and public and private four-year institutions, said that they disagreed with Kirk's views. Just 30% said they agreed with what he had to say.

All around the arena are black and white photos of Charlie Kirk, with his wife, Erika, and their children. One shows him tossing a Maga hat into the crowd and several of him speaking.

Emotions were raw in the stadium, as the band played a lengthy instrumental interlude and the camera panned the crowd, which rose to its feet, holding red, black and white signs that said “Turning Points.” One group held a poster with a sketch of Kirk and the biblical verse, “Here I am Lord. Send me.”

Loud applause rang out when the monitor showed an image of Kirk. An announcer called Kirk a “our friend and hero”.

Charlie Kirk's memorial service is set to begin shortly.

Among the notable speakers include Donald Trump, JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

Kirk's wife, Erika, is also due to deliver remarks.

Officials and prominent Maga world influencers are filling the arena.

Congresswoman Lauren Boebert was among those who have arrived. Conservative activist Scott Presler posed for photos and Steve Bannon was spotted being escorted around into the venue. Elon Musk said on X he was in attendance.

Credentialed alongside the traditional press corps are several new media podcast hosts, YouTubers and young influencers, including some children – a testament to his vast influence on young conservatives.

In the days leading up to today's memorial service, AI-generated tributes to Charlie Kirk, which appeared to present his own commentary from beyond the grave, filled the internet and were even played during services at megachurches.

One of the first to appear was a reassuring message in an AI clone of Kirk's voice that was created within hours of Kirk's death and then played last Sunday at Dream City church, the Phoenix megachurch where Kirk worshipped, and held political events, including a Trump rally in 2020.

Dream City Church in Arizona played the AI of Charlie Kirk on a Sunday as if he was speaking to them at their church service from beyond the grave. This is evil people. It is necromancy. pic.twitter.com/QIEhJa8bXE

One of the many AI-generated messages created immediately after Kirk's death was a video shared by a far-right English nationalist that pictured him with an angel's wings, urging his supporters to double down on support for Israel, and vilifying supporters of Palestine, including an AI-generated image of a scowling Greta Thunberg.

🙏🏼This tribute to Charlie Kirk  was forwarded to me by a follower. He's definitely looking down on us all🕊️❤️So keep up the fight, stand up, speak out peacefully and let's Unite The Kingdom tomorrow 🇬🇧🇺🇸🇮🇱 @TRobinsonNewEra pic.twitter.com/y2tcXOJMQm

In the emotionally and politically charged days since the killing of Charlie Kirk, the rightwing youth activist who was a close ally of Donald Trump, one statement has loomed large. On Monday, the US attorney general – the official in charge of the rule of law in America – said that the Trump administration would “absolutely target” those who espouse “hate speech” about Kirk.

Unlike in many other countries, hate speech is protected by US law unless it incites imminent violence or constitutes a true threat. But that did not deter the nation's top law enforcement officer, who also suggested that – for example – a print shop employee who refused to print flyers memorializing Kirk could be “prosecuted”.

Since Kirk was shot to death while speaking to college students in Utah earlier this month, the US has been gripped by a bitter debate about the relation between political speech and violence. Bondi later walked back some of her remarks, in part because of criticism from other conservatives worried about the reframing of “free speech” as “hate speech”. But Trump, JD Vance, White House adviser Stephen Miller and other top Republicans have framed Kirk's death as the consequence of what they claim is unchecked and violent rhetoric, which they blame on the left wing alone.

It is a remarkable turn from prominent American conservatives, who until Trump's return to power in January had long complained of a censorious leftwing “cancel culture” but now seem happy to reframe that, too, as “consequence culture”.

Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she has been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. This morning, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service.

She said she appreciated Kirk's willingness to debate anyone regardless of their politics or background. “He didn't sugarcoat anything,” she said. “He just wanted to be heard and he wanted everybody to be heard.”

Sawick said going forward she hoped more Americans would accept – even if they don't support – the president and his message. “I want people to get behind our president,” she said. “There's nothing wrong with making America great again.”

The FBI has restricted the airspace surrounding State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona, ahead of Charlie Kirk's funeral service.

In a post on X, the FBI said:

“All aircraft operators are reminded to check and verify FAA Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) before every flight. Drone operators who enter the restricted areas without permission could face drone confiscation, fines and potential criminal prosecution.

Pursuant to federal law, the FBI and/or other federal partners may take security action that results in the interference, disruption, seizure, damage to or destruction of any drone deemed to pose a credible safety or security threat.”

Jeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, came with a group of friends from Orange county on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Charlie Kirk's life and legacy.

“What you're seeing here is not just a tribute to his movement, you're seeing a revival of his message: faith, family, freedom,” Barke said, gesturing to the swelling crowd of supporters. Though only 31, Kirk left a lasting spiritual and political legacy, Barke said.

“I think every one of us needs to be a bit more uncomfortable than we're used to in spreading Charlie's message,” he said, pledging to use his own platform and social media presence to do so.

Thousands of people lined up early to fill a football stadium in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where the US president, Donald Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and other prominent Maga allies will pay tribute to the slain conservative activist. 

Here are more pictures from the newswires of people arriving inside the venue and a first look at the stage setup:

Marjorie Taylor Greene has also issued a tribute to Charlie Kirk ahead of his memorial service.

Writing on X, the Georgia representative said:

“Today hundreds of thousands of people are gathering at State Farm Stadium in Arizona to remember and honor the life of Charlie Kirk. Simultaneously what is really happening is a revival. Through Charlie, people are meeting Jesus. Welcome to church!”

Charlie Kirk was shot while speaking at the campus of Utah Valley University, near Salt Lake City, as part of the American Comeback tour, which is hosted by the university's Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter and was attended by as many as 3,000 people, according to Jeffrey Long, the police chief at the university.

Kirk had pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for Donald Trump's unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement's ideological agenda.

“Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education.

Thousands of people wearing red, white and blue are pouring into State Farm Stadium in Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix. Lines snaked several blocks earlier this morning before sunrise in the desert, where temperatures were expected to near 100 this afternoon.

Inside, many followers of Kirk, the vast stadium was dotted with red MAGA hats and American flags. Seats began to fill hours before the official program was due to begin. Some supporters were already in tears as they listened to a Christian rock group that was performing on stage.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President Trump recently struck an unprecedented deal with Nvidia that lets the company sell its H20 GPUs in China, so long as the government gets a 15% cut of the revenue.

The Chinese government recently instructed companies not to buy Nvidia chips, citing concerns about national security and alleged violations of its antimonopoly laws.

Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar initially estimated that Nvidia could see $56 billion in revenue from China next year after President Trump lifted H20 export restrictions.

Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably the most important company in the world because its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Indeed, Forrester Research analysts recently commented, ""Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.""

However, President Donald Trump has dragged Nvidia into his trade war with China, and political crossfire has been a constant problem for the company. Both countries have used national security as justification to restrict the sale or purchase of the company's products, and investors recently got some more bad news on that front.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Nvidia took a $4.5 billion write-down in the first quarter, when President Trump extended export restrictions to include H20 graphics processing units (GPUs). Those semiconductors, scaled-back versions of the H100 GPU and H200 GPU, had been designed specifically for Chinese companies in compliance with Biden-era export controls. So, Nvidia was left with inventory it could not sell when Trump changed the terms.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly insisted that export bans would not slow progress in China, the second-largest artificial intelligence (AI) market in the world, but would instead stifle U.S. technology leadership. Nvidia commented on social media, ""For the U.S. to win the AI race, America's full-stack platform must remain the global standard.""

Interestingly, while the president cited national security as grounds for export controls, he made a deal with Huang in July that allows Nvidia to sell H20 GPUs in China, provided the government gets 15% of sales. The unprecedented arrangement raised questions about whether the national security risks were a gambit for Trump to exert influence over the private sector or whether he is prioritizing business interests over national security.

Regardless, Trump's decision to lift the export restrictions was a win for Nvidia. Huang says the AI market in China is currently a $50 billion opportunity and is growing at a rate of 50% annually. That means the company could earn hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by the end of the decade if it can supply Chinese customers with AI infrastructure.

Shortly after Trump negotiated a revenue-sharing arrangement with Nvidia, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made comments that upset Chinese authorities. ""We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best stuff. I think fourth best is where we have come out,"" he told CNBC. ""So, you want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.""

While nothing about Lutnick's statement is particularly surprising -- it is widely known that the H20 GPU is a scaled-down version of more powerful accelerators like the H100 and H200 -- his choice of words and callous delivery rankled leaders in Beijing. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese government told companies to stop buying H20 GPUs due to national security concerns. Nvidia has since halted production of the chip, according to The Information.

More recently, the Chinese government accused Nvidia of violating its antimonopoly laws when it acquired networking specialist Mellanox in 2020. In turn, Beijing's top cybersecurity regulator urged Chinese companies not to buy RTX Pro 6000D chips, which are designed to support industrial AI workloads. Instead, China is pushing its companies to rely on homegrown hardware from companies like Huawei.

Indeed, while Alibaba Group, Tencent, and TikTok-parent ByteDance have historically been major buyers of Nvidia hardware, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that those companies are now leaning more heavily on domestic chips. That is undoubtedly bad news for Nvidia and its shareholders because it means China is unlikely to be a material source of revenue anytime soon.

For context, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar estimated that Nvidia would earn $56 billion in revenue from China next year. But that outcome now seems very unlikely given the political tension between the U.S. and China. Indeed, the way the winds are blowing, some analysts question whether Nvidia will see any revenue from China next year.

Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the memorial service for the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Plus, a new $100,000 fee for visa applications for skilled workers in the US sparks confusion. Follow DW.

US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, are due to deliver remarks at Kirk's memorial service, according to a program from conservative organization Turning Point USA.

The memorial on Sunday has drawn thousands of people. The stadium where the memorial is taking place is large enough to accommodate up to 73,000 people.

Plus, the White House has clarified that a new $100,000 fee on visas for skilled workers only applies to new applicants and not to current visa holders.

Keep reading for the latest on Charlie Kirk's memorial service and other news related to the Trump administration on September 21:

The Charlie Kirk memorial is about to begin with US President Donald Trump set to address tens of thousands of those in attendance.

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead on a Utah campus on September 10.

The memorial service for Kirk has attracted tens of thousands of mourners, among them Vice President JD Vance and senior White House officials. 

Vance will speak at the event, as will Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.

""We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,"" said Trump as he left the White House en route to Arizona.

The event is being held amid heightened security measures, with attendees reportedly being subjected to airport-style checks as they filed into the venue.

The US is on a ""path to a dictatorship,""  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday.

The New York Senator's remarks come a day after Donald Trump called for the Justice Department to take action against US president's foes.

Trump had urged the Justice Department on Saturday to take action against his perceived enemies.

Schumer told CNN that turning the agency ""into an instrument that goes after his enemies, whether they're guilty or not... is a real threat to democracy.""

Earlier this week, Trump suggested the licenses of TV networks that criticize him should be revoked.

A group of American lawmakers told China's Premier Li Qiang that both sides need to do more to ""break the ice"" during a rare visit to Beijing.

Delegation leader Adam Smith, a Democrat, said that both side were in agreement about the overarching aim of the visit.

""Certainly, trade and economy is on the top of the list ... (but also) we're very focused on our military-to-military conversations,"" he said in opening remarks.

The visit marked the first time a delegation from the US House of Representatives has visited China since 2019. In the meantime, high-ranking US officials have made multiple visits to Taiwan, angering Beijing.

""We need more of those types of exchanges, and we are hoping, to your words, that this will break the ice and we will begin to have more of these types of exchanges,"" Smith told Li.

Li also welcomed the engagement.

""It is important for our two countries to have more exchanges and cooperation, this is not only good for our two countries but also of great significance to the world,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump threatened Afghanistan of consequences if the Taliban-controlled country did not ""give Bagram Airbase back.""

""If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!"" the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.

The threat came just days after he proposed the idea of taking over the base once again while he was on a visit to the United Kingdom. US had left the base when its troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021.

""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Responding to a question about sending US troops back to retake Bagram, Trump said, ""We won't talk about that, but we're talking now to Afghanistan, and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don't do it, you're going ot find out what I'm going to do.""

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty have on several occasions raised concerns of systematic human rights abuses by US forces at Bagram, especially pertaining to detainees in Washington's ""War on Terror.""

US President Donald Trump on Saturday publicly urged the Justice Department to take action against his enemies, a move that critics say have crushed the institution's autonomy.

In an angry social media post addressing ""Pam"" (apparently Attorney General Pam Bondi) Trump called out the lack of legal action against California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats.

""We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,"" Trump said.

After firing Erik Siebert, the federal prosecutor who was overseeing the probe into James on Friday, Trump appointed his former attorney and White House aide Lindsey Halligan as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

""Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as Attorney General of the United States. She is very careful, very smart, loves our Country, but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, like my recommendation, Lindsey Halligan, to get things moving,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, announcing his decision.

The White House said that an agreement is likely to be signed with video platform TikTok in the coming days.

Details about TikTok's future in the United States ""have already been agreed upon,"" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told US broadcaster Fox on Sunday.

""Now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,"" Leavitt said.

TikTok's operations in the US have come under fire amid concerns about user data that critics of the app claim could be used by the Chinese government to influence public opinion and sway elections.

However, TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have rejected this.

Leavitt said that, under the deal, TikTok would be ""majority-owned by Americans in the United States. There will be seven seats on the board, that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans.""

""The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,"" Leavitt continued.

The killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has sent shockwaves through the US political landscape, galvanizing part of President Donald Trump's base.

Trump vowed to crack down on the ""radical left"" following Kirk's death, and also pledged to classify the ""Antifa"" movement as a terrorist organization.

Kirk, who Trump described as a ""martyr for truth,"" has also served as a rallying cry for far-right and right-wing populist parties around the world.

Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, blamed the death on the ""liberal-progressive left,"" declaring, ""We must stop the hate-mongering left!"", while Jordan Bardella of France's far-right National Rally spoke of a ""poison that eats at our democratic societies"" arising out of the ""dehumanising rhetoric of the left.""

Also in the aftermath of the killing, comedian Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was canceled by ABC after he suggested that the shooter may have been part of the ""MAGA"" Republican movement.

Trump has threatened to revoke broadcast licenses of TV stations he sees as adversarial towards his administration.

Other late-night comics have been particularly critical of the cancellation, with Stephen Colbert, whose own show will be discontinued in May 2026, referring to it as ""blatant censorship.""

India on Saturday expressed concern over US President Donald Trump's new plan to tighten US immigration policy by increasing application fees for H-1B visas that allow tech workers from India to work in the US.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said Saturday that Trump's plan ""was being studied by all concerned, including by Indian industry.""

Skilled talent mobility and exchanges have contributed enormously to both the US and India, the statement said.

""Policy makers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,"" it said.

The ministry warned that ""this measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families. Government hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.""

Charlie Kirk was 31 years old when he was shot dead earlier this month. Here's what to know about his life and politics, as thousands of people prepare to gather to pay their respects at his memorial service.

The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas sparked confusion among visa holders and immigration lawyers.

The White House then clarified on Saturday that the fee was going to be levied at the time of application, but existing holders of valid visas re-entering the country did not need to pay the fee.

""This is NOT an annual fee. It's a one-time fee that applies only to the petition,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X on Saturday.

According to Leavitt, current H-1B visa holders who are currently outside of the country will not be charged the $100,000 to re-enter the US.

The fee only applies to new applicants and does not apply to existing holders of H-1B visas or those applying for renewals, she said, adding that H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.

The White House said the fee was being imposed to level the playing field for American workers which it said are being ""replaced with lower-paid foreign labor.""

The memorial service for conservative figure Charlie Kirk is to be held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

The venue can hold up to 73,000 people.

Among those to attend on Sunday include President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk.

Also scheduled to speak are several Trump administration officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.

Right-wing media figure Tucker Carlson is also to attend.

Organizers said that there will be strict security screening at the event.

The memorial service is scheduled to be held at 11 a.m. local time (1800 UTC).

Prosecutors have revealed text messages that they say prove Tyler Robinson admitted to killing Charlie Kirk.

Mr Robinson, 22, has been charged with murdering Kirk, the conservative activist, shot dead at a Utah university last week.

The suspect wore an anti-suicide vest, designed to prevent prisoners from turning it into a noose, as he appeared before a judge via video link for the first time on Tuesday.

Prosecutors laid out formal charges against Mr Robinson and last week revealed messages to his transgender roommate, with whom Robinson was in a relationship, which they said amounted to a confession.

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.”

Before Kirk's funeral on Sunday, which will be addressed by Maga grandees including Donald Trump and JD Vance, his vice-president, here are the messages in full.

Mr Robinson allegedly confessed to the assassination by hiding a note for his boyfriend.

He placed the message under a keyboard at their shared home, saying he planned to “take out Charlie Kirk”, according to a text exchange.

He wrote: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard,” the messages revealed by officials said.

The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.”

After reading the note, Mr Robinson's boyfriend asked if he was joking:

In a text to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he could reach the spot in a wooded area near Utah Valley University where he allegedly hid the weapon, but he was worried about being seen by a “squad car parked right by it”.

He added that he was worried about what his father would do if he did not return his grandfather's rifle.

Later the suspect told his roommate that his father was a staunch supporter of Mr Trump.

“Since Trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard Maga,” the suspected killer wrote.

Mr Robinson had become “more political”, leaning Left and growing “more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented”, said Jeff Gray, the Utah County Attorney.

Both of Mr Robinson's parents are registered Republicans, according to records seen by The Telegraph.

The gunman left behind bullets engraved with anti-fascist messages, including: “Hey fascist! Catch!”

In a later message to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he would turn himself in and asked his roommate not to talk to the media.

			Poised and devout Erika Kirk has been violently thrust into spotlight since her husband's assassination

When 23-year-old Erika Kirk was named Miss Arizona, contenders saw her as a poised, devout woman with a sense of purpose that elevated her above the competition.

These qualities have been put to the test since her husband, the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, was shot dead while speaking to students on a university campus in Utah last week.

Mrs Kirk, now 36, has been thrust violently into the national spotlight.

In the days since her husband was assassinated and she was forced to tell her two young children that their father would not be coming home because he was “on a work trip with Jesus”, she has emerged with her sense of mission intact.

“I will never let your legacy die,” she vowed to Kirk in a tearful address earlier this week.

Friends and political strategists believe Mrs Kirk, a real estate agent who had previously kept a relatively low profile, is emerging as a political force in her own right.

On Thursday, she was named the chief executive and board chairman of Turning Point USA, her husband's conservative activist group.

Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point's chief operating officer, said she was the obvious candidate to replace Kirk at the helm shortly after her appointment.

He told The Telegraph: “Charlie and Erika are one person ... so it only makes sense for her to be leading the organisation. She carries not only his namesake but his legacy and his heart, his zeal.

“Nothing changes here. We're going to miss our friend dearly, but we are going to see his legacy live on through Erika.”

He added: “Erika Kirk has been the bravest soul I've ever seen in my entire life. I've seen people go through traumatic events. This is beyond traumatic.”

Caitlin Fitz-Maurice, who competed in the 2012 Miss Arizona pageant won by Mrs Kirk, remembered her as a young woman mature beyond her years.

Upset after placing as runner-up in the competition, she recalled Mrs Kirk encouraging her to seek out a “greater purpose”.

“I was more obsessed with trivial things – back then I wasn't really thinking about the future a lot,” Ms Fitz-Maurice told The Telegraph.

“I remember talking to her about going to law school… and her saying, you should be doing those things that matter. I remember being upset about the pageant. She was like, ‘you have a greater purpose, go for that'.”

“She really is a caring, godly person – nothing is fake. What she professes, it's how she lives,” added Ms Fitz-Maurice, who went on to study at George Washington University and qualify as a lawyer.

Mrs Kirk, who worked for real estate firm The Corcoran Group, founded the non-profit Everyday Heroes Like You, which supports under-recognised charities, several years before she claimed the Miss Arizona crown.

She later turned down an offer to become a cast member of the reality TV series Summer House, although she did appear in one episode. “She's beautiful and happens to be religious” was how she was introduced by a friend.

Raised and baptised as a Catholic, she also founded a brand of religious streetwear, selling t-shirts, hoodies, caps and blankets that displayed Bible scenes and verses.

“Every item we produce is created with intention and designed to spark and inspire Gospel conversation,” its website still states.

She met Charlie Kirk in a New York burger restaurant in 2018 for what was supposed to be a job interview but quickly turned into “banter over theology, philosophy and politics”, she later recalled.

“I'm going to date you,” he told her at the end of the meeting.

After marrying in 2021, Mrs Kirk cast herself as her husband's “helpmate” in her “biblical role” as a wife and was frequently at his side during Turning Point events.

Kirk, a Maga firebrand who seemed happiest when fighting in the trenches of culture wars, appeared almost bashful when he introduced his wife on an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show podcast.

Responding to a question about which of them was more conservative, he said without a moment's thought: “Erika.” Grinning, he added: “By far. I am a moderate compared to Erika”.

She returned to the same podcast studio – this time alone – after her husband was allegedly shot dead by 22-year-old student Tyler Robinson.

“Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith,” she said in an emotional speech. “Now and for all eternity, he will stand at his saviour's side, wearing the glorious crown of a martyr.”

She brought her husband's body home to Arizona with JD Vance, the US vice-president, on Air Force Two.

Some compared the grim journey made by the newly-widowed Mrs Kirk, who emerged from the plane with her head bowed and dark sunglasses covering her eyes, to Jackie Kennedy returning from Dallas after John F Kennedy's assassination.

Kirk, who died aged 31, was one of the most influential political figures of his generation, having the ear of Donald Trump and a major voice in the US president's Maga movement.

Turning Point USA, which he founded in 2012, has emerged as a powerful force on hundreds of college campuses.

Mrs Kirk was named its chief executive on Thursday after being urged by friends to take the reins of a movement that suddenly found itself rudderless.

Anna Scott Marsh, a lobbyist who met Kirk as a student and maintained a friendship with him for 10 years, first encountered Mrs Kirk in 2021 when she turned up to help with a political fundraiser in North Carolina.

“She was just so similar to Charlie – so kind, so gracious with her time, so intelligent. When you talk to either of them, they make you feel like you're the most important person in the room,” she recalled.

Backing her decision to take up her husband's mantle, she continued: “Staying the face of Turning Point I think would be really healing to her, and I think it would be really healing for a lot of Americans to see her strength and her tenacity.

“People honestly are kind of looking to her for it, and I know that's a huge burden to ask for her to carry. But I think that she is convicted by her beliefs, both religious and political.”

Brian Darling, a Republican strategist, said he expected Kirk's legacy to be continued through “a bigger Turning Point USA organisation”, which has reported thousands of requests for new chapters since his death.

Figures with ties to the movement told The Telegraph they were being approached by donors outraged by Kirk's murder to grow its presence.

Ms Fitz-Maurice hopes Mrs Kirk will emerge as a major political force.

“She has that fight in her, but she said she's grieving… I really do hope that she does take on his [Kirk's] legacy, and I know that she will. She's got the strength and the perseverance,” she said.

“I know people talk about it, in circles, that they hope she runs for president. I hope all those things.”

            • Australia, Canada and the UK announced their recognition of Palestinian statehood, in an apparently coordinated move that piles pressure on Israel and puts the three countries at odds with the US.
    


            • Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”



            • France plans to recognize a Palestinian state at next week's UN General Assembly as international alarm builds over the ongoing war and starvation crisis in Gaza.
    


            • Elsewhere today on the ground, dozens of people were reported killed as the Israeli military presses on with operations in the Gaza City area.
    


            Canada, Australia and the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


            The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution.
    


            The move puts them at odds with the US and deepens Israel's international isolation.
    


            We're ending our live coverage for now, but you can scroll down to look back at developments as they happened, and see here for a full round-up of today's events.
    


            A senior Hamas official has told CNN today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine is a “welcomed step.”
    


                    “Any step to strengthen the legitimate Palestinian rights, foremost among them the fully sovereign Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem and the right to self-determination, is a welcomed step,” Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, told CNN on Sunday.
                





            However, Naim added that this recognition must be “accompanied by practical measures on the ground to affirm these rights and thwart the Zionist plans that explicitly reject any Palestinian political entity.”
    


            “It must be emphasized that the highest priority now is to stop the genocide and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip and to end the humanitarian blockade on the territory,” he said.
    


For context: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine, vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


                    “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.
                





            The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years.
    


            “We did so with determination, and with diplomatic wisdom. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank.
    


            “The response to the latest attempt to force a terror state upon us in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States. Wait for it,” Netanyahu added.
    


            We're hearing now from Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar, who has condemned today's move by Australia, Canada and the UK to recognise a Palestinian state as “infuriating and immoral.”
    


            “On the one hand — it is a reward to Hamas following the October 7th massacre. It cannot be perceived as anything other than encouragement of terrorism,” Saar said in a video statement.
    


                    “On the other hand — it is a reward to the Palestinian Authority, which, as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently explained, is still engaged in ‘Pay for Slay' policies, paying terrorists — and by doing so, is also clearly encouraging terrorism and violating its obligations under the agreements with us,” he added.
                





            The foreign minister said the strong, widespread opposition in Israel towards the establishment of a Palestinian state would act as a guarantee against it.
    


            “The future of the Land of Israel will not be decided in London or Paris — it will be decided here, in Jerusalem,” Saar added.
    


            The UK, in step with Canada and Australia, has today recognized a Palestinian state, deepening Israel's isolation on the world stage amid calls to end the war in Gaza.
    


            Israeli politicians have condemned the decision.
    


If you're just joining us, take a look below at a recap on today's events so far:



            While we've been focusing on western nations recognizing a Palestinian state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said there was “some progress” in talks with Syria, raising the possibility of peace.
    


            At a cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu said: “Our victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah have opened a window to a possibility that was not even imagined before our recent operations: the possibility of peace with our northern neighbors.”
    


            “We are holding talks with the Syrians — there is some progress, but it is still premature,” Netanyahu said.
    


            Israeli and Syrian delegations met in Paris in August – the first time that the new Syrian government acknowledged direct talks with Israel.
    


            Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa has spoken of the possibility of a deconfliction agreement with Israel along the lines of a 1974 agreement that separated Syrian and Israeli forces after the war the previous year.
    


            Al-Sharaa left for New York Sunday to take part in the UN General Assembly.
    


                    Netanyahu is yet to comment on the move by Australia, Canada and the UK, but at the same meeting said “we will need to fight at the UN and in other arenas against the false propaganda directed at us, and against the calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger our existence and serve as an absurd reward for terrorism.”
                





            In his statement announcing Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada had expected the outcome would have been achieved through a “negotiated settlement.”
    


            Carney conceded the possibility “has been steadily and gravely eroded,” by the “pervasive threat of Hamas terrorism,” Israel's accelerated settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the Israeli government's “contribution to the humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”
    


            The Canadian leader cited Hamas' “longstanding rejection of Israel's right to exist and a two-state solution” as a key factor behind the move.
    


                    “Hamas has terrorized the people of Israel and oppressed the people of Gaza, wreaking horrific suffering. It is imperative that Hamas release all hostages, fully disarm, and play no role in the future governance of Palestine. Hamas has stolen from the Palestinian people, cheated them of their life and liberty, and can in no way dictate their future,” Carney said.
                





            The prime minister also criticized the current Israeli government for “working methodically” to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, through its “unrelenting policy of settlement expansion in the West Bank” and its contribution to the “humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”
    


                    “Its sustained assault in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of civilians, displaced well over one million people, and caused a devastating and preventable famine in violation of international law. It is now the avowed policy of the current Israeli government that ‘there will be no Palestinian state',” Carney said of the Israeli government.
                





            Reaction now from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has welcomed the UK's announcement that it is recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            Abbas said the recognition was “an important and necessary step towards achieving a just and lasting peace” and would pave the way for the implementation of a two-state solution, allowing Palestine to live side by side with Israel in “security, peace, and good neighborliness.”
    


            Abbas said the immediate priority was a ceasefire in Gaza, “the entry of aid, the release of all hostages and prisoners, [and] a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.”
    


            More now from Australia following its recognition of Palestine. The decision marks a “longstanding commitment to a two-state solution,” the statement from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said.
    


            “Today's act of recognition reflects Australia's longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples,” the statement said.
    


            The statement also laid out key requirements from the international community for the Palestinian Authority:
    


            Israeli politicians have condemned the decision by the UK, Australia and Canada to recognize a Palestinian state, a move that deepens Israel's isolation on the international stage.
    


            The Knesset speaker Amir Ohana dismissed Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a “modern-day appeaser who chose dishonour.”
    


            Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's far-right Minister of National Security, said the recognition was a reward for murderers and “requires immediate countermeasures: the immediate application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria and the total dismantling of the ‘Palestinian' Authority.”
    


            Judea and Samaria is the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank.
    


            Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded by saying that the time when Britain and other countries determined Israel's future was over.
    


                    “The only response to this anti-Israeli move is applying sovereignty over the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people in Judea and Samaria, and removing the foolish idea of a Palestinian state from the agenda once and for all.”
                





            Yair Golan, an Israeli politician who leads the left-wing Democrats party, said the “unilateral recognition” of a Palestinian state is “a severe diplomatic failure by Netanyahu and Smotrich — a destructive move for Israel's security.”
    


            The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which has represented the families of those taken hostage on October 7, said that it “condemns various nations' unconditional recognition of a Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to the fact that 48 hostages remain in Hamas captivity following the October 7th massacre.”
    


            There's been no statement yet from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that the United Kingdom was formally recognizing a Palestinian state and reviving hope for a two-state solution, in step with Australia and Canada.
    


                    “In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address.
                





            “That means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment, we have neither.”
    


            The British Prime Minister acknowledged that hope for a two-state solution was fading, but insisted: “We must not let that light go out.”
    


            Starmer said that recognition was not a reward for Hamas, as Israel has claimed. The UK's call for a two-state solution means that Hamas can have no future, he said.
    


            Starmer also said the immense destruction in Gaza was “utterly intolerable” and must end. Israel must stop its cruel tactics and allow aid to surge into Gaza, he said.
    


            The UK will also take further action to sanction senior figures in the Hamas leadership in the coming weeks, Starmer said.
    


            UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Sunday's decision was “an important step to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution, at a time when it is now under unprecedented threat.”
    


                    “Recognition is only one part of what must be a stronger and wider push for peace,” Cooper added.
                


                    Yvette Cooper, UK Foreign Secretary
                


            A statement from the British government said the decision “does not remove the demands the government has made of the Palestinian Authority to conduct extensive reform. President Abbas has committed to this reform, including organising new elections within a year of a ceasefire.”
    


            Australia has just followed Canada's lead in officially recognizing the “independent and sovereign” State of Palestine.
    


            “In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Affairs minister Penny Wong said in a joint statement.
    


            Australia's recognition of Palestine is part of a “co-ordinated international effort to build new momentum for a two-state solution, starting with a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages taken in the atrocities of October 7, 2023,” the statement added.
    


            Canada has announced that it recognizes the State of Palestine, in a move expected to be mirrored by the United Kingdom later today, and France and  others at the UN General Assembly this week.
    


            “Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a post on X.
    


            Carney had said in July that his country intended to recognize the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly. At the time the plan drew condemnation from Israeli officials, who painted the decision as a “reward to Hamas.”
    


            “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before Sunday's announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.”
    


            Ahead of Carney's statement, senior Canadian officials pushed back on Israel's negative reaction to the decision, telling CNN that recognizing Palestine is “not being done to confront or punish Israel.”
    


            “Our sincere communication efforts are to explain this and do everything in our power to prevent the voices that are trying to make this a confrontational gesture from gaining the day,” one senior Canadian official said.
    


            Canadian officials added that they believe recognition keeps a two-state solution in play despite Israel's open opposition to the prospect of a Palestinian state.
    


            Carney's announcement in July also provoked criticism from US President Donald Trump, who promptly suggested that the move would hurt Canada in any trade talks with the United States.
    


            As British Prime Minister Keir Starmer looks set to recognize a Palestinian state later today, Brits in London appeared split over the move.
    


            Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.”
    


                    “I'm very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today.
                





            Michael Angus, a 55-year-old charity director, disagreed. “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said.
    


            As we've reported, US President Donald Trump “disagrees” with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over recognition of Palestinian statehood.
    


            When Trump delivers the first address of his second term to the annual gathering of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, he will also be at odds with more than half of the member nations, including key allies, over the war in Gaza.
    


            The Trump administration has become increasingly isolated on the issue as the conflict nears its two-year mark. As a growing number of countries have denounced Israel's actions in the enclave, the US has not only stood by its ally but provided it with consistent political cover and military support.
    


            One of the clearest examples of the US' isolation will come tomorrow, when France and Saudi Arabia co-host a two-state solution conference, supported by 142 of the 193 UN Member States.
    


            The US is not participating in the conference and was one of only 10 countries who voted against the General Assembly resolution backing the high-level gathering.
    


            President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce that France is recognizing a Palestinian state during the conference, saying in recent days that the move would isolate Hamas. It is a largely symbolic move that some nations have taken in recent months or plan to take in the weeks ahead, and one that Trump administration officials have condemned as counterproductive to peace efforts.
    


            The UK is set to announce its recognition of a Palestinian state this weekend, and Canada, Australia and Belgium expect to join France in making the same announcement during the UN gathering.
    


            Read the full lookahead here.
    


            The UK's recognition of Palestinian statehood comes weeks after the government banned a pro-Palestinian activist group.
    


            Palestine Action is an organization that aims to disrupt the operations of weapons manufacturers connected to the Israeli government. It was outlawed by the British government in June following a security breach at the UK's largest airbase.
    


            It was founded by Huda Ammori and climate activist Richard Barnard in 2020, when the group took its first action to shut down the UK operations of Elbit Systems – Israel's largest weapons manufacturer – and stated its commitment to “ending global participation in Israel's genocidal and apartheid regime.”
    


            Since it was founded, Palestine Action has also, among other actions, occupied, blockaded, spray painted and disrupted the Israeli-French drone company UAV Tactical Systems and the global arms giant Leonardo.
    


            However, it was the group's late June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, and vandalized two Airbus Voyager refueling planes with paint and crowbars – that spurred serious government action.
    


            Days later, then-UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper – who was made foreign secretary in a recent cabinet reshuffle – designated Palestine Action as a terror group, placing it on equal footing with organizations such as Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS – sparking condemnation from United Nations experts, human rights groups, and politicians.
    


            Hundreds have been arrested trying to protest the activist group's ban.
    


            Almost 900 demonstrators were arrested in London earlier this month, marking the largest mass arrest in the English capital in decades.
    


            Dozens of people have been reported killed as the Israeli military presses on with operations in the Gaza City area.
    


            Hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. More than half arrived at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, an indication of the current focus of Israeli operations.
    


            The Palestinian Health Ministry said that over the past 24 hours 75 bodies and more than 300 injured people arrived at hospitals. The ministry - which does not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties - says the cumulative death toll as a result of Israeli military operations since October 2023 had reached 65,283.
    


            The Israeli military said Sunday “numerous terrorists who were preparing to carry out terror attacks” had been killed in the last day in the Gaza City area but did not offer a precise figure.
    


            The military added that troops had also dismantled Hamas' military infrastructure sites in the area and uncovered hidden explosives. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.”
    


An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces says more than 500,000 Palestinians have left the Gaza City area since it ordered civilians to evacuate on September 9.
    


            People in the area told CNN Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza.
    


            Some reaction now to the UK's forthcoming announcement of Palestinian statehood recognition from the Palestinian envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot.
    


            Speaking to the BBC today, he said the move meant “wrongs are being righted.”
    


            “This is more about Britain than it is about Palestine,” Zomlot said. “Palestine existed long before the Balfour Declaration, Palestine existed long before Israel.”
    


            “The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,” he added.
    


                    “I think today the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected, and when taking responsibility of that colonial era, because that era has led us directly to the genocide in Gaza today,” Zomlot added. “Today, we welcome such a historic step.”
                





For context: The Balfour Declaration expressed support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter written by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour.
    


            The Israeli government has maintained it is conducting the war in Gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law, firmly denying accusations of genocide.
    


            While France, the UK and Canada are set to become the first G7 members to recognize a Palestinian state, Germany and Italy have made it clear that they have no intention to follow suit.
    


            They and several other European governments believe recognition should be part of two-state negotations - however distant that prospect.
    


            German chancellor Friedrich Merz has been a long-time opponent of recognizing a Palestinian state and won't be attending the UN General Assembly in New York this week where France and Saudi Arabia will harness international support for the move.
    


            “The German government is not currently considering recognizing Palestinian statehood,” Merz said on Thursday in Madrid. “We continue to view such recognition as one of the final steps, not one of the first, on the path to a two-state solution.”
    


            Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni said in July that recognizing a Palestinian state before it was established could be counterproductive.
    


            “I am very much in favor of the State of Palestine, but I am not in favor of recognizing it prior to establishing it,” Meloni told Italian outlet La Repubblica.
    


            Japan has taken a similar stance and does not plan to recognize a Palestinian state at UN meetings next week, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said on Friday.
    


            He said that while Japan supports a two-state solution, it was a matter of when to recognize a Palestinian state.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has faced mounting pressure from within his own party to officially recognize Palestine as a state, with Labour MPs and voters having long voiced their horror at Israel's war.
    


            The Labour leader has been walking a political tightrope around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his party, which was mired in allegations of antisemitism under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. In 2020, the UK's human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for “unlawful” acts of harassment and discrimination during Corbyn's leadership.
    


            Having striven to win back the trust of British Jews, Starmer lost support from the left of the Labour party, which has demanded the government take a tougher stance toward Israel and criticized the police response to pro-Palestine protests after the UK's proscription of Palestine Action.
    


            In recent months, amid a mounting sense of horror over Israel's military campaign in Gaza both in the UK and globally, Starmer had found himself under pressure from his cabinet ministers to immediately recognize Palestine as a state.
    


            Previous governments had withheld from making the move, saying it must come as part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine on a two-state solution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Reports: Justice Department closed probe into Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, for accepting bag of cash","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/politics/tom-homan-investigation-closed-nyt","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 02:40:00 GMT","


            Tom Homan, now the president's border czar, was recorded last year accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash by undercover FBI agents in an investigation the Trump Justice Department later closed, The New York Times reported Saturday.
    


            The September 2024 payment arose from a probe that was not targeting Homan, The Times reported, citing people familiar with the case. Homan was investigated for potential bribery and other crimes after he agreed to help the undercover agents, posing as businessmen, secure government contracts in a second Trump administration, the report says.
    


            A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Homan accepted a cash payment in a sting operation.
    


            The cash was inside a bag from the fast-casual chain Cava, The Times reported. MSNBC first reported on the investigation.
    


            Investigators began looking into Homan after the original target of a case suggested that a payment to Homan could lead to federal border security contracts, The Times reported. On the tape of the September 2024 meeting, The New York Times reported, Homan appeared to agree to help the undercover agents win contracts if Donald Trump won reelection.
    


            The DOJ shut down the case after Trump began his second term this year, over doubts prosecutors could prove Homan — who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the president's first term — had agreed to a specific act in exchange for the cash and because he was not in a government position at the time.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the matter, which originated under the Biden administration, was subject to a full review by officials with the FBI and DOJ, who “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.”
    


            “The Department's resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed,” they said in a statement Saturday.
    


            CNN has attempted to reach Homan for comment. He told CNN affiliate WWNY in Carthage, New York, on Sunday that there's “nothing to it” when asked about reports of the investigation.
    


            Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, slammed the matter as a “blatantly political investigation” and called Homan “a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant.”
    


            “This blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using its resources to target President Trump's allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country,” she said in a Saturday statement.
    


            A career law enforcement officer, Homan served as the public face of the first Trump administration's aggressive efforts to step up immigration enforcement before retiring in 2018.
    


            After leaving government, he became a Fox News contributor. He also contributed to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president, which Trump distanced himself from during his campaign.
    


            In a sign of his influence in Trump's orbit, Homan addressed the Republican National Convention in July 2024. Speaking from the stage in Milwaukee, Homan warned immigrants who “Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law: You better start packing now. You're damn right.”
    


            Less than a week after Trump won reelection, he announced Homan would serve as his administration's border czar.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports on the charges facing a man allegedly found with a gun and knife at Charlie Kirk's memorial site on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk is set to be honored Sunday at a massive public memorial service that will include speeches from President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

The memorial service for Kirk, who was assassinated on Sept. 10 during the first stop of Turning Point USA's ""The American Comeback Tour"" at Utah Valley University, is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors, including senior White House officials and young conservatives influenced by the late 31-year-old.

Trump said he would attend Sunday's memorial in Arizona to honor Kirk, though he admitted ""there are no words to really describe what happened.""

""He had just an army of young people,"" Trump said, describing Kirk's influence on young conservatives. ""They loved him so much. I mean, they're devastated right now. Everybody is devastated.""

Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded in 2012, released guidelines Saturday night for those attending the service, including a patriotic dress code and a strict no-bag policy.

The memorial, titled, ""Building a Legacy: Remembering Charlie Kirk,"" will begin at 11a.m. local time (2p.m. ET) and is ""first come, first served based on stadium capacity,"" according to the event website.

More than 100,000 heavy hearts are set to converge on Arizona's State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., today to commemorate the life of Charlie Kirk — the fiery young activist who ignited fierce loyalty, sharp, yet civil debate, and whose shocking assassination has left a movement in mourning.

Those in attendance at Kirk's service, which begins at 11 a.m. local time in Glendale, will hear from Republican political heavyweights including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, close allies, and family members who will pay tribute to the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA.

Kirk's widow, Erika, will speak about his legacy and her new role at the helm of the powerful national organization he built. The service is anticipated to be both a moment of mourning and a declaration of continuity, signaling how his movement intends to carry forward without its founder.

Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The gathering was the first stop on TPUSA's planned ""American Comeback Tour,"" and, at first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

The charismatic Kirk, known for his signature debates on college campuses, sat beneath a white tent emblazoned with the slogan ""Prove Me Wrong,"" taking open-mic questions from a crowd of thousands. Moments later, a single shot ended his life.

SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES OVER SECURITY LAPSES SURROUNDING CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING

In the wake of his death, many Americans are learning for the first time of the unlikely rise of the young activist who vaulted from obscurity in suburban Illinois to become a defining voice for a generation of conservatives and one of the movement's most formidable power brokers.

At 18, Kirk dropped out of community college to co-found Turning Point USA. By his mid-20s, he became the youngest speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2016 and a household name in conservative circles. By 31, he commanded a $95 million political empire, galvanized millions of followers online and established a direct line to Trump.

His death leaves behind an energetic movement that indisputably reshaped conservative youth politics.

With backing from Republican donors like Foster Friess, Kirk turned the scrappy campus operation into one of the fastest-growing conservative nonprofits in America. Today, it's a political juggernaut — its revenue, according to tax filings, soared from just $2 million in 2015 to $85 million in 2024.

Add in revenue from its political action arm, Turning Point Action, and the haul climbs well above $95 million.

After his death, TPUSA has seen a massive surge in inquiries for new college chapters as the organization works to advance Kirk's vision.

Andrew Kolvet, executive producer of ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" said the organization has received more than 54,000 requests to establish new campus chapters in the week since the assassination — a surge that would add to its existing network of 900 nationwide.

He also told Fox News Digital that he has ""personally received hundreds of offers to work"" for TPUSA.

Kirk's widow, recently tapped to head the organization, vowed to carry on her husband's mission in her first public comments since his death.

""To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die,"" Kirk said on Sept. 12. ""I refuse to let that happen. No one will ever forget my husband's name. And I will make sure of it. It will become stronger. Bolder. Louder and greater than ever,"" she added.

Kirk said that TPUSA's annual ""AmericaFest"" conference in Phoenix this December will continue as scheduled.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Major House GOP players head for retirement or higher office","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3816384/major-house-republican-players-exit-higher-office-retirement/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Major House personalities head for the door as 2026 rolls around, leaving many wondering how the lower chamber will change with these shifts. 

The House Republican caucus comprises many different factions that bring their own concerns to the table, often making Speaker Mike Johnson's job the “hardest job in Washington” when aiming to appease each of these factions, given his ultra-slim majority. Many key leaders in each faction will head for their next adventure, leaving a gap for new voices. 

Many House members have planned to leave Congress by launching bids for higher office in 2026 or retiring. Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA), who announced his gubernatorial bid earlier this year, told the Washington Examiner that he expects more members to quit as the midterm elections approach. 

“There's a lot of institutional knowledge leaving, that's never a good thing for the institution,” Feenstra said. “However, I do believe in term limits that people should serve a total of 12 years in the House and so those that are leaving after that, I think that's a good thing to bring in new blood is always good.”

Many House members eye the upper chamber, with Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY), Mike Collins (R-GA), Ashley Hinson, Buddy Carter (R-GA), and Barry Moore (R-AL) are seeking a Senate seat. Others are throwing their hats into a gubernatorial race, as Reps. John Rose (R-TN) and John James (R-MI) look to move back home.

Two major fiscal hawks are heading for the door as Reps. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and Chip Roy (R-TX) eye higher offices, as both sit on the powerful House Rules Committee. Norman launched his gubernatorial bid in South Carolina earlier this year, as Roy has been campaigning to be Texas's next attorney general. Both members are known to hold their votes during many large, contentious votes in an effort to get more spending cuts. 

“I just think a lot of us who have been up here trying to fight the fight for the American people, there's reasons for us to take that fight home to our states,” Roy told the Washington Examiner. “Whether you're talking about Andy Biggs or Byron Donalds or myself or Ralph Norman or others that are running statewide.”

“We recognize that a lot of the decisions that affect the people we represent are back home in our states, and there's a lot more work left to be done in Texas and the other states and to carry this whole fight forward,” he continued.

Another fiscal hawk, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), has entered what is considered a “toss-up” race to be Arizona's next governor.  

One of the first House members to jump into a gubernatorial race was Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), who is vying to succeed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), who ran for president in 2024 and is term-limited come 2026 in a seat that is considered “solid Republican.”

Longtime foreign policy hawk, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), is slated for retirement after two decades in Congress. McCaul is one of the most influential voices from the massive Texas delegation, leaving large shoes to fill. The Texas Republican was term-limited in chairing the committees he led, saying that this is the right time to leave. McCaul is not the only Texas Republican heading for retirement; Rep. Morgan Luttrell announced his retirement from Congress after just two terms.

South Carolina is shaping up to be a competitive governor's race as Norman and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) threw their hat in the ring. Norman told the Washington Examiner he is confident he could beat Mace.

“Competition is good, you give people a choice,” Norman said earlier this year. “That's what made the country great, and I love the competitive part.”

Mace is a major personality in the House, often ruffling the feathers of both sides of the aisle as she is known to target members regardless of their party. This week, Mace aimed to censure Rep.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) is teasing her gubernatorial run against Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) after her nomination for President Donald Trump's Cabinet was pulled over the slim House majority. The New York Republican is a close ally of Trump and has taken jabs at Hochul in recent months.

On the other end of the caucus, Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) jumped into the race earlier this year, after hinting for months, to be the next governor of South Dakota, as the sitting Gov. Larry Rhoden (R-SD) has yet to announce his future plans. Johnson is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, often serving as a moderate voice to leadership. 

“Washington functions better when both sides work together on policies that will benefit the American people,” Johnson said on the Problem Solvers Caucus website. “I'm proud to be a part of a team focused on bridging divides rather than encouraging them.”

Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) also heads for retirement after winning his ultra-competitive seat five cycles in a row. He held on to his Nebraska seat, anchored to the blue city of Omaha, last year even as Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by nearly 5 points. Each cycle, he is consistently rated as one of the most endangered House Republicans. The Nebraska Republican credited his success to a “killer instinct” last month in an interview with the Washington Examiner. 

“I just wasn't sure I was going to have the intensity for a sixth run,” he said.

Bacon's retirement instantly makes his district more of a pickup opportunity for Democrats, who must net just three seats to retake control of the House next year. It could also mean one fewer centrist Republican in a chamber that continues to become more polarized. 

As these key players and personalities head for the door, “new blood” will take their seats, bringing their own personality to the lower chamber. House Democrats also face a major wave of retirements and turnover for higher offices following the party's major loss in 2024, which will lead to a shake-up in the makeup of both sides of the aisle in the House. Although Democrats also face members leaving, only 11 Democrats are leaving now compared to the 17 Republicans.

But these numbers are not set in stone. More retirements and campaigns are expected before the 119th Congress comes to a close. Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA) is weighing a Senate bid to run against incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) would be under consideration for Sen. Marsha Blackburn's Senate seat should Blackburn become governor. 

JOSH SHAPIRO CALLS TO NOT ‘CHERRY PICK' POLITICAL VIOLENCE TO CONDEMN 

“These are not supposed to be permanent jobs,” Roy told the Washington Examiner. “You're not supposed to come up here for 40 years, notwithstanding the fact people do. I think you come up here, you serve and go back home, that's the way it was designed, so I'm good with it. New blood is good.

“I think that will carry forward the fight up here, with or without me or anyone else,” he concluded. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Whose daddy is paying for all this?

Ole Miss, as is perhaps well known, is in the heartland of beautiful girls. We know this to be true if we are followers—however casually—of something called RushTok, and we know it to be enduringly true because the above sentence was written by Terry Southern in 1963, in “Twirling at Ole Miss,” which was published in Esquire and then included in Tom Wolfe's essential 1973 anthology, The New Journalism. Let it be therefore established that among the various subcultures of the Deep South, even one as cotton-candy thick and Jolly Rancher wide as sorority rush is worthy of journalistic attention.

RushTok, which took off four years ago and chronicles the adventures of young women rushing the powerhouse sororities of southern universities, is now in its late-baroque phase. (Joan Didion was repeatedly told she arrived “just in time” when she went to study the San Francisco–hippie movement in 1967. “The whole fad's dead now, fini, kaput.”) Those of us who got in at the beginning were observing something being freshly transformed into content, still trailing mists of its previous, unobserved state. This was before sorority rush was turned into reality television and podcasts and exposés and brand endorsements, and before the introduction of new characters, such as rush mothers and rush coaches, and before rush became a launch pad not only to a successful social life but also to a chance at TikTok stardom and the busy, profitable life of an influencer.

Some of the most popular content on RushTok is the OOTD (“outfit of the day,” a term of the young) worn by the PNM (“potential new member,” a term of the old, emanating, one assumes, from the managerial class up there at the organizations' national offices and at the almighty National Panhellenic Conference). The commitment to a dominant style by these southern PNMs is as unvarying as it was in the days of the imperial espadrille and the gold-circle pin, but in its substance, that style has changed completely. Only the mildest trace of southern prep remains, the rest replaced by its opposite: pure femininity. The new look is Hilton Head brunch, country-club Tennessee. It's sexy, but in a sense it's more of a mood than a look: a little bit pampered, a little bit willful.

The outfits are composed of bright little wisps of clothes worn with sparkly rain showers of delicate jewelry: bangle bracelets clacking together, Kendra Scott jewelry—delicate must-haves with colored stones functioning more as amulet than as embellishment. The look is headbands, blowouts, lots of extensions, and enough bleachy highlights for an advancing army of blondes. We are face-to-face with “conventional beauty standards,” but we are alone with our phones and can freely think, Conventional though they may be, these girls look pretty good.

On an OOTD video, the PNM—alone or taking turns in groups of three or four—stands in front of the camera, tapping a finger against every single thing she's wearing and reporting where she bought it. She likes lacy, girly dresses from LoveShackFancy, which seems to have a symbiotic relationship with RushTok: Over the past four years, it has become a major brand. She loves a venerable Alabama vendor called the Pants Store (“They started buying pants from me and they just called it ‘The Pants Store,'” its founder said), which now includes a Rush Shop selling whimsy in the form of pastel rompers and minidresses with polka dots and ruffles. She likes canvas sneakers, flip-flops, loose shorts with tight belts, and blinding-white T-shirts. She likes hot orange and royal blue and lilac: madras deconstructed, an unwitting evocation of decades past.

There's a strong preference for cheap fashion from mass retailers, which are named without a trace of shame or of the bargain hunter's savvy. My shoes and earrings are Amazon, she'll say. My belt is Zara; my skirt is Shein. (Shein's extremely short, beaded miniskirts owned rush on a national level this year, and you don't want to be one second over the age of 22 if you try to wear one.)

If fast fashion provides the undercoat, the paint itself has many expensive touches. The girls love David Yurman bracelets in the famous cable style, which actually is preppy and starts at $275. (In fact, that bracelet is an economic indicator of whether you should be rushing at all: At Alabama, the average new-member fee is almost $5,000.) Golden Goose sneakers are still, somewhat witlessly, very popular. (Do they not know that the Ageist, a magazine dedicated to the interests of “any generation above the age of 40,” ran an article three years ago reporting that “Golden Goose Sneakers Have Hit Our People”?) Most of those sneakers start at about $500 and go up steeply.

But she'll very often go from the highs of David Yurman to the airless heavens of Chanel, Tiffany, Dior, Gucci. “My necklace is Van Cleef,” one woman says, tapping what looks to be an Alhambra necklace from Van Cleef & Arpels, which is the kind of thing a rich man gives to his wife when she turns 40 or catches him having an affair—not to his 18-year-old daughter who's going to run around a college campus with it.

This isn't Dubai; it's Tuscaloosa.

Destinee Wilson runs a TikTok account that totals up the price of OOTDs, pausing the videos every time the PNM mentions an item to report its retail price:

“My dress is from Free People.” (Wilson: “$128.”) “My shoes are New Balance.” (“$90.”) “My watch is Omega.” (“$23,900.”) “My bracelet is David Yurman.” (“$495.”) “My necklace is from Tiffany.” (“$1,025.”) “These bracelets are Enewton.” (“$206.”) “This is David Yurman.” (“$250.”) “And my cute little rush bag is from Case-Mate.” (“$100.”)

The grand total for the look: $26,194.

Wilson is assiduously neutral on the question of whether these things are authentic or dupes. But why would the girls be so forthcoming about Amazon and Shein only to lie about Van Cleef & Arpels?

Wilson's account has received many ugly messages from people upset about its existence. That she is Black and the PNMs are almost entirely white lends some tension to her videos. Last year she made a defiant post: “I will no longer be taking down any price breakdowns,” she said. “I'm trying to destigmatize talking about money, talking about prices. Things cost money, you guys.” In August, People reported that she earns up to $8,000 a month from her social media and her storefront on Amazon, where she offers low-price alternatives to some of the items featured in the videos.

Her account feels like a revolution; it's definitely the best thing on RushTok. That she's also the assistant director of a high-school marching band in North Texas, with an Amazon wish list of things she would like for her students—glue sticks; hair spray; 21 large, white hair bows—makes its own quiet statement.

In the category of “affordable luxury” that PNMs want, one item stands tall: the Case-Mate jelly totes many of these girls use to carry everything they might need for a day—and night—of rushing. (The oil-blotting papers! The extra shoes! The portable fan, portable charger, Listerine strips, mini perfume, touch-up lip color and blush, body spray, deodorant, water bottle, auxiliary battery packs for the iPhone. Don't forget the Band-Aids and—God forbid!—the tampons.) These translucent carryalls (about $100) come in a range of colors, with coordinating grosgrain ribbons—the widest, most luxurious grosgrain ribbons you've ever seen in your life—for tying the bag closed with a big, loopy bow. The first time I saw one, I thought I would faint; it was like seeing heaven.

Rush moms are apparently fried with anxiety, and I don't blame them. My life has been rich and uncomplicated because I have only sons, but if I did have a daughter and her very first college hurdle was going to be—let's cut the shit—a beauty contest, I'd be out of my mind too.

Given how freaked out these families are about rush, I wondered how they stood up to the knives-out stress of college admission itself. But then I discovered that many of these schools aren't very hard to get into. The University of Alabama admits about 75 percent of its applicants. All you have to do is fill out an application and send in $40 and your transcript. Test scores are optional. No essay, no recommendations, no emergency calls to the marriage counselor.

In contrast, the sororities have developed a parallel, dream-time system of admission. You cannot believe how many things you have to submit to the Alabama Panhellenic Association to rush. I will say only that it includes $375, something called a “social resumé,” and a digital photograph—“preferably a headshot (no selfies).”

RushTok has hours of advice on how to conduct yourself, usually posted by young alumni of the system, one of whom explains: “You want your recruiter's first thought to be, ‘Oh my gosh, this girl is so sweet.'”

One video says: Don't get too hung up on your wardrobe; it's really not that important. What does matter? Accessories. “If you have a cool hair clip or piece of jewelry that someone can compliment you on and be like, ‘I love your necklace, that's so pretty. Where did you get it?' and you can turn that into an interesting story.” (I got it off Amazon, and—funny story—I was watching The Yogurt Shop Murders at the same time.)

The PNM must present herself as an innocent, or at least willing to approximate innocence, in part by avoiding strapless dresses and in part by never mentioning the four horsemen of recruitment apocalypse, the B's: boys, booze, bucks, and beliefs.

Politics, sex, religion, and money are what—we are often told—one was never supposed to discuss in polite society during some more restrained era of American life, so these girls will be set if they get invited to a Charleston supper club in 1957. It raises a question: What kind of future (or past) are these young women preparing themselves to enter?

Tradwives, I hear you yelp in horror. They're all going to be tradwives! 

It's true that these sorority girls are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce than the average American woman, but probably no more or less so than the young women who rushed “tent city” at Columbia. It's the college degree that is most predictive of these behaviors.

Educated and ambitious young conservative and MAGA women, such as many of those who pledge southern sororities, have every reason to consider a big professional life, a professional-class husband, and a nanny as being in their future. Some of the biggest jobs in the Trump administration are held by women, including: White House chief of staff; U.S. attorney general; director of national intelligence; secretaries of homeland security, education, labor, and agriculture; and the administrator of the Small Business Association. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, went back to work four days after giving birth and has said, “I would reject that you can't be a good mom and be good at your job.”

For a Wall Street Journal article called “The Conservative Women Who Are ‘Having It All,'” Pamela Paul interviewed more than a dozen young conservative women, all of whom said that the tradwife lifestyle was never a choice they seriously considered for themselves; Paul writes that “they always knew they wanted children and that they also wanted a meaningful career.”

One of the women she interviewed is Katie Britt, the youngest-ever Republican woman elected to the Senate. Britt attended the University of Alabama, where she was president of her sorority and of the student body.

As cowed as the Bambi-like PNMs may appear in their original videos, membership itself seems to make showgirls of them all. Have you seen the huge production numbers these places make as recruitment tools? To a pumping beat, an entire sorority appears in front of the house. The front line performs the kind of explosive, acrobatic moves we first learned about in Cheer, Season 1, while the others commence something like a Las Vegas revue from the 1980s. They look strong, sexual, unafraid of underage drinking or boys. They will not be driven out of public life easily—not after learning all those dance numbers, gathering all that bravado, and cultivating the kind of personal style that clearly opens doors these days.

The girl who more or less created RushTok and became its breakout star is Kylan Darnell. She entered rush as a freshman who had pageant experience and brought a lightly professionalized manner to her OOTD, in which she looked very young and very pretty. She eventually consolidated her extremely positive approach to life in the mantra “I hope you're having a great day, not just a good day.”

Now she is a senior, that fleeting, fragile state in which college seems at once too small for you and more precious than rubies. She recently posted a video while walking across campus in a halter top. “Y'all, my life is so weird,” she said. “It doesn't feel real. Because how do you go from being at probably the best nightclub in Vegas, sitting at the most expensive table, getting everything for free just because of the way that you and your friends look, and dancing with Heidi Klum's daughter and Marshmello”—the DJ, not the confectionery—“all at the same time that night to me having an eight-page essay due tonight?”

There was a time when this kind of exploit would horrify parents, making them fear that their daughter had become cheap, ruined. But today? Secretary of energy.

We have a sense, sometimes, that America has become so homogenized through consumer culture and generalized depravity that we've lost any sense of regionalism, of ways of speaking and doing things that are particular to only one part of the country. But rush in the SEC schools is proof that certain old southern patterns endure.

The system reinforces many long-standing southern ideals: the importance of social connections over academic excellence; the notion that strong relationships flourish in closed societies; the emphasis on regional belonging over national competition; and above all the cloistering of young white women.

We can hardly leave this subject without noticing that the sororities of RushTok are the historically white ones, although, when it comes to several of these schools, they might also be called the currently white ones. It's very hard to find a nonwhite girl in those production numbers and OOTDs.

You would think that the University of Alabama, in particular, would have some anxieties about this fact, considering that just more than 60 years ago it was where George Wallace made his most famous stand against integration, blocking the doors of an administration building to prevent two Black students from registering for classes and budging from his spot only when forced to by federalized National Guard troops.

In 2013, according to the university's student newspaper, a very qualified young Black woman rushed these sororities at Alabama and didn't get a single bid. A former director of Greek life told Time magazine that it wasn't the current sorority students who had kept her out; rather, it was pressure from alumni: “There's definitely some fear, whether real or imagined, that there would be some repercussions if a sorority took an African-American member.”

These sororities, like the historically white fraternities, stand on their members' right to freedom of association, which allows them to socialize with whomever they want. (The segregationists' rationale: freedom of association.) But after the story broke in 2013, the university ordered sororities to reopen their bidding, and offers were extended to several Black women. The university did not respond to a request to comment, but as of a few years ago, of the 7,481 women in the Alabama Panhellenic Association, just 56 were Black.

But enough of all that! We are having fun. We are looking at pretty girls dressed up in LoveShackFancy dresses. This is America in 2025, not 1963. Lighten up, reader!

The conclusion of Alabama rush is an event in which all of the PNMs open their bids at the same time and then run to their new chapter house. These buildings are giant wedding cakes, and they are fortresses, and many of them have crystal chandeliers and wide, sweeping staircases big enough for a hundred Scarlett O'Haras to make a thousand dramatic entrances.

Let us be among them, thundering across campus in our Golden Goose sneakers, tears of excitement and relief in our eyes. By midnight we have to come up with the money, but our parents are good for it. The sisters are ready for us, they're clapping us inside, and finally—finally—we can set down our heavy Case-Mate bags in the massive, marble foyer because now it is over, and now we can belong.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Bitcoin's slow ascent towards establishing new highs has continuously encountered significant opposition in the past few weeks. As the market currently stands in an uncertain zone, there are several questions and concerns about the future trajectory of the premier cryptocurrency. Below is how the latest on-chain data answers some of these questions

How $117,000 Slowed Down BTC's Rise

In a September 20 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson reemphasized his early prediction of $117,000 as a critical resistance zone for the Bitcoin price.

Wedson referenced his post published exactly a week ago, which utilized two main on-chain metrics — the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel, and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price — in reaching his conclusion.

For context, the CVDD Channel is centered around the amount of aged capital being sent into the market. This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins.

Also, the Market Mean Price is the cost basis, on average, of all Bitcoin holders. By extension, the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price is a metric that shows the average cost basis of Bitcoin, adjusted with specific Fibonacci ratios. It displays mathematical levels of extension or retracement around the Bitcoin average holder's cost.

According to the analyst, these two metrics had aligned perfectly, pointing out $117,000 as a zone where retracement was likely to occur. The convergence of these metrics showed not just the technical significance of this price level, but also reflected strong indecision in the market. 

What's Next For Bitcoin?

In the same post on X, Wedson pointed out specific price actions to watch out for in terms of Bitcoin's price progression and what a potential breach could mean.

Looking at the upside case, the analyst explained that a breakout above $118,600 would be a strong confirmation of heightening bullish momentum, which could “open the path for the next explosive move.”

Wedson also warned about a potential downside, which hinges on a break below the $113,700 support. According to the crypto founder, this support breach could lead to a swift decline of Bitcoin's value to as low as $110,000. 

A deeper correction could even drag Bitcoin to as low as $100,000—a price level that may attract institutions for accumulation. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,660, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum has long wrestled with the “non-ouroboros” problem: how to generate real revenue beyond speculative loops of buying, selling, and leveraging tokens on its chain.

For years, memecoins, non-fungible tokens, and incentive-driven decentralised finance apps have propped up activity but failed to provide a sustainable foundation for Ethereum's nearly $100 billion DeFi economy according to DefiLlama data.

Now, as Wall Street is increasingly betting on Ethereum as the backbone of the stablecoin boom, co-founder Vitalik Buterin argues that “low-risk DeFi,” which includes things like payments, savings, and collateralised lending, could finally give the network its flagship revenue engine.

“Non-financial and more experimental applications, are crucially important for Ethereum's role in the world and for its culture,” Buterin wrote in a blog post published Sunday. “But they do not need to be looked to as revenue generators.”

That's a major shift from Ethereum's earlier years, when DeFi was synonymous with double-digit yields on risky liquidity farms and frenzies over cartoon NFTs.

Buterin admits he was “more suspicious of DeFi” then, describing its main appeal as “making money from trading highly speculative tokens.”

Today, he says, the centre of gravity has moved toward simpler financial products.

The raw numbers and other analysts agree.

The supply of stablecoins on Ethereum has ballooned 700% since the start of 2021 to more than $160 billion, while real-world assets like tokenised US Treasuries have grown from almost nothing into a $9 billion market.

“Stablecoins are the ‘ChatGPT' of crypto,” Tom Lee, chair of Ethereum treasury firm BitMine, told DL News in August. “And Ethereum is the backbone. It's legally recognised, and has zero downtime.”

Bitcoin is down 0.4% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $115,440.

Ethereum is down 0.3% in the same period to $4,472.

The search for the best altcoins this week has intensified as investors look for tokens offering both stability and growth. Analysts are closely watching projects that combine strong fundamentals with momentum capable of driving returns in the current market cycle. Three names stand out across reports: Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Ethereum and Avalanche are established players with proven ecosystems and institutional interest. Their adoption, upgrades, and innovation have made them anchors in portfolios. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting the spotlight as it is listed right at the top of analyst pick lists, thereby drawing thousands of new investors who see it as the better return opportunity this week.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of the best altcoins to buy this week, capturing analyst attention. Thousands of investors have already joined the project, fueling momentum that continues to grow as the token gains visibility. This combination of grassroots support and institutional curiosity is placing MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside major names on top analyst lists.

What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is its positioning against larger, established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Avalanche. Both ETH and AVAX are respected for their innovation and strong ecosystems, but their large market caps often limit short-term upside. In contrast, analysts highlight MAGACOIN's potential for sharper returns due to its early-stage accessibility and undervalued status.

The community hype surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE also strengthens its narrative. Social channels are buzzing with discussions, and investor participation has been steadily increasing. This groundswell of interest provides momentum that analysts believe can translate into outsized performance.

By delivering a higher risk-reward profile than established giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly been flagged as a standout analyst pick. Its rise onto top lists this week underscores how both retail and institutional investors are seeking the next high-growth altcoin opportunity.

Ethereum has continued to maintain a strong position among investors with its dominating ecosystem and regular innovation. The next major upgrade in the debate is Fusaka upgrade, promising to increase transaction throughput while reducing gas fees. Analysts hope that this improvement will allow further improvement of decentralized finance platforms and the NFT industry. They are both highly dependent on Ethereum's network.

Institutional adoption is Ethereum's best asset strength. It is behind many Layer 2 scaling solutions, relieving the congestion without damaging its reputation in terms of security. With a larger developer community in blockchain, Ethereum still forms the basis for new applications across the digital economy.

Analysts believe in Ethereum's long-term course. A breakout above resistance levels could lead to a great rally, giving more impetus to the fact that it is one of the best altcoin investments this week.



Avalanche is also earning recognition as one of the week's prime altcoins to watch. Its unique multi-chain structure enables fast speeds and low costs, giving it an edge among developers and users. Compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts further strengthens its role as a practical and scalable alternative.

Beyond DeFi, Avalanche is advancing into real-world finance through partnerships with institutions like J.P. Morgan's Onyx platform. Its involvement in tokenization projects highlights its role in the growing real-world asset sector, a space gaining traction among institutions.

From a market perspective, AVAX has shown renewed momentum in recent weeks. Scheduled token burns are reducing supply, while demand continues to rise. Analysts are now moving to the price range of $42 to $45, with sentiment further aided by Bitwise filing for a spot AVAX ETF. These drivers put Avalanche on analyst lists this week.

Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all feature prominently among the best altcoins to buy this week. Ethereum ecosystem upgrades and institutional support bolster its reputation. Avalanche builds speed and scalability, and is expanding into tokenized finance. Both remain respected leaders in the market.

Yet analysts are signaling that MAGACOIN FINANCE has the greatest near-term growth prospects among the three. Its strong community hype, undervalued price, and rapid climb in analyst lists show why the momentum is moving its way. For investors seeking both stability and higher upside, these three coins represent strong choices—but MAGACOIN is standing out as the name to watch most closely right now.

Crypto traders are once again turning their eyes to altcoins as technical setups suggest that history may be repeating itself.

Market analyst Merlijn the Trader shared a chart highlighting what he describes as an “identical” structure forming in 2025, one that mirrors the explosive rallies seen in 2023 and 2024.

According to the analysis, the total altcoin market cap has been moving within a rising channel for the past two years. Each time liquidity builds near the lower boundary, sharp upward moves follow, igniting what many refer to as “altcoin season.” The pattern played out in late 2023 and again in mid-2024, with both rallies adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the sector.



The same setup is now visible again in 2025. If the trend holds, the altcoin market could be preparing for another parabolic leg, potentially driving valuations toward the upper range of the channel, around $2.4 trillion.

Merlijn stressed that liquidity flows remain the key driver behind these cycles. When Bitcoin consolidates or moves sideways, capital often rotates into smaller tokens, fueling rapid gains. He warned that ignoring these repeating structures could leave traders “chasing green candles instead of riding them.”

For investors, the outlook highlights both opportunity and risk. Altcoin rallies have historically been powerful but short-lived, often ending in sharp corrections. Traders watching for confirmation of this third leg may see September and October as critical months to gauge momentum.

If the channel structure holds, 2025 could deliver another explosive altcoin season, extending a cycle that has already reshaped the broader crypto landscape over the past two years.







CoinMarketCap's momentum tracker has flagged three tokens making significant moves this week: Aster (ASTER), THENA (THE), and Orderly (ORDER).

As the Magnificent 7 stocks soar, Bitcoin advocate Balaji Srinivasan argues the divergence marks the end of the legacy economy.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

A cursory glance at the Magnificent 7 stocks chart reveals a clear trajectory: up only. But when layered against all other stocks, an even more interesting pattern emerges. 493 stocks remain relatively flat while the Mag 7s take a steep upward grind, like climbing the Eiger. As Bitcoin advocate and founder of The Network State, Balaji Srinivasan, muses:

“My explanation is that the legacy economy is being sunset in favor of the Internet economy.”

Stripe CEO Patrick Collison ruminated on similar data, highlighting a trend emerging across Google, Apple, and Microsoft. He questioned why the companies exhibited the same growth dynamics when they are “ostensibly in totally different businesses,' to which Balaji replied:

“I think those graphs reflect the secular shift towards the Internet. Almost every action that was once done offline is moving online, and routed through tech companies.”

What's going on here? Patterns that would once have been dismissed as coincidences now seem to signal something deeper.

The “secular shift” is economist-speak for a permanent, structural change. In this case, it's the decades-long migration from offline to online across the global economy.

From grocery orders to financial transactions, human interactions, and even remote work, the COVID-accelerated rush to digital has become the main route for commerce and connection.

Balaji's response to Collison's question made explicit what many now intuitively sense: tech companies aren't just growing, they're becoming the primary infrastructure for life itself.

“Legacy” sectors like real estate, banking, and manufacturing are being reoriented, rewired, or outright replaced by software. In Balaji's words, almost every offline activity is “routed through tech companies,” as digital-first solutions offer scale, efficiency, and global reach previously unimaginable.

This is not an innovation cycle but a replatforming. It's why companies that once had nothing in common now show the same growth curves or contraction risks: the offline world is contracting, while the internet economy swells to fill the gap.

For investors and founders, these trends reinforce a simple imperative: bet on digital, or risk obsolescence. The parallel growth patterns across disconnected verticals suggest that internet penetration is now the single biggest driver of economic fate.

Tech companies, with their network effects and digital rails, become the middlemen for everything. They reinforce the winner-take-most dynamic so apparent in today's markets.

For policymakers, there's a warning: the digital divide will only widen unless deliberate intervention closes it. As more actions from life are intermediated by platforms, the cost of being unconnected grows.

The trajectory of Magnificent 7 stocks, and, in particular, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, shines a light on a future where the majority of human action runs through software. It's a world reshaped not by a single breakthrough, but by the universal, irreversible shift from meatspace to cyberspace.

The evidence is in the charts, and the trend is only getting steeper.

Seven or eight years ago, anyone consuming business tech news might have come across the phrase “the race to build autonomous vehicles.” In private conversations, company execs and startup founders I spoke to sometimes referred to the commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology as “a race.” The phrase seeped into reporting at the time — including some of my articles. 

What we've learned is that this is not a race so much as a long, curved, and fragmented road — one that looks more like the fan of an alluvial plain than a racetrack — to develop and prove the technology works and make it a profitable business. It's not a race against others as much as an internal contest with existential stakes.

But that doesn't mean there aren't real battlegrounds among those working on the technology, especially with robotaxis. Many might point to the number of cities a company has launched in as one indicator. I believe that while helpful, it's a bit too vague and easy to manipulate.

Two recent news items got me thinking about more narrow and specific battlegrounds within cities: airports and public transit.

Airports were critical to the success of ride-hailing companies. Robotaxis are no different. Today, Waymo offers rides to and from Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. And it's clearly looking to unlock more.

This week, Waymo was granted a permit to start testing its autonomous vehicles at San Francisco International Airport, ahead of the launch of a commercial service. This comes just two weeks after Waymo was cleared to start testing at nearby San Jose Mineta International Airport — and as Tesla is also trying to elbow its way into offering ride-hail service to these airports.

Meanwhile, Waymo and transit software company Via struck a deal that could have far-reaching implications for cities. Government agencies that use Via's software for public transit will be able to fold Waymo's robotaxis directly into their public transit networks. The first city will be Phoenix suburb Chandler through its Chandler Flex fleet of on-demand, shared vehicle fleet. 

This is meaningful, in terms of reach, although it may not be a cash cow for Waymo in the short term. As a Waymo spokesperson explained to me: When a traditional Chandler Flex vehicle isn't available, riders may have the choice to book a trip with Waymo. Should a person choose to ride with Waymo, Chandler Flex will direct them to the Waymo app to hail a fully autonomous ride at a reduced price of $2 or less. At such a low price, it's hard to see how this will push Waymo's balance sheet into the black. 

Still, it's an important volume play. And Via CEO Daniel Ramot indicated in one interview that he hopes this spreads to hundreds of cities.

I gave you three little birds last week, and this week … welp, none that I could verify. Don't fret — there will be more in the future.

U.K. startup Wayve has garnered buzz for locking up deals — and capital — for its generalized end-to-end approach to automated driving technology. You might recall that a year ago, Wayve raised $1.05 billion in a Series C round with SoftBank Group, Microsoft, and Nvidia participating. 

Wayve is now working on a Series D round, and it appears that Nvidia is ready to plunk down more capital. In a letter of intent, which the two companies recently signed, Nvidia said it will evaluate making a $500 million strategic investment in Wayve's next round. I spoke to Wayve CEO Alex Kendall, and he wouldn't say exactly when this round is expected to close. But he did say “we're working quickly towards it.” 

Other deals that got my attention …

Divergent Technologies was once solidly in the automotive sector. These days, the advanced manufacturing company has positioned itself as a defense company and has locked up deals with Lockheed Martin, RTX, and General Dynamics. Now it's raised $290 million, including $40 million in debt, to expand production of missile parts and other specialized components for the military.

EV Realty, a startup focused on providing charging for semitrucks, raised $75 million in a round led by private equity investor NGP. The startup will use the funds to build additional charging hubs throughout California.

Moove, the African vehicle-financing startup backed by Uber, is trying to raise more than $300 million in a round with a post-valuation of more than $2 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

XL Batteries, a Marlborough, Massachusetts-based startup developing flow batteries for energy storage, raised $7.5 million from Merrin Investors.

Hyundai Motor Group is intent on growing, and North America is central to its plan. During its investor day, the Korean automaker said it wants to increase annual sales from 4.17 million in 2025 to 5.55 million by 2030. In the short term (meaning for this year), the company shared new targets for an increase in revenue of between 5% and 6% and an operating profit margin of between 6% and 7%. 

To get there, Hyundai is investing capital, including putting $2.7 billion over three years into expanding the total production capacity of the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia. The company said “electrified vehicles” (that includes 18 new hybrid models by 2030) are expected to account for 60% of total sales, reaching 3.3 million units, with significant growth anticipated in North America, Europe, and Korea.

Rivian officially broke ground on its long-planned factory near Atlanta. 

Stellantis ended plans to produce the all-electric Ram 1500 REV pickup truck, citing low demand for full-size EV trucks; however, it's holding on to the extended-range Ramcharger, which is now confusingly being renamed to Ram 1500 REV.

Tesla said it will redesign its door handles so they're less likely to trap people inside their cars. The decision came a day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into claims that Tesla's door handles become inoperable in certain situations on Model Y SUVs. It also follows an investigation by Bloomberg that exposed the problem.

Meanwhile in Australia, Tesla recalled Powerwall 2 home batteries in the country after the company received reports of fires that led to “minor property damage.”

Uber will test using drones for Uber Eats deliveries in some U.S. markets by the end of this year, part of a new partnership with Israeli startup Flytrex.

Waymo is launching a commercial robotaxi service in Nashville in 2026, and it's partnering with Lyft to expand its reach.

Speaking of Wayve, I thought it was worth reminding y'all that the startup's co-founder and CEO, Alex Kendall, will be joining us onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. The event will be held October 27 to October 29 at Moscone West in San Francisco. Register here to join more than 10,000 startup and VC leaders at Disrupt.

Google controls the repo hence it's under the Google GitHub org.

So it could even be a pure hobby project - not something done for work - where the initial author (over a decade ago) chose to release it under Google's copyright rather than use the exception process.

The sheer amount of times that people have received everything but the high-end GPU they ordered is frankly too absurd to count at this point. We've already seen metal blocks being delivered instead of a graphics card, pasta and rice packaged inside a 5090 box, and a 5070 Ti that was actually just a bag of salt. In comparison to that, receiving just a bland ol' brick instead of an RTX 5080 seems almost uninspired, but that's exactly what happened to u/GlassHistorical5303.

Our victim (who we'll call Glass for ease) ordered a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 from the firm's official store on Amazon. Unfortunately, what they got was a brick wrapped up in the same anti-static bag that the actual GPU usually comes in. Apart from the obvious implication that someone at the factory might've swapped the card, this actually suggests that a reverse-scam was in effect here. Someone may have gotten the real 5080 they wanted, took it out of the box, replaced it with a brick, and returned it to Amazon who didn't bother to properly check the contents.

You might be wondering how a returned package could be thrown in with the new stuff that's supposed to come from PNY's official store — this is where the issue of ""commingling"" comes in. That term refers to merging items from different sellers and channels into a single, unified inventory that makes the job super easy for logistics but remains effectively untracked. All the scammer needs to do is match the box's weight, replacing the 5080 with an identically heavy brick, and the scales tip in their favor (no pun intended).

In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Either that or, of course, an Amazon worker genuinely saw the opportunity and took the GPU for themselves. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. While we often find the fiasco entertaining — top comment called this GPU-brick the ""Foundation Edition"" — it's anything but that for the end user who is now just a sitting duck to the whims of customer service.

Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma befell another customer a year ago, when purchasing from Newegg. It's because of growing scams like these that we advise people to stay vigilant, no matter where you're buying from. Especially if you're shopping used, you may not get something strange in the box, but instead a GPU that literally has no core inside it.

A 3.5-inch AIDA64 compatible model at under $11 seems more useful.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Second screens can be a great asset, and easily pay for themselves by precipitating a productivity boost. They come in all shapes and sizes, leveraging a broad range of technologies, but some products could leave you scratching your head about the best way to fit them into your setup. Especially tiny sub 1-inch screens.

A peculiar case in point we noticed today is the $2.57 WeAct Display FS, listed on AliExpress. That price point seems irresistible for a highly-portable USB interface second screen. However, its postage stamp dimensions (it has a tiny 0.96-inch diagonal screen), means it is something of a curate's egg. This tiny screen isn't going to worry the makers of the best portable monitors, but could have its niche use cases.

 




The dimensions of the WeAct Display FS are more like a typical thumb drive storage device than a portable monitor. Specifications suggest the entire device measures 43 x 14.5mm, but we don't have a thickness measurement to share.

Another significant way it strays from the portable second screen norms is that WeAct's tiny screen doesn't accept a USB-C or HDMI connection – it has a captive USB-A interface (again, like many USB thumb drives). The connector is reversible in this instance, with an insulator pad supplied for the unused side.

One side of the WeAct Display FS is almost entirely taken up by its screen. As mentioned previously, this has a 0.96-inch diagonal. Using a bit of math, we can work out that the actual screen measures ~0.429 x 0.858 inches (~10.9 x 24.4mm).

Across this tiny display, there are 160 x 80 pixels (thus a 2:1 ratio). We also know the display uses the RGB565 (16-bit) color format, delivering up to 65,536 colors, which should be ample for its touted applications.

WeAct reckons that its little Display FS device is going to be useful for both system monitor and media projection applications. Indeed, two Windows applications are supplied, which are crafted for these purposes.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

CNX Software notes that the code upon which the WeAct Studio System Monitor is based is open source. Thus, it is theoretically possible to use the WeAct Display FS and this app on systems other than Windows. Any Python supporting OS should do the trick, but you'll have to do more leg work to use this device as a tiny second screen on macOS or Linux, for example.

The origin of the WeAct Studio Screen Projection app isn't known, and it is thought to be a Windows-only app which emulates a Windows display. It is shown being configured to replay images / video from other screens. CNX Software expects it to be able to be used as a full-screen YouTube video or photo gallery playback device.

If this kind of tiny second screen has you intrigued, but the WeAct Display FS is too small for you, we spotted similar but larger devices on AliExpress. Moving the budget up to $10.76 means you could grab a 3.5-inch IPS Type-C Computer Secondary Screen, which is advertised as a great AIDA64-based system monitor (a very similar screen is $26 on Amazon). Stylishly circular 2.1-inch IPS screens with USB-C connectivity can be grabbed from $27.16 via AliExpress. But that's a significant circular premium to pay. Remember to check postage costs on AliExpress, too.

Finally, I can retire Wallpaper Engine.

Personalizing the computers we own — whether it's a phone or a proper desktop — is one of life's few simple comforts. It can bring you joy knowing that your favorite picture will greet you every morning when you start your day. Now, movements behind the Windows 11 development scene indicate that pictures could soon be exchanged for videos. Microsoft has finally added the option to use video files as desktop backgrounds in the latest Windows 11 Insider build, and it works seamlessly, as spotted by @phantomofearth on X.

Windows DreamScene is back! Hidden in the latest Windows 11 Dev/Beta build (26x20.6690) is built in support for setting video files like .mp4 as your desktop background: pic.twitter.com/B4vdtfvqScSeptember 20, 2025

As the tweet says, some of you may remember Windows DreamScene from back in the day. It was a built-in utility that allowed users to put videos as their wallpaper... up until Vista. Unfortunately, DreamScene was pulled from Windows 7 and never made a comeback officially. In the meantime, alternatives like the ever-so-popular Wallpaper Engine rose to fame and replaced DreamScene in the zeitgeist. Many modern gamers today may not even remember that dynamic desktop backgrounds used to be a native feature of the OS.

 




Fortunately, Microsoft is finally answering the community's decades-long prayers and testing this feature. It's available as part of the Windows 11 26x20.6690 Dev/Beta builds, for which you have to join the Windows Insider program. Once in, all you have to do is enable feature ID 57645315 and restart the explorer.exe process in Task Manager. After that, just open settings, and you should see .mp4, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .avi, and .webm in the list of supported file formats when you go to select a new wallpaper. Simply pick a video you want and you're good to go.

Keep in mind that this feature only works on the desktop, not on the lockscreen so you're not going to get those macOS-style aesthetic TikToks out of your utilitarian Windows system anytime soon. More importantly, though, since this is an experimental feature, there's no saying when it will actually make its way to the stable, public release channel — if at all. Similar to the native speed test button that Microsoft is trialing, this feels like a fairly iterative yet obvious improvement that we should, therefore, see go mainstream relatively soon.

Some Batch 1 units remain, ready to be snapped up, priced from $299.

The new, reinvigorated Commodore has announced that its maiden product reached a significant milestone. A few hours ago, the official Commodore account on X shared evidence that the Commodore 64 Ultimate had eclipsed the 10,000 units sold milestone. The statement also offered profuse thanks to the community.

On behalf of the entire Commodore team, a HUGE THANK YOU goes out to you, our incredible community. Hitting 10K pre-orders of the Commodore 64 Ultimate is only possible because of your passion and support.Together, we're not just reliving history, we're building the future… pic.twitter.com/l2YJmQBBgOSeptember 21, 2025

If you unfurl the embedded Tweet, above, you can see the growth in sales charted for the C64 Ultimate (all models). Things got off to a galloping start from the get-go on July 12 this year. From August, we have seen more steady progress in sales numbers. Interestingly, the chart has markers on the timeline to coincide with the ‘Let's Buy Commodore' video trilogy releases. These videos got hundreds of thousands of views (one over 400,000), so the Commodore management were obviously measuring the media impact on sales trends.

Our last report, on how Commodore successfully raked in over $2 million during the C64 Ultimate's debut week, coincided with a video release titled ‘Making History: Signing the Commodore Contract + C64 Ultimate Production Update.' We also saw a very positive blip in sales around that date. Perhaps people felt assured that Commodore was really back.

In a quick follow-up to the 10K milestone Tweet, Commodore reminded its fans that “there's still time to secure your spot in Batch 1 of the Commodore 64 Ultimate pre-orders over at https://www.commodore.net/ to make sure you'll be among the first to receive yours this year.” Pricing for this FPGA-powered retro-futuristic machine featuring the “world's first transparent keyboard circuit board” starts from $299. Readers are reminded that the “Founders Edition will be a one-time run,” and we don't have word on what will succeed it for latecomers – surely something very similar.

Retro computing fans should be cheered by this latest Commodore milestone, even if they aren't particularly interested in experiencing a modern C64. Remember, the new Commodore has quite boldly claimed that it will become a “Founder's Sandbox,” for new computer tech projects. Its roadmap will feature as many as 12 major releases over the next four years – which should be exciting for all computer enthusiasts.

EFL

Wrexham's first league victory over Norwich City being broadcast live on TV in the United States should have surprised no one.

Last season, the club owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney were the only one of the 72 EFL members to have every league fixture shown in the U.S., underlining their big appeal on the other side of the Atlantic.

Throw in the extra intrigue of USMNT striker Josh Sargent leading the Norwich attack and it really was a no-brainer for Paramount+ to make the game one of their three 3pm kick-offs shown live on Saturday.

The presence of the Missouri-born 25-year-old — rated by Phil Parkinson as “the best striker in the league” — meant this was always going to be a stiff test for a Wrexham back line who have been coughing up far too many chances since winning promotion.

It was one they passed as a tweak of formation, with two debutants in Issa Kabore and Dominic Hyam starting in a re-jigged back five, led to Wrexham deservedly prevailing 3-2.

“It's about striking a balance,” said Parkinson when asked about fielding two holding midfielders in a 3-4-2-1 setup. “Football is about trying to be secure at one end and keep the attacking threat that we'd shown so far this season.

Back of the net in Norfolk 👏

— Wrexham AFC (@Wrexham_AFC) September 20, 2025



“We set out in pre-season with the two systems but the injuries we've had meant we were unable to implement it with the personnel we wanted. This was the first chance.”

The ploy worked well.

It not only afforded Wrexham the freedom to get at their hosts, as two-goal Josh Windass and Lewis O'Brien provided excellent support for lone striker Kieffer Moore. But the defence also looked much more secure than it has all season, even allowing for the two lapses in concentration that were punished ruthlessly by Jack Stacey and Jovon Makama.

It was certainly a big improvement on the mess from the previous week, when QPR were effectively granted the freedom of north Wales in a resounding 3-1 victory that could have been even more emphatic.

Parkinson's response was to bring Manchester City loanee Kabore in for his debut at right wing-back, as Ryan Longman switched to the opposite flank. Hyam also got the nod ahead of Conor Coady at the heart of the defence, as Callum Doyle and Max Cleworth slotted in either side of the former Blackburn Rovers man.

The changes worked brilliantly. Not only did Kabore provide two stunning assists from the right flank — Windass and Longman the beneficiaries — but there was a cohesion to Wrexham's defensive efforts that had been totally lacking against QPR a week earlier.

Along with the pace and power provided by Kabore, perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the afternoon was how seamlessly Hyam slotted into the back three. He read the play well, never shirked a challenge and was a tower of strength in the air.

Considering Hyam was up against Sargent, that was no mean feat. Having been recalled to Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad earlier this month for the friendly double-header against South Korea and Japan, the Norwich captain is eyeing a place at next year's World Cup.

A glance at Sargent's metrics for Norwich points towards someone who makes the most of any service that comes his way. Prior to Wrexham's visit, his five goals had come from 121 touches of the ball spread across five games, according to Opta.

That was a goal 😆

🔴⚪️ #WxmAFC pic.twitter.com/KZ5bxruikM

— Wrexham AFC (@Wrexham_AFC) September 20, 2025



Just 21 of those had come in the opposition penalty area, suggesting a ruthless efficiency when the ball did find the striker. Those five goals had come from a mere 16 shots this season.

Moore, by way of contrast, had four goals from the same number of shots but he'd been much more involved, chalking up 195 touches including 11 headed clearances.

Against Wrexham, Sargent saw slightly more of the ball. He had a season's high 35 touches in total, including six in the opposition penalty area. And yet his three attempts came with a combined expected goals (xG) of just 0.09, underling what a good job Hyam and his team-mates did on the U.S. striker.

The one time Sargent did briefly find space from a first-half corner, a combination of Hyam and Doyle ensured he was quickly forced wide before hitting a shot that was blocked.

Otherwise, it was an afternoon to forget for Norwich's talisman, who turned down a big-money move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg during the summer.

“We were up against probably the best striker in the league today in Josh Sargent,” says Parkinson. “We did a lot of work on him, how we felt we had to deal with him. He's a dangerous player but our concentration levels were good.

“There was a lot of fatigue out there eventually, as they tracked his runs, they got tight to him and limited a really good player to very little.”

Parkinson was also full of praise for Kabore, who had an exemplary afternoon down the right. He had 48 touches (only Cleworth with 66 and Ben Sheaf with 61 managed more for the visitors), sent over nine crosses (six more than anyone else in red) and managed two headed clearances to go with his assists for Windass and Longman.

“What can I say about Issy?” adds Parkinson. “The medical team were behind me and saying, ‘His sprint distances are completely off the scale, can we get him off?' But he was doing such a good job defensively.

“For us, we have had very attack-minded wing-backs in recent years. He is that. But we also needed someone with a defensive mindset as well. In one-v-one situations against a really good player in (Papa) Diallo, he had to stick to his task.

“I just hope Pep (Guardiola) doesn't get a video of the game as he might want him back!”

Wrexham are far from the finished article defensively. How can they be when their expected goals against (xGA) stands at 14.5, at least two goals more than any of their peers. They've also faced 115 shots, 14 more than anyone else.

But, there was enough in the Norwich victory to suggest a corner has been turned and that things should continue to improve in the coming weeks as, effectively, a new squad gets to grips with the Championship.

“I wanted the lads to enjoy this game,” adds Parkinson. “Four years ago we were down this way and playing King's Lynn away in front of 800 people. I want people to understand how far we have come.”

Campbell shines for Club NXT after World Cup decision

Photo: Club Brugge @ X

South African sensation Shandre Campbell put on a stellar display for Club NXT in the Challenger Pro League on Saturday.

The 20-year-old grabbed an assist as Club Brugge's reserve side played to a 1-1 draw with Cassius Mailula's new club KV Kortrijk.

Campbell has played four matches across all competitions this season, featuring for both the senior and reserve team. He has one goal scored for the first team and an assist for the reserve side.

The Amajita star has been a revelation for Brugge since signing for the club in July 2024 from the now-defunct SuperSport United in his homeland.

Overall, the starlet has made four appearances for the first team and scored one goal, while he scored nine goals with three assists in 21 matches for Club NXT.

However, the player was recently denied the greenlight to report for the South African under 20 national team camp ahead of the FIFA World Cup in Chile later this month

Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos tried to intervene in a bid to convince the Belgian giants to release Campbell, but his efforts went in vain.

Meanwhile, compatriot, Mailula is yet to make his debut in the Belgian second tier after completing a loan move from MLS franchise Toronto FC.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

ENGLAND'S kit for the 2026 World Cup has been leaked.

FA chiefs have opted for a clean and safe design after the controversy surrounding the Euro 2024 shirt.

The Three Lions have continued the classic look with the white home shirt boasting modern touches.

There is an intricate jacquard pattern on the chest and torso displaying a lion and stars.

Red inserts complement a navy trim around the neck and sleeves, similar to the Euro 2020 kit.

The inside of the collar also bears the words 'Happy and Glorious' from the national anthem.

The safe look should help The FA avoid the controversy that surrounded the previous kit, which was used for Euro 2024.

Some fans branded the previous shirt ""woke"" after the colours of the St George's flag were changed.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer even slammed the FA and Nike for changing the “unifying” St George's flag, but manufacturers refused to revert back to the traditional colours.

The controversy led away shirt sales to better the home top for the first time ever.

England have returned to the traditional red for their away kit for the next World Cup, despite the navy-purple look selling well.

However the design is still yet to be released, or leaked, though it could follow a similar safe style to the home jersey.

Nyamam Makuac netted a brace as South Sudan defeated Djibouti 5-0 at the Juba National Stadium.

Ludia Maika and Joan Adong had given the home side an early lead, and Makuac made sure they went into recess leading 3-0. After the break Makuac increased South Sudan's lead, and Monica Nakamu made it 5-0.

In Kigali, Rwanda stopped Zimbabwe 2-1 in a match played at the Kigali Pele Stadium.

Darlene Ishmwe gave Rwanda the lead after only 3 minutes, but Bethel Kondo leveled matters after 18 minutes. Five minutes into the second half Scholastique Gikundiro made it 2-1 for Rwanda.

Zimbabwe continued to push forward in search of more goals, but the home side defended well.

Arsenal's perfect start to the new Women's Super League season came to an end on Sunday at Manchester United as the Gunners were held to a 0-0 draw in a game they had the better of. Olivia Smith hit the crossbar, Caitlin Foord whistled an effort just wide and Alessia Russo had a decent opportunity through on goal saved as Renee Slegers' side turned the screw in a hard-fought encounter, but the visitors had to settle for a point on the road in the end.

It was United who started brightest, with Melvine Malard the recipient of a good chance inside the opening minute, but Arsenal would grow into the game, and as their pressing started to trouble the Red Devils, opportunities arose. That said, there was a lack of clear-cut opportunites throughout the 90 minutes and the Gunners didn't test opposing goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce enough, with it often from the edge of the box or an unfavourable angle that the looks at goal came.

Even those half-chances dried up in the second period, despite Slegers being able to throw on the likes of Chloe Kelly and Beth Mead from a star-studded bench. There were positives at the other end of the pitch, though, with United themselves limited to few big moments as 18-year-old Katie Reid continued to look incredibly promising in the heart of defence alongside the experienced Steph Catley, whose fantastic block to deny Malard proved crucial in the end as the Gunners were at least able to keep their first clean sheet of the new campaign.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Oscar Piastri's rough weekend in Baku continued as he crashed out on the opening lap of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri was left frustrated by the “lapses in judgement” and “silly mistakes” that combined to end his Azerbaijan Grand Prix on the opening lap.

Championship leader Piastri was on a 34-race points-scoring streak ahead of the Baku weekend, with his consistent scoring a cornerstone of his title charge.

However, after an error in Saturday's Qualifying that saw him collide with the wall in Q3 – leaving him with a ninth-place starting slot on the grid – Sunday failed to get any better for the Australian.

A jump start on the grid, and an ensuing anti-stall, immediately pushed the McLaren man towards the back of the order, before he broke late for Turn 5, locked his front-left tyre and slid helplessly into the wall, ending his race there and then.

“Certainly not my finest moment,” he told Sky Sports F1. “I just anticipated the start too much, and it was a silly, simple error with that. Then, the crash – I just didn't anticipate the dirty air in the way I should have. I clearly went into the corner way too hot and that was that.

“The grip level was low, but I should have known that. I'm certainly not blaming it on anything other than myself, I just didn't make the judgement calls that I needed to at the right time, and that's obviously disappointing.”

The weekend as a whole was far from ideal for Piastri with the damage caused by his Q3 crash also resulting in a chassis swap for the Grand Prix.

“Qualifying yesterday, it was what it was,” he added. “Then today, just more silly mistakes. It was certainly a messy weekend for sure, but I would be more concerned if I was slow and trying to make up for it that way and having these errors because of that.

“But the fact that they're just simple lapses in judgement... it's not a position I want to be in or to put the mechanics in, because it has been a rough weekend for them. If I'm trying to find a silver lining, at least I have that.”

An added positive for Piastri is that his McLaren team mate Lando Norris could only manage seventh place in Baku, meaning the Australian retains a 25-point lead in the Drivers' Standings.

“I'm not too concerned about that,” he said. “I'm solely focused on myself and what I can do to improve. There's still a long way to go, and if you have good or bad weekends, the championship is far from over.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen, George Russell and Carlos Sainz face the press at the conclusion of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. George Russell (Mercedes), 3. Carlos Sainz (Williams)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: Carlos Sainz, a brilliant qualifying lap yesterday set you up for a podium finish today — your first for Williams. You said on the radio on the way in that it is the best moment of your career. Just tell us what this moment means to you.

Carlos SAINZ: Yeah. Honestly, I cannot describe how happy I am, how good this feels. This is even better than my first ever podium that I did. We've been fighting hard all year and finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed — we've had it all year — and everything comes together, we can do some amazing things together. And yeah, today we nailed the race. Not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that yesterday I wasn't expecting to beat.

Q: We talked a little bit earlier in the week about how you've had pace at a lot of the races in the last few — it's just been a failure to convert for a various amount of reasons. How proud are you of yourself on track, and the team, of course, for their ability to convert from a strategy standpoint today?

CS: Yeah. I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through our very difficult year. I think we've proven to everyone the massive step that we took compared to last year. We are on the rise; we are in the right direction. Unfortunately, with me, we've had a lot of bad luck, a lot of incidents — very difficult to convert all that pace into results. But now I understand why it all happened, because the first podium needed to come like this. It's just life, you know? Life just sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one, and this stays much better than any other thing that I was expecting. So, just a life lesson, to keep believing, keep trusting yourself, your team around you, your procedures, everything that you're doing — because sooner or later, it always pays off.

Q: Cool. We'll go and join with your team. Congratulations.

CS: Thank you very much.

Q: P2 for George Russell today. You said before the race that a podium was a possibility, and you had incredible pace on those Hard tyres. We even heard you pre-empt a message from the pit wall to extend that stint. Was that the key today to get ahead of Carlos?

George RUSSELL: Yeah. I mean, firstly, congrats to Carlos and Williams. Amazing result for them. I think for us, really happy to be back on the podium. It's been a bit of a rough weekend for me personally, but the car was great. Lewis came in P4 as well, so happy with that.

Q: You talked about a rough week for you personally — a bit under the weather. So how tough was it to sort of focus, and how are you feeling after 51 laps?

GR: Yeah, I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest. I was fortunate — I felt much better today than I felt on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, looking forward to a bit of rest now. But as I said, just happy with the result. And for us as a team, trying to beat Ferrari in the Constructors' was a good step towards that.

Q: Absolutely. Well, congratulations. Go get some rest. Max, 67th win of your career, second in a row. That looked like Max 2023 — as straightforward as it gets. Did it feel that easy from inside the car?

Max VERSTAPPEN: They're all a bit different, but I think this weekend has been incredible for us. Of course, last weekend was already great. But yeah, for us to win here again is just fantastic. And I think also in the race, the car was working really well. On both of the compounds, we had clean air all the time, and you could then look after your tyres. And yeah, it was pretty straightforward. Of course, it's not easy around here — very windy today, so the car is always moving around a lot. But yeah, of course, incredibly happy with this performance.

Q: After the conditions we saw yesterday and all the problems in qualifying — you mentioned the wind, similar conditions today. How surprised were you that there weren't more incidents, that we didn't have more Safety Cars or even a red flag? Is that the drivers just learning from yesterday, or was it maybe not as hard today?

MV: I think in the race, always, you have to be a little bit more careful, right? Also, with tyre management and stuff, you want to make the one-stop work. So I think everyone was a bit more cautious with that anyway. Plus, of course, the compounds that we're running today — Medium and Hard — they weren't really used that much up until today, and that all helped. And yeah, for sure I was happy that there were not too many Safety Cars.

Q: Max, two wins on the trot. This Red Bull car seems to have really taken a step forward the last few weeks. Are you confident that this sort of pace, this sort of relative competitiveness can continue all the way to the end of the season?

MV: Difficult to say at the moment, but for sure the last two race weekends have been amazing for us. Singapore — completely different challenge again with the high downforce. So we'll see what we can do there.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Very well done, Max. A very dominant victory for you today. Just how sweet was the performance?

MV: I think overall, just a great weekend for us. I think for sure, you know, starting up front was key, especially in the beginning, just managing your tyres to go long. But, yeah, overall, very happy with how the race was going. I mean, I could go very long in that first stint. The car was doing pretty much what I wanted it to do. Just how much you commit, right, to push around here, which is not always easy with the layout of the track, the wind as well. It was quite tough today with that. But, yeah, we just stayed out until basically everyone pitted. And then there were only a few laps left on the medium, clearing a few backmarkers, which took a bit of time. But after that, just bringing it home. And for us, that's another just great result. A bit unusual. This season has been really swinging left and right, but at least now two weekends in a row, it's been going really well.

Q: You say it's been swinging left and right. Was this the best the car has felt all season?

MV: I guess together with Monza. Yep. Monza has never really been a particularly strong track for us, so to do that, that was already a big plus. And I guess all in all for me here in Baku, it's been alright, but never amazing — apart from maybe '21, '22, I guess. But the rest has always been a bit difficult. So, yeah, to have a weekend like this, it was very important.

Q: How much of a risk was it to start the race on the Hard tyre given that you hadn't run on it up until that point?

MV: Well, not so much from knowing how good it would be. It's more like the start or an untimely Safety Car. So as soon as we crossed, like, 20 laps into the race, I was a bit happier, but it was a bit of a risk. I think it's a bit unusual, of course, when you're on pole, to start on the hardest compound that is available. But we did it, and I think it was the right call. We said before the race, well, one way or another one strategy will work, and we'll come out of the race happy with it. Luckily, we chose the right one.

Q: Now, Max, you're only 69 points behind Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' Championship. Given the recent upswing in competitiveness, does it give you a smidgen of hope that the title is within range again?

MV: I mean, I don't rely on hope. But it's seven rounds left – 69 points is a lot. So I personally don't think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season — just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we'll know.

Q: And given where the car is now, do you have a little bit more hope going to Singapore, a race where Red Bull's never won?

MV: Well, I have never won. Red Bull has won, right? We'll see. It's completely different. High downforce. A lot of deg on the tyres, so we'll see what happens. I really don't know at the moment.

Q: Alright. Very well done today. Thank you very much, Max. George, let's come to you. Great race by you. What was the key to the climb up to P2 today?

GR: I think it was just staying out of trouble, to be honest. I don't think we had a spectacular weekend, to be honest. And, obviously, Carlos just did an amazing job, and Liam also did a great job yesterday qualifying ahead of us. But all of the cars who we ordinarily fight sort of made mistakes or underperformed, and we sort of picked up the pieces. So, obviously, really happy to finish P2 all things considered. But also, I think the cool temps helped us a little bit. So just good to capitalise on all of those things.

Q: Do you have a better race car or qualifying car at the moment?

GR: I think it's very dependent circuit to circuit. Definitely, this weekend, the conditions and the circuit layout probably suited our car better than we'll see in Singapore. But right now, the field is so compact and overtaking is pretty difficult. So it seems like anybody can do an amazing lap and get themselves up the order. And, to be honest, it's pretty incredible seeing the likes of Carlos, Hülkenberg, Hadjar on the podium this season.

Q: You've been under the weather all weekend. Sounding a bit like Barry White. Just how tough was it physically for you?

GR: Well, fortunately, it was Baku. Even though it's one of the toughest circuits, mentally and physically it's maybe one of the easiest. So today I'm much better. Friday and Saturday, I was really rough. And, you know, had it been Singapore, as an example, I think I probably would have called it a day on Friday, to be honest, and probably wouldn't have done the race. So, yeah, sort of fortunate timing. And I haven't been ill for a couple of years, actually, so it just all sort of hit me at once these days, but I'm on the up now.

Q: Quick word on the Constructors' Championship, please. Mercedes in P2, four points now ahead of Ferrari. How do you see this one playing out over the remaining seven races? Do you expect it to go to the wire, or do you think one of you will gain an advantage?

GR: Well, I think right now with the current form, there's as much chance of Max finishing ahead of us as there is Ferrari, to be honest.

MV: Red Bull, no?

GR: Yeah, team Verstappen! But, yeah — sorry, I lost my train of thought there. It just swings so quickly. Ferrari were looking amazingly strong on Friday here, and they've always been great here. You know, Charles has been on pole four times here, and they could have easily been one-two on the grid. And with how difficult overtaking is, they probably would have finished one-two as well. But, obviously, they had a bad qualifying, and they came away with single-figure points, and we were the ones coming away with 30 points, so nobody knows.

Q: Very well done. Thank you for that. Carlos, if we could come to you. First podium for Williams — very well done. What was the key to this result, first of all?

Carlos SAINZ: The key was probably just nailing a perfect weekend from practice, quali, to race. It's what I've been looking for since the beginning of the season — just to nail a perfect weekend. I think we had almost a perfect one in Jeddah when we scored maximum points, but then the rest of the season has been really up and down with a lot more downs than ups. Very unlucky in some cases. Job not well done in others — by me or by other things that were in our control. But I always said to the team from the beginning that whenever a first big opportunity of fighting for a podium comes, as long as we have everything under control and nothing goes wrong and we prove to everyone what we're doing, and we get that podium, then I'll be OK. And it's exactly what ended up happening today. We had our chance starting from P2. Probably, if you asked many of us yesterday, we didn't believe the podium was actually achievable with so many fast cars behind. But I think we've had good pace this year, we just didn't have many opportunities to show it. Today we had a very good opportunity to show our very good pace, and we managed to stay on the podium. Only George managed to beat us with very good pace, but it was a very well executed race.

Q: Is that what makes this so special? You said earlier that this tastes sweeter than your first ever podium in Formula 1.

CS: Yeah, 100%. This one means even more just because of, obviously, a year ago when I put my bet on Williams, and I said I'm going to this team because I truly believe in this project, and I truly believe that this team is on the rise. I'm very comfortable in this working environment, also very comfortable with everyone around me. And I have actually been pretty fast all year with the car. I think out of everyone that's changed teams — which is not an easy task nowadays — I've been very competitive from the first race, very quick, but I didn't have results with me. I didn't have results to prove to myself, the team, and everyone that some good things were about to come. But, in the end, they did. I think life has taught me many times that this sometimes happens — that you have a run of misfortune or bad performances, but then suddenly life gives you back if you keep working hard with something really sweet like this.

Q: Carlos, you've got your first podium for Williams before Lewis has got his first podium for Ferrari. Can we get your thoughts on that?

CS: What everyone else does is not my business, to be honest. What I care about is that the first opportunity that I had to score a podium with Williams, and the first opportunity Williams had to score a podium, we took it, we scored it, and there it is.

Q: Final one from me. What else is possible with this car in 2025?

CS: Not much more than this, to be honest. I think the podium is — unless something crazy happens — maybe our best chance. Probably Vegas will be our next best track to try and maybe put together a top five or a top six, which is what we sometimes can achieve when everything goes right. Apologies, it's a tough ask. I'll fight for it if it comes, like you've seen today. But the rest, for example in Qatar, I don't think we will score points. That's how much our performance swings. But then we will have the Austins, the Mexicos. We will be a pure midfield car where we can maybe get in the points and keep our championship going. So excited to see what happens in those races.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Jesus Balseiro – Diario AS) Question to Carlos. Third place is quite nice, but was it ever possible to be second today? Do you think you could have done anything different, obviously on strategy, to keep George behind?

CS: Yeah. Obviously, I was racing for second the whole race, but I think it was around the first 10 laps of the Hard tyre where I was expecting to be clearly quicker than George on a new Hard versus his old Hard that I said, ""If now I can put my car in front of him before he boxes, we have a chance for P2."" But then they started telling me his lap times on those used Hards versus my new Hard, and I saw there was no chance. They were just simply too quick for us today. So congrats to him and Merc for that. Kimi was also coming quick behind, and I had to change my focus to getting the P3 rather than fighting for the P2.

Q: Carlos, when you saw Max with the Hard tyre at the start, did you think that was a good opportunity for you?

CS: No. I thought maybe I could have done the same, if I knew. But I knew we had measured during the whole weekend that the left-hand side of the grid was a lot less grip than the right-hand side. So even if I was on a step softer compound, I knew that even with a good start and the short run to Turn 1, with that left side being very dirty, it was probably not enough to get him at the start. I still got a decent start, but it was not enough to put him under pressure. And I think for the Hard tyres, he must have done a good start.

Q: (Aynur Mehdiyeva – Racebrief.com) My question is for Carlos. First of all, congratulations with your first podium with the Williams team in Baku. Did you follow some specific strategy during the race?

CS: No. No. I just knew — I think on long runs on Friday, I saw my lap times and I saw that I'm
actually very quick, very competitive. So if it's not easy to overtake back there, they're going to struggle to get to me because I'm not slow. That's why yesterday, I said I was dreaming about the podium, but in reality, I was kind of believing that if we nailed everything, we could actually make it happen because our pace has genuinely been good all year in this kind of tracks. I've been quick. The car has been quick. And if we nail everything, I thought a top five was possible. And if we do everything perfect, maybe even the podium.

Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to the three drivers, please. Next Grand Prix will be in Singapore. Is this the most difficult race of the F1 season? And if so, why?

MV: Depends on a lot of things. If the car is shocking to drive, yes, it's really hard to keep it in a straight line. But if the car is nice to drive, then it's more about just the physicality of it. But at the same time, if everything's going well, then you can relax a bit more, and then naturally it's less physical as well. So, I don't know. Let's wait and see. I mean, it's for sure always hot and you're sweating a lot, so you have to prepare for that. But I guess we've all done that — heat training and stuff — preparing for these kinds of races. Basically, just getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. I don't mind it. It's a cool track. Of course, I've never won there, but it's a cool feeling to drive there, and I hope this year we'll be a bit more competitive.

GR: Same.

CS: Yeah. I think Singapore is very tough physically, but I think driving-wise, the race we just had here in Baku is probably the toughest of the year given the wind, the walls. The speeds that we do here is, for me, tougher as a driver than Singapore. But Singapore is more physically demanding.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.

Verstappen led off the line, despite gambling on the hard tyres for the start. In clean air he built a commanding lead and pitted late for some mediums. Never under any pressure, the Dutchman bagged his fourth win of the season and a ‘Grand Slam' to boot. But his was not the only success story for Red Bull. Tsunoda had a clean start, fought hard and kept Norris at bay in the early stages. He did not put a foot wrong and although he could not find a way past Lawson, sixth is still his best Grand Prix result of the season.

Max Verstappen, 1st

“It was an incredible weekend and today we had really good pace and it ended up being quite a straightforward race. Starting out in front today was key for us and we managed our tyres well. We were going well on the first stint and executed everything how we wanted to. Our strategy was to go from Hard tyres and then on to Mediums and luckily there were no safety cars in the middle of the race which might have messed this up. This is a tough track to be consistent at, with the challenging layout and also very hard winds so you have to keep reminding yourself to keep out of the walls! I was happy with the car and we really managed our pace and had quite a big gap to the Mercedes. It has been a great weekend overall and the last two weekends for sure have been amazing. Both are tracks where we have low downforce so we will see how we go on other circuits. Hopefully we can continue forward with this form, but we are just enjoying the moment right now. We are really happy with what we are doing: the relationship that I have with the Team is really good and when the car goes well, everything comes together.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 6th

“We've put together a strong weekend here in Azerbaijan, where we showed the performance that we've wanted to for a long time. So, scoring my best result with the Team feels deserved. We put ourselves in a great position yesterday in Qualifying and we wanted to capitalise on that with the good promise that we showed in the long runs in practice. There wasn't a lot of tyre degradation on either the Medium or Hard tyre, so no one was particularly falling away, which made it tricky to pass but still, I am happy with P6. I've received massive support from the Team, so it's nice to repay that with some solid points. The changes that we've made to the car have really worked this weekend and it allowed us to be more competitive than we have been on race days previously. I came into Baku having put in a lot of hard work off track to extract as much performance as possible and today was a step in the right direction. I feel like I have unlocked something that I can take into future races. Also, a huge congratulations to Max as it was a classic drive from him. The Team has been operating at a very sharp level, and we want to continue this momentum. We are not giving up anything until the end of the season.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“This win started with a Max masterclass in Qualifying yesterday. We didn't know what race pace would be like as nobody really got any long runs on Friday, but he just pulled away lap after lap, another Grand Chelem, Pole, in the lead from start to finish and setting the fastest lap. The win is down to everyone in Milton Keynes pushing so hard to make the car faster. There is no silver bullet, but no one has ever given up on this season in terms of understanding why we were not reaching the level we wanted and, little by little, the work that Max and Yuki have been doing with the whole Team has been paying off and at least, here and in Monza we were back in the game. We are not leaving any stone unturned in this 2025 campaign. We are fighting to get more and more learning, to unlock more and more understanding because even if the 2026 regulations are completely different there is always a lot we can carry over from this season. Yuki had a very strong race, keeping the McLaren and Ferrari behind him. He needed a clean weekend and he performed really well scoring important points for the Team in what is his best result of the season.”

In the cooler conditions, Mercedes once again came to the fore. Antonelli was strong from word go, pressuring Lawson in the first stint. Russell had to battle back past Tsunoda, but was soon on his team mate's tail. Mercedes pitted Antonelli early to undercut Lawson, and while that did not initially work, the teenager was able to pick off his Kiwi rival on track. Russell stayed out for a very long first stint and managed to overcut both his team mate at Sainz. From there the podium was assured, an impressive effort considering how unwell he has been. Antonelli could not chase down Sainz for the rostrum, but P4 is his best result since Canada.

George Russell, 2nd

""I am really happy to be back on the podium. It's been a tough run of races recently and I also have not felt well this weekend. That made today even more challenging than it could have been, so I am very pleased to finish P2. I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag! Congratulations to Carlos (Sainz) and Williams too. That was a very well-deserved result for them.

""On our side, the car felt great throughout and Kimi did a superb job to bring home P4 too. That is important points for the team as we look to battle Ferrari and Red Bull for second in the Constructors' Championship. Hopefully we can build on this result over what is sure to be a tight battle across the final seven races of the season.""

Kimi Antonelli, 4th

""Today was a much better Grand Prix than I've had in recent races. That said, I am still slightly disappointed that I wasn't able to get myself on the podium. We were closing in on Carlos (Sainz) in the final few laps, but I just couldn't quite find the pace to get within DRS range and then attempt an overtake. He did a great job so congratulations to both him and Williams.

""Whilst I was hoping for more, today was still a decent result and with George in second, a good day for us as a team. We gained a lot of points on Ferrari which is a positive and moved back into second in the Constructors' Championship. The pace across the field is tight but hopefully we can carry the momentum from here in Baku into Singapore in two weeks' time.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""That was a strong weekend for us as a team, and we come away from Azerbaijan with a good result. It felt good to get back on the podium in P2 and for Kimi to bring home solid points in P4. Of course, we are always hoping to be on the top step of the podium, but this gives us some positive momentum after two difficult races after the summer break.

""Congratulations to Carlos (Sainz), James (Vowles), and Williams on their P3 too. That was totally earned on merit. Kimi did what he could to get close enough to attack but their pace was a bit too strong. Kimi nevertheless did a great job to get past (Liam) Lawson; we saw how several cars such as the Ferrari of Leclerc and the Red Bull of Tsunoda were unable to do so when they were in DRS range. He will use this weekend to take momentum into the final seven races. George meanwhile drove a fantastic race; he's been suffering with illness all weekend and it was touch-and-go whether he'd even be able to drive on Friday and Saturday. It was a big push from him and to perform like this was mega.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We've had a solid weekend throughout here in Azerbaijan and that continued into today. We executed the race well on both sides of the garage to get ourselves back on the podium and bring home good points in P4 too. We'd not run the medium or hard tyres in free practice, so it was good to see that the car was well balanced on both compounds. We elected to split the start tyre strategies with the lack of long run data and so many cars out of position. George used this to good effect in his first stint to build a gap that, with a perfectly executed pit stop by our mechanics, gave him P2 on track. It was an impressive performance, particularly given that he has not been feeling 100 per cent this weekend.

""For Kimi, it was a solid weekend from start-to-finish. He looked after his Medium tyres early on and was then able to jump Lawson for P4 with a pass on track. He closed on Sainz in the closing stages, but the pace of the Williams and the difficult following meant he had to settle for a spot just off the podium. Nevertheless, he has shown what he is capable of after some tough weekends recently and we are sure he will build on this in the closing stages of the season.""

Sainz had a great start and held onto second in the opening stint. He even pushed Verstappen in the early stages, before getting into a rhythm and keeping the rest at bay. He lost out to Russell in the pit stops, after Mercedes overcut Williams, but sensibly he opted not to try and fight the Mercedes ahead but to concentrate on the one behind. The Spaniard gave no incentives to Antonelli, not putting a foot wrong in securing his first podium for his new team, and Williams' first since 2021. As for Albon, he collided with Colapinto after opportunistically trying to send one up the inside after his second pit stop. That earned the Thai driver a 10-second time penalty, and ended any hopes he had of making it back to the points.

Alex Albon, 13th

""First of all, today was a great result for the team and for Carlos, it has been a long time coming. Carlos executed a really clean weekend, and the car was quick and so it was great to see that result. Unfortunately for me, I think yesterday's Qualifying put us on the back foot for the Race. I expected us to be fast today, and we were quick on track when we were able to be in clean air, but the degradation was quite low today so that limited our progress when we were in the DRS train and it got a bit scrappy at times. It's a very different track in Singapore so we will analyse everything from this weekend and hope to score good points the next time out.""

Carlos Sainz, 3rd

""Finishing P3 today in Baku and being on the podium is an amazing feeling! I think it's one of my best races ever! We've been working so hard and gone through some really big ups and downs, but this makes it all worth it and we need to feel proud as a team. I'm sure this is just a taste of what's to come for us at Williams and we need to keep working in this direction.Today we had the pace, and we delivered when it mattered, not making any mistakes and scoring a magnificent podium on pure merit. Thank you to the entire team, here and back at home, for your relentless effort and support! And also, to all our Williams fans out there! I can't wait for more to come! Vamos!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""The result is fantastic. I've been fortunate to have a few podiums in my career, but this is one I'll remember forever. We earned this together as a team - a team that, in recent years, has been at the back, fighting just to survive, and now has battled its way back into this position. Carlos delivered a phenomenal race — an exceptional drive from start to finish, and a joy to watch. You could see and hear just how much it meant to him. I believe in positive momentum, and this gives Carlos a real foundation to build on. With Alex, sometimes you just have those days. He absolutely had the pace — we've seen it all weekend — but after that early incident in Qualifying, it was always going to be difficult. Still, he fought back and finished close to the points. For now, I can't wait to get back to the factory on Monday with the trophy and feel the roof come off the place. This result is a reward for the incredible dedication of the entire workforce, who give so much of their lives to this team.""

Lawson started third and held that position early on. In fact, he spent much of the race holding arguably faster cars at bay. He pitted after Antonelli, and although he came out just ahead, on cooler tyres he could not keep the Mercedes man at bay. He also lost out to Russell - who overcut the Kiwi - but running fifth, Lawson managed to hold onto the position despite huge pressure lap after lap from the likes of Tsunoda and Norris. Hadjar made it double points for the team, as he came home P10 after a quieter race than his team mate enjoyed. Racing Bulls have jumped Aston Martin and are now sixth in the Championship.

Isack Hadjar, 10th

“We had some hydraulic issues before the race start, but the boys did an amazing job to get everything fixed in time. I got off to a really good start, but unfortunately, I made the same costly mistake as yesterday and lost two places. We had great pace on the Hard tyre, but not so much on the Medium, so we'll need to do some research to understand why. There are still plenty of positives and learnings to take away from this weekend though; Liam drove a perfect race, and I'm really happy for the team with a double points finish. I'm looking forward to Singapore and feel confident that we can do well there.”

Liam Lawson, 5th

""The race felt rewarding, particularly after the last ten to fifteen laps, which was pretty intense. Obviously it's a little disappointing from where we were starting, but realistically we didn't have the speed to fight with the guys in front today, despite always being hopeful. To have a P5 is big for us, especially in the Championship right now. We've had a good car all weekend thanks to the team, so I'm pleased to be coming home with points. We gave it everything!""

Alan Permane, Team Principal

“The race finishes off a great weekend for us here in Baku, which was strong for both our drivers. It was always going to be difficult to keep the quicker cars behind, but we finished with both cars in the points, putting us back to P6 in the Championship. I'm really pleased for Liam; a career best for him with 5th place. He put together 20 perfect laps towards the end, keeping those cars behind him. For Isack, starting 8th with two Ferrari's behind him was always going to be tricky, but he finished very close to them in the end. He struggled a little bit with the Medium tyre at the start with the balance, but was flying once he was on the Hard tyre.

""We're going armed into Singapore with bags of confidence and we can really relish in the last third of the season.”

Piastri's poor weekend went from bad to worse in Baku. He anticipated the start and jumped too early, his car going into anti-stall when he immediately stopped. That earned him a five-second time penalty, but also meant the whole field flowed past. Running last, Piastri then locked up attacking Turn 5 and ran straight into the barriers. That ended his race, but he was forced to watch from the side of the track for much of the afternoon. As for Norris, he lost out a few times, especially to Leclerc at the Safety Car restart. He ran a very long first stint on the mediums, but a slow pit stop meant he came out in traffic and despite having DRS, the McLaren man could not find a way past his rivals. He reduced the Championship gap – but not by as much as he might have hoped.

Oscar Piastri, DNF

""Obviously not the weekend we were looking for in Baku. I made a mistake at the start and then locked up. I want to apologise to the team, especially the mechanics after they did such a great job to get my car back together after Qualifying. We just need to keep our heads down, review, and put this one behind us before coming back stronger next race weekend.""

Lando Norris, 7th

""A tricky race and a tricky weekend overall. Today the pace was okay, but not enough to overtake. After not doing a good enough job yesterday, and a lack of real strategy options today, there wasn't much more we could have done. Frustrating and not how I wanted the weekend to go, but we'll get our heads down now and look ahead to Singapore.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""A difficult weekend at a circuit we knew would be tricky for us. It was confirmation once again that our competitors are not far from us and at some circuits, faster.

""For Oscar, it was a rare weekend with a few uncharacteristic mistakes, but he is already processing the weekend and taking all the learnings ahead of the next round. On Lando's side, we didn't give him a car that was in condition to overtake. He otherwise drove a solid race.

""A big thank you to team trackside for all of their work, especially rebuilding Oscar's car after Qualifying and to the team back in Woking for their great support. We will review our efforts and ensure we come back stronger in Singapore.""

Ferrari opted to split strategies at the start, Leclerc on mediums and Hamilton on hards. Both had clean starts, with Leclerc fighting with Norris in the early stages. After the Monegasque racer pitted to try and undercut some rivals, Hamilton ran a long stint and climbed to fifth. On fresher rubber, he was let back past his team mate to try and chase down Norris ahead. Unable to get ahead of the McLaren, Hamilton slowed on the last lap to give the place back to his team mate – but not quite enough, winding up crossing the line 0.4s ahead of Leclerc.

Charles Leclerc, 9th

""Today, what mattered was being on the right strategy, in the sense that some cars started on Hards and others on Mediums, and the most important thing was to find yourself in the faster group of cars who were on the same tyres as you, in order to be able to fight your way forward. I was stuck behind Liam (Lawson) for most of the second stint. He was on a different strategy with the Mediums and I was on Hards at that point, so I couldn't overtake him. I also had a small issue on my PU, which affected my pace for a few laps.

""At the end of the day, what had the biggest impact on our race was our qualifying result. I made a mistake in Q3 and ended up starting from P10. Going for a P8 or P9 in a race is not my target, and these are not positions I am interested in fighting for. We have to reset and come back stronger in the upcoming races. The temperatures were colder than ever before in Baku this time around, which has impacted our performance in the way we were able to work our tyres. Things should look better in warmer temperatures, so I'm looking forward to Singapore and hope we will be in better shape there.

""Congratulations to Carlos (Sainz) for his first podium with Williams, he had a strong weekend and I'm happy for him.""

Lewis Hamilton, 8th

""It's not the result we were aiming for and of course it's disappointing. I felt more comfortable in the car today and the balance was much better, but it was difficult to close on the cars ahead as they had strong pace.

""Qualifying is always key and we didn't maximise it this weekend. Our setup choice and execution in quali weren't ideal, and that left us further back than we should have been. Fighting for eighth and ninth doesn't reflect the potential we had if everything had come together.

""We're going to be focused on how we can improve our qualifying performance over the coming weeks. The team and the pit crew did a great job today and I'm thankful for their hard work. We'll regroup and come back stronger in Singapore.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""We cannot be satisfied with eighth and ninth. We started behind Norris and we finished behind him, which is the reality of this track. We had an issue with Charles' engine which we will now investigate and, even if it was marginal, it was enough to prevent him from being able to overtake in a straight line, which explains why we were stuck behind Lawson. The main regret is for yesterday, because we had the pace to do a much better job in qualifying and that's where the weekend got away from us. It's encouraging that the pace was there, but frustrating that we did not capitalise on it because you have two parts of the job: one is pure performance and the other is your execution. In terms of performance we made a step forward after Spa, but to be P10 and P12 yesterday was not what we expected. Now we need to understand what we could have done better, because we made some mistake, some poor choices. I know Charles is accepting the responsibility for qualifying, but we need to work on our execution to come back stronger.""

Hulkenberg's race was compromised by damage off the line, as he tangled with Ocon at the start. He was able to continue without needing to pit, but it was Bortoleto who got the closest to points for Kick Sauber. He ran a very long first stint and climbed into the top 10, making himself a nuisance to the top runners by sitting in their pit stop window. But after pitting and with just the one DNF in the field, the opportunity just was not there for the Brazilian to back up his Monza P8 with another score.

Nico Hulkenberg, 16th

“It was one of those races where things just didn't fall into place. I always seemed to be on the wrong side of the timing, losing out here and there. The highlight was definitely the restart - I managed a nice double overtake into Turn 3, which was rewarding. But after that, I was stuck behind Franco [Colapinto] and Lance [Stroll] for most of the first stint. We lost a lot of time there, and that was really the make-or-break moment.

""The pace at the end was good, but by then the race had already slipped away from us - qualifying and the early laps left us with too much to recover. There weren't many variables or opportunities to shake up the order today. It wasn't our strongest weekend, but we'll take the lessons on board and focus on executing better next time out.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 11th

“It's been an intense race, always near some other cars and very close to the walls at all times. I think we delivered everything that we had on the table today, with P11 being the maximum we could achieve: it's been a bit of a tricky weekend overall of us, and I don't think we would have had enough pace to fight higher up. Still, we kept pushing, managed to maximise what we had and took home some important learnings. Some weekends you can put up a fight, some you can't as much, but that's racing. Now, we turn our focus to Singapore in two weeks' time.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“It's been a very windy weekend here in Baku, and one that certainly tested our package. The circuit exposed some of the limitations of the C45, particularly in qualifying. However, in race trim, we started Sunday knowing we had a more competitive car for the midfield battle. Gabi fought hard in the pack, and Nico's pace in the final stint was particularly strong. I think we delivered the maximum we could today - in a race where the wind affected the cars throughout and, with low attrition, there weren't many chances to capitalise on.

“On a more positive note, the hydraulic issue from Monza was fully resolved thanks to the hard work from the team trackside and back at the factory. During the race, the pit crew did a great job; huge credit to everyone involved. This weekend showed that we're still in the midfield fight – now it's about translating that into points next time out.”

After a very difficult Saturday that saw one car crash and the other disqualified from Qualifying, race day did not start any better for the American team. Ocon was involved in a racing incident off the line with Hulkenberg and pitted with a puncture. The team opted to pit him immediately under the Safety Car so he could run to the end on the hards – which he managed in a heroic feat, keeping those tyres alive for 50 laps. As for Bearman, he had a quieter race in many ways but just found himself stuck in a DRS train for much of the afternoon.

Esteban Ocon, 14th

“It was a good start, and we tried a really aggressive strategy. It's a bit of a shame on that side, but we'll review. It's been a difficult weekend for us, and there are a lot of things to improve on for the next race, and this is what we'll look out for in Singapore. We need to have a clean sweep with no issues – a healthy weekend – which is what we're all asking for.”

Oliver Bearman, 12th

“It was a good race as overall we made a good comeback, and we had good pace. I started P15 but lost a few spots early on during the Safety Car restart, and after that, I was really stuck in the first stint behind cars, and it was damage limitation from there on. The car was quick, but we couldn't do anything with it.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“It was a tough race to recover from, starting P15 and P20, so when you start there and get into a DRS train, it's very difficult to overtake. For Esteban, I think the strategy was right, but in terms of balance limitation, it wasn't quite there for him to make further progress. On Ollie's side, we didn't maximise the start and Safety Car restart, and we lost positions. Unfortunately, the DRS train defined his race because we were stuck behind slower cars. You can see the potential in the second stint how quick Ollie was, so we know it's there. Again, it's frustrating because over a whole weekend you can make one mistake and that defines it – but unfortunately that's the nature of the game in Formula 1. We've got the car and the drivers, so it will happen.”

Alonso reacted to Piastri moving off the line, and was pinged for a false start along with the McLaren man. That meant he had to serve a five-second time penalty at his pit stop, which dropped him down the order. He did finish ahead of his team mate on a quiet day for the team, who dropped from sixth to seventh in the Championship following Racing Bulls' big score. Not their track, not their race – as Aston Martin turn their attention towards a different style of circuit next time out in Singapore.

Fernando Alonso, 15th

""It was a difficult race without much happening and we simply didn't have the pace. At the start, I reacted to Oscar's movement and unfortunately got the penalty. I don't think this impacted our race in the end, because we just didn't have the performance. Hopefully our car will suit Singapore better and we can fight for the points again.""

Lance Stroll, 17th

""We stayed out for a longer stint on the Mediums hoping to take advantage of a Safety Car that never came, which limited our opportunities and what we could do. We will look ahead to Singapore now where we hope to be more competitive and have a stronger race weekend.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""There were very few opportunities in the race and points were out of reach today. The majority of cars stopped only once – as we did – with the Medium tyres performing especially well with low degradation. That limited the strategy options and made for quite a straightforward race. Both drivers pushed hard, but ultimately we were missing outright pace. We will head back to Silverstone, regroup, and come back stronger in Singapore.""

Alpine never had the pace to compete in Baku. They rolled the dice and split their strategies, starting Colapinto on the mediums and Gasly on the hards. That brought their drivers together a couple of times, with both swift to obey team orders to try and do everything they could to force a result. But the situation was not helped by Colapinto finding himself unluckily tagged into a spin by Albon after his pit stop, which dropped him down the order.

Pierre Gasly, 18th

“That was a very difficult day and not a good one for us as a team. We just lacked pace here all weekend. This track has proved difficult for us, more so than at recent races, and we have to take the lessons where we can as, even with the car we have, we really should not be finishing so far off. We have some ideas on the areas we lack and where we need to improve but something has really not clicked here and it has been a bit of a trend at the last few weekends. I am not feeling great in the car right now like I did earlier in the season so that is something we need to turnaround. This is the package we have and I know we will sit down together, work hard and aim to come back stronger from the next race.”

Franco Colapinto, 19th

“First of all, thank you to the entire team who worked hard to have the car prepared and ready to start from the grid today. It was a big effort by everyone and shows the togetherness of the team even in difficult moments. It was a pity we could not reward them with a good result. We knew coming into the race it was going to be tough as a team and that proved to be the case. With the current package we have, we need everything to go perfectly and have a bit of luck on our side, and it didn't go our way today. I tried my best and made a good start. After the first stop I was fighting with Alex [Albon] and I got spun around which cost me a lot of time. The car felt different afterwards, maybe picking up a bit of damage, which we carried for the rest of the race. We need to keep working hard in the upcoming races and take what we can from them.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“On this track, a one-stop has always been an almost mandatory strategy and today was no exception, even though we brought a softer range of compounds than last year. Additionally, the fact it was cooler than usual helped the teams and drivers manage thermal degradation, particularly on the rear axle.

“As a result, it was a very straightforward race in terms of tyre behaviour. The Medium and Hard were very close in terms of performance and also in terms of degradation which was practically non-existent on both compounds. The C4 saw the most use (598 laps, 61.84%) and the Soft never put in an appearance. After last night's rain, the track surface reset itself a bit and therefore actually evolved significantly over the course of the race. Ahead of us we now have another 2026 tyre development test session. On Thursday 25th and Friday 26th September, Ferrari and Haas will support us for one day each at the Mugello circuit, working on a programme focussed on defining the hardest compounds in the range.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Despite both Ferraris finishing inside the points at Baku, drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton viewed it as a disappointing weekend.

Charles Leclerc insists that Ferrari have ""got to react"" after a disappointing Azerbaijan Grand Prix despite a double points finish for the Scuderia.

The Monegasque driver could only finish ninth in Sunday's 51-lap race on the streets of Baku, with team mate Lewis Hamilton one place further ahead after both drivers started down the field.

Hamilton had failed to reach Q3 and started P12, while Leclerc crashed in Q3 and started P10 at a venue where he had previously taken four pole positions on the bounce.

""We've got to react. It's not been a strong weekend at all,"" said Leclerc when asked how he and the team move forward.

""It's always easy to blame the car and I think overall the car this weekend hasn't been the strongest and it's been a difficult weekend. We have some explanations, first is probably the approach that I've had on the set-up, which hasn't been the right one. Second, I think our car is struggling whenever it's cool and it's been quite cold since yesterday and that made us struggle.

""But I think the main reason, and I am the first one responsible of that, is the mistake in Qualifying. When you start P10, it's very difficult to change the situation.

""You kind of hope to beat the strategy of all the other fast drivers but I kind of ended up the other side and I was stuck behind Liam [Lawson] the whole race. He did a really good job of defending and had good straight line speed so he could keep me behind, and I couldn't really use my pace, so it was a boring race.""

Ferrari entered the weekend after another strong showing on Friday, Hamilton having set the pace in Free Practice 2 from Leclerc and happy with the direction the team had taken.

The seven-time World Champion was content with his progress in a race where overtaking was difficult, but agreed with his team mate's assessment that better Qualifying performance was needed.

""Got a good start and progressed to P8 was positive,"" he said.

""I think our ultimate pace was not great in the race and I think I lost a lot of ground in the first stint, particularly on the hard tyre compared to the guys on the mediums. But I came back towards the end but I think overall the pace was not really great and Qualifying clearly is key.

""I think it just shows that Qualifying is everything, we didn't operate perfectly yesterday so we've got some work to do but we'll take it internally and try to improve.""

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

In a record-breaking Qualifying session at the Baku City Circuit, Max Verstappen came out on top for Red Bull.

Max Verstappen took pole position in a remarkable Qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with a wealth of drivers falling victim to the narrow Baku streets throughout the session.

With wind and brief rain increasing the challenge, an unprecedented six red flags were flown for crashes involving Alex Albon, Nico Hulkenberg, Franco Colapinto, Ollie Bearman, Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri.

After several disrupted attempts to improve his time, Verstappen managed to sail above the chaos and claim pole with a 1m 41.117s lap, beating Williams' Carlos Sainz and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson to the top spot.

Piastri crashed out with just under four minutes remaining, at which point only Sainz, Lawson and Isack Hadjar had set fast laps. In the tense shootout, Verstappen was the only one able to edge out the Williams, while Lando Norris ended the near two-hour Qualifying session down in seventh place.

""To have an external power of financial interest come fuck around with that material diminishes the trust,"" said the 'Sentimental Value' director about deciding to have all of his films financed in Europe.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Joachim Trier left San Sebastian Film Festival attendees in awe at an event Sunday morning where the Sentimental Value director spoke candidly and eloquently about his career.


	The Danish-Norwegian filmmaker, an Academy Award nominee for his 2021 romantic dramedy The Worst Person in the World, is also known for Reprise (2006), Oslo, August 31st (2011) and Louder Than Bombs (2015). His most recent project, winner of Cannes' Grand Prix this year Sentimental Value, is screening here at the 73rd San Sebastian Film Festival.




	The film follows Trier's frequent collaborator Renate Reinsve as Nora who, along with her sister Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), are faced to confront their strained relationship with their father, a fading director named Gustav Borg (Stellan Skarsgard). Elle Fanning also stars in the movie as a U.S. actress, Rachel Kemp, hoping to be in Borg's next feature.

	Trier spoke — and Reinsve, in attendance, watched on — at the discussion in San Sebastian where he fielded a myriad of questions about his journey to film stardom and working predominantly in Europe. The director explained how he set the precedent to have final cut on all his films when, in the wake of the success of Reprise, he was tasked with finding a U.S. studio to work with.


	“I need final cut, I've had it since film one,” he began. “To me, it's a moral implication of taking responsibility for what the actors give a director — if they show their emotions, their bodies, whatever — we created a movie [and] I carry the responsibility of what they bring to the final product. No one that sits in some studio capacity and invests money should decide that, in my opinion. That's not how art is made… [I have] a moral responsibility towards the cinematographer, maybe being away from his or her family for months on end to work on the vision that me, as a director, and all the others in the team created. To have an external power of financial interest come fuck around with that material diminishes the trust between us and the group.”

	











	“I'm not going to shame people,” he added, “because it's damn hard to make a film and many, many, many films are made every year where the director didn't have final cut, and they're wonderful films.”


	Trier admitted that demanding final cut made it “tough” to get a film financed and while some U.S. producers showed immense support, Reprise was made out of Oslo, Norway and in collaboration with France. “I've worked in the European financing system my whole career and I'm super happy about it,” he added.


	The financing system for cinema in Europe, while it has given Trier “a platform to express myself very freely,” he also believes it is constantly under political threat. “Right-wing political movements are always trying to diminish the idea of soft money support for the arts across most countries in Europe… We need support. And most art has always been supported by someone with an intention of not just making money, but supporting expression and artistic endeavors.”


	At the same time, Trier said the need to have total creative control over his films is something that producers should be in support of. “If you [look at] film history, a lot of the films that commercially worked have also been made by directors that are deeply involved in the script process, deeply involved in the editing and has had a sense of control — the achievements of personal expression is at the core of some of the most successful films, financially.”

	











	Trier continued that his championing of his actors should be mirrored by financiers' attitudes towards filmmakers. “My approach to shielding, protecting, loving, nourishing [actors] is how producers and financiers should work with directors. Don't employ directors unless you really want to support them and love them and help them, and [same with] writers and editors… I want Renate to do well, I want her to do something wonderful and I'm proud of Renate as a director. I think financiers should feel like that with directors and the creative team.”


	Across the session, Trier covered an extensive range of topics, from grieving the late David Lynch and the intersection of film and love (“tenderness is the new punk!”), to believing in the power of the “European auteur” and the cinematic universes they build. When discussing Sentimental Value, Trier, father to two young children, admitted his own fear of failure as a parent played a huge role in writing Skarsgard's part.


	“I said going in, ‘I'm really scared of failing as a father.' And it's very symbolic to make this film for me, because I don't want to be Gustav,” he said. “In Norway, we have had a lot of progression [for] female directors over the last 15, 20 years, and that has been great for us male directors too, because we have gotten a focus on [a] good set culture, where the macho energy is lessened and it's not just all tough guys.”


	This has allowed filmmakers in Norway to have “private conversations” about balancing being an artist with having children, he added. “Actually, the feminist discourse around cinema has helped men also allow ourselves bigger freedom of figuring out how we make movies [as parents].”

	Can Ed Sheeran's “Camera,” Olivia Dean's “Man I Need,” or Sombr's “Back to Friends” crack into the top 10 and overtake the hold that ‘KPop Demon Hunters' has on the Hot 100? Our Billboard chart experts break it all down on this week's Contenders.


	Tetris KellyIs Ed Sheeran making a comeback? Will Olivia Dean become a new chart princess? Are you feeling a little Sombr? I mean, can anybody shake the ‘KPop Demon Hunters' four spots in the top 10? We're talking some of the contenders on this week's race to No.1.


	Delisa ShannonSo my thought is that all of ‘KPop Demon Hunters' will be on the top three.


	Tetris KellyBut Ed Sheeran just released a brand-new project. I don't need a camera.


	Trevor AndersonWell, I think Ed Sheeran is back next week in a big way. People are really talking about the “Camera” song that's popping off from the new album ‘Play.' You know, it's been a little quieter on the Hot 100 in the past couple of years, but look out, “Camera” just might put him back in the conversation.


	Tetris KellyA new bombshell has entered the villa.


	Xander ZellnerI think Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” is gonna have a huge week next week. I feel like I hear that song everywhere. It's all over TikTok. It just hit the top 40 of this week's chart for the first time. I think it's gonna climb even higher next week


	Tetris KellyBut after a VMA performance, a lot of people are feeling Sombr.


	Trevor AndersonIt's still climbing up the Hot 100. “Undressed” is in the top 20 for the first time. “Back to Friends” in the top 25 for the first time. So Sombr is really on people's best new artist Grammy picks. Both those songs climbing up will continue to go up in the next couple of weeks. It'll be a Sombr September.

The star is back in the United States for a limited run of pop-up performances.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	“We're going to teach you a dance,” Chappell Roan says, as if there's anyone in the audience tonight who still doesn't know her infamous “Hot to Go!” choreography.


	In reality, the crowd of thousands at Saturday's (Sept. 20) show at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York, hasn't just been waiting all night for this — many of them have been waiting several months. It's been quite some time since the Missouri native performed in her home country, with the end of 2024 marking a particularly rough period for her. In addition to canceling two stateside shows for mental health reasons, she faced onslaughts of backlash for everything from speaking out about predatory fan behaviors to criticizing Kamala Harris amid the presidential race, leading to her largely stepping back from the internet.

	











	Now, a packed audience dotted with pink cowboy hats and Lady Liberty crowns — nods to Roan's getup at the 2024 Governor's Ball, one of the last times she performed in New York — embraces her completely, every bump in the road forgotten. Looking out at a sea of arms eagerly forming the shapes of the letters “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” (“I think you get it,” she giggles, abandoning her dance tutorial after one run-through), she looks stronger than ever, strutting around the stage in a sexy Captain Hook-esque outfit without missing a note as flames erupt behind her.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Saturday's concert is the first of eight pop-up performances in the U.S. that Roan has generously tacked onto her European Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour, and one of four dates slated for NYC. The setlist is full of high-octane numbers from her 2023 debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, with “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” “Femininomenon,” “After Midnight,” “Naked in Manhattan” (“Can you believe it? We're in New York!” she yells triumphantly midway through), “Guilty Pleasure” and “Casual” preceding “Hot to Go!,” as well as new single “The Subway,” which recently earned Roan her highest-ever peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 3.


	Later in the show, she writhes around on the stage floor while covering Heart's “Barracuda,” sensually serenades a mic stand topped with a blonde wig for the waltzy “Picture You,” line dances with her bandmates to March single “The Giver” and fills up the stadium with impressive high note after high note during “Good Luck, Babe!,” the breakout hit that catapulted the pop singer to superstardom with unprecedented swiftness in spring 2024. The latter two tracks are expected to appear on Roan's next LP, which she plans to start work on after the tour ends in October. (“It took me five years to write the first [album], and it's probably going to take at least five to write the next,” she warned in a recent interview with Vogue.)

A post shared by billboard (@billboard)


	Though Roan is a total force on stage, polished and magnetic while trouncing around a set made to look like an illustrated fairytale castle, the show is not without her signature frankness. She hilariously breaks character at one point to inform the crowd that she'd totally forgotten her entire “a—s” was on display in her outfit until she was taken by surprise at the sight of her own rear-end on one of the big screens behind her. Toward the end, while singing the vulnerable and now-deeply-ironic “California” about worrying she'll never make it in the music business, she interjects, “I just saw someone yawn — that's crazy.”

	











	She also takes a tender moment to address why her return home is so momentous. “It's been quite a year,” she tells the crowd around the halfway point in the show. “I can't believe we're here, honestly. It's crazy. Thank you for sticking with me through it, I know it was … it's been really hard.” 


	“I'm so glad I can come to work like this,” she continues. “I just needed a place like this so bad when I was 13, 14. I just wanted to dress up however I wanted, and I wanted to wear makeup and look weird. So I hope you know that you're welcome here, however you show up today. You are cherished.”


	As Roan dives into “Kaleidoscope,” her fans band together to let her know that the feeling is very much mutual. A dazzling rainbow suddenly appears and winks back at her as she sings, with the concert-goers in the back several rows of the stadium holding up multicolored lights in one unified effort.


	“Everyone look behind you,” she instructs the rest of the crowd before momentarily forgetting the song's lyrics, distracted by the emotionally charged gesture — the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless show. “You've got the rainbow! It's a kaleidoscope! It's so beautiful!”


	After her stay at Forest Hills, Roan will play two nights in Kansas City before closing out the Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour with two nights in Los Angeles. See Roan's full setlist at the first night of her NYC shows below.

UPDATED: The man arrested for allegedly shooting into the lobby of Sacramento ABC affiliate KXTV (ABC10) was released from jail on bond Saturday, then taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge, according to Sacramento County Main Jail records.


	Anibal Hernandezsantana, 64, of Sacramento, was arrested in connection with Friday's shooting on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm. 


	Sacramento officials confirmed Hernandezsantana had been released from the jail by Saturday afternoon after posting $200,000 bail. He was then arrested later that day on federal charges, an FBI spokesperson told the Sacramento Bee.

	











	Hernandezsantana is accused of violating federal statute 47 USC 333, which states no person can “willfully or maliciously interfere” with radio communications licensed or authorized by the federal government. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The shooting Friday occurred one day after a protest was held outside the station over the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! 


	The motive of the shooting remains under investigation.


	Hernandezsantana is scheduled to appear in Sacramento federal court Monday. He's due to appear in Sacramento Superior Court Tuesday afternoon on the local charges. according to jail records.


	Officers responded to reports of shots fired at the TV station shortly after 1:30 pm Friday. Sacramento Police Officer Anthony Gamble said at least three gunshots were fired at the building from a passing vehicle. 

	











	Police later was able to identify the vehicle, leading officers to a Sacramento residence and Hernandezsantana's subsequent arrest.


	ABC News photos showed three bullet holes in the window of the building's lobby. The station said a person was in the lobby at the time of the shooting, but was not injured. 


	Hernandezsantana was being booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail. 


	In a statement to ABC News, ABC10 station owner Tegna, said it “is fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees.” Security also has been increased at the station. 


	The demonstration outside the building Thursday was part of widespread protests over ABC's suspension of Kimmel following his comments about Charlie Kirk, including one held outside Disney studios in Burbank and another in Hollywood where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is taped. Attendees at the Sacramento protest held signs reading “First Amendment,” “Resist” and “You're Next” among others.

“The MAGA gang was desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”
What don't people understand about this statement?

The shooter wasn't from the Right Wing party. Even his own family said he was a Left Wing supporter,in a relationship with a Transgender. Stop your ignorance.

Some people get their news from Kimmel, apparently.

Lol

California as a state should break away or at minimum break into 3 or more different states, then maybe the differences being displayed, those associated individuals whom are upset, can run their own environment and see who's plot of land can function without discord, or if anything allow society as a whole discover and witnesses which of the two will last the longest as a civil society.  If anything, what's left over from building the wall in the south can keep those Californians confined to their own desirable homes, neighborhoods, places that they feel comfortable and can express their feelings, emotions, and influences among themselves without any outside interference. Give them what they want and allow them to sleep in the bed(s) that are made. (Example: Look at Spain on a map)

This is treason.  You are not an American. Adults use words to solve their problems and find solutions.

This isn't treason, asshole. Treason is January 6th.

I don't know which is worse…that this shooting might be a “targeted” shooting or a “random” shooting.

What kind of place is Sacramento where random shootings are commonplace?

It's not commonplace.

A handful of wealthy conservative people are to blame for this.  Aside from David (and Larry) Ellison and Shari Redstone (the Sykdance/Paramount merger), another name that people need to know is Nexstar CEO Perry Sook.  The Dallas-based CEO is very conservative and is trying to purchase Tegna in order to become the largest owner of TV stations in the country.  The FCC's rules currently say that no one can own stations that reach more than 40% of the US population – but with the Tegna purchase, Nexstar would exceed 40%.  So naturally, they objected to Kimmel's non-controversial statement so their merger can proceed.  And Sook wants Carr to give Nexstar an exemption so the Tegna purchase can go through.  So blame Carr, Sook, Ellison, Redstone, and a few others for eroding the First Amendment.

How about blame the mental case behind the trigger? This is the way to solve problems? It's not a left/right problem. It's a right/wrong problem and the left has lost their moral compass.

In a September 2025 interview with the New York Times, filmmaker Cameron Crowe let the magazine in on an interesting statement he once witnessed an iconic director make about what he thinks will be the long-term impact of Tom Cruise's career.

Crowe revealed he was at a dinner party when he heard Clint Eastwood, revered for directing hit Western films such as “The Outlaw Josey Wales” and “Unforgiven,” name the “Top Gun” star as the actor most likely to be viewed as “a legend” a hundred years from now. Read on for details.

Relaying the story to the New York Times, Crowe said, “I have the same lawyer as Clint Eastwood, and he invited me to a dinner party. He sat me next to Clint Eastwood, and I was so nervous.” The “Almost Famous” writer recounted how Eastwood leaned over and brought up the topic of Tom Cruise.

Crowe says he told Eastwood, “Oh man, Tom Cruise. I love working with Tom Cruise.” The action star famously portrayed a dashing playboy who must grapple with the aftermath of disfiguring his face in a crash in Crowe's 2001 sci-fi thriller “Vanilla Skye,” in which he shared the screen with Penelope Cruz.

Crowe says Eastwood predicted, “In a hundred years, they're gonna look back. That's the career. Tom Cruise's career.” 

According to the Guardian, Clint Eastwood was in talks to direct a remake of “A Star Is Born” around 2012, before Bradley Cooper ultimately took over the project and released his version in 2018.

The outlet reported at the time that Eastwood was hoping to cast Tom Cruise as the lead, and was eyeing none other than Beyoncé to star across from him. The story says the “Halo” singer initially backed away from the project due to delays, but agreed to sign on once she learned Eastwood would be attached.

Producer Bill Gerber revealed Eastwood and Beyoncé even traveled for a face-to-face meeting to discuss the project. But he says the plans fell apart due to “the movie business.” He explained, “Time happened. Beyonce got pregnant, and then Clint went off and did another movie. At the time I thought, ‘I'm going to be able to make a movie with my old dear friend,' not old, my young dear friend, and I was so excited about it.”

After the missed opportunity with “A Star Is Born,” Eastwood has still never directed Cruise in a film.

	Soon after forcing Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves, Sinclair — the broadcasting giant that operates dozens of ABC affiliates — announced it would replace the late-night show Friday with a special dedicated to Charlie Kirk. However, instead of broadcasting the special Friday, Sinclair affiliates aired a rerun of Celebrity Family Feud, Variety reports.


	Just 10 minutes before the Kirk special was set to broadcast, Sinclair issued a statement via social media announcing that it would instead premiere on YouTube. “Tonight, Sinclair will continue to air ABC network programming as scheduled in the late-night time period,” the company wrote Friday night.

Watch now: https://t.co/2OG7KE9S8Z pic.twitter.com/oRNt3vXnhU


	“The Charlie Kirk special will instead be available on The National News Desk's YouTube channel, ensuring viewers can continue to enjoy ABC programming while also providing full access to the special online.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	As of Sunday morning, the YouTube video of the Kirk special has generated just 26,000 views since it was uploaded on Friday night.

	











	Both Sinclair and fellow affiliates giant Nexstar pledged to kick Jimmy Kimmel Live off its U.S. stations following the host's comments about Kirk's assassination during a Monday monologue; soon after,  ABC said is was suspending the late-night show “indefinitely.”


	“Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” said Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”

	The company also stated that it will not lift the suspension on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability,” and called on Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family, as well as make “a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA.”


	In the aftermath of Kimmel's suspension, the late-night community has thrown their support behind the host, while politicians and celebrities alike have warned against the Trump administration's FCC-backed attacks on free speech.

	As Chappell Roan once sang, in New York you can try things. So it was the perfect place for her to make her big American return. Saturday night in New York was Chappell's first U.S. show in nearly a year, after her summer of conquering European festivals. She's bringing it all back home with a limited series of pop-up gigs in NYC, Kansas City, and L.A., with her new “Visions of Damsels and Other Dangerous Things” show. 


	Saturday night was a triumphant American homecoming for the Midwest princess, the kick-off for her four-night stand at New York's Forest Hills Stadium. It's a historic venue — and way too tiny for a star on her level. But that's why the show had such a special and intimate feel, under the stars, on the first chilly night of September. The whole night felt like a coronation moment for her — and a communal dance-crazed celebration for her hardcore fans.


	Her brief pop-up run is basically a victory lap, after her meteoric rise. “It's been quite a year, huh?” Chappell told the crowd. “Thank you for sticking with me through it. It's been really hard. And I'm so glad that I can come to work like this,” displaying her flamboyantly dressed self.

	She spent the night exploding with queer bravado and supernova presence, on a giant stage designed as a giant gothic castle. The crowd's sing-along energy was ferocious from the start, with the opening one-two punch of “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl” and “Feminomenon,” where Chappell asked “But does it happen?” and got 13,000 NOOOOOs back. Yet she can't help being the super-est, graphic-est, ultra-modern-est force in the house.

	











	When it comes to her Visions of Damsels aesthetic, she goes totally medieval with her fantasy castle, complete with staircase, parapets, drawbridge, and throne. Behind her, there's images of mythical creatures — goblins, dragons, hippogriffs, Pegasus-style flying horses, and wait, what do you call the serpents with wings? But Chappell was the queen of the castle from the start, stomping onstage to an orchestral metal fanfare, wearing a crimson pirate ensemble and her bat-wing fascinator. In one of the night's peak moments, she sat on her throne in a black cape, with a gremlin doll in her lap. “This is Shigella, my tour pet,” she announced. “She/they. And we're gonna sing ‘Coffee.'”


	Like most pop queens of our moment, Chappell builds her live show on straight-up Nineties guitar rock. She's got a kick-ass metal band full of female headbangers, busting out the most classic rock-star moves. (Chappell is a huge fan of kneeling to worship the guitar hero while she plays a solo — a Seventies move that's never been more popular than it is in 2025.) But she also did a fantastic demolition of Heart's “Barracuda” — talk about a song that could have been written for her.


	To the surprise of absolutely nobody, the crowd was dressed to kill — riding the subway to Forest Hills felt like part of the celebration, with all that leather and lace looking awesomely surreal on the E-train in the Saturday-afternoon sunlight. For “Kaleidoscope” the venue lit up like a rainbow, part of the overall queer-celebration vibe, only fitting for the most famous out pop star since Elton. “I just needed a place like this so bad when I was 13, 14,” Roan said. “I just wanted to dress up however I wanted to — I wanted to look weird. I hope that you know you're welcome here, however you show up today. You are cherished.”


	“The Giver” absolutely destroys live, her Shania-coded sapphic stomp into country-disco boot-scoot territory. She coached the audience in the “Hot To Go!” dance, though everybody pretty much already had that down. Chappell roared through the tunes from her debut The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, which dropped almost exactly two years ago, in late September 2023. It's a measure of how massive her rise has been — a show that feels like a greatest-hits set, even though it's practically every song she's ever recorded. Onstage, she comes on like the one-woman culmination of so many all-time pop legends — the perfect fusion of Madonna's aggro flash with Cyndi Lauper's just-wanna just-wanna warmth and Prince's omni-erotic outrageousness.

	But for all her ultra-modern sensibility, she's an old-school show-biz entertainer at heart. Her ballads were torch-song interludes that could have knocked them dead in lounges a century ago. For “Picture You,” she hung a blonde wig on the mic stand and sang to it. “California” had a great moment where she did a double take and laughed, “I just saw someone yawn. That's insane.” She reached back five years for “Love Me Anyway.” “This is an old one — I usually don't even sing it,” she said. “But you guys will pull me through it.” But then her tone shifted slightly when she reached for a skirt that wasn't there. “My god, I forgot my bottom's just a thong,” she said. “I looked at the screen and saw my ass.”


	“The Subway,” her summer single, is her most New York song — she debuted it at the local Governors Ball festival, in the summer of 2024, her last NYC show. It's an urban break-up ballad where the whole city seems to scream her ex's name, as Chappell sings, “I'm still counting down all of the days till you're just another girl on the subway.” It was poignant live, especially when the crowd took over for the closing lament, repeating the lines, “She's got a way/She got away.”


	“If you've got something pink, will you put it in the air so I can see it?” she requested before “Red Wine Supernova.” She got what she asked for with a sea of pink cowgirl hats. She introduced “My Kink Is Karma” with the words, “I wanna dedicate this one to my ex.” But for the big finale, instead of an encore break, she just jumped right into the inevitable show-stopper “Pink Pony Club.” You can tell it's a perfect pop song because it gets more effective — not less — when you hear it for the thousandth time. But to sing it in public is another level of devotion — belting “Santa Monica, you've been too good to me” with thousands of other like-minded fanatics is a truly powerful experience.

	











	The night began with drag performers and opening band Japanese Breakfast, doing songs from their new Melancholy Brunettes and Sad Women. “Chappell Roan is definitely this artist's favorite artist,” singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner said, adding at the end, “See you in the pit.” (Sociological footnote: the biggest crowd sing-alongs on Chappell's pre-show mix tape were Gaga's “Applause,” One Direction's “What Makes You Beautiful,” and — the big surprise — “Stacy's Mom” by Fountains of Wayne. Take a cosmic bow, Adam Schlesinger.)


	It was way back last October when Roan closed out her Midwest Princess tour, after her explosive summer of 2024, when she just seemed to get twice as massive every week. Since then, her only American gigs have been her appearances at the Grammys, Saturday Night Live, and Elton's Oscars party. But she's been a touring machine in Europe, making the festival rounds and bringing her castle with her. So it's a revelation to see how much more brash and confident she's gotten as a live performer— especially since she was never exactly slack in those departments. After the New York stand, she's got only four more pop-up shows, in Kansas City and L.A. As she explained, “I love these three cities so much + wanted the chance to do something special before going away to write the next album.”

	At one point, Chappell recalled, “I think the last time I played New York, it was Brooklyn Steel” — a club seven times smaller than Forest Hills. That was October 2023, when her album was just a few weeks old, yet she was already too massive for the 1800-capacity venue. That's one of the paradoxes of Chappell: She's a performer who's spent virtually her entire performing career playing rooms that feel ridiculously too small for her. But then, any room would. On a night like this, you couldn't imagine any place that could hold a pop-star presence this overwhelming, this emotionally intense, this committed. On the stage in her heels, it's where she belongs.

The familiar grounds of Heritage Village took on a different feel under the cloak of darkness on August 23rd. The historic buildings, usually full of life and history, stood silent and unlit, creating an atmosphere of nervous energy. This was the setting for a sold-out public investigation hosted by Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, an event that blended local history with a search for the supernatural, and left this reporter with experiences that defy easy explanation.

The goal of the evening, aside from providing a thrill, was to support a local landmark. Brad Monks, founder of Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, said his group is passionate about giving back.

""We, more than anything, would love trying to help out these types of locations that we do, especially Heritage Village or any museums or anything like that with historical significance in the province,"" Monks explained. ""If we can help out, that's what we like to do.""




The strange occurrences began for me inside the Vipond House. Without being touched, my phone suddenly began playing the song ""Tightrope Years,"" specifically at the lyric, ""And the years hit rewind."" It played through the chorus and stopped. This happened five more times, four inside the house and once more just outside the building, even after we filmed closing all apps and turning the volume completely down. It remains an unexplainable, technological anomaly in a house from a different era.

My experience wasn't isolated. Monks noted that many guests felt something that night. ""A lot of people like heard voices, some seen the shadow figures and stuff and things move,"" he said.

The most profound moment, however, happened inside the Knibbs House. I was attempting to communicate with whatever might be present using a device called a Rempod, which lights up in response to changes in the electromagnetic field. I began a simple yes/no conversation, and after establishing a connection, I asked if the spirit wanted to sing a song. The Rempod lit up for yes.




I suggested a classic children's song: ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat.""

What happened next was captured on audio and video. A device known as a spirit box, which rapidly scans radio frequencies, creating white noise, began to sing. Through the static, the clear, melodic tune of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" could be heard, seemingly in the voice of a little girl.

For Monks, who has been investigating for over 25 years, these are the moments that challenge even the most hardened skeptics. He is adamant about the authenticity of his group's work.

""I'm not going to jeopardize my experience and my reputation or try to rig something or anything like that,"" Monks stated firmly. ""What you get is what you get. Sometimes, you know, we'll go to a location... and we go there and nothing happens. We come up with nothing. But the majority of the time, we come up with a little bit of something... I always say, if you're a skeptic, come with us for one night and check it out. And I think you'll change your mind on it.""




Following the success of the August event, Monks is already in discussions with Heritage Village to plan an even bigger event for next year, with a vision to create a city-wide haunted tour.

""We're hoping not just to have Heritage Village for next year,"" Monks revealed. ""I'm looking at bringing Soo Line on board, and I'm going to talk to, and see if I can get the Tommy Douglas Center on board with it as well.""

For now, the grounds of Heritage Village are quiet once more, but for those who were there on that dark August night, the memories of inexplicable songs will linger for a long time.","{'href': 'https://discoverweyburn.com', 'title': 'DiscoverWeyburn'}","other"

In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, conspiracy theories across the political spectrum are spreading rapidly online. CNN's Marshall Cohen reports.

In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, conspiracy theories across the political spectrum are spreading rapidly online. CNN's Marshall Cohen reports.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to implement a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas in an effort to address what his administration claims is the overuse of the program. CNN's Kristin Holmes explains what this means.

Sister Albertine Debacker, a 29-year-old who goes by @soeur.albertine, is an influencer with a difference. She gives advice and shares details of her life as a Catholic nun to more than 500,000 followers. It's part of a wider trend in France where the Catholic Church says it's seeing an unexpected revival among Gen Z, fuelled in part by social media. CNN's Joseph Ataman spoke to Sister Albertine at a youth festival in France to learn more about this fresh approach to faith.

The Trump administration abruptly suspended most Palestinian visas in August, derailing college plans for hundreds of Gazan students. CNN's Kylie Atwood spoke to one woman who fled Israel Gaza City offensive this week instead of setting up her American dorm room.

Van Jones reveals what Charlie Kirk messaged him one day before his assassination.

GOP Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday denounced Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's threats to pull ABC's broadcast license as “unbelievably dangerous” and compared some of his rhetoric to “mafioso” tactics.

Protesters and ICE agents clashed outside of an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois after demonstrators sat in front of the exit as ICE vehicles were trying to leave. Several people, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were struck by pepper balls and tear gas. In a statement to CNN, ICE blamed the protestors for the events, saying they assaulted agents.

In a ruling dripping with derision, a federal judge has rejected President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, asserting that the rambling 85-page suit did not follow federal rules for filing civil complaints.

Drenching storms turned quiet streets in into rivers of mud in California's San Bernardino County. One motorist was trapped in moments, roads were buried and neighborhoods were cut off. Families had to shelter in place and some vehicles were left temporarily stranded, but no injuries have been reported, officials say.

Federal funding cuts to a pediatric cancer network that runs clinical trials have limited potentially life-saving treatments for 5-year-old Juliette Lesko, who has an incurable form of pediatric brain cancer called ependymoma. CNN's Rene Marsh spoke to her parents about their fight to save her life.

A telecommunication outage caused Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers in Dallas to lose radar and some communications, leading to flights being stopped at the area's airports. After a virtual shut down of airports across the city, some flights were allowed to resume after 3:30 p.m. CT.

Former CDC official Dr. Demetre Daskalakis describes the unusual confusion he saw within a meeting of advisers chosen by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to guide CDC vaccine recommendations.

President Donald Trump said he thinks networks' broadcast licenses could be revoked if they air overwhelmingly negative perspectives on him. CNN's Kaitlan Collins reports.

CNN's Fareed Zakaria asks former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about Jimmy Kimmel's show being pulled from ABC's air. Watch Fareed Zakaria GPS on Sunday at 10aET/PT.

Dr. Martin Kulldorff, the new head of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, proposed “a live public debate on vaccines” with former CDC leaders. But CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner warned that the topics are too complex to be settled through public debates.

CNN's Jake Tapper explains the business practices going on as a result of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" being taken off the air and how the Trump administration plays a role in it. 

President Donald Trump criticized Jimmy Kimmel and dismissed questions over whether his suspension amounted to an attack on free speech during a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel came after FCC Chariman Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against Disney if they did not address Kimmel's comments about the reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder.

Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk, appeared virtually for his first court hearing since he was formally charged with aggravated murder, among other charges. Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty in the case.

A New York judge on Tuesday dismissed two terror-related murder charges against Luigi Mangione, finding they are “legally insufficient,” according to the judge's ruling.

Several homes were damaged or destroyed in San Juan County, Utah, on Saturday. The state rarely sees destructive tornadoes, with only three confirmed in that county since 1950, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.

Vice President JD Vance hosted an episode of ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" after Kirk's assassination. Vance had multiple notable guests on including Tucker Carlson, RFK Jr. and Karoline Leavitt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Did Kenneth even know the frequency?: Five classic songs with enduring mysteries","https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/investigating-five-classic-songs-with-enduring-mysteries/","Sun, 21 Sep 2025 18:30:00 GMT","

Just about everybody loves a good mystery, but it's not always for the same reasons. Some folks are obsessed with sleuthing and rapidly forming hypotheses on limited information in order to feel a sense or order and control in the universe—true crime docs and Reddit conspiracy threads are their playgrounds. 

For others, the mystery itself is the draw; the romantic idea that something, somehow, can actually remain bewildering in a world of overwhelming surveillance and data bombardment is quite the comforting thought. “May it always remain unsolved,” they might say.

Pop music is chock-full of little mysteries of its own, of course, although the number seems to be dwindling year by year, as obsessed scholars have nearly overturned every single stone ever touched by a Beatle, and every beard ever worn by Bob Dylan. 

Fortunately, there are still 2,843 music mysteries classified as “vaguely uncertain” by the Council for Unnecessary Studies, which gives us the chance to randomly select five of them for an update on our latest investigations. 

The 1993 mega hit ‘I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)' has caused decades of confusion. What exactly was “that”? 

Songwriter Jim Steinman always maintained the answer was right there in the lyrics — each verse includes a list of things Meat Loaf would do for love, followed by the one thing he wouldn't. For example: he'd “run right into hell and back,” but he won't “forget the way you feel right now.” Still, Meat Loaf admitted he loved the ambiguity, and fans continue to debate it like it's pop's ultimate Zen koan.

REM's ‘What's the Frequency, Kenneth?' (1994) was inspired by a bizarre 1986 incident in which American news anchor Dan Rather was attacked in New York by a man repeating the phrase, “Kenneth, what's the frequency?” The attacker, later identified after the song's release as William Tager, was a mentally ill ex-con who was convinced that TV networks were beaming signals into his head. Michael Stipe didn't know that detail at the time, however, so he spun the surreal event into a song about cultural dislocation. 

But is the original mystery actually solved? Do we know for certain that Tager wasn't being victimised by a TV signal, and that Dan Rather, aka Kenneth, didn't know its frequency? Choose your own adventure on that one, I guess.

Carly Simon's sassy 1972 classic ‘You're So Vain' kept fans guessing for generations about which famous jerk might have inspired its biting lyrics. Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, and Warren Beatty were all rumoured suspects, but it was just as fun to insert your own narcissistic ex into the story.

Then, for some reason, in 2015, Simon finally confirmed that at least one verse was indeed about Beatty. Simon insisted multiple men are still implicated, however, and she's never revealed the full list, so again, the game's afoot if you like a good scorn-based whodunnit.

On MF Doom's beloved Mm..Food (2004), a guest rapper billed as Mr. Fantastik appears on ‘Rapp Snitch Knishes,' spitting arguably the best verse on the entire album: “True to the ski mask, New York's my origin / Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion / Accordin' to him, when the D's rushed in / Complication from the wire, testimony was thin.” 

Yet no one has ever confirmed this MC's identity. No photos, no other credits, no social media trail. Some believe he was a New York underground rapper who never pursued a career; others suspect he was Doom himself under an alias, pitch-shifted and disguised. With Doom's death in 2020, the mystery deepened. Unless tapes emerge from the vaults, Mr Fantastik may remain hip-hop's phantom guest — a testament to Doom's love of comic-book alter egos and unsolvable puzzles.

On ‘You Said Something' from her 2000 album Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, PJ Harvey sings of a fleeting but magical moment in New York: “On a rooftop in Brooklyn / At one in the morning / Watching the lights flash / In Manhattan. / You said something / That I've never forgotten.” 

The song repeatedly mentions that “something” but leaves it poetically, romantically, ironically, and frustratingly unquoted. Was it a sweet statement of affection? A riddle? A secret confession? By withholding the detail, Harvey actually creates something far more interesting, as the listener is left to ponder the profundity of some random's rooftop remark that managed to inspire a song this good.
