Ballon d'Or favourite Ousmane Dembélé may still make Monday's award ceremony despite his Paris Saint-Germain side now having to play their postponed Ligue 1 game at Marseille at exactly the same time.

He is injured for the match at the Stade Velodrome and PSG bosses must now decide if he is permitted to go to the Paris event.

The bulk of the Champions League-winning squad will have to miss the bash.

Le Classique was due to take place on Sunday but heavy rain meant it was put back to Monday, despite Marseille playing again on Friday at Strasbourg before hosting Ajax in the Champions League on Tuesday September 30.

The other option was to postpone to December but the league announced a Monday kick-off instead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England's kits for the 2026 FIFA World Cup have reportedly been leaked, with the Football Association seemingly opting for a safe design following the controversy over their Euro 2024 attire. The home kit will maintain the Three Lions' classic white shirt with claims it will also feature ‘modern touches'. Red inserts are expected to be featured on the design, complete with a navy outline. Typical features will include the one star denoting England's 1966 World Cup triumph, which will be placed above the badge. The update had seen the traditional red cross with a navy blue, light blue and pink one. Amid a backlash against the change, Sir Keir Starmer - then opposition leader - had been among those to call for the design to be changed back. 'The flag's unifying, it doesn't need to change,' Starmer said at the time. So I think they should just reconsider this and change it back.' Designs are yet to be confirmed for the away kit for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, but England are expected to return to their traditional red strip. The Three Lions had worn a blue away kit for Euro 2024. England are closing in on qualification for the World Cup having moved seven points clear at the top of their qualification group. Official details on England's kits are likely to be released later this year, after Thomas Tuchel's men seal qualification for the World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ENGLAND'S kit for the 2026 World Cup has been leaked. FA chiefs have opted for a clean and safe design after the controversy surrounding the Euro 2024 shirt. There is an intricate jacquard pattern on the chest and torso displaying a lion and stars. Red inserts complement a navy trim around the neck and sleeves, similar to the Euro 2020 kit. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer even slammed the FA and Nike for changing the “unifying” St George's flag, but manufacturers refused to revert back to the traditional colours. England have returned to the traditional red for their away kit for the next World Cup, despite the navy-purple look selling well. However the design is still yet to be released, or leaked, though it could follow a similar safe style to the home jersey. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wrexham's first league victory over Norwich City being broadcast live on TV in the United States should have surprised no one. Throw in the extra intrigue of USMNT striker Josh Sargent leading the Norwich attack and it really was a no-brainer for Paramount+ to make the game one of their three 3pm kick-offs shown live on Saturday. It was one they passed as a tweak of formation, with two debutants in Issa Kabore and Dominic Hyam starting in a re-jigged back five, led to Wrexham deservedly prevailing 3-2. “Football is about trying to be secure at one end and keep the attacking threat that we'd shown so far this season. It not only afforded Wrexham the freedom to get at their hosts, as two-goal Josh Windass and Lewis O'Brien provided excellent support for lone striker Kieffer Moore. But the defence also looked much more secure than it has all season, even allowing for the two lapses in concentration that were punished ruthlessly by Jack Stacey and Jovon Makama. Parkinson's response was to bring Manchester City loanee Kabore in for his debut at right wing-back, as Ryan Longman switched to the opposite flank. Not only did Kabore provide two stunning assists from the right flank — Windass and Longman the beneficiaries — but there was a cohesion to Wrexham's defensive efforts that had been totally lacking against QPR a week earlier. Having been recalled to Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad earlier this month for the friendly double-header against South Korea and Japan, the Norwich captain is eyeing a place at next year's World Cup. A glance at Sargent's metrics for Norwich points towards someone who makes the most of any service that comes his way. Prior to Wrexham's visit, his five goals had come from 121 touches of the ball spread across five games, according to Opta. Those five goals had come from a mere 16 shots this season. Moore, by way of contrast, had four goals from the same number of shots but he'd been much more involved, chalking up 195 touches including 11 headed clearances. Against Wrexham, Sargent saw slightly more of the ball. And yet his three attempts came with a combined expected goals (xG) of just 0.09, underling what a good job Hyam and his team-mates did on the U.S. striker. Otherwise, it was an afternoon to forget for Norwich's talisman, who turned down a big-money move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg during the summer. He's a dangerous player but our concentration levels were good. “There was a lot of fatigue out there eventually, as they tracked his runs, they got tight to him and limited a really good player to very little.” Parkinson was also full of praise for Kabore, who had an exemplary afternoon down the right. He had 48 touches (only Cleworth with 66 and Ben Sheaf with 61 managed more for the visitors), sent over nine crosses (six more than anyone else in red) and managed two headed clearances to go with his assists for Windass and Longman. “The medical team were behind me and saying, ‘His sprint distances are completely off the scale, can we get him off?' But he was doing such a good job defensively. “For us, we have had very attack-minded wing-backs in recent years. But we also needed someone with a defensive mindset as well. “I just hope Pep (Guardiola) doesn't get a video of the game as he might want him back!” How can they be when their expected goals against (xGA) stands at 14.5, at least two goals more than any of their peers. But, there was enough in the Norwich victory to suggest a corner has been turned and that things should continue to improve in the coming weeks as, effectively, a new squad gets to grips with the Championship. “I wanted the lads to enjoy this game,” adds Parkinson. “Four years ago we were down this way and playing King's Lynn away in front of 800 people. I want people to understand how far we have come.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With an estimated 5.5 million fans expected, seamless, secure, and modern payment infrastructure has become critical for converting international visitor spending into substantial economic gains. The higher average spending of foreign tourists—nearly three times that of local consumers—makes efficient payment processing a strategic necessity across retail, hospitality, entertainment, and food and beverage sectors.The push for modernization is driven not only by transaction volume but also by the diverse payment preferences of global travelers, including credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless options. Streamlined systems will allow businesses to scale operations during peak periods, ensure frictionless transactions at hotels, stadiums, restaurants, and retail outlets, and enhance overall visitor experience. By investing in advanced, agile payment platforms, Mexico aims to transform the influx of international fans into measurable economic growth while positioning its tourism and hospitality sectors for long-term success.Advertisement  Recent data on consumer spending patterns underscores the urgency. International tourists, though they represent a relatively small portion of total transactions, contribute disproportionately to overall spending. On average, foreign visitors spend almost three times more per purchase than local consumers. This significant difference in transaction values illustrates the need for payment systems capable of efficiently handling larger, high-value purchases while minimizing friction.For businesses operating in Mexico during the World Cup, upgrading payment infrastructure is no longer a luxury. Modern payment platforms that combine agility, security, and global compatibility are poised to become strategic enablers of revenue growth rather than mere conveniences.Advertisement  The sports and entertainment sector, in particular, stands to benefit from comprehensive payment integration. From ticket purchases to in-stadium concessions, smooth and reliable payment experiences can significantly enhance customer satisfaction while increasing operational efficiency. Efficient checkout processes reduce queues and transaction bottlenecks, especially during peak times, ensuring that fans enjoy a seamless experience while venues maximize revenue opportunities.Similarly, the food and beverage industry can leverage advanced payment technology to handle surges in demand efficiently. Faster and frictionless payments not only improve customer satisfaction but also increase the number of transactions handled per hour, directly contributing to higher revenues during high-traffic events like the World Cup.Advertisement  Beyond transactional efficiency, the broader tourism and hospitality sectors are beginning to view digital payment experiences as a critical component of service quality. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators that adopt global payment solutions and contactless technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, ensuring that visitors enjoy a hassle-free experience from arrival to departure.Looking forward, businesses preparing for the World Cup must focus on three key pillars of payment modernization:Diversifying payment methods to accommodate international visitor preferences, including credit cards, digital wallets, and other emerging payment technologies.Minimizing friction at checkout to prevent cart abandonment, reduce queues, and speed up transactions across all points of sale.Delivering personalized payment experiences that foster customer loyalty and encourage repeat business beyond the duration of the tournament.The upcoming World Cup presents Mexico with a unique economic opportunity. Effective payment systems can unlock higher spending from international visitors, optimize operations across multiple sectors, and enhance the overall visitor experience. For companies across industries, investing in modern payment infrastructure is no longer optional—it is a strategic imperative to maximize both operational efficiency and economic gain.Advertisement  Share On:Tags: Digital Payments, mexico tourism, Travel News, World Cup 2026Subscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News The push for modernization is driven not only by transaction volume but also by the diverse payment preferences of global travelers, including credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless options.
