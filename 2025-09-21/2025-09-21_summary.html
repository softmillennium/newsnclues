            President Donald Trump on Sunday said tech and media giants Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch will be a part of the group to take over TikTok's algorithm in the acquisition of the social media platform's US operations.
    


            “You know, they're very well-known people. And Larry Ellison is one of them. He's involved. He's a great guy. Michael Dell is involved. I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved,” Trump said on Fox News' “Sunday Briefing,” referring to Lachlan Murdoch — the CEO of Fox Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News — and the son of Fox Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch.
    


            Trump added that Rupert Murdoch “is probably going to be in the group.”
    


            The TikTok talks involving the Murdochs could result in Fox Corp. becoming part of the consortium, according to a person familiar with the matter. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch would not be investing as individuals.
    


            Participating in the TikTok consortium could provide a boost for Fox Corp., which has been making many digital media investments to offset declining areas of business like broadcast television.
    


            Dell is the CEO of computer maker Dell Technologies.
    


            Trump's comments are a change from the consortium of investors previously named in the TikTok deal. The Trump administration had said that the group of investors would include Ellison's company, Oracle, along with Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that TikTok will have seven board members, six of whom will be American.
    


            The makeup of American investors is required by the bill passed by Congress in April 2024, which required a nationwide ban of TikTok operations in the United States unless the social media app sold about 80% of its assets to American investors.
    


            Leavitt had said on Saturday that data and privacy for the app in the United States will be led by Oracle and that the company would be one of the American investors.
    


            Ellison's company began hosting TikTok's US data in 2020.
    


            Trump said Friday that he had “a very productive call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and that progress was made toward finalizing the deal.

            • Massive memorial service: Huge crowds of mourners have made their way inside a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, for the funeral of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month. Worship music is playing and seats are dwindling as tens of thousands of supporters pack into the service.
    


            • Trump administration: President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet will speak at the service, prompting extremely tight security. Kirk had a direct line to the president and was a personal friend of many Trump officials.
    


            • Outpouring of grief: Erika Kirk, who is taking the helm at her late husband's organization, Turning Point USA, will also speak. Kirk has said she's anguished at the loss of a loving husband and father and has vowed to continue his work.
    


            State Farm Stadium is at near capacity as attendees have filled the stadium for Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sunday.
    


            Almost all the available seats inside appear to be full just after 9:30 a.m. local time.
    


            More than 200,000 mourners may try to attend the service, a Glendale Police Department spokesperson told CNN.
    


Here's a glimpse inside the stadium: 



                    We have already seen some notable names in the crowd today, including several lawmakers, conservative influencers and Republican officials. There are various levels of access, including “floor” passes and VIP access, aside from the general admission. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            A number of Trump administration officials and Cabinet members who will speak at Charlie Kirk's memorial have both publicly and privately credited the conservative activist for their current positions.
    


            Kirk took an active role during Donald Trump's transition ahead of the president's second term, temporarily moving his family down to Florida and helping vet the officials.
    


            Many of these officials had Kirk on speed dial and would text with him on a regular basis until his death, sources told CNN.
    


            Trump, who will be the final speaker Sunday, has publicly lauded Kirk for helping him win over youth voters in 2024, which the president and his advisers believed helped him secure the election.
    


Vice President JD Vance, a close friend of Kirk's, will also speak at his memorial. Vance has credited Kirk with bringing him into the MAGA fold, helping him win his Senate campaign in Ohio and ultimately convincing Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., that Vance had truly come to support Trump. Trump Jr. played an enormous role in convincing the president that Vance was the right pick for VP.
    


Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth privately credited Kirk with getting him confirmed in the Senate. During what was a contentious confirmation process, one of the greatest hurdles to Hegseth's nomination was GOP Sen. Joni Ernst. Kirk launched an active campaign against Ernst, threatening to primary her and getting his large following on board.
    


            Trump's health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said Kirk was a leading architect of Kennedy's endorsement of Trump and crucial to him getting his Cabinet position. Sources said Kirk stressed the importance of Kennedy's “Make America Healthy Again” movement to Trump's team and how the former independent presidential candidate would open new avenues of voters to Trump.
    


            Kirk called getting Kennedy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed “mission critical.” Kirk used his enormous platform to promote Gabbard, who will also speak today. Kirk privately called senators and their associates when it looked as though she might not make it through the confirmation process, a source told CNN at the time.
    


            Here's another look at the crowds outside State Farm Stadium, where many tens of thousands of mourners will honor Charlie Kirk at today's memorial service:

                    Almost all available seats inside State Farm Stadium now appear full a little after 9:30 a.m. local time. There hasn't been official word that the venue is at capacity, but it certainly looks from the floor as if there aren't any more seats in the designated sections. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            Today's crowd is full of young adults who felt connected to Charlie Kirk, who began building Turning Point USA — the most influential young conservative organization in the country — when he was still a teenager.
    


            “He was willing for conversation. I think we've lost the desire to converse with opposite views … and I think Charlie really came and tried to bridge that gap,” said Karla Soto Perez, a student at Grand Canyon University who left campus at 2 a.m. to get to the stadium.
    


            “We are all humans and we're all created in the image of God and we all have something to say,” she said, summing up Kirk's faith-driven message. “And that's so important.”
    


            Her friend Emily Blumenschein said she felt compelled to attend today's service to show solidarity with Kirk's message.
    


            “I feel like our generation, especially for what he did for us, the least we can do is show up and to show that we stand with Christianity and for the truth and to support him and his family,” she said.
    


            Luke Bravo, from Fresno, California, said Kirk's assassination hit him hard.
    


            “It was like a brother in Christ was shot and killed, and I felt like a member of the family and it was really hard,” he said.
    


            He said he was looking forward to hearing in particular from Erika Kirk — who was named CEO of Turning Point and is poised to take on a significant profile in conservative politics.
    


            Starting early this morning, we saw huge crowds forming outside State Farm Stadium. As soon as the doors open, they filed in to Charlie Kirk's memorial service — but even as seats began to fill up, it feels on the ground like it barely made a dent on the still-growing number of mourners outside.
    


Here's another look at the scenes in Glendale, Arizona:



                    The hours before the service gets underway have the feel of a megachurch service, with worship music pulsing through the stadium and attendees on their feet raising their hands in praise. Almost all of the people I've spoken to here have mentioned Charlie Kirk's Christian faith as a reason they were drawn to him and motivated to come to today's memorial. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            While tens of thousands of people gather to memorialize Charlie Kirk, his Turning Point USA group is taking an opportunity to organize.
    


            In the hours before the official program begins, volunteers are walking through the concourse at State Farm Stadium with clipboards to help register voters.
    


            Attendees were also handed flyers for America Fest 2025, TPUSA's annual conference in December, with discount codes to attend.
    


            Turning Point USA was a major organizing force in President Donald Trump's reelection, pouring millions of dollars into the battleground state of Arizona, and many hope their work will continue in the wake of Kirk's passing.
    


            As many pile into State Farm Stadium on Sunday morning, CNN spoke to some attendees about what it means to them to be at Charlie Kirk's memorial service.
    


            “I wanted to be here to honor him and his life and his family, what he stood for,” Pamela Milton told CNN.
    


            Milton flew from California to attend the service. She said she arrived at the stadium around 5 a.m. local time and got inside about three hours later.
    


            Clifford Craig also arrived early, at around 2:30 a.m. local time.
    


            When asked about why he decided to attend the service, Craig told CNN, “To show my love and support for America and Charlie Kirk.”
    


            Craig described hearing the news of Kirk's death as devastating and “like losing a brother.”
    


            “I'd really like to hear positive influence, how we're going to move forward with unity and help bring this country back together, what it should be,” Craig said.
    


            Other attendees shared similar words about their hopes for the service and said they are happy to be in attendance to honor Kirk.
    


                    The venue is rapidly filling. The first and second tiers of seating are now full, and the uppermost level is beginning to look full as well. Lines of attendees continue to snake through the stadium as people find their seats. — Kevin Liptak, Glendale, Arizona






            Ballistic glass surrounds the podium at Charlie Kirk's memorial service today inside Arizona's State Farm Stadium, where a high-profile lineup of speakers — including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance — are set to take the stage.
    


            The glass-secured podium, positioned front and center, reflects security measures now standard at grand and open-space events featuring the president, especially after last year's assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.
    


            CNN has reported on the heightened security operation for the massive event.
    


            President Donald Trump briefly spoke with reporters before he departed for Charlie Kirk's memorial in Arizona.
    


            The president answered questions about Russia's recent breaches of NATO allies' airspace and the Department of Justice potentially prosecuting several political foes.



Here's what he said: 



Defense of Poland and Baltic states from Russia: Trump told reporters he would defend the countries from Russia if necessary. “Yeah, I would,” he told reporters while leaving the White House for Arizona to attend Kirk's memorial service. Trump's comments come after breaches over the airspaces of several NATO member countries in the past week.
    


Pressure on Justice Department: “Pam Bondi is doing a great job,” he told reporters. “I think Pam Bondi is going to go down as one of the best attorney generals of the ages.” The comments come after Trump in a social media post Saturday put pressure on Bondi to bring criminal charges against several political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump suggested in a subsequent post Saturday he does have confidence in Bondi, whom he described as “very careful.”
    


            A Glendale Police Department spokesperson now tells us more than 200,000 may try to attend today's memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk — double the previous estimate of 100,000.
    


            Over 200,000 people have registered for the event on Turning Point USA's website, Jose Santiago told CNN today.
    


That would easily exceed the available seats: State Farm Stadium has capacity for more than 63,000 people, according to its website, with the ability to expand to accommodate an additional 10,000.
    


            Desert Diamond Arena, which will serve as an overflow site, has a seating capacity of around 19,000.
    


            State Farm Stadium is beginning to fill with what is expected to be many tens of thousands of mourners ahead of the service's official start.
    


            The atmosphere is far from that of a typical funeral. Attendees, many of whom have been waiting since the early morning hours to get inside, are mostly wearing red, white and blue — as suggested by organizers — with virtually no one coming in black.
    


            The crowd spans a range of ages, from teenagers to older folks. I've seen many families with young children as well.
    


            Right now, Christian musicians are on stage playing worship music as the crowd continues to arrive. Many in the crowd are standing and raising their hands to the music.
    


            Already, the first tier of seats appears mostly full. People are beginning to take seats in the second tier.
    


                    The streets of Glendale are gridlocked for miles. Streams of attendees — many wearing apparel with Charlie Kirk's likeness — are parking miles away and walking to the stadium. As a long procession of motorcycles donning American flags wove through the congestion, many motorists stepped out of their vehicles and applauded, with some yelling, “God bless America!” — Josh Campbell, Glendale, Arizona






            Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, who is accused of killing prominent conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, with aggravated murder and announced they would seek the death penalty.
    


            The charging document for the 22-year-old suspect outlines evidence collected by investigators, including DNA on the suspected murder weapon and a texted confession.
    


Here's what you should know:



            The charging document says Robinson “intentionally” targeted Kirk because of Robinson's “belief or perception regarding Charlie Kirk's political expression.”
    


            In addition to aggravated murder, prosecutors outlined six other charges against Robinson.
    


            He faces two charges of obstruction of justice after concealing or removing “the firearm used to shoot Charlie Kirk,” and after he allegedly “destroyed, concealed, or removed the clothing he wore during the shooting,” according to the document.
    


            Robinson also faces one count of felony discharge of a firearm and one count commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.
    


            Prosecutors presented two charges of witness tampering for directing his roommate to delete “incriminating” text messages and to stay silent if questioned by police, the court filing states.
    


            Read here for a full rundown of the key takeaways.
    


            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have vowed to go after Democrats and liberal organizations in the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, describing their actions as retribution.
    


            “I think this is right out of the authoritarian playbook,” Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in her first televised interview since the 2024 election. “They're taking a terrible crime, this awful murder of this young man, and they are trying to use it, along with others of their rationales, to go after their political opponents.”
    


            Clinton said the United States has “a violence problem,” pointing to the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home in April.
    


            In such moments, Clinton argued, “leadership should try to bring people together.”
    


            “But instead, we're seeing more of the divisiveness,” the former secretary said.
    


            Asked if ABC's yanking of Jimmy Kimmel's show after apparent pressure from Trump's Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is state censorship, Clinton said it “is a very clear example of that,” adding that free speech must always be protected — not only when it's favorable, which she argued is the Trump administration's approach.
    


            “You defend free speech in terrible times,” Clinton said. “And you defend free speech that is used against holding people in power accountable through satire, humor, barbed attacks. You defend it even when it is offensive.”
    


            CNN is here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where huge crowds of mourners are expected to gather for the funeral of Charlie Kirk.
    


            This video from a short time ago shows a line already stretching across the parking lot as attendees wait to enter the memorial service.
    


            Local authorities have told us they expect as many as 100,000 people to show up at the stadium and an overflow site.
    


            As President Donald Trump left the White House to attend the memorial for Charlie Kirk today in Arizona, he said the service will “celebrate the life of a great man.”
    


            “We want to look at as a time of healing,” Trump said. “That something like this could have happened is not even believable so we will have a very interesting day, a very tough day.”
    


            When asked what message he wants to share with Kirk's family, the president said, “I will just give them my love, there's nothing much you can say.”
    


            “He had a hold on youth because they loved him, they respected him,” Trump said. The service, he added, will highlight Kirk's “tremendous influence for a young man, he did a great job.”
    


            The memorial service for Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners to a football stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
    


            Earlier this week, the president said he will “say a few words” at the ceremony. In addition to the president, Turning Point USA has also said that Vice President JD Vance and Kirk's widow, Erika, will deliver remarks.

Murano resident reported children, aged between 12 and 13, to the police

Italy might be a football-loving country but that did not stop police in Venice from pursuing a group of unlikely targets: 14 children who fell foul for playing the game in a public square, leading to fines presented to their parents, in a move that has sparked a debate about the rights of young people to play outdoors.

The children, aged between 12 and 13, were playing football earlier this month in Pino Signoretto square in Murano, an island of about 4,500 inhabitants in the Venetian lagoon, when a resident, annoyed by the noise they were making, reported them to the police.

Police officers then went to the square and identified each child before their parents were summoned and ordered to pay a €50 (£43) fine on their behalf. The children were allegedly playing football in a prohibited area, “creating a disturbance to the public peace and a danger for people in transit”, according to the official notice given to the parents and published in the Italian press.

Antonio Trampus, the father of one of the children, told La Stampa: “My son called me in tears. The police wouldn't listen to reason. They could have called us parents and asked us to take our children home. Instead, they immediately took their names and addresses.”

The fine could rise to as much as €500 if not paid within 60 days. “But we will not pay,” said Trampus, adding that the group was planning to appeal and take the matter up with the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro.

The fines were enforced based on regulations introduced in 2019 banning ball games in certain areas of Venice. In Murano, the only square where the game is permitted is San Bernardo. But the parents argue that Pino Signoretto square was never included in the list of banned areas as it was only recently created after the neighbourhood was redeveloped.

“San Bernardo is not suitable,” said Trampus. “Whereas the other square is. Removing the children there would mean returning it to the state it was in before.”

The case sparked debate in Venice, with local councillor Marco Gasparinetti arguing that the police intervention was disproportionate and questioning the priorities in a city grappling with overtourism, pickpockets and a dwindling local population.

Referring to the parents being summoned to the police station, Gasparinetti wrote on Facebook: “Were they scammers? Pickpockets? Drug dealers? No, they were the parents of [14] children.”

Gasparinetti added that it should have been enough to take the ball away and tell the children to stop playing. “Wouldn't that have been more educational? Common sense and a sense of priority were lacking.”

Corriere del Veneto reported that the children might have been penalised due to their age, because areas where ball games are permitted are exclusive to children under 11.

Paolo Poggi, a retired professional footballer who was born in Venice, also contributed to the debate. “Long live children who spend time outdoors,” he told La Nuova Venezia newspaper. “The rules are sacrosanct, but common sense is needed. Children's play experience must be preserved.”

			Poised and devout Erika Kirk has been violently thrust into spotlight since her husband's assassination

When 23-year-old Erika Kirk was named Miss Arizona, contenders saw her as a poised, devout woman with a sense of purpose that elevated her above the competition.

These qualities have been put to the test since her husband, the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, was shot dead while speaking to students on a university campus in Utah last week.

Mrs Kirk, now 36, has been thrust violently into the national spotlight.

In the days since her husband was assassinated and she was forced to tell her two young children that their father would not be coming home because he was “on a work trip with Jesus”, she has emerged with her sense of mission intact.

“I will never let your legacy die,” she vowed to Kirk in a tearful address earlier this week.

Friends and political strategists believe Mrs Kirk, a real estate agent who had previously kept a relatively low profile, is emerging as a political force in her own right.

On Thursday, she was named the chief executive and board chairman of Turning Point USA, her husband's conservative activist group.

Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point's chief operating officer, said she was the obvious candidate to replace Kirk at the helm shortly after her appointment.

He told The Telegraph: “Charlie and Erika are one person ... so it only makes sense for her to be leading the organisation. She carries not only his namesake but his legacy and his heart, his zeal.

“Nothing changes here. We're going to miss our friend dearly, but we are going to see his legacy live on through Erika.”

He added: “Erika Kirk has been the bravest soul I've ever seen in my entire life. I've seen people go through traumatic events. This is beyond traumatic.”

Caitlin Fitz-Maurice, who competed in the 2012 Miss Arizona pageant won by Mrs Kirk, remembered her as a young woman mature beyond her years.

Upset after placing as runner-up in the competition, she recalled Mrs Kirk encouraging her to seek out a “greater purpose”.

“I was more obsessed with trivial things – back then I wasn't really thinking about the future a lot,” Ms Fitz-Maurice told The Telegraph.

“I remember talking to her about going to law school… and her saying, you should be doing those things that matter. I remember being upset about the pageant. She was like, ‘you have a greater purpose, go for that'.”

“She really is a caring, godly person – nothing is fake. What she professes, it's how she lives,” added Ms Fitz-Maurice, who went on to study at George Washington University and qualify as a lawyer.

Mrs Kirk, who worked for real estate firm The Corcoran Group, founded the non-profit Everyday Heroes Like You, which supports under-recognised charities, several years before she claimed the Miss Arizona crown.

She later turned down an offer to become a cast member of the reality TV series Summer House, although she did appear in one episode. “She's beautiful and happens to be religious” was how she was introduced by a friend.

Raised and baptised as a Catholic, she also founded a brand of religious streetwear, selling t-shirts, hoodies, caps and blankets that displayed Bible scenes and verses.

“Every item we produce is created with intention and designed to spark and inspire Gospel conversation,” its website still states.

She met Charlie Kirk in a New York burger restaurant in 2018 for what was supposed to be a job interview but quickly turned into “banter over theology, philosophy and politics”, she later recalled.

“I'm going to date you,” he told her at the end of the meeting.

After marrying in 2021, Mrs Kirk cast herself as her husband's “helpmate” in her “biblical role” as a wife and was frequently at his side during Turning Point events.

Kirk, a Maga firebrand who seemed happiest when fighting in the trenches of culture wars, appeared almost bashful when he introduced his wife on an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show podcast.

Responding to a question about which of them was more conservative, he said without a moment's thought: “Erika.” Grinning, he added: “By far. I am a moderate compared to Erika”.

She returned to the same podcast studio – this time alone – after her husband was allegedly shot dead by 22-year-old student Tyler Robinson.

“Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith,” she said in an emotional speech. “Now and for all eternity, he will stand at his saviour's side, wearing the glorious crown of a martyr.”

She brought her husband's body home to Arizona with JD Vance, the US vice-president, on Air Force Two.

Some compared the grim journey made by the newly-widowed Mrs Kirk, who emerged from the plane with her head bowed and dark sunglasses covering her eyes, to Jackie Kennedy returning from Dallas after John F Kennedy's assassination.

Kirk, who died aged 31, was one of the most influential political figures of his generation, having the ear of Donald Trump and a major voice in the US president's Maga movement.

Turning Point USA, which he founded in 2012, has emerged as a powerful force on hundreds of college campuses.

Mrs Kirk was named its chief executive on Thursday after being urged by friends to take the reins of a movement that suddenly found itself rudderless.

Anna Scott Marsh, a lobbyist who met Kirk as a student and maintained a friendship with him for 10 years, first encountered Mrs Kirk in 2021 when she turned up to help with a political fundraiser in North Carolina.

“She was just so similar to Charlie – so kind, so gracious with her time, so intelligent. When you talk to either of them, they make you feel like you're the most important person in the room,” she recalled.

Backing her decision to take up her husband's mantle, she continued: “Staying the face of Turning Point I think would be really healing to her, and I think it would be really healing for a lot of Americans to see her strength and her tenacity.

“People honestly are kind of looking to her for it, and I know that's a huge burden to ask for her to carry. But I think that she is convicted by her beliefs, both religious and political.”

Brian Darling, a Republican strategist, said he expected Kirk's legacy to be continued through “a bigger Turning Point USA organisation”, which has reported thousands of requests for new chapters since his death.

Figures with ties to the movement told The Telegraph they were being approached by donors outraged by Kirk's murder to grow its presence.

Ms Fitz-Maurice hopes Mrs Kirk will emerge as a major political force.

“She has that fight in her, but she said she's grieving… I really do hope that she does take on his [Kirk's] legacy, and I know that she will. She's got the strength and the perseverance,” she said.

“I know people talk about it, in circles, that they hope she runs for president. I hope all those things.”

            Britain, Canada and Australia announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


            The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution.
    


            France and several other countries are expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week, deepening Israel's isolation and putting them at odds with Israel's key partner, the United States.
    


            In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.
    


            More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel's offensive in Gaza.
    


            In the first of a series of apparently coordinated announcements Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on X his country “recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel.”
    


            “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before the announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.”
    


            Carney had said in July that his country would recognize the State of Palestine at the UNGA, drawing immediate condemnation from Israeli officials and the US, with President Donald Trump saying it could hurt Canada in trade talks.
    


            The announcement by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes good on his pledge in July to recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel met certain conditions, which included agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to the prospect of a two-state solution.
    


            Since Starmer issued his ultimatum, Israel has moved to take control of Gaza City and expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and has repeated its opposition to a two-state solution.
    


            “In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for countries to join France in announcing their recognition at UNGA. Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino are among other governments planning to recognize a Palestinian state this week.
    


            Israel has furiously condemned the moves, saying they will reward and embolden Hamas for its October 7, 2023, terror attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another roughly 250 taken hostage.
    


            Israel's subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinian people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. A growing number of international scholars and bodies say Israel's war constitutes genocide, an accusation that the Israeli government has vehemently denied.
    


            Far-right members of the Israeli government responded to the announcements Sunday by urging Netanyahu to annex the occupied West Bank.
    


            Meanwhile, Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, told CNN that today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”
    


Western recognition won't change the reality on the ground: A Palestinian state has never seemed further away



            Despite the growing momentum to recognize Palestine, there are roadblocks to it becoming a full UN member.
    


            The path to become a full member requires at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council to vote in favor, and none of the five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the US – to veto it. The US would be expected to wield its veto power if the issue came before the Security Council.
    


            Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to recognize a Palestinian state, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation.
    


            And other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Canada and the UK are the first G7 countries to recognize Palestine, but fellow members Japan, Italy and Germany oppose the move.

US president to speak at event in Glendale, Arizona, as number of rightwing commentators including Steve Bannon and Elon Musk attend

Students who debated with Kirk: ‘His goal was to defeat us'

US right claimed free speech was sacred – until the Charlie Kirk killing

Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service.

Trump, alongside other high-profile cabinet members including JD Vance and defense secretary Pete Hegseth, are set to deliver remarks on Kirk.

In the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life's work – “when people stop talking, that's when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.

Kirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.

Kirk applied basic rules of civility to his debate style, asking opponents their name and saying it was nice to meet them. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. But his critics are taking issue with any version of his legacy that does not account for the bigoted nature of his arguments. They are also closely examining his very style of debate.

“I don't think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truth,” said Mason, a 26-year-old graduate student who debated with Kirk on the YouTube show Surrounded last fall. “I think Charlie came to debates to verbally beat his opponents.”

Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service.

Here are some images coming through the newswires from State Farm stadium as Charlie Kirk's memorial service goes under way:

at the State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona

Many people traveled far and wide to pay tribute to Charlie Kirk in Glendale on Sunday. Among them was Eddie Wallin, a 30-year-old from Sweden who crossed the Atlantic to honor the slain organizer.

His journey took him from Sweden to Texas, where he rented a car and said he drove 17 hours straight to make it to Glendale in time for the memorial. He subsisted on bananas and other sugary provisions to keep him alert.

Wallin, wearing a white shirt emblazoned with “Freedom,” said he had first met Kirk in 2019, during a trip to Texas. He recalled that Kirk, smiling, told him he'd never thought he'd meet a Swedish conservative. Six years later, Wallin said he encountered Kirk again during the 2024 presidential election and was surprised when the organizer, by then a hugely prominent figure in Maga politics, remembered him.

“After so many years he remembered me,” Wallin said. “I will remember him for my whole life.”

at the State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona

For much of the morning, attendees in the packed stadium have been listening to Christian worship music.

Many sang along with the lyrics, while some raised their hands and swayed. It's a striking contrast from a Trump rally where the play list often features Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA, the Village People's YMCA and Luciano Pavarotti's“Ave Maria”.

The event, like Turning Points itself, has blended faith and politics for a new generation of conservatives.

Chris Tomlin, a Christian music singer, is singing now along with the audience, which joins him for the refrain: “You will always be holy / holy forever.”

As he left the White House for Phoenix this morning, Donald Trump praised Charlie Kirk's mobilization of college students through Turning Point USA, the organization that he founded instead of going to college himself.

“For a young man, he did a great job, a tremendous job,” Trump said. “He had a hold on youth because they loved him. They respected him. And if you go back 10 years, those colleges were dangerous places for conservatives. And now they're hot. They're very hot. Just like this country is hot.”

As our colleague Alice Speri reported, TPUSA has over 900 chapters on college campuses and claims to have “incubated” more than 350 rightwing influencers over the years.

Kirk himself, however, was broadly unpopular among college students, according to polling after his death. Research done for Puck last week revealed that 70% of students surveyed, at community colleges, technical colleges, trade schools, and public and private four-year institutions, said that they disagreed with Kirk's views. Just 30% said they agreed with what he had to say.

All around the arena are black and white photos of Charlie Kirk, with his wife, Erika, and their children. One shows him tossing a Maga hat into the crowd and several of him speaking.

Emotions were raw in the stadium, as the band played a lengthy instrumental interlude and the camera panned the crowd, which rose to its feet, holding red, black and white signs that said “Turning Points.” One group held a poster with a sketch of Kirk and the biblical verse, “Here I am Lord. Send me.”

Loud applause rang out when the monitor showed an image of Kirk. An announcer called Kirk a “our friend and hero”.

Charlie Kirk's memorial service is set to begin shortly.

Among the notable speakers include Donald Trump, JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

Kirk's wife, Erika, is also due to deliver remarks.

Officials and prominent Maga world influencers are filling the arena.

Congresswoman Lauren Boebert was among those who have arrived. Conservative activist Scott Presler posed for photos and Steve Bannon was spotted being escorted around into the venue. Elon Musk said on X he was in attendance.

Credentialed alongside the traditional press corps are several new media podcast hosts, YouTubers and young influencers, including some children – a testament to his vast influence on young conservatives.

In the days leading up to today's memorial service, AI-generated tributes to Charlie Kirk, which appeared to present his own commentary from beyond the grave, filled the internet and were even played during services at megachurches.

One of the first to appear was a reassuring message in an AI clone of Kirk's voice that was created within hours of Kirk's death and then played last Sunday at Dream City church, the Phoenix megachurch where Kirk worshipped, and held political events, including a Trump rally in 2020.

One of the many AI-generated messages created immediately after Kirk's death was a video shared by a far-right English nationalist that pictured him with an angel's wings, urging his supporters to double down on support for Israel, and vilifying supporters of Palestine, including an AI-generated image of a scowling Greta Thunberg.

🙏🏼This tribute to Charlie Kirk  was forwarded to me by a follower. He's definitely looking down on us all🕊️❤️So keep up the fight, stand up, speak out peacefully and let's Unite The Kingdom tomorrow 🇬🇧🇺🇸🇮🇱 @TRobinsonNewEra pic.twitter.com/y2tcXOJMQm

In the emotionally and politically charged days since the killing of Charlie Kirk, the rightwing youth activist who was a close ally of Donald Trump, one statement has loomed large. On Monday, the US attorney general – the official in charge of the rule of law in America – said that the Trump administration would “absolutely target” those who espouse “hate speech” about Kirk.

Unlike in many other countries, hate speech is protected by US law unless it incites imminent violence or constitutes a true threat. But that did not deter the nation's top law enforcement officer, who also suggested that – for example – a print shop employee who refused to print flyers memorializing Kirk could be “prosecuted”.

Since Kirk was shot to death while speaking to college students in Utah earlier this month, the US has been gripped by a bitter debate about the relation between political speech and violence. Bondi later walked back some of her remarks, in part because of criticism from other conservatives worried about the reframing of “free speech” as “hate speech”. But Trump, JD Vance, White House adviser Stephen Miller and other top Republicans have framed Kirk's death as the consequence of what they claim is unchecked and violent rhetoric, which they blame on the left wing alone.

It is a remarkable turn from prominent American conservatives, who until Trump's return to power in January had long complained of a censorious leftwing “cancel culture” but now seem happy to reframe that, too, as “consequence culture”.

Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she has been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. This morning, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service.

She said she appreciated Kirk's willingness to debate anyone regardless of their politics or background. “He didn't sugarcoat anything,” she said. “He just wanted to be heard and he wanted everybody to be heard.”

Sawick said going forward she hoped more Americans would accept – even if they don't support – the president and his message. “I want people to get behind our president,” she said. “There's nothing wrong with making America great again.”

The FBI has restricted the airspace surrounding State Farm stadium in Glendale, Arizona, ahead of Charlie Kirk's funeral service.

In a post on X, the FBI said:

“All aircraft operators are reminded to check and verify FAA Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) before every flight. Drone operators who enter the restricted areas without permission could face drone confiscation, fines and potential criminal prosecution.

Pursuant to federal law, the FBI and/or other federal partners may take security action that results in the interference, disruption, seizure, damage to or destruction of any drone deemed to pose a credible safety or security threat.”

Jeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, came with a group of friends from Orange county on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Charlie Kirk's life and legacy.

“What you're seeing here is not just a tribute to his movement, you're seeing a revival of his message: faith, family, freedom,” Barke said, gesturing to the swelling crowd of supporters. Though only 31, Kirk left a lasting spiritual and political legacy, Barke said.

“I think every one of us needs to be a bit more uncomfortable than we're used to in spreading Charlie's message,” he said, pledging to use his own platform and social media presence to do so.

Thousands of people lined up early to fill a football stadium in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where the US president, Donald Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and other prominent Maga allies will pay tribute to the slain conservative activist. 

Here are more pictures from the newswires of people arriving inside the venue and a first look at the stage setup:

Marjorie Taylor Greene has also issued a tribute to Charlie Kirk ahead of his memorial service.

Writing on X, the Georgia representative said:

“Today hundreds of thousands of people are gathering at State Farm Stadium in Arizona to remember and honor the life of Charlie Kirk. Simultaneously what is really happening is a revival. Through Charlie, people are meeting Jesus. Welcome to church!”

Charlie Kirk was shot while speaking at the campus of Utah Valley University, near Salt Lake City, as part of the American Comeback tour, which is hosted by the university's Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter and was attended by as many as 3,000 people, according to Jeffrey Long, the police chief at the university.

Kirk had pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for Donald Trump's unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement's ideological agenda.

“Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education.

Thousands of people wearing red, white and blue are pouring into State Farm Stadium in Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix. Lines snaked several blocks earlier this morning before sunrise in the desert, where temperatures were expected to near 100 this afternoon.

Inside, many followers of Kirk, the vast stadium was dotted with red MAGA hats and American flags. Seats began to fill hours before the official program was due to begin. Some supporters were already in tears as they listened to a Christian rock group that was performing on stage.

Over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have saved nearly 94 million lives.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

The date was Feb. 8, 1954 and young David Edmonston had an upset tummy. 

Compared with other global events around that time – the death of Joseph Stalin, the advent of colour TV – the gastrointestinal woes of an 11-year-old in rural Massachusetts hardly seemed consequential.

But to Thomas Peebles, they hinted at a chance to make history. When the young physician-researcher at Boston Children's Hospital learned of David's symptoms– which soon included a telltale rash – he beelined for the boy's boarding school, where a measles outbreak was under way.

How measles made its way back to Canada

Dr. Peebles wanted three things from David: a throat-washing, some blood and a stool sample. But he also extended an invitation. “He asked if I would help the world,” David later recalled. “So I said yes, of course.” 

Today, every Canadian child who gets a measles vaccine is injected with a weakened form of the virus that traces back to the “Edmonston strain” that Dr. Peebles collected that day. More than two millennia after a cattle pathogen spilled over into human populations, the virus that causes measles had finally been isolated from the blood of an American schoolboy. Within a decade, it would be harnessed into a vaccine.

The medical breakthrough heralded the modern era of vaccination. It gave the world a powerful defence against one of the most contagious diseases known to humankind. Over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have saved nearly 94 million lives.

And because the virus only circulates in humans, the arrival of an effective vaccine introduced a tantalizing possibility: eradication.

“Today we are on the threshold of eliminating another dangerous disease – measles,” U.S. health officials announced in 1967.

Six decades later, that threshold has yet to be crossed.

Measles remains very much a part of the human condition. According to latest estimates, more than 100,000 people died of measles in 2023, primarily children in lower-income countries. 

This year has seen an alarming resurgence in countries where measles is considered eliminated, including Canada and the U.S., both of which are struggling to extinguish their largest outbreaks in decades.

There were signs from the start that the path to conquering the disease would be bumpy and meandering. 

Public reception to the measles vaccine in 1963 was relatively muted compared with the jubilation and public weeping that erupted when an effective polio vaccine was announced, pediatrician Adam Ratner says in Booster Shots: the Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health.

Opinion: Mistrust in medicine is infecting our society – and it's putting our children at risk

“From the beginning, the announcement of measles vaccine availability was plagued by contradictions,” he wrote. “Inconsistent messages, unclear availability and limited public understanding of why one might want to vaccinate a child against measles in the first place ... hindered the availability and success of the measles vaccine.”

Experts knew that one barrier to vaccination was the widespread belief that measles was a normal and ultimately harmless part of childhood. In reality, measles annually killed more Canadian children than polio, a disease that struck parents with terror.

(Today, one in every 1,000 children infected will die. Measles can also weaken the immune system, in addition to causing complications such as deafness, blindness or brain swelling.)

The first two licensed vaccines for measles were also less than ideal. 

One, made with a “killed” or inactivated virus, was well tolerated but offered inferior protection (it would be taken off the market by the early seventies).

The better-performing vaccine, made with a weakened version of the live virus, was prone to causing high fevers and even rash. These side effects could be mitigated with a second injection of a preparation made from donated blood plasma. But this was cumbersome and expensive, especially compared with the polio vaccine, which sold at just six or seven cents a shot.

“Sir, when is the measles' vaccine going to be made available to the free immunization clinics?” a reader calling themselves “anxious mother” wrote to The Toronto Star in 1964. “We with large families feel the $10 charged by physicians is a little steep for each child.”

An answer came the following year, when Toronto launched a mass vaccination campaign – the first by a Canadian public health department, according to reports at the time. 

Vaccinating became easier and more tolerable in the seventies, with the introduction of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot. This included an attenuated version of the live measles virus that minimized side effects.

But measles outbreaks continued, and health officials bemoaned Canada's low vaccination rates. “Young families are no longer motivated by the memory of diphtheria and polio epidemics of the pre-immunization era,” lamented a report by the Ontario Council of Health.

Internal documents show how Alberta's measles outbreak began to spiral out of control

In the early eighties, Canadian public health departments envied their counterparts in the U.S., where the incidence rate for measles was six times lower, owing in part to laws that mandated vaccinations for school-aged children.

In 1982, Ontario and New Brunswick passed similar legislation (today, they remain the only Canadian provinces with such laws). In Ontario, the law gave rise to anti-vaccination groups such as the Committee Against Compulsory Vaccination. Within just two years, these organizations had successfully pressured the province into amending legislation to allow for exemptions based on conscientious objection. 

Newspaper headlines from the decade reveal the fragility of every hard-won victory against the wildly infectious foe. “Measles in Canada drops to all-time low,” says a 1983 headline in The Globe and Mail. One year later: “Measles cases in 3 provinces at 5-year high.” 

The mid-nineties introduced the two-dose MMR vaccination schedule. This paved the way for Canada to achieve a historic milestone in 1998: measles elimination, meaning it had been free of continuous transmission for more than 12 months. The virus that once infected up to 90,000 Canadians a year no longer circulated in this country.

But that same year delivered the biggest setback yet to global elimination efforts. The Lancet, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, published a fraudulent paper authored by the now-disgraced British scientist Andrew Wakefield that alleged a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The paper was ultimately retracted 12 years later, and Mr. Wakefield was banned from practising medicine.

The damaging paper had landed at a pivotal moment, however, with the Internet providing a new and powerful substrate for disinformation to spread through. 

“That definitely was the beginning of the modern era of anti-vaccine sentiment,” said René Najera, director of public health for the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and editor of the History of Vaccines project. 

Opinion: Ending vaccine mandates is a cynical political play – and it threatens children's lives

The first two decades of this millennium saw periodic measles flare-ups in Canada ignited by importations of the virus by infected travellers. Then, starting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine vaccinations, eroded public health care infrastructure and gave rise to a powerful wave of mistrust against the medical establishment – ideal conditions for measles to stage a comeback.

In North America, this ancient virus is once again on the move. And it's spreading through a world that bears little resemblance to the one Dr. Peebles asked young David to help.

Vaccines have become deeply politicized. Social media and influencers are spreading false or misleading information faster and farther than ever. The U.S. – once a global leader in public health– has a vaccine skeptic running its health department and dismantling the research ecosystem that once gifted the world its first measles vaccine.

“Measles is one of those diseases like smallpox that can be eradicated. A couple of generations of near 100 per cent vaccination and we would eradicate it, and then we can take it off the vaccine schedule and nobody has to worry about it,” Dr. Najera said. 

“But, you know, that's not where we are.”

Changes to regulatory or information environments will help states decouple from federal health recommendations

Seven US states and the nation's largest city announced this week that they have formed the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, in an effort to strengthen the region's health guidance as the national health landscape fractures. Maryland announced they would join the alliance on Friday.

As national health agencies revisit their recommendations, including high-profile restrictions on the updated Covid shots and the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the pressure is increasingly falling on states to navigate recommendations and new federal rules.

“I definitely see a future where there is considerable state-level variability on vaccine policy, much like we have seen in the abortion space,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and former senior adviser for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

There were already some access issues with vaccines, especially for people who have been marginalized. “But in general, it didn't matter where you lived,” said Jen Kates, senior vice-president at the health non-profit KFF. “Now it does.”

And while Covid shots were the first to be restricted, policies could also change on other shots – as with the MMRV restrictions proposed on Thursday.

“The area where it could really have a dramatic impact, is what might change with the kids' [routine vaccination schedule],” Kates said.

The new alliance – among Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York state and New York City, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island – has been collaborating for months, including a meeting in August to discuss emergency preparedness, vaccine purchasing, lab capacity and more.

The West Coast Health Alliance, a similar organization led by the governors of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii, issued their first winter vaccine recommendation on Wednesday, encouraging residents to stay up to date on vaccines against Covid, flu and RSV.

In the past, the federal government funded much of the public health work done at state, local, territorial and tribal levels, and has worked as a “norm setter” by offering the best available evidence and public health practices, Kates said.

The states would then make decisions on, for instance, which vaccines are required for school attendance and whether they offer non-medical exemptions.

States also regulate pharmacists, deciding whether a pharmacist can vaccinate someone without a prescription or administer vaccinations to kids. And states regulate a subset of health insurers operating within their jurisdictions.

Several states have laws that pharmacists can administer vaccines, and that insurers must cover them, when they're recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Now, amid delays on recommendations and concerns that federal information may not be based on evidence or data, “they are scrambling to change their regulatory or information environments to be decoupled from the federal recommendation to the extent that they can”, Kates said.

“It's a pretty dramatic thing. It's happened very quickly,” Kates said. Several states have already moved to allow pharmacists to administer a Covid vaccine without a prescription and to require insurance coverage of the shots, and some have implemented broader language to potentially apply to other vaccines.

“It is going to create a very different environment, and it's already happening.”

Other states are considering new restrictions to their vaccination policies. Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, promised the state would soon end vaccine mandates for school attendance, though no law has been proposed to amend those mandates.

Idaho has the highest non-medical exemption rate in the country, and the state tried to pass a law earlier this year ending mandates, though that part of the law was ultimately removed.

West Virginia's senate passed a bill in February to expand non-medical exemptions, and Texas passed a bill making it easier to avoid vaccine mandates in May.

Some states, without changing any of their laws, might restrict access simply by “following exactly what FDA and CDC say”, Kates said.

The result is a patchwork of vaccine rules varying by location – the divided states of America.

The fractures will not be felt equally even among states. Low-income people who don't have a strong relationship with doctors or private insurers will face more barriers to getting prescriptions and paying for shots, for example.

Medical organizations have also broken with official recommendations.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), for example, offers its own guidance on respiratory virus vaccination.

AHIP, the health insurance trade association, announced on Tuesday that members' health plans will “continue to cover all ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025”. Not every major insurer is a member of AHIP.

States can help implement the recommendations of these professional organizations and try to clear roadblocks to access, Jetelina said.

By banding together, states can also share the work of examining scientific evidence and offering recommendations, as well as sharing potential bulk orders and making other collaborative actions.

But one state's policies can have repercussions for the entire nation.

“Infectious diseases don't see state lines,” Jetelina said. “What happens in one state will directly impact people living in other states, especially those that cannot protect themselves because they are too young or too sick to get vaccinated.”

The changes to vaccine recommendations are “stressful”, even for people who try to stay informed, and “it contributes to this ecosystem of mistrust”, Kates said.

“And even for people who want to get a vaccine, the more obstacles that are put up – it's going to deter everybody.”

While vaccine policy is shifting, vaccines remain overwhelmingly popular across the US.

The “vast majority of Americans” – between 80% and 90%, depending on the poll – still favor vaccination, though support has “dramatically shifted” along political lines in recent years, Jetelina said.

Even conservative parents in Florida, for example, support vaccines, according to a new KFF survey.

“They support mandates for going to school. They want their kids to be vaccinated,” Kates said.

Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin has been dismissed from military service, Russian pro-government media outlet RBC reported on Sept. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

The general has long been associated with battlefield setbacks since 2022.

Lapin commanded Russia's Central Military District during Ukraine's September 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive, where Russian defenses collapsed and multiple cities were retaken. 

This earned him public criticism from Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov as "a good-for-nothing" general.

In 2024, Lapin oversaw Russia's defenses in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched an unprecedented cross-border incursion in 2024, seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) in the first months. 

The Wall Street Journal later reported that gaps in Russian defenses under Lapin let Ukraine advance.

Nine months later, Moscow launched a counteroffensive supported by 12,000 North Korean troops, eventually retaking most of the territory but at a cost of 80,000 soldiers killed or wounded.

Lapin, born in Kazan in 1964, rose through Russia's military ranks after graduating from the Kazan Higher Tank Command School. 

In 2017, he served as chief of staff of Russian forces in Syria and later commanded the Central Military District and multiple Russian formations in Ukraine.

Russian pro-government media outlet Tatar-inform reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, that Lapin will now serve as an assistant to Tatarstan's head, Rustam Minnikhanov.

In 2022, Ukraine's prosecutor general named Lapin a suspect in waging an aggressive war against Ukraine and violating the country's territorial integrity and inviolability.

U.S. President Donald Trump again urged European countries to stop importing oil from Russia, during a dinner in Mount Vernon, Virginia, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 21.

The aircraft, an Il-20M, departed from Russia and entered international airspace without establishing communication, making visual identification the only way to confirm its presence.

The analysis shows that 42% of these deaths occurred within the first year after President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's month-long "partial mobilization" in September 2022.

The rare strike marks only the third visually confirmed destruction of such a vehicle since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.

 This week on Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers the ongoing response to the Sept. 9 violation of Polish airspace by Russian drones — the first instance of NATO engaging Russia militarily on its own soil since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin has long been associated with battlefield setbacks since 2022.

"The Russian invaders' air fleet in the temporarily occupied Crimea has been reduced again as a result of successful combat operations," Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said.

Although the platform had been known for about a year, it was only now publicly displayed. 

"We saw on Friday that NATO is functioning very efficiently... even to the point that if we were truly forced to use the last resort, which is the use of force, then there was a readiness for that as well," Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 54 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, of which air defenses intercepted 33.

The number includes 1,010 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Polish authorities on Sept. 20 discovered what may be the remnants of the last of 19 drones downed over Polish territory following a Russian violation of Warsaw's airspace over a week prior.

"Agents of our movement blew up the railway tracks in Smolensk, leading to an aerospace factory. This plant produces Kh-59 missiles for the Russian Ministry of Defense," the Atesh group claimed.

"Given Russia's brutality against the Ukrainian people, it was only right that Russian government funds in the United States be seized and repurposed to help Ukraine rebuild its country under the REPO Act," Republican Senator Jim Risch said.

"Security guarantees, in essence, are a deterrent. That deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible, it has to be strong," Finnish President Alexander Stubb said.

Prosecutors have revealed text messages that they say prove Tyler Robinson admitted to killing Charlie Kirk.

Mr Robinson, 22, has been charged with murdering Kirk, the conservative activist, shot dead at a Utah university last week.

The suspect wore an anti-suicide vest, designed to prevent prisoners from turning it into a noose, as he appeared before a judge via video link for the first time on Tuesday.

Prosecutors laid out formal charges against Mr Robinson and last week revealed messages to his transgender roommate, with whom Robinson was in a relationship, which they said amounted to a confession.

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.”

Before Kirk's funeral on Sunday, which will be addressed by Maga grandees including Donald Trump and JD Vance, his vice-president, here are the messages in full.

Mr Robinson allegedly confessed to the assassination by hiding a note for his boyfriend.

He placed the message under a keyboard at their shared home, saying he planned to “take out Charlie Kirk”, according to a text exchange.

He wrote: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard,” the messages revealed by officials said.

The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.”

After reading the note, Mr Robinson's boyfriend asked if he was joking:

In a text to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he could reach the spot in a wooded area near Utah Valley University where he allegedly hid the weapon, but he was worried about being seen by a “squad car parked right by it”.

He added that he was worried about what his father would do if he did not return his grandfather's rifle.

Later the suspect told his roommate that his father was a staunch supporter of Mr Trump.

“Since Trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard Maga,” the suspected killer wrote.

Mr Robinson had become “more political”, leaning Left and growing “more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented”, said Jeff Gray, the Utah County Attorney.

Both of Mr Robinson's parents are registered Republicans, according to records seen by The Telegraph.

The gunman left behind bullets engraved with anti-fascist messages, including: “Hey fascist! Catch!”

In a later message to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he would turn himself in and asked his roommate not to talk to the media.

Golden light spills over endless rows of vines, and the hum of harvest fills the valleys of California. For weeks every fall, the land turns into a symphony of baskets, presses, and fermenting grapes – the heartbeat of an industry that now makes the United States the world's fourth-largest wine producer and its biggest consumer. Ninety percent of that comes from California alone, a state that has become synonymous with fine wine.

This success story began not with the land, but with a man. Behind Napa's rise stood an unlikely figure: a Russian émigré who fled revolution, crossed Europe, and brought Old World science to the New. His name was Andre Tchelistcheff – the godfather of American winemaking.

When Andre Tchelistcheff arrived in California in the late 1930s, he found a land with perfect soil and sunshine but a winemaking industry in ruins. Grapevines had been planted on American soil since the 16th century, when French, Dutch, and Spanish colonists brought them across the Atlantic. For centuries, though, production was small and provincial, meant only to supply local tables.

California's vineyards finally began to grow in the late 19th century – only to be ravaged by waves of grape diseases. Then came Prohibition. Between 1920 and 1933, the industry collapsed almost entirely. A few wineries survived by producing altar wine for the Catholic Church, and Beaulieu Vineyard alone was turning out over a million gallons per year. But these were rare exceptions.

By the time Prohibition was repealed, American wine was a shadow of its former self. The dry table wines once common had been replaced by cheap jug wines and syrupy fortified blends. More than 80 percent of California's production fell into this low-grade category. One critic of the era put it bluntly:

“It's better to drink beer than California wine.”

This was the state of Napa Valley on the eve of Tchelistcheff's arrival.

Andre Tchelistcheff was born in Moscow in 1901, into a noble family whose lineage stretched back to the fifteenth century. His youth was shattered by the October Revolution and the Civil War. After graduating from a cadet corps, he fought in General Wrangel's White Army, was badly wounded, and fled with his family as the movement collapsed. Like many Russian émigrés, they began a long journey through Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia before finally settling in Europe.

In Prague, Tchelistcheff studied agronomy and trained at the legendary Tokaji vineyards in neighboring Hungary. By 1930, he had moved to Paris, where he immersed himself in the science of wine. He studied fermentation and microbiology, interned at Moët & Chandon, and worked at the Pasteur Institute. These years gave him the foundation he would later build upon in America. As he liked to say, “When I think about wine, I switch from English to French.”

By the late 1930s, his reputation was growing. Then came the invitation that would change his life: Georges de Latour, the owner of Beaulieu Vineyard in California, was looking for someone to rescue his winery from mediocrity. Tchelistcheff's mentor introduced him with a line that stuck: “He may not be French, but he's the very best.”

California in the 1930s had everything nature could offer a winemaker – sun-drenched valleys, fertile soils, and a Mediterranean climate. What it lacked was craft. When Tchelistcheff first set foot in Napa, he was stunned by what he found. Cellars were stiflingly hot, presses were cooled by dumping in blocks of ice, and equipment stood rusting in the corners. Hygiene was almost nonexistent: workers didn't wash their hands, larvae bred in barrels, and dead rats were even left floating in fermentation tanks.

For a man trained in the rigor of the Pasteur Institute, it was a shock. Yet the contrast went beyond winemaking. Tchelistcheff was every inch a European aristocrat – always immaculately dressed, precise in his manners, addressing men as “my dear sir” and women as “madam.” In remote Napa, this refinement made him an object of ridicule. His young son was even beaten up at school for wearing a French-style uniform.

It was into this unlikely environment – a land of promise wrapped in provincial roughness – that Andre Tchelistcheff began his American experiment.

Tchelistcheff's first act in California was simple but radical: he demanded order. The barrels were scrubbed clean, the cellars cooled, and the old rusty equipment replaced with stainless steel tanks and enamel-lined pipes. It was the first time such technology had been used in Napa Valley, and the effect was immediate: the wines no longer carried the metallic tang of rust.

He introduced cold fermentation for white wines and malolactic fermentation for reds – practices that would later become standard worldwide. He drastically reduced the use of sulfur dioxide, which had been added to Californian wines in reckless quantities. Local workers could hardly believe it; one foreman even suggested dumping in a whole bucket of the chemical “just in case.”

At the same time, he turned to the vineyards. California was then dominated by high-yield grapes good for bulk wine but useless for quality. Tchelistcheff pushed for Cabernet Sauvignon, convinced that Napa's soil and climate could rival the Old World's best. After overcoming resistance from the vineyard's owners, he finally got his way.

The result was the Georges de Latour Private Reserve. By the 1940s, it had become a symbol of American fine wine, poured at White House receptions and recognized as California's first truly world-class vintage.

No single winemaker, however brilliant, could transform an entire industry alone. Tchelistcheff's true legacy came through his students.

After Georges de Latour's death, Beaulieu Vineyard passed into the hands of corporate owners more interested in profits than in quality. Frustrated by marketing gimmicks and budget cuts, Tchelistcheff left the winery in 1973 after more than twenty-five years. It turned out to be a turning point. As an independent consultant, he became a mentor to a new generation of California winemakers.

Unlike many in his field, Tchelistcheff never hoarded his knowledge. He was exacting in standards, generous in teaching, and utterly devoted to the craft.

But his vision reached beyond Napa. Studying the soils of the Pacific Northwest, he saw that Cabernet Sauvignon could thrive in Washington, while Pinot Gris would do well in Oregon. With his guidance, his nephew Alexander Golitsyn – another Russian aristocrat in exile – founded Quilceda Creek Winery, later hailed as one of America's finest producers of Cabernet. Tchelistcheff also advised Chateau Ste. Michelle, steering it toward Gewürztraminer, Semillon, and Riesling, which put Washington State on the wine map.

By the late 1970s, his influence spanned the entire American West. Tchelistcheff earned the title of “America's most influential winemaker since the Prohibition,” or simply “The Maestro” – the man who gave the United States not just great wines, but a wine culture.

For centuries, French winemakers dismissed the New World as incapable of true greatness. But in 1976, that certainty was shattered. British wine merchant Steven Spurrier organized a blind tasting in Paris, pitting French classics against upstart California wines.

To the astonishment of the judges – and humiliation of Bordeaux and Burgundy – the winners were from Napa Valley: a Cabernet from Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and a Chardonnay from Chateau Montelena. Both had been made by Tchelistcheff's students. For the first time in history, American wines outscored the French in their own capital.

News of the upset reached Tchelistcheff while he was touring Bordeaux. Ever the diplomat, he told his assistant not to mention it to their hosts: “If we tell them right now, the French might take offense – and after all, we're their guests.”

The so-called “Judgment of Paris” became a turning point in global wine history. It was proof that the New World could rival, and even surpass, the Old – and Tchelistcheff's fingerprints were all over the victory.

Even in his later years, Tchelistcheff remained restless. In the early 1980s he returned to Europe, not as a refugee but as a master, sought out by winemakers across the continent. One of them was Lodovico Antinori, scion of a dynasty that had been making wine in Tuscany since the fourteenth century.

Antinori wanted to plant Cabernet Sauvignon in the coastal soils of Bolgheri. After studying the land, Tchelistcheff disagreed. Merlot, he argued, would thrive there. Their debate became almost comic: Antinori crossed out “Merlot” on the vineyard map and scribbled “Cabernet,” while Tchelistcheff crossed it back again. In the end, the Russian émigré prevailed.

The result was Masseto, a bold Merlot that stunned the wine world. Today it is considered one of Italy's most prized and expensive wines – a legacy born not in Florence or Bordeaux, but from the instincts of an old exile from Moscow.

Despite his fame, wealth, and influence, Tchelistcheff never owned a vineyard of his own. Friends urged him to, but he always refused. “I am a child of revolution,” he explained.

“I know what it means to lose everything overnight. I don't have a cellar, I don't have a vineyard, I have nothing. All I have is my mind.”

Then, with a smile, he would add: “Well, maybe also a dozen bottles under my bed.”

Andre Tchelistcheff died in Napa Valley in 1994, at the age of ninety-two – the place where he had arrived as an outsider and which he helped turn into one of the world's great wine regions. To generations of winemakers, he remained simply The Maestro: the Russian émigré who gave America a wine culture and, in doing so, proved that the New World could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Old.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in occupied Crimea, the agency reported on Sept. 21. 

"The Russian invaders' air fleet in the temporarily occupied Crimea has been reduced again as a result of successful combat operations," HUR wrote on Telegram. 

The Mi-8 is a medium-lift helicopter widely used by Russia for transport, reconnaissance, and combat support. It can carry troops and equipment or be outfitted as a gunship.

The radar destroyed was identified as the 55Zh6U Nebo-U, a mobile early-warning system capable of detecting stealth aircraft and cruise missiles at long ranges. 

Such radars provide critical targeting data for surface-to-air missile systems.

The agency did not disclose the exact location of the strike.

Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, has remained one of the key targets for Ukrainian operations against Russian military infrastructure since the start of the full-scale invasion.

On Sept. 9, HUR reported targeting two radar stations, and on Sept. 1, it said it destroyed two Mi-8 helicopters and struck a Russian tugboat.

U.S. President Donald Trump again urged European countries to stop importing oil from Russia, during a dinner in Mount Vernon, Virginia, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 21.

The aircraft, an Il-20M, departed from Russia and entered international airspace without establishing communication, making visual identification the only way to confirm its presence.

The analysis shows that 42% of these deaths occurred within the first year after President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's month-long "partial mobilization" in September 2022.

The rare strike marks only the third visually confirmed destruction of such a vehicle since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.

 This week on Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers the ongoing response to the Sept. 9 violation of Polish airspace by Russian drones — the first instance of NATO engaging Russia militarily on its own soil since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin has long been associated with battlefield setbacks since 2022.

"The Russian invaders' air fleet in the temporarily occupied Crimea has been reduced again as a result of successful combat operations," Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said.

Although the platform had been known for about a year, it was only now publicly displayed. 

"We saw on Friday that NATO is functioning very efficiently... even to the point that if we were truly forced to use the last resort, which is the use of force, then there was a readiness for that as well," Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 54 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, of which air defenses intercepted 33.

The number includes 1,010 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Polish authorities on Sept. 20 discovered what may be the remnants of the last of 19 drones downed over Polish territory following a Russian violation of Warsaw's airspace over a week prior.

"Agents of our movement blew up the railway tracks in Smolensk, leading to an aerospace factory. This plant produces Kh-59 missiles for the Russian Ministry of Defense," the Atesh group claimed.

"Given Russia's brutality against the Ukrainian people, it was only right that Russian government funds in the United States be seized and repurposed to help Ukraine rebuild its country under the REPO Act," Republican Senator Jim Risch said.

"Security guarantees, in essence, are a deterrent. That deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible, it has to be strong," Finnish President Alexander Stubb said.

Ukraine unveiled its TOLOKA underwater drone at the Defense Tech Valley 2025 exhibition in Lviv, Ukrainian military news site Militarnyi reported on Sept. 19. 

Although the platform has been known for about a year, it has only now been publicly displayed. The system features three variants capable of striking targets up to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away.

The compact TLK-150 is designed for stealth operations just below the surface, using electric propulsion to evade detection and penetrate Russian defenses, according to Defense Express.

Larger models include the TLK-400, with a range of 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) and a 500-kilogram payload, and the TLK-1000, which measures up to 12 meters, carries 5,000 kilograms, and can reach targets up to 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

Ukraine's General Staff showcased the drone on social media on Sept. 19.

"Ukraine's Armed Forces will soon receive a number of new systems, including drones, unmanned boats, ground robotic complexes, and electronic warfare equipment," the military said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky first introduced the TOLOKA drone at the Support Ukraine summit in February, highlighting its ability to strike ships, ports, and Russian strategic targets.

The unveiling comes amid Kyiv's focus on precision strikes against Russian infrastructure.

In June, the Security Service of Ukraine carried out its third attack on the Crimean Bridge, a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

While the exact cause of damage to the bridge's underwater supports remains unclear, some defense experts speculate that the TOLOKA drone may have played a role.

Since 2022, Ukraine has steadily expanded its naval drone fleet, integrating unmanned maritime systems into combat operations. 

Kyiv has repeatedly used maritime drones to inflict heavy losses on Russian assets in the Black Sea.

If he was nervous, 11-year-old Brilyn Hollyhand did not show it, confidently welcoming Charlie Kirk to an interview on his YouTube channel with a subscriber count of just seven.

“You're much further ahead of the curve than I was,” Kirk joked in seeming disbelief at the maturity of his young interviewer back in 2017. “So you're way ahead of the game”.

Now aged 19, Mr Hollyhand is being touted as Kirk's heir apparent after the 31-year-old Maga podcaster was shot and killed by a single bullet during an appearance at Utah Valley University last week.

Mr Hollyhand has travelled the length of the country speaking at universities across the US in a Kirk-like fashion, promoting conservative values on campus and rallying the youth to vote.

Since his first interview with his mentor seven years ago, the college student has become one of the most followed young conservative influencers of his generation, amassing around half-a-million followers across his social media platforms.

“There's a lot of people that you interview that you never speak to again, but Charlie and I stayed friends, he's been my mentor. I talked to him up until the morning of his passing,” Mr Hollyhand told The Telegraph.

“He was that person who cheered me on and I could go to for advice, and we were just there for each other.”

In the hours after Kirk's murder, grass-roots Republicans began to ask who, if anyone, could replace the void left in the conservative media bubble.

The right person will need to echo Kirk's slick communication skills and understanding of Generation Z, something Mr Hollyhand grasped from a young age.

In fifth grade, he founded The Truth Gazette, a conservative political website, and began hosting a podcast a year later.

In January 2023, alongside CJ Pearson, another rising conservative activist, he was appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee's newly created Youth Advisory Council.

One year later, at the age of just 18, he published his first book drawn from his interviews with conservative political figures such as Kirk.

“Everybody's talking about, who's the next Charlie Kirk? Who can replace Charlie Kirk? There is no replacement for Charlie Kirk, there's nobody that can fill his shoes,” Mr Hollyhand added, fresh off a talk in South Carolina.

“I got reminded in that moment of one of the last times I was on a campus with Charlie. He did a Q&A and somebody said, ‘Charlie, who is going to take the baton, who is next?'

“Charlie looked into the audience and said, ‘You're the next Charlie Kirk, and you are, and you.'

“I did the same thing to the students in South Carolina, and I said, every single one of you is Charlie Kirk.”

Mr Hollyhand said he has faced a wave of death threats since Kirk's assassination. They have become so serious that he is escorted to classes at Auburn University, Alabama, where he now attends college, by a security detail.

“We have to be louder for Charlie and no, that doesn't mean not being safe. I'll be travelling with a security detail, unfortunately,” he said.

“There's a detail that has to walk with me to my classes every day because of the death threats that I've gotten just in the last week. That's the world that we woke up in on Wednesday.”

Like Kirk, Mr Hollyhand remains steadfast in his belief that civil discourse is the answer to the toxicity in US politics.

“We can't let America die just because civil discourse is done. We have to bring back civil discourse and the perfect place to do that is on campuses.

“That's why my tour is called one conversation at a time. I think the problem, and the reason that I'm getting threats and the reason Charlie was assassinated, is because people don't know how to talk to each other.”

Long gone is the squeaky-voiced fourth grader with glasses too big for his face interviewing his political hero.

Even at his tender age, Mr Hollyhand is now a seasoned speaker and pundit who will help carry the baton left behind by Kirk, no longer asking questions about Kirk's legacy but helping to define it.

President Trump recently struck an unprecedented deal with Nvidia that lets the company sell its H20 GPUs in China, so long as the government gets a 15% cut of the revenue.

The Chinese government recently instructed companies not to buy Nvidia chips, citing concerns about national security and alleged violations of its antimonopoly laws.

Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar initially estimated that Nvidia could see $56 billion in revenue from China next year after President Trump lifted H20 export restrictions.

Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably the most important company in the world because its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Indeed, Forrester Research analysts recently commented, "Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible."

However, President Donald Trump has dragged Nvidia into his trade war with China, and political crossfire has been a constant problem for the company. Both countries have used national security as justification to restrict the sale or purchase of the company's products, and investors recently got some more bad news on that front.

Nvidia took a $4.5 billion write-down in the first quarter, when President Trump extended export restrictions to include H20 graphics processing units (GPUs). Those semiconductors, scaled-back versions of the H100 GPU and H200 GPU, had been designed specifically for Chinese companies in compliance with Biden-era export controls. So, Nvidia was left with inventory it could not sell when Trump changed the terms.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly insisted that export bans would not slow progress in China, the second-largest artificial intelligence (AI) market in the world, but would instead stifle U.S. technology leadership. Nvidia commented on social media, "For the U.S. to win the AI race, America's full-stack platform must remain the global standard."

Interestingly, while the president cited national security as grounds for export controls, he made a deal with Huang in July that allows Nvidia to sell H20 GPUs in China, provided the government gets 15% of sales. The unprecedented arrangement raised questions about whether the national security risks were a gambit for Trump to exert influence over the private sector or whether he is prioritizing business interests over national security.

Regardless, Trump's decision to lift the export restrictions was a win for Nvidia. Huang says the AI market in China is currently a $50 billion opportunity and is growing at a rate of 50% annually. That means the company could earn hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by the end of the decade if it can supply Chinese customers with AI infrastructure.

Shortly after Trump negotiated a revenue-sharing arrangement with Nvidia, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made comments that upset Chinese authorities. "We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best stuff. I think fourth best is where we have come out," he told CNBC. "So, you want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack."

While nothing about Lutnick's statement is particularly surprising -- it is widely known that the H20 GPU is a scaled-down version of more powerful accelerators like the H100 and H200 -- his choice of words and callous delivery rankled leaders in Beijing. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese government told companies to stop buying H20 GPUs due to national security concerns. Nvidia has since halted production of the chip, according to The Information.

More recently, the Chinese government accused Nvidia of violating its antimonopoly laws when it acquired networking specialist Mellanox in 2020. In turn, Beijing's top cybersecurity regulator urged Chinese companies not to buy RTX Pro 6000D chips, which are designed to support industrial AI workloads. Instead, China is pushing its companies to rely on homegrown hardware from companies like Huawei.

Indeed, while Alibaba Group, Tencent, and TikTok-parent ByteDance have historically been major buyers of Nvidia hardware, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that those companies are now leaning more heavily on domestic chips. That is undoubtedly bad news for Nvidia and its shareholders because it means China is unlikely to be a material source of revenue anytime soon.

For context, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar estimated that Nvidia would earn $56 billion in revenue from China next year. But that outcome now seems very unlikely given the political tension between the U.S. and China. Indeed, the way the winds are blowing, some analysts question whether Nvidia will see any revenue from China next year.

LONDON, September 21. /TASS/. Nearly 90% of British citizens do not support London's upcoming recognition of Palestinian statehood, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing a JL Partners survey.

The poll, conducted between August 19 and 31 among 2,118 respondents, found that 87% opposed the unconditional recognition of a Palestinian state, while only 13% expressed their backing.

Support for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision was lowest among opposition parties, with just 6% of Conservative voters and 8% of Reform UK voters in favor. Among Labour supporters, only 11% backed the move.

The survey also showed that 51% of respondents oppose recognition while Hamas remains in power, and 40% said recognition should come only after Hamas agrees to a ceasefire and releases Israeli hostages. Seventeen percent rejected recognition under any circumstances.

According to the BBC and Sky News, Starmer will announce the decision on September 21. Critics argue that the move would undermine London's ability to influence both Israel and Hamas.

On July 29, the prime minister's office warned it would recognize Palestine before the start of the UN General Assembly session in September if Israel continued to block humanitarian aid to Gaza and did not end its military operation in the enclave. Amid the escalating conflict, the Foreign Office later confirmed that recognition would proceed in September. The high-level week of the UN General Assembly will run from September 23 to 27, as well as on September 29.

ENERGODAR /Zaporozhye region/, September 21. /TASS/. The plan for the potential transition of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) into power generation mode is being successfully implemented, including addressing the most critical issues - ensuring sufficient water for reactor cooling and securing external energy supply, ZNPP Director Yuri Chernichuk told TASS.

"Work is proceeding across all elements of the plan. In areas such as staffing and licensing, progress is more visible. As for other aspects, they are not yet as obvious, but work is underway in every direction. This includes the most frequently discussed issues, including ensuring the plant's power supply, maintaining the transmission lines required for generation, hydrotechnical facilities, and keeping water levels adequate for the plant's operation. Work is being carried out across all these areas," Chernichuk said.

On February 18, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev told TASS that, under his directive, a major program was being prepared for bringing ZNPP back online. He later noted that the state corporation had already drawn up a comprehensive plan for the phased commissioning of the plant, which is currently under review by the Russian government. At the same time, Likhachev emphasized that the program could only be carried out once military threats from Ukrainian forces are removed.

TEHRAN, September 21. /TASS/. Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be suspended due to actions by the "E3" (the United Kingdom, Germany, and France) aimed at restoring UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) of the Islamic Republic announced.

"Despite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' cooperation with the Agency and the submission of plans to resolve the crisis, cooperation with the Agency will be suspended in connection with the actions of the European countries," Tasnim news agency cited the statement.

It was noted that even amid the suspension of cooperation, Iran's Foreign Ministry is recommended to continue consultations with the IAEA within the framework of SNSC decisions to protect national interests.

On August 28, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France initiated the snapback mechanism to restore UN Security Council sanctions on Iran. On Friday, the Security Council rejected a resolution calling for the non-restoration of the sanctions regime against Iran. In the vote, Russia, China, Algeria, and Pakistan supported the resolution. Nine members, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, voted against it, while two members abstained.

            • Australia, Canada and the UK announced their recognition of Palestinian statehood, in an apparently coordinated move that piles pressure on Israel and puts the three countries at odds with the US.
    


            • Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”



            • France plans to recognize a Palestinian state at next week's UN General Assembly as international alarm builds over the ongoing war and starvation crisis in Gaza.
    


            • Elsewhere today on the ground, dozens of people were reported killed as the Israeli military presses on with operations in the Gaza City area.
    


            Canada, Australia and the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


            The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution.
    


            The move puts them at odds with the US and deepens Israel's international isolation.
    


            We're ending our live coverage for now, but you can scroll down to look back at developments as they happened, and see here for a full round-up of today's events.
    


            A senior Hamas official has told CNN today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine is a “welcomed step.”
    


                    “Any step to strengthen the legitimate Palestinian rights, foremost among them the fully sovereign Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem and the right to self-determination, is a welcomed step,” Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, told CNN on Sunday.
                





            However, Naim added that this recognition must be “accompanied by practical measures on the ground to affirm these rights and thwart the Zionist plans that explicitly reject any Palestinian political entity.”
    


            “It must be emphasized that the highest priority now is to stop the genocide and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip and to end the humanitarian blockade on the territory,” he said.
    


For context: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine, vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


                    “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.
                





            The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years.
    


            “We did so with determination, and with diplomatic wisdom. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank.
    


            “The response to the latest attempt to force a terror state upon us in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States. Wait for it,” Netanyahu added.
    


            We're hearing now from Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar, who has condemned today's move by Australia, Canada and the UK to recognise a Palestinian state as “infuriating and immoral.”
    


            “On the one hand — it is a reward to Hamas following the October 7th massacre. It cannot be perceived as anything other than encouragement of terrorism,” Saar said in a video statement.
    


                    “On the other hand — it is a reward to the Palestinian Authority, which, as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently explained, is still engaged in ‘Pay for Slay' policies, paying terrorists — and by doing so, is also clearly encouraging terrorism and violating its obligations under the agreements with us,” he added.
                





            The foreign minister said the strong, widespread opposition in Israel towards the establishment of a Palestinian state would act as a guarantee against it.
    


            “The future of the Land of Israel will not be decided in London or Paris — it will be decided here, in Jerusalem,” Saar added.
    


            The UK, in step with Canada and Australia, has today recognized a Palestinian state, deepening Israel's isolation on the world stage amid calls to end the war in Gaza.
    


            Israeli politicians have condemned the decision.
    


If you're just joining us, take a look below at a recap on today's events so far:



            While we've been focusing on western nations recognizing a Palestinian state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said there was “some progress” in talks with Syria, raising the possibility of peace.
    


            At a cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu said: “Our victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah have opened a window to a possibility that was not even imagined before our recent operations: the possibility of peace with our northern neighbors.”
    


            “We are holding talks with the Syrians — there is some progress, but it is still premature,” Netanyahu said.
    


            Israeli and Syrian delegations met in Paris in August – the first time that the new Syrian government acknowledged direct talks with Israel.
    


            Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa has spoken of the possibility of a deconfliction agreement with Israel along the lines of a 1974 agreement that separated Syrian and Israeli forces after the war the previous year.
    


            Al-Sharaa left for New York Sunday to take part in the UN General Assembly.
    


                    Netanyahu is yet to comment on the move by Australia, Canada and the UK, but at the same meeting said “we will need to fight at the UN and in other arenas against the false propaganda directed at us, and against the calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger our existence and serve as an absurd reward for terrorism.”
                





            In his statement announcing Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada had expected the outcome would have been achieved through a “negotiated settlement.”
    


            Carney conceded the possibility “has been steadily and gravely eroded,” by the “pervasive threat of Hamas terrorism,” Israel's accelerated settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the Israeli government's “contribution to the humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”
    


            The Canadian leader cited Hamas' “longstanding rejection of Israel's right to exist and a two-state solution” as a key factor behind the move.
    


                    “Hamas has terrorized the people of Israel and oppressed the people of Gaza, wreaking horrific suffering. It is imperative that Hamas release all hostages, fully disarm, and play no role in the future governance of Palestine. Hamas has stolen from the Palestinian people, cheated them of their life and liberty, and can in no way dictate their future,” Carney said.
                





            The prime minister also criticized the current Israeli government for “working methodically” to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, through its “unrelenting policy of settlement expansion in the West Bank” and its contribution to the “humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”
    


                    “Its sustained assault in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of civilians, displaced well over one million people, and caused a devastating and preventable famine in violation of international law. It is now the avowed policy of the current Israeli government that ‘there will be no Palestinian state',” Carney said of the Israeli government.
                





            Reaction now from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has welcomed the UK's announcement that it is recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            Abbas said the recognition was “an important and necessary step towards achieving a just and lasting peace” and would pave the way for the implementation of a two-state solution, allowing Palestine to live side by side with Israel in “security, peace, and good neighborliness.”
    


            Abbas said the immediate priority was a ceasefire in Gaza, “the entry of aid, the release of all hostages and prisoners, [and] a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.”
    


            More now from Australia following its recognition of Palestine. The decision marks a “longstanding commitment to a two-state solution,” the statement from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said.
    


            “Today's act of recognition reflects Australia's longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples,” the statement said.
    


            The statement also laid out key requirements from the international community for the Palestinian Authority:
    


            Israeli politicians have condemned the decision by the UK, Australia and Canada to recognize a Palestinian state, a move that deepens Israel's isolation on the international stage.
    


            The Knesset speaker Amir Ohana dismissed Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a “modern-day appeaser who chose dishonour.”
    


            Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's far-right Minister of National Security, said the recognition was a reward for murderers and “requires immediate countermeasures: the immediate application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria and the total dismantling of the ‘Palestinian' Authority.”
    


            Judea and Samaria is the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank.
    


            Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded by saying that the time when Britain and other countries determined Israel's future was over.
    


                    “The only response to this anti-Israeli move is applying sovereignty over the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people in Judea and Samaria, and removing the foolish idea of a Palestinian state from the agenda once and for all.”
                





            Yair Golan, an Israeli politician who leads the left-wing Democrats party, said the “unilateral recognition” of a Palestinian state is “a severe diplomatic failure by Netanyahu and Smotrich — a destructive move for Israel's security.”
    


            The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which has represented the families of those taken hostage on October 7, said that it “condemns various nations' unconditional recognition of a Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to the fact that 48 hostages remain in Hamas captivity following the October 7th massacre.”
    


            There's been no statement yet from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that the United Kingdom was formally recognizing a Palestinian state and reviving hope for a two-state solution, in step with Australia and Canada.
    


                    “In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address.
                





            “That means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state. At the moment, we have neither.”
    


            The British Prime Minister acknowledged that hope for a two-state solution was fading, but insisted: “We must not let that light go out.”
    


            Starmer said that recognition was not a reward for Hamas, as Israel has claimed. The UK's call for a two-state solution means that Hamas can have no future, he said.
    


            Starmer also said the immense destruction in Gaza was “utterly intolerable” and must end. Israel must stop its cruel tactics and allow aid to surge into Gaza, he said.
    


            The UK will also take further action to sanction senior figures in the Hamas leadership in the coming weeks, Starmer said.
    


            UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Sunday's decision was “an important step to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution, at a time when it is now under unprecedented threat.”
    


                    “Recognition is only one part of what must be a stronger and wider push for peace,” Cooper added.
                


                    Yvette Cooper, UK Foreign Secretary
                


            A statement from the British government said the decision “does not remove the demands the government has made of the Palestinian Authority to conduct extensive reform. President Abbas has committed to this reform, including organising new elections within a year of a ceasefire.”
    


            Australia has just followed Canada's lead in officially recognizing the “independent and sovereign” State of Palestine.
    


            “In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Affairs minister Penny Wong said in a joint statement.
    


            Australia's recognition of Palestine is part of a “co-ordinated international effort to build new momentum for a two-state solution, starting with a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the hostages taken in the atrocities of October 7, 2023,” the statement added.
    


            Canada has announced that it recognizes the State of Palestine, in a move expected to be mirrored by the United Kingdom later today, and France and  others at the UN General Assembly this week.
    


            “Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a post on X.
    


            Carney had said in July that his country intended to recognize the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly. At the time the plan drew condemnation from Israeli officials, who painted the decision as a “reward to Hamas.”
    


            “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before Sunday's announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.”
    


            Ahead of Carney's statement, senior Canadian officials pushed back on Israel's negative reaction to the decision, telling CNN that recognizing Palestine is “not being done to confront or punish Israel.”
    


            “Our sincere communication efforts are to explain this and do everything in our power to prevent the voices that are trying to make this a confrontational gesture from gaining the day,” one senior Canadian official said.
    


            Canadian officials added that they believe recognition keeps a two-state solution in play despite Israel's open opposition to the prospect of a Palestinian state.
    


            Carney's announcement in July also provoked criticism from US President Donald Trump, who promptly suggested that the move would hurt Canada in any trade talks with the United States.
    


            As British Prime Minister Keir Starmer looks set to recognize a Palestinian state later today, Brits in London appeared split over the move.
    


            Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.”
    


                    “I'm very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today.
                





            Michael Angus, a 55-year-old charity director, disagreed. “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said.
    


            As we've reported, US President Donald Trump “disagrees” with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over recognition of Palestinian statehood.
    


            When Trump delivers the first address of his second term to the annual gathering of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, he will also be at odds with more than half of the member nations, including key allies, over the war in Gaza.
    


            The Trump administration has become increasingly isolated on the issue as the conflict nears its two-year mark. As a growing number of countries have denounced Israel's actions in the enclave, the US has not only stood by its ally but provided it with consistent political cover and military support.
    


            One of the clearest examples of the US' isolation will come tomorrow, when France and Saudi Arabia co-host a two-state solution conference, supported by 142 of the 193 UN Member States.
    


            The US is not participating in the conference and was one of only 10 countries who voted against the General Assembly resolution backing the high-level gathering.
    


            President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce that France is recognizing a Palestinian state during the conference, saying in recent days that the move would isolate Hamas. It is a largely symbolic move that some nations have taken in recent months or plan to take in the weeks ahead, and one that Trump administration officials have condemned as counterproductive to peace efforts.
    


            The UK is set to announce its recognition of a Palestinian state this weekend, and Canada, Australia and Belgium expect to join France in making the same announcement during the UN gathering.
    


            Read the full lookahead here.
    


            The UK's recognition of Palestinian statehood comes weeks after the government banned a pro-Palestinian activist group.
    


            Palestine Action is an organization that aims to disrupt the operations of weapons manufacturers connected to the Israeli government. It was outlawed by the British government in June following a security breach at the UK's largest airbase.
    


            It was founded by Huda Ammori and climate activist Richard Barnard in 2020, when the group took its first action to shut down the UK operations of Elbit Systems – Israel's largest weapons manufacturer – and stated its commitment to “ending global participation in Israel's genocidal and apartheid regime.”
    


            Since it was founded, Palestine Action has also, among other actions, occupied, blockaded, spray painted and disrupted the Israeli-French drone company UAV Tactical Systems and the global arms giant Leonardo.
    


            However, it was the group's late June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, and vandalized two Airbus Voyager refueling planes with paint and crowbars – that spurred serious government action.
    


            Days later, then-UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper – who was made foreign secretary in a recent cabinet reshuffle – designated Palestine Action as a terror group, placing it on equal footing with organizations such as Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS – sparking condemnation from United Nations experts, human rights groups, and politicians.
    


            Hundreds have been arrested trying to protest the activist group's ban.
    


            Almost 900 demonstrators were arrested in London earlier this month, marking the largest mass arrest in the English capital in decades.
    


            Dozens of people have been reported killed as the Israeli military presses on with operations in the Gaza City area.
    


            Hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. More than half arrived at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, an indication of the current focus of Israeli operations.
    


            The Palestinian Health Ministry said that over the past 24 hours 75 bodies and more than 300 injured people arrived at hospitals. The ministry - which does not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties - says the cumulative death toll as a result of Israeli military operations since October 2023 had reached 65,283.
    


            The Israeli military said Sunday “numerous terrorists who were preparing to carry out terror attacks” had been killed in the last day in the Gaza City area but did not offer a precise figure.
    


            The military added that troops had also dismantled Hamas' military infrastructure sites in the area and uncovered hidden explosives. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.”
    


An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces says more than 500,000 Palestinians have left the Gaza City area since it ordered civilians to evacuate on September 9.
    


            People in the area told CNN Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza.
    


            Some reaction now to the UK's forthcoming announcement of Palestinian statehood recognition from the Palestinian envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot.
    


            Speaking to the BBC today, he said the move meant “wrongs are being righted.”
    


            “This is more about Britain than it is about Palestine,” Zomlot said. “Palestine existed long before the Balfour Declaration, Palestine existed long before Israel.”
    


            “The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,” he added.
    


                    “I think today the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected, and when taking responsibility of that colonial era, because that era has led us directly to the genocide in Gaza today,” Zomlot added. “Today, we welcome such a historic step.”
                





For context: The Balfour Declaration expressed support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” in a letter written by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour.
    


            The Israeli government has maintained it is conducting the war in Gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law, firmly denying accusations of genocide.
    


            While France, the UK and Canada are set to become the first G7 members to recognize a Palestinian state, Germany and Italy have made it clear that they have no intention to follow suit.
    


            They and several other European governments believe recognition should be part of two-state negotations - however distant that prospect.
    


            German chancellor Friedrich Merz has been a long-time opponent of recognizing a Palestinian state and won't be attending the UN General Assembly in New York this week where France and Saudi Arabia will harness international support for the move.
    


            “The German government is not currently considering recognizing Palestinian statehood,” Merz said on Thursday in Madrid. “We continue to view such recognition as one of the final steps, not one of the first, on the path to a two-state solution.”
    


            Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni said in July that recognizing a Palestinian state before it was established could be counterproductive.
    


            “I am very much in favor of the State of Palestine, but I am not in favor of recognizing it prior to establishing it,” Meloni told Italian outlet La Repubblica.
    


            Japan has taken a similar stance and does not plan to recognize a Palestinian state at UN meetings next week, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said on Friday.
    


            He said that while Japan supports a two-state solution, it was a matter of when to recognize a Palestinian state.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has faced mounting pressure from within his own party to officially recognize Palestine as a state, with Labour MPs and voters having long voiced their horror at Israel's war.
    


            The Labour leader has been walking a political tightrope around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his party, which was mired in allegations of antisemitism under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. In 2020, the UK's human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for “unlawful” acts of harassment and discrimination during Corbyn's leadership.
    


            Having striven to win back the trust of British Jews, Starmer lost support from the left of the Labour party, which has demanded the government take a tougher stance toward Israel and criticized the police response to pro-Palestine protests after the UK's proscription of Palestine Action.
    


            In recent months, amid a mounting sense of horror over Israel's military campaign in Gaza both in the UK and globally, Starmer had found himself under pressure from his cabinet ministers to immediately recognize Palestine as a state.
    


            Previous governments had withheld from making the move, saying it must come as part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine on a two-state solution.

Live memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — President Donald Trump and prominent members of his “Make America Great Again” movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere.

The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.

“We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. “It will be a tough day.”

Kirk's assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.

The service will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals west of Phoenix, where Kirk's Turning Point organization is based. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event.




Members of the public began lining up outside the stadium before dawn to secure a spot, several hours before the start of the service. The 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organizers suggested.

The stadium had the feel of a megachurch service. Floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands playing on stage as the crowds filed in. Many stood and sang along.

“I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference,” said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. “He deserves us to be here.”

Trump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.

He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised “the life and legacy” of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday.

“Who could vote against that? All (Republicans) were saying was ‘Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'” Trump told reporters. “And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that.'”

Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk's death. 

ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air indefinitely following backlash from affiliated broadcasters and the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian's remarks about Kirk.

The State Department has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.

A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred.

Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach. 

The crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk's memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.

 “I think he spoke on more than just politics,” said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. “Now that he's gone, it's like who's gonna speak for us now?”

His impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.

Kirk “was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. “But he never stopped smiling, never stopped respecting his interlocutor and anyone who challenged him.”

Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader.

Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.

Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president.

Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak.

Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes.

Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that “the movement my husband built will not die.”

Many have been attempting to relocate from the city, where 1 million people once lived, to the southern Gaza Strip following Israeli military calls for a full evacuation. Hundreds of thousands remained in the city, the territory's largest and already in ruins from nearly two years of war and struggling with famine.

CAIRO (AP) — Israeli strikes in Gaza City and at a refugee camp killed more than 40 people, including 19 women and children, health officials said on Sunday, as several European countries and leading U.S. allies moved to recognize a Palestinian state.

Health officials at Shifa Hospital, where most of the bodies were brought, said the dead included 14 people killed in a strike late Saturday which hit a residential block in the southern side of the city. Health staff said a nurse who worked at the hospital was among the dead, along with his wife and three children.

Another strike that targeted a group of people in front of a clinic in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least eight Palestinians, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. The dead include four children and two women, the hospital said. Another 22 people were wounded, it said.

Israel did not comment on the strikes.

In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said Sunday that an Israeli drone strike in the southern city of Bint Jbeil killed five people, among them three children, and two others were wounded. No further details were given.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident.

Since Hezbollah and Israel's monthslong war ended in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November, Israel has struck southern Lebanon almost daily in what they say are attacks to target the Lebanese militant group. 

The Lebanese government has said that these strikes violate the ceasefire and hampers their efforts to gradually disarm the group.

The latest Israeli military operation, which began this week, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire further out of reach. The Israeli military, which has told Palestinians to leave, hasn't given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Israel says the operation is meant to pressure Hamas into freeing hostages and surrendering.

Ahead of the U.N. assembly, peace activists in Israel have hailed the planned recognition of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, a group of more than 60 Jewish and Arab organizations representing about 1,000 activists, including some veteran organizations promoting peace and coexistence, known as It's Time Coalition, called for an end to the war, the release of the hostages and the recognition of a Palestinian state. 

“We refuse to live forever by the sword. The UN decision offers a historic opportunity to move from a death trap to life, from an endless messianic war to a future of security and freedom for both peoples,” said the coalition in a video statement. 

On Saturday night, tens of thousands of people in Israel protested, calling for an end to the war and a hostage deal.

Yet a ceasefire remains elusive. Israeli bombardment over the past 23 months has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza, destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.

On Sunday, Australia, Canada and the U.K. announced formal recognition of Palestinian statehood. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move is intended “to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the announcement.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the establishment of a Palestinian state “will not happen.” In an angry statement after the coordinated initiative from the Commonwealth nations was announced, he accused the foreign leaders of giving a “prize” to Hamas.

“It will not happen,” he said. “A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.”

Other prominent Western countries are preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood at the gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. Netanyahu said he would announce Israel's response after a trip next week to the U.S., where he is to meet President Donald Trump at the White House.

In a statement Sunday, the military stated it killed Majed Abu Selmiya, who it said was a sniper for Hamas' military wing and was preparing to carry out more attacks in the Gaza City area, without providing evidence. 

Majed was the brother of the director of Shifa hospital, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, who called the allegations a lie and said Israel was trying to justify the killing of civilians. Dr. Selmiya told The Associated Press that his brother, 57, suffered from hypertension, diabetes and had vision problems. 

As the attacks continue, Israel has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City to move south to what it calls a humanitarian zone and opened another corridor south of the city for two days this week to allow more people to evacuate. 

Palestinians were streaming out of Gaza City by car and on foot, though many are unwilling to be uprooted again, too weak to leave or unable to afford the cost of moving.

Along the coastal Wadi Gaza route, those too exhausted to continue stopped to catch their breath and give their children a much-needed break from the difficult journey.

Aid groups have warned that forcing thousands of people to evacuate will exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. They are appealing for a ceasefire so aid can reach those who need it. 

Pope Leo XIV criticized what he described as the “forced exile” of Palestinians from Gaza, saying there was no future for the “martyred” Gaza Strip based on violence and vendetta. 

During his Sunday noon blessing, Leo issued another appeal for peace and expressed appreciation for the work of Catholic organizations active in helping Palestinians, which had representatives present in St. Peter's Square.

Families of hostages still held by Hamas have accused Netanyahu of condemning their loved ones to death by continuing to fight rather than negotiating an end to the war.

Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting that Israel's victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah “have opened a window for the possibility of peace with our neighbors to the north.”

“We are holding talks with the Syrians -- there is some progress, but still a vision for the future,” he said.

Israel has occupied parts of southwest Syria since the overthrow of then-Syrian President Bashar Assad in December. Relations with the new Syrian government have been tense, with Israel carrying out airstrikes over the summer in what it says were steps to protect Syria's Druze community.

Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an interview on Syrian state television on Sept. 12 that negotiations with Israel for a security deal are still ongoing. He hopes that Israeli troops will return to where they were before the fall of Assad's government under a disengagement agreement in 1974.

“Israel considered the fall of the regime as Syria's withdrawal from the 1974 agreement, even though Syria showed its commitment from the very beginning,” said al-Sharaa.

France and Saudi Arabia hope to use this year's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly and the increasingly horrific war in the Gaza Strip to inject new urgency into the quest for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established.

Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly.

But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. The U.S. has blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the General Assembly. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank.

That would put the Palestinians' dream of independence even further out of reach.




The creation of a Palestinian state in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict, which began more than a century before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

Proponents say this would allow Israel to exist as a democracy with a Jewish majority. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. 

“Israel must understand that the one state solution, with the subjugation of the Palestinian people without rights -- that is absolutely intolerable,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said last week. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.”

Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009.

Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods.

The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves.

In Gaza, Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced some 90% of the population of 2 million, left much of the territory uninhabitable and pushed some areas into famine. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city.

Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing.

Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance.

The plan calls for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the return of all hostages and a complete Israeli withdrawal. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not.

The international community would help the Palestinian Authority rebuild Gaza and govern the territories, possibly with the help of foreign peacekeepers. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow.

The 193-member world body approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing the so-called “New York Declaration” earlier this month. 

The United States and Israel say the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas and makes it harder to reach a deal to halt the war and return the remaining hostages.

The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March.

Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction.

Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.”

Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state.

The U.S. has not taken a public position on the issue, but in an interview with Fox News, Rubio linked “this conversation about annexation” to the issue of statehood recognition.

The United Arab Emirates has called annexation a “red line,” without saying what effect it might have on the 2020 Abraham Accords, in which the country normalized ties with Israel.

The French-Saudi plan sidesteps the most divisive issues in the conflict: final borders, the fate of the settlements, the return of Palestinian refugees from past wars, security arrangements, the status of Jerusalem and recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.

It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. 

The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.

All of which means the plan is likely to end up on the mound of past Mideast accords, parameters and road maps, leaving Israel in full control of the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, ruling millions of Palestinians who are denied basic rights.

Bill Belichick in his debut as HC for UNC was blown out by a score of 48-14. Colin Cowherd asks whether or not this was surprising, and what it means for the legendary head coach. 

Jordon Hudson may have given her boyfriend, North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick, a pep talk before his game against UCF, but it didn't work out for the Tar Heels on Saturday in Central Florida.

The Tar Heels were blown out 34-9 as UCF dominated on its home turf, dropping North Carolina to 2-2 in Belichick's inaugural college football coaching campaign.

Before the game, Hudson was spotted talking to Belichick on the sideline, which has become a common occurrence since his debut at North Carolina in another blowout loss to TCU earlier this season.

It's unclear what Hudson, 24, and Belichick, 73, were discussing on the field, but video captured Hudson whispering in Belichick's ear before kickoff.

"First of all, he did a great job with UCF today," Belichick said of coach Scott Frost after the loss. "Their team played well, certainly better than we did. There were too many problems out there to be consistent."

The Tar Heels allowed 13 unanswered points to start the game, putting them in an early hole. They managed a field goal late in the second quarter, but the damage was already done as UCF extended the lead after that.

"There are a lot of things that we need to do a better job of, and they were just better than us today," Belichick added.

Gio Lopez, Belichick's quarterback, threw for only 87 yards with two interceptions before suffering a right leg injury in the third quarter that knocked him out of the game.

This was Belichick's first loss since his debut against the Horned Frogs. North Carolina turned the tide with a 20-3 win over Charlotte and blew out Richmond 41-6 last week to reach 2-1 entering Saturday.

Hudson has been a regular presence on the sideline before games despite some disagreeing with it when she was spotted before the TCU game. Her name was even mentioned by TCU player Bud Clark, who went viral after commenting on Instagram Live following the 48-14 rout.

"Belichick gotta call for his girlfriend," Clark, who had a pick-six in the win, was heard saying in a clip. "…He sad."

Hudson and Belichick created the wrong type of stir leading up to the 74-year-old coach's debut, most notably with a controversial "CBS Sunday Morning" interview.

Hudson said, "We're not talking about that," when Belichick was asked how the couple met. Emails obtained by WRAL show Belichick addressing the controversy over his romantic and professional relationship with Hudson, where he claimed CBS "secretly" had a camera focused on her despite her request to sit off camera.

"I met Jordon randomly on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. That is no secret," Belichick wrote in another email. "Jordon was not dodging the specific question regarding how we met, but rather was preventing the interview from continuing to probe into personal matters."

Hudson also handles Belichick's off-the-field career opportunities, and since the relationship began, it has been the punchline of jokes at award shows as well as a storyline in the national sports media.

North Carolina football general manager Michael Lombardi insisted that Belichick's relationship with Hudson isn't a distraction for the program.

"I mean, a lot of it is just noise," he told ESPN Radio's "Marty & McGee" in June. "And for us to be distracted by something that has no bearing, that has no relevance whatsoever, that is a complete falsehood, in terms of what people are saying or what they're writing. It's comical. And, for me, to really even attack anybody who's saying it, gives them credibility. Which I don't, because it's a completely false narrative."

With Sunday's focus on the memorial for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona — an event that more than 100,000 people are expected to attend — University of Alabama students remembered Kirk for his faith and inspiration on Wednesday in their own ceremony.

A number of speakers took to the stage to address his legacy.

Former reality TV star Savannah Chrisley, conservative activist CJ Pearson, and political commentator Alexis Wilkins all spoke. 

CHARLIE KIRK LEAVES BEHIND POWERFUL CHRISTIAN FAITH LEGACY AFTER TRAGIC SHOOTING

Also making an address was Kieghan Nangle, 22, executive assistant to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Nangle, an Alabama alum, said Erika Kirk's strength has been and will continue to be an inspiration for scores of young women. 

"If Erika [Kirk] could stand before the world with power and bravery just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy," said a young Christian this week.  (Turning Point USA)

"Charlie's wonderful wife, Erika, needs an army behind her, and every person in this country has what it takes to rise to that occasion," Nangle said in her speech.

The Kirks married in May 2021. The couple has two children, a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son.

"If Erika could stand before the world with power and bravery, just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy," said Nangle.

Nangle said she was introduced to TPUSA in 2021 when she attended the Young Women's Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas.

"Charlie and TPUSA taught me and my peers lessons that I believe if they weren't taught, my generation's lives and our country would look very different today," Nangle told Fox News Digital.

"The organization taught me how to stand firm in my convictions."

Many millennials and members of Gen Z are returning to church, reading Scripture and expressing a desire for greater spiritual depth, Fox News Digital previously reported. 

"The organization taught me how to stand firm in my convictions, stay rooted in my faith, and exhibit courageous pride in the best country in the world — America," she added.

TPUSA has said that campus chapter requests have surged by the thousands after Kirk's assassination, as Fox News Digital has reported.

"Our hard work of talking to students daily and bringing speakers to campus allowed organizations to boom on campus today, with over 300 people at their meeting this past week, and the organization is now the largest student-led organization on campus," said Nangle. 

"The organization was the outlet I didn't know I needed during college," she added.

Miss America Cassie Donegan spoke to Fox News Digital about her win, responding to online trolls and how she wants to help create unity in a divided nation.

When Cassie Donegan was crowned Miss America, she never imagined her victory would be quickly overshadowed by a wave of criticism targeting her appearance.

Several users online quickly flooded social media with harsh critiques of Donegan's pageant makeup. They argued that the 28-year-old's look appeared heavy and harsh under the glaring stage lights. Some even claimed runner-up Sadie Schiermeyer, representing Texas, should have won instead.

Donegan, who represented New York at the competition on Sept. 7 in Orlando, Florida, told Fox News Digital she's not letting the hateful words get under her skin.

"The reality is, when something big happens like this, there are going to be many opinions," she said.

"Everyone has the right to their own opinion, especially in such a public forum like the internet. … Yes, there is that negativity out there, and that is their truth. They are allowed to have that opinion, and I respect that entirely. But I'm surrounded by so much love and so much support and so many people who are holding me up … I'm just not allowing [their negativity] to cloud the really incredible thing that's happening."

Donegan pointed out that she's more focused on being a role model for younger girls across the country.

"I'm able to look at these little girls and say, ‘I am not much different than you are right now, and you are so capable of doing anything you want to do,'" she said. "I want them to believe in themselves, because if they don't, no one else will. Empowerment really comes from within. And if there's even a small part of me that brings that spark out of them, then I've done my part. That will be something I will be grateful to be a part of."

Miss America, a glitzy competition, was born from a 1921 Atlantic City beauty contest just a year after women were given the right to vote, the Associated Press reported. Many participants say the organization – a large provider of scholarship assistance to young women – has been life-changing, opening doors for them both personally and professionally.

The organization, one of the nation's most recognized brands, awards more than $5 million in cash scholarships annually, plus millions more at the national, state and local levels.

Last year's Miss America winner, Abbie Stockard of Alabama, crowned her successor. Donegan's win included a $50,000 tuition scholarship, plus an additional $3,000 scholarship for her performance in the preliminary talent competition.

Donegan said surrounding herself with people who "pour positivity into you" is key to combating hateful words online.

The first runner-up in the Miss America pageant was Sadie Schiermeyer of Texas. (Miss America IP INC. )

"I know it's really hard," she admitted. "It's hard not to open my phone and want to go and see what people are saying, but curiosity really does kill the cat. … I once heard that other people's opinion of you is not your business. That is something that I've really tried to [live] by. Their opinion of me is valid because that is their truth, but it doesn't mean that it's my opinion of me.

"[I ask myself], ‘Would they say that to me directly if it wasn't behind a screen?' … At the end of the day, if you're surrounding yourself with positivity and the people who know you, who love you and see you, then the other noise is going to matter a lot less."

The accomplished singer said she's developed thick skin over the years.

"I'm from a smaller town. We were a lower-income family," she said. "We struggled a lot growing up. I dealt with bullying pretty badly. My mom had a lot of health problems. She had her first of multiple strokes when I was only nine years old. Some days, we didn't even know if certain utilities were going to be on. Some days they weren't on."

Cassie Donegan isn't fazed by online trolls who criticized her pageant look. (Miss America IP INC. )

"That's not necessarily the background that someone would think of when they look at something as glamorous as the Miss America opportunity from the outside," Donegan noted. "But if you allow life and your circumstances to control your outcome, then it would potentially keep you from standing in spaces like Miss America."

"I was not in a $10,000 gown," she continued. "My talent outfit was given to me and was sponsored. The makeup I used, some of it came from drugstores. The other part was sponsored by an incredible makeup sponsor.

"There is no set of rules that says you have to spend a certain amount of money, or you have to come from a certain background or lifestyle to be Miss America, or to be whatever it is that you want to be. If even one person can understand that and believe that about themselves, that their circumstances do not decide their outcome … then I have been successful in my job this year."

"I'm the daughter of a veteran of our United States Navy," she said. "I come from a long line of veterans. My brother is now also in the process of potentially … joining our military as well. I have a lot of pride in our armed forces here in the United States. 

"I think just seeing that dedication day in and day out to protecting our country and … protecting the things that our country was founded on — being able to have equality for all. Being able to have spaces that are filled with love and kindness. Being able to look at your neighbor and say, ‘Your journey matters just as much as my journey.'"

"Something so wonderful about my job as Miss America is that while I may have my own beliefs or opinions, I do get to create … a safe space," she reflected. "It is a space for you to be able to stand and say your truth, live your truth, be your truth, and understand that there is love here, there is a community here. We can have these rooms full of people from different backgrounds, different walks of life and be able to have these really authentic moments of connection and conversation."

CNN's Kaitlan Collins confronted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over her social media posts pertaining to the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a Friday episode of "The Source."

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., sparred with CNN host Kaitlan Collins on Friday over a video the liberal lawmaker shared on social media and her remarks about Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.  

Collins pressed Omar on why she reposted a video that said, "Kirk was Dr. Frankenstein and his monster shot him through the neck."

"Because there were a lot of things in the video that I did agree with. Obviously, we share videos. We don‘t have to agree with every single word, but I do believe he was a reprehensible, hateful man. Like, that is my view of the words that he has said about every single identity that I belong to. He didn‘t believe that we should have equal access to anything. He also just didn't even believe I could be smart enough, I could have thoughts that could be equal to a White man. Where are we missing this conversation about who this man was and the things that he said?" 

Singling out Collins, Omar asked, "How do you not… find that reprehensible, Kaitlan?"

Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 while speaking at a campus event in Utah.

ABC REPORTER CALLS CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN'S TEXT MESSAGES WITH TRANSGENDER PARTNER ‘VERY TOUCHING'

The lawmaker turned the question back to Collins, who said, "Of course, I don't subscribe to that." 

Omar asked Collins, "You think I don't have the brain processing power like you or a White man?" The CNN host said, "Of course not" as Omar asked her if she would find that reprehensible. 

"I'm not asking why you think he's reprehensible. I think you're obviously allowed to have your own views. That's why we have you on here so often. Because we like to hear your views and what you think on something. I just think it was the video where it called him Dr. Frankenstein and said his monster shot him through the neck. I mean, obviously, this is a person. And looking at this, this is someone who was a husband and a father. And in the days after his shocking death, that happened as a result of his views or happened as a result as he was sharing his views publicly with people, that people found it jarring to hear such criticism of that in the immediate aftermath of his death," Collins said. 

Omar said she found it jarring that people wanted to memorialize Kirk and excuse "reprehensible things" that he said.

"It is one thing to care about his life, because obviously so many people loved him, including his children and wife. But I am not going to sit here and be judged for not wanting to honor any legacy this man has left behind, that should be in the dustbin of history, and we should hopefully move on and forget the hate that he spewed every single day," Omar continued.

Omar was criticized over an interview she did with Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan after Kirk's assassination.

Omar expressed condolences for Kirk's family but went on to criticize him during the interview.

"But what I do know for sure is that Charlie Kirk was someone who once said, ‘Guns save lives' after a school shooting," Omar said. "Charlie was someone who was willing to debate and downplay the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police … downplay slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth should never exist."

Omar went on to lament that there are a "lot of people who are out there talking" about Kirk "just wanting to have a civil debate," prompting Hasan to interject and call it a "complete rewriting of history."

"Pawn Stars" boss Rick Harrison tells Fox News Digital how Las Vegas buffets are disappearing due to changing eating habits, while food halls become the new trend as fewer tourists are visiting.

For decades, Las Vegas buffets were a tourist jackpot. Today, food halls are a big draw.

Even "Pawn Stars" boss Rick Harrison has noticed the evolution of people's eating habits, calling the buffet's decline an example of "Darwinism."

"You know, 100 years ago, lobster was considered poor people's food, so everything has changed," Harrison told Fox News Digital in a video interview from his restaurant, Rick's Rollin Smoke Barbeque & Tavern. 

LAS VEGAS BUFFETS 'A DYING BREED' AS CASINOS PUSH 'YOUNGER AND COOLER' FOOD HALL OPTIONS

The once-famous buffets in Vegas have given way to trendy Strip food halls in recent years.

In 2020, Rio's Carnival World Buffet closed down before reopening as Canteen Food Hall in 2024.

ARIA Buffet also shuttered in 2020, reopening as Proper Eats Food Hall in 2022. 

The Big Top Food Court at Circus Circus, which opened in 2021, replaced a small portion of the venue's buffet.

Despite the changes, the menu at Harrison's restaurant leans on barbecue tradition – the kind that takes 16 hours in a smoker.

"We don't cut the time," Harrison saidl. "It's not 15-and-a-half hours. It's not 15 hours and 45 minutes. It's 16 hours, every bit of it."

Harrison said all the meat at his restaurant is locally sourced.

"We're kind of known for our burnt ends," he added. "For people who don't know what the burnt ends [are], that's the fatty side of the brisket."

Harrison said he was born and raised in North Carolina, which he called "mostly the barbecue capital of the world."

WHY SOME STEAKHOUSES ARE THRIVING WHILE OTHERS CAN'T KEEP DINERS COMING BACK: 'NOT JUST ABOUT THE FOOD'

His restaurant, which is next to the pawn shop, receives thousands of visitors every day, he said.

"People from overseas don't know about American barbecue, and when they find out about it, they absolutely love it," Harrison said.

With tourism numbers down in Vegas, many people have pointed to the expensive pricing, especially when it comes to food.

On that point, Harrison called the $1,000 steak "the most ridiculous thing in the world."

"I wouldn't fall for the gimmicks," he said, noting there are still places to eat "a good ol' American steak" for $50 to $80.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority recently released its numbers for July visitors, noting a 12% drop from last year.

There are still places in Vegas to eat "a good ol' American steak" for relatively reasonable prices, said Vegas insider Rick Harrison. (iStock)

There were 3,089,300 visitors in July compared to over 3.5 million last year, while occupancy on the Strip dropped 7% from 86.5% in 2024.

Harrison attributed the decrease to "people skipping vacations" due to inflation. 

The great thing about Vegas, he said, is the variety of food offerings.

"You have everything from a food court to five-star restaurants," Harrison said. 

"So, it's a little bit of everything here. … You got something for every budget here."

A gunman opened fire in a New Hampshire country club Saturday, killing one person and wounding “several other” people, authorities said. Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke said the person who died at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua was an adult male.

NASHUA, N.H. (AP) — Witnesses say someone struck a gunman with a chair after the shooter said “free Palestine” and opened fire while a wedding was taking place in a New Hampshire country club. 

One person was killed and two others were wounded by gunfire Saturday before the suspect was taken into custody, authorities said.

The person who died at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua was a 59-year-old man identified as Robert Steven DeCesare, according to New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke.

Authorities identified the suspect as Hunter Nadeau, 23, and said he had been arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder for knowingly shooting DeCesare.

Witnesses at the scene said the shootings took place in a restaurant adjacent to a wedding that was taking place. Tom Bartelson of Pepperell, Massachusetts, who was at the country club, described a chaotic scene that unfolded near his nephew's wedding. He said he heard the shooter say “the children are safe” and “free Palestine” and appeared to be targeting someone.

“Getting together for a dance for the bride and groom and then all chaos went off,” he said. “We heard about six shots and everybody ducked for cover and next thing you know we're rushed into safe spots and things like that.”

Wedding DJ Michael Homewood credited the chair strike with preventing an even worse shooting.

“He hit him over the head with a chair, and he probably saved a bunch of lives just doing that,” Homewood told WCVB-TV.




Investigators were still working to determine a motive, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley said. Authorities said there is no known connection between Nadeau and DeCesare. 

Authorities had initially thought there could be two shooters but later said there was only one. 

“Additional charges likely will be brought, including for the additional shooting victims,” Formella and Rourke said in a statement. They said they expect Nadeau to be arraigned at the Ninth Circuit Court in Nashua on Monday.

In addition to three gunshot victims, others at the scene suffered injuries including lacerations, a broken hand and blunt force trauma, Nashua Fire Rescue said Sunday.

Nashua Fire Rescue said it assisted about 100 people from the scene to a nearby firehouse, mostly on foot. Minor medical issues were handled at the scene, the agency said.

Later, Nashua Mayor Jim Donchess said he had faith in police to “get to the bottom of this and bring the perpetrator to justice.”

Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement Sunday that the attorney general's office will assist Nashua police with the investigation and that she and her husband were “praying for the victims and their families.”

Nashua is about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of Boston, just across the Massachusetts border. 

The mother of DeCesare, the man who was killed, had earlier described not being able to find her son after he was shot.

“He went down. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter escaped ... They saw my son go down and they saw blood,” said Evie O'Rourke of Salem, New Hampshire.

Sophie Flabouris, another witness who was at the scene, told WCVB-TV that someone hit the suspect over the head with a chair to subdue him. Flabouris said the suspect then fled the scene.

“We had just gathered around the dance floor. We were about to do a Greek smashing of the plates and throwing the dollar bills. The bride had just come up to me and gave me the plates to say, ‘All right, you give this to my husband.' And all of a sudden we heard ‘pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.' Heard five shots,” Flabouris told WCVB-TV. “All of a sudden heard ‘Gun!' Chaos, screaming, and then running.”

Emily Ernst, who was at the scene, said she saw a gunman in all black.

“He had a mask on. We just saw him raise the gun and then we ran,” Ernst said. “I ran through the kitchen for my life.”

Bartelson said some people dropped to the ground and attempted to get away from the scene. There was a lot of panic, he said.

“We were trying to keep family members safe,” he said. “Keep everybody down and try to find safe spots.”

More than 100,000 heavy hearts are set to converge on Arizona's State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., today to commemorate the life of Charlie Kirk — the fiery young activist who ignited fierce loyalty, sharp, yet civil debate, and whose shocking assassination has left a movement in mourning.

Those in attendance at Kirk's service, which begins at 11 a.m. local time in Glendale, will hear from Republican political heavyweights including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, close allies, and family members who will pay tribute to the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA.

Kirk's widow, Erika, will speak about his legacy and her new role at the helm of the powerful national organization he built. The service is anticipated to be both a moment of mourning and a declaration of continuity, signaling how his movement intends to carry forward without its founder.

Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The gathering was the first stop on TPUSA's planned "American Comeback Tour," and, at first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

The charismatic Kirk, known for his signature debates on college campuses, sat beneath a white tent emblazoned with the slogan "Prove Me Wrong," taking open-mic questions from a crowd of thousands. Moments later, a single shot ended his life.

SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES OVER SECURITY LAPSES SURROUNDING CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING

In the wake of his death, many Americans are learning for the first time of the unlikely rise of the young activist who vaulted from obscurity in suburban Illinois to become a defining voice for a generation of conservatives and one of the movement's most formidable power brokers.

At 18, Kirk dropped out of community college to co-found Turning Point USA. By his mid-20s, he became the youngest speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2016 and a household name in conservative circles. By 31, he commanded a $95 million political empire, galvanized millions of followers online and established a direct line to Trump.

His death leaves behind an energetic movement that indisputably reshaped conservative youth politics.

With backing from Republican donors like Foster Friess, Kirk turned the scrappy campus operation into one of the fastest-growing conservative nonprofits in America. Today, it's a political juggernaut — its revenue, according to tax filings, soared from just $2 million in 2015 to $85 million in 2024.

Add in revenue from its political action arm, Turning Point Action, and the haul climbs well above $95 million.

After his death, TPUSA has seen a massive surge in inquiries for new college chapters as the organization works to advance Kirk's vision.

Andrew Kolvet, executive producer of "The Charlie Kirk Show," said the organization has received more than 54,000 requests to establish new campus chapters in the week since the assassination — a surge that would add to its existing network of 900 nationwide.

He also told Fox News Digital that he has "personally received hundreds of offers to work" for TPUSA.

Kirk's widow, recently tapped to head the organization, vowed to carry on her husband's mission in her first public comments since his death.

"To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die," Kirk said on Sept. 12. "I refuse to let that happen. No one will ever forget my husband's name. And I will make sure of it. It will become stronger. Bolder. Louder and greater than ever," she added.

Kirk said that TPUSA's annual "AmericaFest" conference in Phoenix this December will continue as scheduled.

Rachel's Challenge founder Darrell Scott joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss how he has worked in his daughter's memory to save other children across the country and to share the message he has for other parents experiencing the same tragedy.

DENVER - A Colorado teenager who died tackling a school shooter to save his classmates is now being considered for sainthood — a move parishioners say reflects his extraordinary courage and faith.

Kendrick Castillo, 18, was killed on May 7, 2019, when he charged one of the gunmen who opened fire at STEM School Highlands Ranch, just days before graduation. His selfless act allowed classmates to subdue the attackers and prevented what could have been a much larger tragedy.

"You cannot overstate the heroism of Kendrick Castillo," George Brauchler, who prosecuted the case, told Fox News Digital. "And on that particular day, if you said in classroom 107, who's going to be your hero that averts a mass murder? I don't know if he's in the top half. I just think that people would have written him off as not that guy, but he turns out to be that guy." 

The shooting erupted inside a British literature class that had gathered to watch "The Princess Bride" as an end-of-year reward. Two assailants, Devon Erickson, then 18, and accomplice Alec McKinney, then 16, carried out the attack.

During the shooting, Castillo and fellow students Joshua Jones and Brendan Bialy rushed Erickson. After firing four shots, Erickson's weapon jammed.

Castillo was fatally shot in the struggle, but his actions gave classmates the chance to disarm the attackers. He was the only student killed, while eight others were injured.

Brauchler, who also prosecuted the Columbine High School and Aurora theater shooting, described Castillo as "a miracle baby" and the only child to his parents, John and Maria Castillo.

"They renamed the street near the school Kendrick Castillo Way," Brauchler said. "And now he's cleared the first hurdle toward canonization in the Catholic Church he loved so much. It's really an incredible story."

Erickson was later convicted on 46 counts, including first-degree murder, and faces life in prison without parole. McKinney, who testified against him, pleaded guilty and could be eligible for parole after about 20 years, according to the Associated Press.

After the verdict, Kendrick's father, John Castillo, said he felt his son's presence guiding the jury. "I'm sure he was looking down today," he told the outlet. "This day was justice for him."

Former student Mitchell Kraus, who was wounded in the attack, recalled walking Erickson to the nurse's office just minutes before the shooting began. "He never gave any indication something was about to happen," Kraus said. Now in college, Kraus said he feels closure knowing Erickson will never walk free again.

"Now that I can be sure that this monster, to be honest, is never going to see the light of day again, it's just a weight off my back," he said.

The Diocese of Colorado Springs, which oversees the area where the tragedy occurred, has formally received a petition to open Kendrick's cause for canonization, the National Catholic Register reported. 

Although Kendrick had deep ties to the Archdiocese of Denver, Church law designates the diocese where a person died to initiate the canonization cause. Since his death occurred in Highlands Ranch, the responsibility falls to the Colorado Springs Diocese.

Father Patrick DiLoreto of St. Mark Parish in Highlands Ranch said Castillo's sacrifice may qualify under Pope Francis' "Offering of Life" category — recognizing those who give their lives for love of God and neighbor, even outside of traditional martyrdom definitions.

"He [Castillo] courageously threw himself at one of the school shooters without hesitation, allowing other students to follow and subdue the gunman," DiLoreto explained. "This saved the lives of his fellow classmates when, in any other circumstance, there would surely have been more deaths on that day."

Castillo's devotion was well known in his parish. He carried a rosary daily, one of which was found on him after his death and later gifted to a classmate, the Register reported. He volunteered regularly, attended funerals of strangers to pray for them, and openly spoke of wanting to be a witness of faith.

Bishop James Golka of Colorado Springs praised those who gathered testimony about Kendrick's life. "It seems clear that Kendrick was an exceptional young man," he said.

As America continues to face tragic acts of school violence, parishioners and leaders alike see Castillo's example as a source of strength.

"As the country faces more and more persecution of Christians, especially in these horrific school shootings, such as the one last week in Minnesota, we can look at the heroic examples such as Kendrick and the children who protected others for inspiration," Father DiLoreto finished.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports on the charges facing a man allegedly found with a gun and knife at Charlie Kirk's memorial site on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk is set to be honored Sunday at a massive public memorial service that will include speeches from President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

The memorial service for Kirk, who was assassinated on Sept. 10 during the first stop of Turning Point USA's "The American Comeback Tour" at Utah Valley University, is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors, including senior White House officials and young conservatives influenced by the late 31-year-old.

Trump said he would attend Sunday's memorial in Arizona to honor Kirk, though he admitted "there are no words to really describe what happened."

"He had just an army of young people," Trump said, describing Kirk's influence on young conservatives. "They loved him so much. I mean, they're devastated right now. Everybody is devastated."

Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded in 2012, released guidelines Saturday night for those attending the service, including a patriotic dress code and a strict no-bag policy.

The memorial, titled, "Building a Legacy: Remembering Charlie Kirk," will begin at 11a.m. local time (2p.m. ET) and is "first come, first served based on stadium capacity," according to the event website.

The Pentagon says it will require credentialed journalists at the military headquarters to sign a pledge to refrain from reporting information that has not been authorized for release — including unclassified information.

Journalists who don't abide by the policy risk losing credentials that provide access to the Pentagon, under a 17-page memo distributed Friday that steps up media restrictions imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.

“Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified,” the directive states. The signature form includes an array of security requirements for credentialed media at the Pentagon.

Advocates for press freedoms denounced the non-disclosure requirement as an assault on independent journalism. The new Pentagon restrictions arrive as Trump expands threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape.

“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting. It is getting only what officials want them to see,” said National Press Club President Mike Balsamo, also national law enforcement editor at The Associated Press. “That should alarm every American.”




Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel personality, highlighted the restrictions in a social media post on X.

“The ‘press' does not run the Pentagon — the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility,” Hegseth said. “Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.”

The Pentagon this year has evicted many news organizations while imposing a series of restrictions on the press that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort — areas where the press had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military.

The Pentagon was embarrassed early in Hegseth's tenure when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently included in a group chat on the Signal messaging app where the Defense secretary discussed plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job.

The Defense Department also was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out.

On Saturday, the Society of Professional Journalists also objected to the Pentagon's move, calling it “alarming.”

“This policy reeks of prior restraint — the most egregious violation of press freedom under the First Amendment — and is a dangerous step toward government censorship,” it said in a statement Saturday. “Attempts to silence the press under the guise of “security” are part of a disturbing pattern of growing government hostility toward transparency and democratic norms.”

And Matt Murray, executive editor of The Washington Post, said in the paper's columns Saturday that the new policy runs counter to what's good for the American public. 

“The Constitution protects the right to report on the activities of democratically elected and appointed government officials,” Murray said. “Any attempt to control messaging and curb access by the government is counter to the First Amendment and against the public interest.”

            Tom Homan, now the president's border czar, was recorded last year accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash by undercover FBI agents in an investigation the Trump Justice Department later closed, The New York Times reported Saturday.
    


            The September 2024 payment arose from a probe that was not targeting Homan, The Times reported, citing people familiar with the case. Homan was investigated for potential bribery and other crimes after he agreed to help the undercover agents, posing as businessmen, secure government contracts in a second Trump administration, the report says.
    


            A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Homan accepted a cash payment in a sting operation.
    


            The cash was inside a bag from the fast-casual chain Cava, The Times reported. MSNBC first reported on the investigation.
    


            Investigators began looking into Homan after the original target of a case suggested that a payment to Homan could lead to federal border security contracts, The Times reported. On the tape of the September 2024 meeting, The New York Times reported, Homan appeared to agree to help the undercover agents win contracts if Donald Trump won reelection.
    


            The DOJ shut down the case after Trump began his second term this year, over doubts prosecutors could prove Homan — who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the president's first term — had agreed to a specific act in exchange for the cash and because he was not in a government position at the time.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the matter, which originated under the Biden administration, was subject to a full review by officials with the FBI and DOJ, who “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.”
    


            “The Department's resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed,” they said in a statement Saturday.
    


            CNN has attempted to reach Homan for comment. He told CNN affiliate WWNY in Carthage, New York, on Sunday that there's “nothing to it” when asked about reports of the investigation.
    


            Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, slammed the matter as a “blatantly political investigation” and called Homan “a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant.”
    


            “This blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using its resources to target President Trump's allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country,” she said in a Saturday statement.
    


            A career law enforcement officer, Homan served as the public face of the first Trump administration's aggressive efforts to step up immigration enforcement before retiring in 2018.
    


            After leaving government, he became a Fox News contributor. He also contributed to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president, which Trump distanced himself from during his campaign.
    


            In a sign of his influence in Trump's orbit, Homan addressed the Republican National Convention in July 2024. Speaking from the stage in Milwaukee, Homan warned immigrants who “Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law: You better start packing now. You're damn right.”
    


            Less than a week after Trump won reelection, he announced Homan would serve as his administration's border czar.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will award Ben Carson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the third such award he's announced this month.

“Congratulations, Ben. He didn't know this,” Trump said in a speech during an event at Mount Vernon for American Cornerstone Institute, founded by Carson. “He didn't know it. I hope he's happy.”

A former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Carson, 74, went on to serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration. 

The one-time rivals developed a strong bond, and Carson — seen at one point as among the top contenders for Trump's running mate in the 2024 campaign — served as Trump's national faith chairman during last year's race. 

A staunch social conservative who has opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage, Carson has become a popular conservative speaker and author.

The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors.

Trump bestowed the honor on 24 people during his first term and has already announced two other recipients since his return to the White House. Trump mentioned no date for giving the honor to Carson, but other honorees are already in the pipeline.




Earlier this month, Trump said he would bestow the award on former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, two days after his longtime political ally was seriously injured in a car crash.

During a Sept. 11 commemoration event at the Pentagon, Trump announced that he would posthumously give the award to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month and whose memorial service Trump plans to attend Sunday in Arizona.

Former President Barack Obama responded to ABC's decision to indefinitely take Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air and warned of "government coercion."

"After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like," Obama said in a post on X.

"This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it," he said in a response.

Washington has largely split along party lines in the wake of ABC's shocking suspension of the late-night host on Wednesday following Kimmel's comments on the shooting of Charlie Kirk.

The Jimmy Kimmel fallout is ramping up. Get caught up here:



President Donald Trump and his allies have praised the network's decision to "indefinitely" suspend Kimmel after Carr, a Trump appointee, pressured Disney before local TV stations revolted, and ultimately, ABC took action.

"We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. "These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."

In contrast, Democrats are aghast, saying that Kimmel's suspension is an affront to the First Amendment. Like Hollywood, many in the party are rallying around the host.

On Thursday, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a lengthy letter to Carr, calling his actions "corrupt political intimidation," and asking for the FCC to turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, the affiliated TV station operator, starting from January 20.

"The Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) apparent weaponization of its federal regulatory authority and ABC's preemption of programming that may be critical of President Trump represents a dangerous escalation in attacks on press freedom and protected speech," the Committee wrote in the five-page letter signed by Rep. Robert Garcia.

Trump celebrated the suspension of Kimmel's show shortly after the news broke — and he called on NBC to do the same with Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon.

"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," Trump said in a Truth Social post. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT."

At a press conference alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday morning, Trump doubled down.

"You can call that free speech or not," Trump said. "He was fired for lack of talent."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Kimmel's suspension "outrageous."

"It's a page right out of Xi's playbook. This is just despicable, disgusting, and against democratic values," Schumer said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday night. "Trump and his allies seem to want to shut down speech that they don't like to hear. That is not what democracies do. That is what autocracies do."

Vice President JD Vance has not yet directly weighed in on Kimmel's suspension, but on Thursday morning, he made a joke about it.

"Everyone please congratulate @marcorubio, the new host of ABC's late night show," Vance wrote on X.

Marco Rubio holds several jobs in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and Acting Archivist of the United States.

He's been the subject of several jokes about holding multiple jobs, and has occasionally made light of it himself.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Democratic leadership released a joint statement condemning ABC's move and calling on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to resign for engaging "in the corrupt abuse of power."

"He has disgraced the office he holds by bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration," the group of lawmakers said.

The lawmakers also signalled that they could use subpoena power to investigate the incident the next time they're in the majority.

"Media companies, such as the one that suspended Mr. Kimmel, have a lot to explain," the lawmakers continued. "The censoring of artists and cancellation of shows is an act of cowardice. It may also be part of a corrupt pay-to-play scheme. House Democrats will make sure the American people learn the truth, even if that requires the relentless unleashing of congressional subpoena power. This will not be forgotten."

The statement was co-signed by Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu, Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, and Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Carr is "a great guy," but the way he pressured Disney "is dangerous as hell."

"He says, 'We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way,'" Cruz said during an episode of his podcast "Verdict" that was released on September 19. "And I got to say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it."

Cruz is not a fan of Kimmel, whom he once defeated in a charity basketball game. The former GOP presidential hopeful said he's worried about Carr's actions could backfire on conservatives if Democrats retake the White House.

"They will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly."

Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, is spearheading an investigation into the FCC, ABC, and Sinclair over the incident.

On September 18, Garcia signed a letter requesting the FCC turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, starting from Trump's inauguration day. The deadline to turn over these documents is October 2.

"Every American has a duty to stand up for our First Amendment values," Garcia said. "We will not be silent as our freedoms are threatened by corrupt schemes and threats. Anyone who is complicit will need to answer to us."

"We stand ready to work with any media organization willing to resist any attempts of unlawful coercion of editorial decisions and expose any abuse of federal authority to suppress constitutionally protected speech," wrote Garcia in the letter.

Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah praised Carr in the wake of Kimmel's suspension.

"Sic semper tyrannis," Lee wrote. "Great work by @BrendanCarrFCC."

He added a hashtag: #BuhByeJimmyKimmel.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Republican Party of engaging in censorship after Kimmel's suspension.

"Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows," Newsom wrote. "These aren't coincidences. It's coordinated. And it's dangerous. The @GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time."

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana indicated that he was supportive of Kimmel's suspension.

"The liberal media is finally catching up to where the rest of the country is," Cassidy wrote on X. "We love Charlie Kirk. We don't like dishonest brokers."

Cassidy has a history with Kimmel, dating back to when Republicans unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, during Trump's first term.

Kimmel invited Cassidy onto his show in May 2017, where Cassidy pledged to develop legislation to ensure that families had access to affordable healthcare. Kimmel later attacked Cassidy's bill, which led to a simmering feud.

Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a moderate Republican, said he was uncomfortable with Kimmel's suspension in an appearance on C-SPAN Washington Journal on Thursday morning.

"I think it would have been better just to shame him," Bacon said. "People have a right to listen to what they want. If they don't like it, don't listen to it. I get a little worried about this cancel culture that we have."

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut went directly after Carr after the FCC chair praised Nexstar for pulling Kimmel off the air, which preceded ABC's decision.

"This is a massive, history making abuse of your power," Murphy wrote on X. "It will define your legacy and one day you will come to regret punishing free speech and trying to destroy democracy."

Taylor Budowich, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, cheered on Kimmel's suspension.

"Welcome to Consequence Culture," Budowich wrote. "Normal, common sense Americans are no longer taking the bullshit and companies like ABC are finally willing to do the right and reasonable thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested that the FCC played a key role in Kimmel's suspension — and that media companies are to blame as well.

"Last-minute settlements, secret side deals, multi-billion dollar mergers pending Donald Trump's approval," Warren wrote on X. "Trump silencing free speech stifles our democracy. It sure looks like giant media companies are enabling his authoritarianism."

Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democrat and frequent Trump critic, said that if Democrats retake the House, they will investigate matters like this.

"There's going to be a Democratic majority in just over a year," Swalwell said during a hearing on Thursday. "And to the FCC chairperson and anyone involved in these dirty deals, get a lawyer and save your records, because you're going to be in this room."

During an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press," Sen. Rand Paul called Carr's remarks suggesting that the FCC would take action against Disney-owned ABC "absolutely inappropriate."

"Brendan Carr's got no business weighing in on this, but people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don't have the right to employment," he said. "Virtually everybody employed, probably including yourself, has a code of conduct in your contract that you have to adhere to."

Paul said networks are entitled to pull content they don't agree with.

"The FCC should have nothing to do with it, but I do think a couple of networks pulled out. Sinclair pulled out — they were disgusted by the comments. That's their right."

He added, "But the government's got no business in it and the FCC was wrong to weigh in."

Elon Musk's xAI has designed its Grok chatbot to be deliberately provocative. It has a flirtatious female avatar that can strip on command, a chatbot that toggles between "sexy" and "unhinged" modes, and an image and video generation feature with a "spicy" setting.

The workers who train xAI's chatbot have seen firsthand what it means to carry out this vision. In conversations with more than 30 current and former workers across a variety of projects, 12 told Business Insider they encountered sexually explicit material — including instances of user requests for AI-generated child sexual abuse content (CSAM).

Sexual material and CSAM crop up across nearly every major tech platform, but experts say xAI has made explicit content part of Grok's DNA in ways that set it apart. Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, which largely block sexual requests, xAI's strategy could complicate things when it comes to preventing the chatbot from generating CSAM.

"If you don't draw a hard line at anything unpleasant, you will have a more complex problem with more gray areas," Riana Pfefferkorn, a tech policy researcher at Stanford University, told Business Insider.

Business Insider verified the existence of multiple written requests for CSAM from what appeared to be Grok users, including requests for short stories that depicted minors in sexually explicit situations and requests for pornographic images involving children. In some cases, Grok had produced an image or written story containing CSAM, the workers said.

Workers said that they're told to select a button on an internal system to flag CSAM or other illegal content so that it can be quarantined and to prevent the AI model from learning how to generate the restricted content. More recently, workers have been told they should also alert their manager.

Many workers, including the 12 who said they encountered NSFW content, said they signed various agreements consenting to exposure to sensitive material. The agreements covered projects geared toward adult content and general projects that involved annotating Grok's overall image generation or text generation capabilities, as explicit content could pop up at random.

One document reviewed by Business Insider said that workers might encounter the following content: "Media content depicting pre-pubescent minors victimized in a sexual act, pornographic images and/or child exploitation; Media content depicting moment-of-death of an individual," and written descriptions of sexual and physical abuse, hate speech, violent threats, and graphic images.

Fallon McNulty, executive director at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Business Insider that companies focused on sexual content need to take extra care when it comes to preventing CSAM on their platforms.

"If a company is creating a model that allows nudity or sexually explicit generations, that is much more nuanced than a model that has hard rules," she said. "They have to take really strong measures so that absolutely nothing related to children can come out."

It's unclear whether the volume of NSFW content or CSAM increased after xAI introduced its "Unhinged" and "Sexy" Grok voice functions in February. Like other AI firms, xAI tries to prevent AI-generated CSAM. Business Insider was unable to determine whether xAI data annotators review more such material than their counterparts at OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta.

Musk has previously called the removal of child sexual exploitation material his "priority #1" when discussing platform safety for X.

The team that trains Grok has had a tumultuous month. Over 500 workers were laid off; several high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated; and the company appears to be moving away from generalists toward more specialized hires. It's not clear if the shifting structure of the team will change its training protocols. Musk recently posted on X that training for Grok 5 will begin "in a few weeks."

Representatives for xAI and X, which merged with xAI this past March, did not respond to a request for comment.

XAI's tutors review and annotate hundreds of images, videos, and audio files to improve Grok's performance and make the chatbot's output more realistic and humanlike. Like content moderators for platforms like YouTube or Facebook, AI tutors often see the worst of the internet.

"You have to have thick skin to work here, and even then it doesn't feel good," a former worker said. They said they quit this year over concerns about the amount of CSAM they encountered.

Some tutors told Business Insider that NSFW content has been difficult to avoid on the job, whether their tasks involve annotating images, short stories, or audio. Projects originally intended to improve Grok's tone and realism were at times overtaken by user demand for sexually explicit content, they said.

XAI has asked for workers willing to read semi-pornographic scripts, three people said. The company has also asked for people with expertise in porn or for people willing to work with adult content, five people said.

Shortly after the February release of Grok's voice function — which includes "sexy" and "unhinged" versions — workers began transcribing the chatbot's conversations with real-life users, some of which are explicit in nature, as part of a program internally referred to as "Project Rabbit," workers said.

Hundreds of tutors were brought into Project Rabbit. It briefly ended this spring, but temporarily returned with the release of Grok companions, including a highly sexualized character named "Ani," and a Grok app for some Tesla owners. The project appeared to come to an end in August, two people said.

The workers with knowledge of the project said it was initially intended to improve the chatbot's voice capabilities, and the number of sexual or vulgar requests quickly turned it into an NSFW project.

"It was supposed to be a project geared toward teaching Grok how to carry on an adult conversation," one of the workers said. "Those conversations can be sexual, but they're not designed to be solely sexual."

"I listened to some pretty disturbing things. It was basically audio porn. Some of the things people asked for were things I wouldn't even feel comfortable putting in Google," said a former employee who worked on Project Rabbit.

"It made me feel like I was eavesdropping," they added, "like people clearly didn't understand that there's people on the other end listening to these things."

Project Rabbit was split into two teams called "Rabbit" and "Fluffy." The latter was designed to be more child-friendly and teach Grok how to communicate with children, two workers said. Musk has said the company plans to release a child-friendly AI companion.

Another worker who was assigned to an image-based initiative called "Project Aurora" said the overall content, particularly some of the images they had to review, made them feel "disgusting."

Two former workers said the company held a meeting about the number of requests for CSAM in the image training project. During the meeting, xAI told tutors the requests were coming from real-life Grok users, the workers said.

"It actually made me sick," one former worker said. "Holy shit, that's a lot of people looking for that kind of thing."

Employees can opt out of any project or choose to skip an inappropriate image or clip, and one former worker said that higher-ups have said workers would not be penalized for choosing to avoid a project.

Earlier this year, several hundred employees opted out of "Project Skippy," which required employees to record videos of themselves and grant the company access to use of their likeness, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.

Still, before the mass opt-outs of Project Skippy, six workers said that declining to participate in projects could be difficult. They said it required them to reject assignments from their team lead, which they worried could result in termination.

Four other former workers said the company's human resources team narrowed the flexibility for opting out in an announcement on Slack earlier this year.

As a consequence of the AI boom, regulators have seen an uptick in reports of AI-generated content involving child sexual abuse, and it has become a growing issue across the industry. Lawmakers are figuring out how to address a variety of AI-generated content, whether it's purely fictional content or an individual using AI to alter real-life images of children, Pfefferkorn, the Stanford researcher, said.

In an ongoing class action complaint against Scale AI — which provides training and data annotation services to major tech firms like Alphabet and Meta — workers accused the company of violating federal worker safety laws by subjecting contractors to distressing content. In 2023, Time reported that OpenAI was using data annotators in Kenya to review content that included depictions of violent acts and CSAM. Spokespeople for OpenAI and Meta said the companies don't allow content that harms children on their platforms.

Many AI companies have safety teams that perform a task called "red teaming," a process dedicated to pushing AI models to the limit to guard against malicious actors that could prompt the chatbots to generate illegal content, from bomb-making guides to pornographic content involving minors. In April, xAI posted several roles that involved red teaming.

Allowing an AI model to train off illegal material would be risky, Dani Pinter, senior vice president and director of the Law Center for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, told Business Insider. "For training reasons alone, they should be very cautious about letting that type of content in their machine learning portal," Pinter said, adding that it's important the chatbots are trained not to spit back CSAM in response to user requests.

"The drum we're beating right now is, it's time to practice corporate responsibility and implementing safety with innovation," Pinter said. "Companies can't be recklessly innovating without safety, especially with tools that can involve children."

NCMEC said in a blog published early September that it began tracking reports of AI-generated CSAM in 2023 from social media sites and saw a surge in reports from AI companies last year. Companies are strongly encouraged to report these requests to the agency, even if the content doesn't depict real children. The Department of Justice has already started pursuing cases involving AI-generated CSAM.

In 2024, OpenAI reported more than 32,000 instances of CSAM to NCMEC, and Anthropic reported 971.

Spokespeople for Anthropic and OpenAI told Business Insider that the companies don't allow CSAM and have strict policies in place to prevent it.

XAI did not file any reports in 2024, according to the organization. NCMEC told Business Insider it has not received any reports from xAI so far this year. It said it has received reports of potentially AI-generated CSAM from X Corp.

NCMEC said it received about 67,000 reports involving generative AI in 2024, compared with 4,700 the year before. In the blog published last week, the organization said it had already received 440,419 reports of AI-generated CSAM as of June 30, compared with 5,976 during the same period in 2024.

President Donald Trump and prominent members of his "Make America Great Again" movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere.

The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.

"We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today," Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. "It will be a tough day."

Kirk's assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.

The service will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals west of Phoenix, where Kirk's Turning Point organization is based. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event.

Members of the public began lining up outside the stadium before dawn to secure a spot, several hours before the start of the service. The lower bowl of the stadium quickly filled with mourners dressed in red, white a blue, as organizers suggested.

The stadium had the feel of a megachurch service. Floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands playing on stage as the crowds filed in. Many stood and sang along.

"I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference," said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. "He deserves us to be here."

Trump has blamed the "radical left" for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.

He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised "the life and legacy" of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday.

"Who could vote against that? All (Republicans) were saying was 'Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'" Trump told reporters. "And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that.'"

Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk's death.

ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air indefinitely following backlash from affiliated broadcasters and the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian's remarks about Kirk.

The State Department has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.

A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he "had enough" of Kirk's hatred.

Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.

The crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk's memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.

"I think he spoke on more than just politics," said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. "Now that he's gone, it's like who's gonna speak for us now?"

His impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.

Kirk "was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them," Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. "But he never stopped smiling, never stopped respecting his interlocutor and anyone who challenged him."

Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader.

Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.

Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president.

Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak.

Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes.

Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that "the movement my husband built will not die."

On Friday, the White House announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, sparking a wave of confusion and panic as companies and workers scrambled to make sense of the order.

Three tech workers from across the US explained how they spent Friday night and Saturday.

Two spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking to the media; Business Insider has verified their identities.

I studied engineering back home in India and got recruited into a US-based tech company straight out of college.

After working at the company's Indian operations for about three years, I was given the opportunity to transfer to the US because I was one of the few people familiar with the technology and their customers.

I received my H-1B right away and moved to the US in 2013.

The green card backlog for Indian-born applicants has kept me on an H-1B for 12 years, with no clear end in sight.

I first saw the news that the president had signed a proclamation for a $100,000 H-1B visa fee on Friday.

The last 36 hours have felt like being on call for a production outage, except the system being debugged is my career.

At first, it wasn't clear whether this applied to new H-1B applications, renewals, or even H-4 dependents, such as my wife. I was also worried about who would have to pay the fees — employees or their companies — and if firms would be willing or able to pay this fee for thousands of H-1B workers.

I have been constantly checking YouTube, LinkedIn, and the White House official channels for clearer instructions.

Many companies have already advised employees to avoid travel, and some friends who were abroad on H-1Bs have even been asked to return before September 21st.

I saw my friends who were visiting India book last-minute flights to get back to the US after calls with their human resource teams. Everyone was stressed about them not being able to come back to the US.

I was planning to travel to India for vacation, but I need to rethink that because of the uncertainty around whether current visa stampings will be impacted.

My sister, who recently gave birth, also planned to travel soon, but canceled her trip this weekend. She would have been flying back with my mother, who was visiting us, and I had to scramble to find someone who could make the trip back to India with our mom.

The White House's update that it would only impact people in the next lottery cycle brought a lot of relief.

The anxiety of this weekend and the lack of a clear pathway to a more permanent residency are now making us rethink things.

We might decide that if it's getting harder to live on the H-1B, it's better to go back to our home country rather than being stressed out in the US.

I moved from India to the US a decade ago to pursue a master's in engineering. I've been with my current company since graduating from the program.

I received my H-1B visa on my third try in the lottery. I was anxious leading up to it and had already started exploring what my fallback options could be.

I found out about the new White House order on the H-1B visa on Friday from friends who began checking up on me and whether the new rules would affect me.

I opened ChatGPT and asked what exactly the order was, what criteria of H-1B holders it affected, and if there were any changes to alternative visas like the E-B1 or E-B2. More than H-1B, I was hoping there were no changes to the green card routes.

I was planning a holiday in a couple of months, but I've punted planning that trip and buying tickets. It doesn't make sense for me to book something and then not be allowed to travel.

The White House's clarification about how the new rules only apply to new applicants was definitely relieving.

After years in the US, my spouse and I have the mindset of not letting these changes affect us too much. We say that if we're here temporarily, let's make the most of it and continue to grow in our careers by making ourselves more indispensable.

But in the past year, I've started to explore ways I can build a more credible profile so that I qualify for more expedited green card options.

Since the administration changed, I've also been making sure we are renewing our documents and getting our passport stampings done proactively and not waiting until the last minute.

It's made me feel the pain of new graduates and how difficult it would be for them to come to the US, pay off student loans, and get an opportunity to find an employer that would be supportive of them working here.

That will be a big challenge, at least for the next 12 months, but I'm hoping people are still supportive of the highly skilled talent that comes through.

I came to the US in 2018 to pursue my master's in computer engineering.

I was fortunate enough to get my H-1B visa on my first attempt when I was still in graduate school.

Even though I did not move from India with the expectation to stay in the US long term, I felt relieved to get the visa and thought it gave me an option to stay longer if I wanted.

I've worked for multiple Big Tech companies since graduating and am currently a software engineer at a tech firm based in Silicon Valley.

It's been a tough 36 hours.

I was wrapping up work on a Friday evening and solving a client issue when a friend called and started telling me about what was going on.

I instantly started Googling and reading about it, trying to figure out what exactly had happened.

I was troubled because I am going through an H-1B extension right now, and I thought I would be impacted.

I spoke to my wife, who was out of town for the weekend, and we decided she should not travel back to India for her visa stamping. We're waiting for things to cool down before booking any tickets.

After our call, I was frustrated, so I went to play pickleball with my friends to work out some of those emotions.

I came home to a call from my mom back in India. My parents heard the news, and they asked me what was going on and why I didn't just leave the US and work somewhere else. I told them we should wait for things to settle down before making a big decision.

My friends, most of whom work at Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft, are all in the same boat. At dinner after the game, we chatted about the new order and what we should do.

That night, I watched webinars from immigration and employment lawyers to try to make sense of the proclamation. I told myself that there was not much I could do right now besides going to sleep.

New guidance from the immigration authority about existing H-1B holders has made me feel like I'm off the hook, but my wife and I are still waiting for more confirmation before making travel plans.

My reason to come to the US was that it's the heart of innovation. But I was doing well in my previous role in India before I came for my master's, and I've been thinking about whether it makes sense to live here long term.

I've started thinking about options such as the Global Talent visa in the UK or opportunities in Singapore.

Being in Silicon Valley is rewarding from a work perspective, because the people here are at the top of their game, but now it feels like, is it really worth it?

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway has completely exited its extremely profitable equity investment in the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD.

In August 2022, Berkshire began to reduce the 225 million share position it had purchased in 2008 for $230 million.

That followed a 41% jump in the value of the position during that year's second quarter to $9 billion.

By June of last year, Berkshire had sold almost 76% of its stake, bringing it just under 5% of BYD's outstanding shares.

By crossing below that level, Berkshire no longer had to disclose subsequent sales under the Hong Kong exchange's rules, so as far as we knew the company owned 54 million shares.

A Buffett Watch reader, however, pointed out that the Q1 financial filing by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the subsidiary that held the shares, listed the value of the investment as zero as of March 31.

A Berkshire spokesperson confirmed that the entire BYD position has indeed been sold.

Based on the investment values listed in BHE's reports, the sales continued after the stake fell below 5% last year.

Berkshire made its initial purchase 17 years ago at the urging of Charlie Munger.

At the 2009 annual meeting, he told shareholders that even though it looked like "Warren and I have gone crazy," he saw the company and its CEO, Wang Chuanfu, as a "damn miracle."

It was an incredible call. BYD shares increased by roughly 3890% during the years Berkshire owned them.

Buffett has not explained in detail why Berkshire started selling, but, in 2023, he told CNBC's Becky Quick that BYD is an "extraordinary company" being run by an "extraordinary person," but "I think that we'll find things to do with the money that I'll feel better about."

Around the same time, Berkshire sold almost all of the company's Taiwan Semiconductor stake, roughly $4 billion of stock, just months after the shares were purchased as he "reevaluated" the geopolitical risk posed by Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China. "It's a dangerous world," he said.

Warren Buffett has not been speaking publicly in the last few years about his generally liberal political views, telling shareholders in 2022 that some people get "sustainably mad" and "take it out on our companies," potentially harming employees and shareholders.

It is, however, reasonable to assume that he doesn't see eye-to-eye on most issues with President Donald Trump.

But they do agree, at least partially, on one thing: U.S. businesses should not chase very short-term goals.

This week, the president posted on Truth Social that the SEC should allow corporations to report earnings every six months, instead of the current three-month requirement.

"This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies," he wrote.

The SEC tells CNBC it is "prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies."

Buffett, who famously favors making decisions for the long run, has strongly urged companies to stop providing quarterly earnings-per-share guidance.

A 2018 Wall Street Journal opinion piece co-written by JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon says, "In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability."

That happens, they said, when companies cut back on long-term beneficial spending to meet or beat their own short-term forecasts when earnings are affected by outside factors they can't control.

They argue that "financial markets have become too focused on the short term" and quarterly guidance "is a major driver of this trend."

There is, however, an important distinction.

Buffett and Dimon stress they are not against the reporting of earnings every quarter. They just don't like companies forecasting what those earnings will be.

Companies, they said, should "continue to provide annual and quarterly reporting that offers a retrospective look at actual performance so that the public, including shareholders and other stakeholders, can reliably assess real progress."

iPhone Air is the big newcomer among Apple's latest lineup that went on sale Friday, but inside the slim phone's raised plateau is another new piece of hardware that signals a renewed focus on artificial intelligence. 

Apple's custom A19 Pro chip introduces a major architecture change, with neural accelerators added to each GPU core to increase compute power. Apple also debuted its first ever wireless chip for iPhone, the N1, and a second generation of its iPhone modem, the C1X. It's a move analysts say gives Apple control of all the core chips in its phones.

"That's where the magic is. When we have control, we are able to do things beyond what we can do by buying a merchant silicon part," said Tim Millet, Apple vice president of platform architecture. He sat down with CNBC at Apple Park in September for the first U.S. interview about the new chips.

Until now, Broadcom was the main provider of wireless and bluetooth chips for iPhones, although Apple has made networking chips for the AirPods and Apple Watch for nearly a decade. Apple's N1 is in the entire iPhone 17 lineup and the iPhone Air.

Arun Mathias, Apple vice president of wireless software technologies and ecosystems, gave CNBC an example of the N1's improved Wi-Fi functionality. 

"One of the things people may not realize is that your Wi-Fi access points actually contribute to your device's awareness of location, so you don't need to use GPS, which actually costs more from a power perspective," Mathias said. "By being able to do this more seamlessly in the background, not needing to wake up the application processor as much, we can do that significantly more efficiently."

For iPhone modems, Qualcomm has been the sole provider since 2020. That changed in February when Apple unveiled the C1 in the iPhone 16e. It's a plan first set in motion in 2019, with Apple's purchase of Intel's modem business for $1 billion. Qualcomm has long warned investors of the coming change. 

Qualcomm modems remain in the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, but Apple's C1X is in the iPhone Air. 

"It may not be as good as Qualcomm's yet, in terms of just overall throughput and performance, but they can control it and they can make it run at lower power. So you're going to get better battery life," said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies, a technology research and consulting firm. He expects Apple to "completely phase out" Qualcomm in the "next couple of years."

Apple's Mathias said the C1X is "up to twice as fast" as the C1 and "uses 30% less energy" than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro.

Neither Qualcomm or Broadcom saw much market impact following Apple's announcement, and both companies will maintain licensing deals with Apple for certain core technologies.

Apple's three new chips come amid increasing pressure from Wall Street about the company's AI strategy.

"They probably won't ever have their own Apple model like Google or OpenAI," Bajarin said. "They're still going to run those services on iPhone, right? They want the iPhone to be the best place for developers to run their AI."

Apple has been making its own system on a chip, or SoC, since the A series launched with the iPhone 4 in 2010. The latest generation A19 Pro has a new chip architecture that prioritizes AI workloads, adding neural accelerators to the GPU cores.

"We are building the best on-device AI capability that anyone else has," Millet told CNBC. "Right now we are focused on making sure that these phones that we're shipping today, or shipping soon, will be capable of all the important on-device AI workloads that are coming."

Privacy is a major reason Apple is prioritizing on-device AI, but Millet said there's another reason, too. 

"It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience," he said. 

One "built-in AI" feature Millet highlighted is the new front camera that uses AI to detect a new face and automatically switches to taking a horizontal photo. "It's leveraging a full complement of almost all the capabilities in the A19 Pro," Millet said.

Apple's original AI hardware, its Neural Engine, was first unveiled back in 2017. It was barely mentioned at the launch. Instead, it's all about adding compute power to the GPUs. 

"The integration of the neural processing is reaching MacBook Pro class performance inside an iPhone," Millet said. "It's a big, big step forward in ML compute. And so when you look inside the Neural Engine, for example, you have a lot of dense matrix math. We didn't have that capability in our GPU. But now we do with A19 Pro."

Bajarin told CNBC that Apple's neural accelerators may work similarly to the tensor cores on Nvidia's AI chips, such as the H100.

"We're integrating neural processing in a way that allows someone who's writing a program to one of those small processors, extending the instruction set so they have a new class of computer that they have access to right there, and they can switch back and forth between 3D-rendering instructions and neural-processing instructions, all seamlessly inside the same microprogram," Millet said.

Apple's previous generation A19 SoC is in the base model iPhone 17, while the A19 Pro is in the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 and 17 Pro Max.

Following overheating issues in the iPhone 15, a new "vapor chamber" in the Pro models keeps the custom chips cool.

"It's actually positioned in concert with where the system on a chip, the A19 Pro is positioned," said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing. "We think about how that all goes together, including with that forged unibody aluminum design, which is incredibly thermally conductive so that we can effectively dissipate heat with the vapor chamber, with where it's positioned with our chip. And it's even laser welded into it, which creates a metallic bond which also helps dissipate heat."

Apple still relies on others for smaller components, like Samsung for memory and Texas Instruments for analog chips. All bigger core chips, however, may be Apple-designed in every iPhone as soon as next year, according to Bajarin.

"We expect that there would be modems coming to Mac. We would expect there's modems coming to iPad. There's probably N variants of the networking chip coming to Mac," Bajarin said. "I think over the course of the next few years, it will be on all of the portfolio."

When CNBC asked Apple's Millet if neural accelerators will be in the GPU cores of M5, the next anticipated SoC for Mac, he said, "We have a unified approach to architecture."

The iPhone maker plans to manufacture at least some of its custom chips in the U.S., at facilities like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's new campus in Arizona, where CNBC got a tour of the first completed fab.

Apple's A19 Pro is made at the leading edge of TSMC's 3-nanometer node. While TSMC is working toward 3nm production in Arizona by 2028, it's not there yet.

"If you need to be on the leading edge, it's going to be Taiwan for the time being," Bajarin said. 

In August, Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips from companies not making domestically. That same day, Apple increased its U.S. spending commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. CEO Tim Cook said part of that will go toward creating an "end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America."

"There's really a question of what part of tariffs impact the silicon supply chain," Bajarin said. "This is obviously why Apple and Tim Cook are on their mission and out there talking about investing in America."

As part of that plan, Bajain said Apple could give struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel "serious consideration if 14A really does deliver on all of its promises." Although, he added, it's "going to be awhile" before Intel "becomes a viable option."

For now, Apple is committed to making chips at TSMC Arizona.

"We are super excited about TSMC's push into U.S. manufacturing. Obviously it will help us from a time zone perspective, and we also appreciate that the diversity of the supply is also really important," Millet said.

When asked if he knows how much of Apple's $600 billion U.S. spend will go toward custom silicon, Millet said, "I hope it's a lot."

When my husband and I met, we were both in law school in Washington, DC. We had each moved there for school. Neither of us had any ties to the city, and before we met, neither of us expected to stay there after graduation.

Before we got married in 2002, we discussed moving back to my hometown of Philadelphia, PA, or his hometown of St. Paul, MN, to be closer to family. However, we quickly realized that if we left DC, our job opportunities would be limited. Since we had both spent years in higher education and incurred significant debt to earn our degrees, launching our careers was at the forefront of our minds.

Although my husband and I both wanted children, we knew we wouldn't have them right away, and allowing family to take a backseat to work seemed like the right choice at the time. After we earned our diplomas, we both got jobs we liked and settled into life in DC for the long haul. But things didn't work out the way I had planned.

After my first child was born, my priorities started to shift. My daughter was born with multiple disabilities and complex medical needs. Caring for her and working a 9-to-5 job wasn't feasible. Additionally, not knowing whether she would live until her first birthday prompted me to reevaluate how I wanted to live my life.

Although I loved my job, my career was no longer the most crucial thing in my life. I wound up leaving my position as a full-time attorney and pieced together several part-time and freelance jobs I could do from home instead.

My husband was thriving in his career, and one parent having a stable job with a steady income was more important than ever with a disabled child. Moreover, by the time my daughter was born, I had established a full life in DC.

We owned a home I loved, and had close friends who became a support system. My husband and I once again briefly considered moving to be closer to family, but it still didn't seem like the best idea for us. We decided to stay where we were settled, and my husband's career trajectory seemed much more promising.

My husband and I went on to have three more children. After each child's birth, we once again discussed moving back to Philadelphia or St. Paul, but with every passing year, leaving DC seemed more difficult, especially if it meant starting over with a new job.

Now that my kids, now aged 10 through 19, and my parents, now in their mid-70s, are older, I think we made a mistake in deciding to raise my children far away from any family. Since I left traditional employment just a few years after graduation, it's clear that my career would not have suffered from living somewhere without as many job opportunities. My husband may have wound up with a very different career trajectory in Philadelphia or St. Paul, but I think the trade-off would have been worth it.

I love the life we built in DC, and my children are happy. We take advantage of all the city has to offer, from a seemingly endless number of free museums to a vast national park. Still, I often think about how much they missed out on by not growing up close to cousins, grandparents, and a big extended family that loves them. The chaos of life means that visits were not nearly as frequent as I had hoped they would be. Selfishly, I also realize that my life would have been easier if I lived near family who could help when life seems overwhelming or babysit for a night out with my husband.

Guilt also crept in when my father got cancer and my mother developed health challenges of her own. My parents needed help too, but leaving my four kids who needed me made frequent or extended visits impossible. My father passed away a few months ago, and I will always regret that I couldn't spend more time with him when he was sick. Now, my mother is older and alone, and I wish I could help her more.

Although I've tried to devise a plan, it seems impossible to dismantle our lives in DC and move. However, if I could go back and do things over, I would choose being closer to family over better job opportunities.

Steve Jobs lived simply in 1982. All the Apple cofounder said he needed was "a cup of tea, a light, and your stereo." Forty years later, not much has changed for the next generation of young founders.

While the AI boom is sending millions in venture funding to 20-something entrepreneurs, many still aren't buying furniture. 

Spartan living is common. Some live on mattresses in the office, while others keep their apartments' clutter to a minimum.

Six young tech founders gave Business Insider a glimpse into their apartments — take a peek inside:

ThirdLayer operates out of a live/work-zoned loft that was previously occupied by another Y Combinator startup. Their landlord, it turned out, was their investor. The desks and kitchen are on the main floor; up and down the stairs, you'll find beds.

In the kitchen, the sink was full of dishes because everyone likes to "sit and work" and not "do chores," per 22-year-old cofounder Regina Lin. They have plastic utensils and rarely cook.

"This stack of ramen used to be a lot bigger," Lin said, pointing to a tower of different instant noodle brands. "It was very high."

Next to the kitchen is their common area, where they film social videos, store their prop gimmicks, and often house overnight guests. Lin said that she sleeps there from 4 to 7 a.m., "and then I escape to my bedroom before anyone in the morning comes and sees me passed out there."

The floor is filled with standing desks. Lin's desk is littered with Blue Bottle cups; she said that she usually has at least four. Affixed to one desk is a bed for their cat, Tobi. Lin thought a cat would be "good for company culture."

ThirdLayer has beds both upstairs and downstairs. Julia Alvarenga, ThirdLayer's intern, got the most prized room downstairs: a storage closet. The company's design engineer also lives there, and they outfit the downstairs couch as a bed when remote employees visit.

The founders sleep upstairs. Lin sleeps in a king-size bed; she said she wanted a smaller mattress so that they could fit more, but it was too big to get out the door. Her cofounder, Kevin Gu, sleeps on a couch just feet away.

"Everyone in the house is just right next to each other all the time," Lin said.

The room has a closet, though it doesn't have any racks to hang clothes. Lin suspects that it was built as a room to take calls. The founders leave their suitcases in there, and Lin also stacks her clothes in a large plastic bin next to her bed.

The upstairs bathroom is small. If Lin wants to do her makeup or get ready for the day, she'll go downstairs to the bigger common bathroom, she said.

25-year-old Docket cofounder Boris Skurikhin's mattress is on the floor.

His makeshift nightstand is a short cardboard box, on which he stacked his computer and a biography of physicist Andrei Sakharov. His clothes are folded and stacked against the room's windows.

"We moved here very, very quickly from New York," he said. "We started the YC batch that following Monday, and we were build mode, we were think mode. Furniture was not that important."

Skurikhin doesn't like clutter; he says the almost empty room allows him to walk around and think.

The living room has two desks, his and his cofounder's. He doesn't use the desk much, since the office is within walking distance. The "most interesting part," he said, was a piece of paper with the cofounders' three tenets stuck to the wall with some packing tape:

In their doorway is a small "conversational table" where Skurikhin sometimes eats lunch or dinner. He doesn't touch the kitchen much, he said, though he's proud of his tea collection.

Every time 28-year-old Nectir founder Kavitta Ghai has a "mental block" at her Los Angeles apartment, she uproots to an Airbnb where her team can meet her. Now she's in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood; she especially liked the spot because of its record player.

Ghai does not have time to cook food — "DoorDash is my best friend," she said — but keeps some supplies on hand for when she hosts friends or hackathons.

In her living room, Ghai is playing meditative music — something she "always" has on.

"Does it work? I don't know," she said. "I must set the vibes of the house. The candle has to be on. I'll wake up in the morning and walk around with my incense."

The Airbnb also has a small patio, one of Ghai's non-negotiables: "I need to be able to walk outside on days when I'm working for 12 hours."

The porch is also an ideal spot to sit out and have a coffee in the morning, or to smoke a joint, she said.

Ghai's desk is not in her bedroom, another non-negotiable while picking an Airbnb. She needs separation, she said, and having a separate desk area allows her to create a "little WeWork."

The bedroom features floor-to-ceiling windows, as Ghai likes to wake up to sunlight. The first thing that she does every morning is make her bed.

"My friends say my homes look like serial killer homes," she said. "I like it to look like nobody lives there ever. I need you to walk into my house and be like, 'Is this a staged home?'"

Inside Ghai's closet, there are two designer bags: one Dior, one Louis Vuitton. They're both vintage, Ghai said. She likes to go to vintage stores and find nice bags that need some care.

"I like to do my little art projects," she said.

29-year-old Josh Sirota sleeps on an air mattress in the middle of the Eragon office.

He tries to get up at 8 a.m., when he wanders over a few feet to his desk. He's the only one who sleeps there full-time, but the office has cots and a couch for those who work particularly late.

Upstairs is more bed space and a conference room, but the area is currently strewn with Sirota's clothes.

"We just moved a month ago and I've been super traveling, so we haven't set up this area yet," he said.

Sirota's room will eventually be upstairs, too, he said, and it will have an actual mattress and a closet. For now, the space is empty.

Outside, Sirota has a tent set up. Photos of tents pitched in what was inaccurately described as the X office recently spread around the social media platform, which Eragon recreated for a marketing stunt. Next to the tent is a stationary bike for office use.

Eragon is part of Andreessen Horowitz's accelerator, A16z Speedrun. Sirota said he was meeting Ben Horowitz that week, and on his desk was a copy of Horowitz's "What You Do Is Who You Are."

He also had Andrew Chen's "The Cold Start Problem," which he said was "essential reading.

Next to the books was a can of green tea, a Redbull, and a bag of socks gifted by his sister. There was a bag of leftover McDonald's from an Uber Eats delivery.

Stacked up high on his desk were at least five canisters of Zyn nicotine pouches.

26-year-old TrainLoop founder Jackson Stokes' apartment doesn't have a living room. It's worked for him: "We were just never actually here," he said, explaining that he'll spend 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the office on a normal day.

It's more spacious than his last apartment, which was a five-bedroom with six guys in it. That apartment also didn't have a dishwasher.

This apartment also has a robotic coffee machine, which he bought off a friend for $1. "It's very tech," he said.

The company coffee maker is much nicer. He recently bought a $1,500 machine for the TrainLoop office. They haven't moved into the new space yet; the machine sits on his bedroom floor.

Stokes wants to have a nice bedroom. He called it a "bit cluttered" — there's a plant on top of the coffee machine — but said that he'd been "nesting."

Stokes has books from Stripe Press and paintings from local artists on his shelves. He also has two framed printouts from photobooths: one from his time at Google and the other from Y Combinator's end-of-batch party.

Stokes' top shelf also contains alcohol. He has a bottle of wine from winning first place at an OpenAI hackathon and a bottle signed by his YC group partner, Michael Seibel. There's also a bottle of Clase Azul, which is still sealed because "we don't drink that much."

"I actually have not rung the bell on this one yet," Stokes said of the bottle's topper. "But I have rung the bell on others."

23-year-old Haokun Qin and his Gale cofounder moved into their Toronto apartment two months ago: "We just shoved our stuff in here, and we've been here maybe half the time."

He keeps his room basic, just "whatever I need to sleep." That includes a bed, a nightstand, and a heated blanket — no comforter or duvet needed.

"I move around too much to have that much stuff on me," Qin said.

His favorite thing in the room, Qin said, was the protein shakes that he stores under his bed.

In his bathroom, Qin has a variety of skincare products.

"I don't even know what it is, but half the stuff my mom bought, and half the stuff I bought on Amazon over time," he said. "I couldn't tell you, man."

In his apartment's living area, Qin has floor-to-ceiling windows. He points out one to The Velocity Incubator, a local startup program. His office, he says, is a three-minute walk away.

Opening his freezer, Qin pulls out an ice pop and laughs. "We call them freezies," he said.

One of the biggest questions facing Uber and other companies experimenting with self-driving cars is who will own and maintain all those vehicles without gig workers. 

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the real estate industry could offer one possible answer to the problem.

While speaking this month at a summit hosted by the "All-In" podcast, Khosrowshahi fielded a question about how Uber would handle ownership of the self-driving cars that it plans to add to its operations in the coming years. All-In posted a video of the conversation on Wednesday.

"You're going to have financial owners that own big fleets of cars that are on our network," Khosrowshahi said.

"All of these cars are going to be financeable," he said.

Before becoming Uber's top executive, Khosrowshahi was CEO of travel search site Expedia. He said that major hotel brands like Hilton or Marriott don't typically own their hotels. Like other commercial real estate properties, such as shopping malls, hotels are often owned by real estate investment trusts, or REITs.

"Those hotels are owned by financial-only players," Khosrowshahi said at the event.

The trusts typically handle many of the expenses of owning the properties, such as maintenance and taxes, while receiving income through rent.

A decade from now, some investors could play a REIT-like role for companies that use lots of self-driving vehicles, Khosrowshahi said at the All-In event.

Uber's current ride-hailing business has become profitable in part because the company has avoided owning many of its most important assets.

The company's ride-hailing drivers are independent contractors who use their own cars to shuttle passengers around cities or deliver food to customers' doors. Uber pays the drivers for each gig that they complete.

While some drivers are eligible for Uber benefits like gas discounts, they are responsible for their own vehicle costs.

While human Uber drivers will likely be around for years, Khosrowshahi also said at the summit that self-driving cars could eventually leave many people out of work. What comes next for those workers represents "a big, big societal question," he said.

For Uber, the challenge will be finding a business model that has all the benefits of self-driving cars while owning as little as possible.

Disruption at some European airports continued for a second day on Sunday after a cyberattack targeted check-in technology company Collins Aerospace.

The U.K.'s largest airport, Heathrow, was among those affected, along with airports in Berlin and Brussels.

Brussels Airport on Sunday asked airlines to cancel half of Monday's scheduled departing flights as issues with its check-in system remain unresolved.

A spokesperson for the airport said Collins Aerospace, the system's provider, has yet to deliver a secure updated version of the software necessary to restore full functionality.

Collins Aerospace "provides check-in and boarding systems for several airlines across multiple airports globally," Heathrow Airport said in a post on X Saturday.

Collins' parent company, RTX, said in a statement to Reuters that it was aware of "cyber-related disruption" to its MUSE software.

"The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations," RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies, said in a statement emailed to Reuters. It added that it was looking to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

CNBC has contacted RTX for comment and is awaiting a response.

Aviation analytics provider Cirium told CNBC that on Sunday so far, 38 departures and 33 arrivals had been canceled across Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, as of 10 a.m. London time.

On Saturday, 35 departures and 25 arrivals were canceled. Brussels saw the highest number of flight cancellations, at 15.

All three airports issued updated statements Sunday.

Heathrow said it was working to "resolve and recover" following the Collins outage that impacted check-in.

"We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate," it said on X. "We encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to Heathrow and to arrive no earlier than three hours for long-haul flights and two hours for short-haul."

Brussels said on its website Sunday that the cyberattack was having "a large impact on the flight schedule and unfortunately causes delays and cancellations of flights." It advised travelers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport.

Berlin warned travelers of longer waiting times due to a "systems outage at a service provider."

Dublin Airport was also affected, but said it expects to operate a full schedule on Sunday.

"Some airlines in Terminal 2 are continuing to use manual workarounds to generate bag tags and boarding passes. This means that the check-in and bag drop processes may take slightly longer than normal," the airport said on X.

The attack on Collins Aerospace is the latest in a series of high-profile cybersecurity breaches that have made headlines.

Jaguar Land Rover said last week that it was extending a pause in production until Sept. 24 following a cyberattack. "We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time," the company said in a statement.

While British retailer Marks & Spencer earlier this year said a recent cyberattack, which left food shelves bare and brought online sales to a standstill, would wipe out almost one-third of its annual profits.

However, Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at cybersecurity firm Check Point, noted that the aviation industry was a particularly target for cybercriminals given its reliance on shared digital systems.

"These attacks often strike through the supply chain, exploiting third-party platforms that are used by multiple airlines and airports at once," she said in an emailed statement. "When one vendor is compromised, the ripple effect can be immediate and far-reaching, causing widespread disruption across borders."

To improve resiliency, she said aviation companies should ensure software systems are regularly updated and well-tested backup systems are in place. She also called for better information-sharing between the technology providers, airlines and governments.

"Cyberattacks rarely stop at national borders, so the faster one country can identify and report an attack, the faster others can take action to contain it," she said. "A joined-up defence will be far more effective than siloed responses."

Bitcoin's slow ascent towards establishing new highs has continuously encountered significant opposition in the past few weeks. As the market currently stands in an uncertain zone, there are several questions and concerns about the future trajectory of the premier cryptocurrency. Below is how the latest on-chain data answers some of these questions

How $117,000 Slowed Down BTC's Rise

In a September 20 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson reemphasized his early prediction of $117,000 as a critical resistance zone for the Bitcoin price.

Wedson referenced his post published exactly a week ago, which utilized two main on-chain metrics — the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel, and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price — in reaching his conclusion.

For context, the CVDD Channel is centered around the amount of aged capital being sent into the market. This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins.

Also, the Market Mean Price is the cost basis, on average, of all Bitcoin holders. By extension, the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price is a metric that shows the average cost basis of Bitcoin, adjusted with specific Fibonacci ratios. It displays mathematical levels of extension or retracement around the Bitcoin average holder's cost.

According to the analyst, these two metrics had aligned perfectly, pointing out $117,000 as a zone where retracement was likely to occur. The convergence of these metrics showed not just the technical significance of this price level, but also reflected strong indecision in the market. 

What's Next For Bitcoin?

In the same post on X, Wedson pointed out specific price actions to watch out for in terms of Bitcoin's price progression and what a potential breach could mean.

Looking at the upside case, the analyst explained that a breakout above $118,600 would be a strong confirmation of heightening bullish momentum, which could “open the path for the next explosive move.”

Wedson also warned about a potential downside, which hinges on a break below the $113,700 support. According to the crypto founder, this support breach could lead to a swift decline of Bitcoin's value to as low as $110,000. 

A deeper correction could even drag Bitcoin to as low as $100,000—a price level that may attract institutions for accumulation. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,660, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum has long wrestled with the “non-ouroboros” problem: how to generate real revenue beyond speculative loops of buying, selling, and leveraging tokens on its chain.

For years, memecoins, non-fungible tokens, and incentive-driven decentralised finance apps have propped up activity but failed to provide a sustainable foundation for Ethereum's nearly $100 billion DeFi economy according to DefiLlama data.

Now, as Wall Street is increasingly betting on Ethereum as the backbone of the stablecoin boom, co-founder Vitalik Buterin argues that “low-risk DeFi,” which includes things like payments, savings, and collateralised lending, could finally give the network its flagship revenue engine.

“Non-financial and more experimental applications, are crucially important for Ethereum's role in the world and for its culture,” Buterin wrote in a blog post published Sunday. “But they do not need to be looked to as revenue generators.”

That's a major shift from Ethereum's earlier years, when DeFi was synonymous with double-digit yields on risky liquidity farms and frenzies over cartoon NFTs.

Buterin admits he was “more suspicious of DeFi” then, describing its main appeal as “making money from trading highly speculative tokens.”

Today, he says, the centre of gravity has moved toward simpler financial products.

The raw numbers and other analysts agree.

The supply of stablecoins on Ethereum has ballooned 700% since the start of 2021 to more than $160 billion, while real-world assets like tokenised US Treasuries have grown from almost nothing into a $9 billion market.

“Stablecoins are the ‘ChatGPT' of crypto,” Tom Lee, chair of Ethereum treasury firm BitMine, told DL News in August. “And Ethereum is the backbone. It's legally recognised, and has zero downtime.”

Bitcoin is down 0.4% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $115,440.

Ethereum is down 0.3% in the same period to $4,472.

Home - Crypto Presales - XRP vs MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analyst Debate Highlights Best Altcoins to Buy for Q4 Breakouts

The final quarter of 2025 has opened with a heated debate among analysts: which altcoin will deliver the stronger breakout – XRP or MAGACOIN FINANCE? Both tokens have captured market attention, but for very different reasons. XRP, with its established payment network and growing institutional traction, is viewed as a steady large-cap poised for further gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, meanwhile, is the fast-rising presale token attracting headlines with bold growth projections.


Analysts in XRP's corner argue that it has something presale tokens can't replicate – proven adoption. Ripple's partnerships with banks and financial institutions across multiple continents give XRP a tangible use case in payments and settlement. With the token trading near $3.05, many believe it could push toward $5 if institutional flows continue.

Proponents point to Ripple's ETF filing in the U.S. as another potential catalyst. If approved, it could bring a new wave of legitimacy and inflows to XRP, elevating it further into the spotlight. “XRP is past the stage of speculation,” one analyst explained. “It's a functioning asset with real-world demand.”











On the other side of the debate are those betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has gained attention by positioning itself as one of the best presales of 2025, with analysts projecting the potential for massive gains once it lists. Unlike XRP, which moves in measured increments, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the possibility of 50x-type returns if early momentum sustains.

Its presale has already exceeded expectations, raising millions and capturing a growing online community. Supporters argue that while XRP represents safety and steady adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents pure opportunity. “This is about entering before the real rally begins,” another analyst said. “XRP might double, but MAGACOIN FINANCE could multiply many times over.”

The debate ultimately comes down to a matter of risk tolerance. XRP is a relatively safer option backed by years of development and regulatory clarity. It has liquidity, adoption, and an established place in portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, thrives on being new and untested – qualities that make it risky but also capable of delivering the type of explosive gains rarely found in established tokens.

Investors weighing the two have to decide whether they want incremental growth or asymmetric upside. Historically, both approaches have worked – blue-chip altcoins like XRP provide stability, while early-stage tokens often deliver the most spectacular rallies.











Timing adds urgency to the debate. With Ethereum ETF speculation, Bitcoin whale accumulation, and retail momentum all heating up, the final quarter of the year is shaping up to be decisive. Analysts expect heightened volatility across the board, meaning both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from renewed liquidity entering the market.

For XRP, the question is whether adoption milestones can push it into new price territory. For MAGACOIN FINANCE, the test is whether presale enthusiasm translates into sustained momentum once trading begins.

The XRP vs MAGACOIN FINANCE debate captures the essence of crypto investing. XRP offers established strength, backed by adoption and institutional legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold potential, driven by presale energy and speculative appetite.

Neither camp is wrong – they simply represent different strategies. Conservative investors may lean toward XRP, while risk-takers may see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the real play for Q4. In truth, both tokens reflect the market's dual nature: stability on one side, speculation on the other.

In another step toward establishing Europe's economic and digital sovereignty, European Union finance ministers on Friday agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank that would be independent of the U.S.-based Visa and Mastercard systems.

The European Commission first proposed a digital euro currency in 2023, but discussions heated up last year, according to Reuters, as the drive to reduce Europe's dependence on U.S. and other non-EU technologies gathered momentum. The discussions recently have ratcheted up further, per Reuters, in response to President Trump's global push for stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The finance ministers met Friday in Copenhagen along with ECB President Christine Lagarde and European Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis to finalize the roadmap.

The agreement ensures that national finance ministers will have a say on whether and when the ECB would issue the currency and on how much digital euros residents will be able to hold. Their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

“The compromise that we reached is that before the ECB makes a final decision in relation to issuance…there would be an opportunity for a discussion in the Council of Ministers,” Paschal Donohoe, who chairs meetings of finance ministers, told a joint press conference.

Before the European Commission's proposal could be adopted in needs to be signed off on by the European Parliament and European Council, made up of equal representation of the EU member countries. The Council aims to complete its work on the proposal by the end of 2026, according to Reuters. The ECB hopes to have legislation in place by June.

Some EU countries currently have their own digital currencies, but none are accepted across the entire 27-nation bloc.

“The digital Europe is not just a means of payment, it is also a political statement concerning the sovereignty of Europe and its capacity to handle payment, including on a cross-border basis, with a European infrastructure and solution,” Lagarde said at the press conference.

As in the U.S., some European bankers have expressed concern that a fiat-backed digital currency would drain funds from traditional banks, limiting their ability to make loans in fiat and undercutting the traditional financial system.

In response to the Commission's original proposal in 2023, Finance Watch, a non-profit advocacy group founded in 2011 as a counterweight to financial industry lobbying, warned that a digital currency could also harm consumer privacy by enabling government financial surveillance, Reuters reported at the time.

The ECB said last year that privacy would be an important design feature of the digital euro, according to Reuters. The digital euro would not be programmable, like limited-use digital vouchers, and it would not give governments the ability to track individuals' spending, ECB digital euro chief Evelien Witlox said.

One of the most controversial features of President Donald Trump's second term is his relentless criticism of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining elevated interest rates – a stance Trump argues is unnecessarily costly to the American economy.

But this is more than just rhetoric. Trump is aggressively attempting to undermine the Fed's board, threatening an institution long known for its political independence. Ironically, this very assault risks backfiring, deepening what Trump and others describe as a Fed that is "behind the curve," potentially leading to a deeper sell-off in the U.S. dollar.

"Political pressures make it tough to credibly shift to an overtly dovish footing. That leaves policy data driven (thus late) rather than pre-emptive. That's bad for the USD," the market insights team at Lloyds Bank led by Nicholas Kennedy, said in a note to clients on Sept. 18.

Last Thursday marked a new chapter in Trump's campaign against the central bank, as his administration took the unprecedented step of petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This would be the first forced removal of a sitting Fed governor since the institution's founding in 1913.

The move followed a temporary judicial block issued by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who prevented the ousting of Cook, a Biden appointee, pending further legal proceedings.

According to the Lloyds Bank market insights team, such attacks are likely to increase as Powell enters the final months of his term as Chairman. Trump's recent appointee at the Fed, Stephen Miran, is already calling for rapid-fire rate cuts and wants the bank to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 50 basis points in the recently concluded meeting.

At its core, Trump's campaign reflects a desire for a Fed more responsive to his economic worldview, which demands ultra-low rates around 1%, down significantly from the present 4%.

Trump has argued that current rates keep mortgage costs prohibitively high for many Americans, hindering homeownership and imposing billions in unnecessary debt refinancing expenses. He frames this as a staggering missed opportunity on an otherwise “phenomenal” economy. Meanwhile, many economists agree that rates remain too high given signs of weakening labor markets and consumer health.

Thus, the Federal Reserve is widely perceived as “behind the curve” – a technical term meaning it is too slow to cut rates in response to evolving economic conditions.

Yet, Trump's insistence on forcing faster rate cuts risks pushing the Fed further behind this curve.

Imagine holding the reins of the world's most powerful central bank, responsible not only for the world's largest economy, but the fate of the global reserve currency, the USD. Now imagine the political pressure to cut rates quickly, against the fear of appearing politically compromised. This leaves policymakers damned if they act and damned if they don't.

So, unlike typical policymakers who adjust with measured calm in response to data, Powell and his colleagues now operate under intense political pressure and public scrutiny from the White House. They face a classic catch-22: face accusations of succumbing to political pressure in case of rapid rate cuts (even if they do so independently); wait too long and risk the potential deepening of an economic slowdown.

This dynamic could breed reflexive stubbornness. To avoid accusations of capitulating to political pressure, the Fed may instinctively lean towards caution – waiting longer and keeping rates elevated. However, this posture can exacerbate the problem: delayed rate cuts keep monetary policy out of sync with economic conditions, much like a patient who resists mild medication only to require drastic doses once a fever spikes.

The subsequent high doses of rate cuts could be interpreted by markets as a sign of panic, leading to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.

The catch-22 situation could also weigh on the U.S. dollar, a bullish development for dollar-denominated assets like gold and bitcoin.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, has dropped nearly 10% this year to 97.64. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has rallied by 24% to $115,600.

Stablecoin adoption is gaining momentum among corporates and financial institutions driven by regulatory clarity and cost-savings in global money transfers, according to a survey by EY-Parthenon.

Conducted with 350 executives in June after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the survey found that 13% of firms already use stablecoins, mainly for cross-border payments. Among those who didn't use stablecoins, 54% expected to adopt them within the next six to 12 months.

Regulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act was widely viewed as a turning point. The legislation, which was signed into law in July, provided long-awaited rules for U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, including reserve requirements and issuer approval processes.

Executives said in the survey the law reduces uncertainty around liquidity, tax treatment and custodial services.

Cost savings are also a key driver for adoption, with 41% of current users reporting at least a 10% reduction in expenses from using stablecoins in international transactions.

Respondents also saw stablecoins as a long-term fixture in global finance. By 2030, they estimate stablecoins could facilitate between 5% and 10% of all cross-border payments, representing $2.1 trillion to $4.2 trillion in value.

Still, infrastructure hurdles remain. Only 8% of businesses accepted payments in stablecoins, and many firms planned to lean on banking and fintech partners for integration.

What if a simple mobile game could reshape an entire cryptocurrency landscape? This isn't just hypothetical — it's the thrilling reality for the Pudgy Penguins community. The much-anticipated debut of the Pudgy Party mobile game has sent shockwaves through the crypto sector, amassing a staggering 750,000 downloads within a blink of an eye. This meteoric success has prompted an avalanche of speculation regarding the PENGU token, rapidly captivating both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. As the interplay between gaming and cryptocurrency garners unprecedented interest, institutional investors are zeroing in on this NFT phenomenon. What does this unprecedented rise imply for Pudgy Penguins' trajectory and the overarching narrative of crypto expansion?

The Pudgy Party mobile game represents far more than just another addition to the gaming industry; it marks a defining moment for the Pudgy Penguins brand. Since its launch on August 29, it has swiftly become one of the most talked-about titles within the Web3 ecosystem. Crafted by Mythical Games, the game proves that engaging and enriching gameplay can act as a catalyst for mass adoption in blockchain-based entertainment. Such explosive popularity is a clear signal of substantial demand for fresh Web3 experiences, drawing in both gaming devotees and crypto aficionados in droves.

This strategic pivot transforms Pudgy Penguins from a quirky meme into a formidable player within the gaming and NFT sectors. By employing tools like the Early to the Party Soulbound Token (SBT), they're not just creating gamers; they're engendering unwavering community loyalty and enriching engagement among players.

In the wake of the Pudgy Party's exhilarating success, the PENGU token has skyrocketed by an astounding 800%. Analysts are abuzz with the exhilarating prospect of PENGU reaching prices as high as $0.22. The close connection between the game's success and the burgeoning interest in PENGU underscores a palpable shift in crypto market dynamics. Institutional endorsement, including hints at potential ETF applications, is fanning the flames of optimism throughout the market.

Luca Netz, Pudgy Penguins' CEO, asserts that this wave of developments is not solely about igniting short-term enthusiasm; it's about solidifying the brand's reputation within the industry. The surge in engagement from Asian investors demonstrates a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency assets, thereby positioning Pudgy Penguins as a compelling investment prospect for those dabbling in digital assets.

Pudgy Penguins' ascent isn't merely a tale of organic growth; it's significantly underpinned by strategic alliances that amplify its visibility in the marketplace. Partnerships with heavyweights like Mythical Games and various financial institutions lend crucial credibility. These collaborations merge digital payment solutions with traditional finance, reflecting compliance with dynamic regulations while elevating standards for the entire crypto ecosystem.

The broader ramifications of these partnerships reveal a revealing trend: institutional investors are increasingly inclined to back projects that outline clear growth strategies and innovative frameworks. This growing sentiment is mirrored in the soaring prices of PENGU tokens amidst rising trade volumes and favorable market sentiment.

As elation surges around the recent price upticks, the daunting specter of market volatility casts a shadow. Historical patterns demonstrate that market behaviors often hinge on the short-lived triumphs from games or hot NFT drops; true stability, however, lies in continuous innovation paired with prudent fiscal governance. For Pudgy Penguins, the challenge will be sustaining momentum through a fortified framework that champions ongoing progress and community involvement.

Industry experts warn that simply riding the wave of excitement isn't sufficient; without a balanced approach that intertwines engaging gameplay with sustainable growth, the brand risks perpetuating a lingering “meme coin” reputation. As Pudgy Penguins charts a course toward audacious financial products in the crypto domain, a strategic and holistic methodology is imperative to ensure enduring success.

As Pudgy Penguins and its PENGU token continue to capture headlines, a widening array of observers is drawn into their captivating success narrative. The synergy of a hit mobile game, pivotal partnerships, and a surge in investor enthusiasm highlights the potential for Pudgy Penguins to reestablish itself within the crypto arena.

With the tantalizing prospect of ETF applications and growing institutional support on the horizon, the outlook appears bullish for this vibrant NFT brand. However, navigating the labyrinthine market conditions amid mounting regulatory scrutiny will remain a critical test. The evolution of Pudgy Penguins heralds an exhilarating fusion of gaming and cryptocurrency, lighting up pathways of opportunity in what promises to be a dynamic future.

YZi Labs, the family office founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao and Yi He, which was rebranded from Binance Labs, has expanded its position in Ethena Labs, the protocol behind USDe, which has become the third-largest U.S. dollar-denominated crypto asset with more than $13 billion in circulation.

The investment comes as Ethena enters a new stage of growth, which includes extending its footprint on BNB Chain. This includes rolling out products designed to bridge crypto and traditional finance, such as USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin in development, and Converge, an institutional settlement layer being built with Securitize and partners connected to BlackRock.

USDe, marketed as a "synthetic dollar," uses bitcoin BTC, ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL (SOL)as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on exchanges to maintain a $1 peg. 

Launched less than two years ago, the synthetic dollar crossed the $10 billion supply milestone faster than any other dollar-pegged crypto asset.

“Since our investment team first met Guy [Young] in late 2023, Ethena has become the category definer for yield-bearing synthetic dollars,” said Dana Hou, investment partner at YZi Labs.

For users, the developments mean more options for holding and using digital dollars across centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. For institutions, products like Converge aim to create a familiar settlement layer for tokenized assets, potentially broadening adoption of on-chain financial infrastructure.

As the Magnificent 7 stocks soar, Bitcoin advocate Balaji Srinivasan argues the divergence marks the end of the legacy economy.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

A cursory glance at the Magnificent 7 stocks chart reveals a clear trajectory: up only. But when layered against all other stocks, an even more interesting pattern emerges. 493 stocks remain relatively flat while the Mag 7s take a steep upward grind, like climbing the Eiger. As Bitcoin advocate and founder of The Network State, Balaji Srinivasan, muses:

“My explanation is that the legacy economy is being sunset in favor of the Internet economy.”

Stripe CEO Patrick Collison ruminated on similar data, highlighting a trend emerging across Google, Apple, and Microsoft. He questioned why the companies exhibited the same growth dynamics when they are “ostensibly in totally different businesses,' to which Balaji replied:

“I think those graphs reflect the secular shift towards the Internet. Almost every action that was once done offline is moving online, and routed through tech companies.”

What's going on here? Patterns that would once have been dismissed as coincidences now seem to signal something deeper.

The “secular shift” is economist-speak for a permanent, structural change. In this case, it's the decades-long migration from offline to online across the global economy.

From grocery orders to financial transactions, human interactions, and even remote work, the COVID-accelerated rush to digital has become the main route for commerce and connection.

Balaji's response to Collison's question made explicit what many now intuitively sense: tech companies aren't just growing, they're becoming the primary infrastructure for life itself.

“Legacy” sectors like real estate, banking, and manufacturing are being reoriented, rewired, or outright replaced by software. In Balaji's words, almost every offline activity is “routed through tech companies,” as digital-first solutions offer scale, efficiency, and global reach previously unimaginable.

This is not an innovation cycle but a replatforming. It's why companies that once had nothing in common now show the same growth curves or contraction risks: the offline world is contracting, while the internet economy swells to fill the gap.

For investors and founders, these trends reinforce a simple imperative: bet on digital, or risk obsolescence. The parallel growth patterns across disconnected verticals suggest that internet penetration is now the single biggest driver of economic fate.

Tech companies, with their network effects and digital rails, become the middlemen for everything. They reinforce the winner-take-most dynamic so apparent in today's markets.

For policymakers, there's a warning: the digital divide will only widen unless deliberate intervention closes it. As more actions from life are intermediated by platforms, the cost of being unconnected grows.

The trajectory of Magnificent 7 stocks, and, in particular, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, shines a light on a future where the majority of human action runs through software. It's a world reshaped not by a single breakthrough, but by the universal, irreversible shift from meatspace to cyberspace.

The evidence is in the charts, and the trend is only getting steeper.

According to Vitalik Buterin, the future of Ethereum ETHUSD lies not in NFTs or meme coins, but in something far simpler — low-risk DeFi. In a new essay, the Ethereum co-founder likened this to how search became Google's main source of income, powering every other service around the internet giant.

In short, the point is that Ethereum doesn't need hype cycles to survive. What it needs is a solid foundation of payment systems, savings accounts, collateralized lending and synthetic assets that will stand the test of time. These are trustworthy tools that also keep ETH locked up and fees flowing.

Low-risk defi can be for Ethereum what search was for Googlehttps://t.co/6xIxCrOToQ

The numbers show why this shift is important. Back in 2019, Ethereum DeFi losses amounted to more than 5% of the total value locked. By 2025, that figure had dropped to almost zero.

Protocols have become safer, risks have dropped, and the wild edges of DeFi have moved further away from the core. Buterin argues that, for millions of users, the risks in traditional finance are now greater than those in DeFi.

"Digital oil" or new Google?

Low-risk DeFi also creates opportunities for the road ahead. These include reputation-based lending without heavy collateral, prediction markets used for hedging and new forms of stable value, such as "flatcoins" tied to inflation indexes. All of these build on the safer foundations being formed today.

Buterin is clear in his message — Ethereum's biggest application doesn't need to be revolutionary. It just needs to work everywhere, reliably. Low-risk DeFi fits that role, and if he is right, it could be the piece that finally makes Ethereum both sustainable and integral.

Blockchain technology often consumes too much energy. The Algorand network, founded by MIT's Silvio Micali, is set to make crypto sustainable. Its high efficiency and eco-conscious design offer a cleaner, more secure digital future.

Algorand carries a distinct consensus protocol: pure proof of stake. Proof of work systems, which include bitcoin, are energy-intensive. PPoS has the structure for scalability, security, and decentralization but a minimal environmental footprint.

FinTech Magazine reported that Algorand's PPoS mechanism operates like a lottery system. It finalizes transactions using a single block. A verifiable random function selects validators for each transaction block.

Unlike other blockchains, Algorand's validators need less computational power to reach network consensus, effectively reducing energy consumption.

A lightweight approach means node operation demands minimal hardware. This saves computing resources and promotes decentralization without compromising sustainability.

Algorand's commitment to energy efficiency is a positive development for the blockchain industry. Cryptocurrencies with massive amounts of energy rely on proof of work.

 Privacy experts warn EU's Chat Control law could break encryption, erode trust in digital platforms and push users toward decentralized Web3 solutions. 

As EU lawmakers near a decision on the “Chat Control” law, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms.

As European lawmakers near a decision on the controversial “Chat Control” legislation, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms.

At the center of the debate is the EU's proposed Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse, which would require platforms to scan private messages for illegal content before they are encrypted. Critics say this effectively creates a backdoor into encrypted systems, contradicting the EU's own commitments to privacy.

“Giving an inherently corruptible entity nearly unlimited visibility into the private lives of individuals is incompatible with an honest value statement of digital privacy,” Hans Rempel, co-founder and CEO of Diode, told Cointelegraph. He called the proposal a dangerous overreach.

Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, noted that the law appears “difficult to justify under the existing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union.” She pointed to Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantee the confidentiality of communications and protection of personal data. 

“Client-side scanning would enable the monitoring of content on user devices prior to transmission, including in cases where there is no indication of unlawful activity,” she explained.

Experts say the regulation sets a dangerous precedent from a legal and technological standpoint. “There are no guarantees,” Rempel added, when asked if the tools could be misused. “Over 10% of all data breaches occur in government systems,” he warned.

Fabrega raised concerns over the broader impact such surveillance would have on public trust. “Encryption is not only a technical feature, it is a promise to users that their private communications will remain confidential,” she said. 

The erosion of trust in traditional messaging platforms could prompt users to explore decentralized Web3 alternatives, platforms built to protect user data through encryption by design.

“Web3's privacy battle cry is ‘Not your keys, not your data,'” Rempel said. “This is true self-custody for data,” he added, noting that the end-user maintains sovereignty over their information from “cradle to grave.”

Fabrega echoed the sentiment, stating that “privacy-conscious users will increasingly explore decentralized Web3 alternatives” if Chat Control is passed. She warned that the shift could “fragment the European digital market” and weaken the EU's ability to shape international norms on privacy.

Germany, which holds the pivotal vote, has yet to take a final stance. While 15 EU countries currently support the proposal, they fall short of the 65% population threshold required for passage. If Germany votes in favor, the law will likely pass; if it abstains or opposes, the legislation is expected to fail.

“We believe it to be low,” Rempel said of the likelihood of passage. “But it won't be the last time that there is an attempt to subvert fundamental human rights in the name of safety.”

Introduction: Strategic Alliances in the Blockchain Payment Sector

Amid the rapid evolution of blockchain technology, payment-focused public blockchains, as critical infrastructure bridging traditional finance and the Web3 world, are encountering unprecedented opportunities. Recently, UPCX, a high-performance blockchain payment platform, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Paycle and NTT Digital, a member of the global NTT DOCOMO Group.

This collaboration aims to jointly advance the research, development, and application of next-generation decentralized payment systems, including optimizing technical specifications, developing SDKs/APIs, and promoting real-world use cases for financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. For an emerging blockchain positioned to “optimize payment and financial services,” this MOU is not merely a technical partnership but a milestone in UPCX's transition from proof-of-concept to mainstream adoption. It signals UPCX's entry into Japan—one of the world's leading markets for Web3 adoption, with over 12 million verified crypto users—and leverages NTT's global telecommunications network to expand worldwide. This article analyzes the deeper significance of this collaboration and explores its potential impact on UPCX's long-term investment value.

Unlike general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, UPCX functions as a “multifunctional Web3 toolbox,” supporting stablecoin issuance, non-custodial custody, multi-signature payments, and scheduled/recurring payments, delivering a “smartphone-like intuitive” blockchain payment experience.

As a nascent project, UPCX launched its mainnet in early 2025 and was listed on Japan's BitTrade exchange, emphasizing regulatory compliance. However, in the competitive payment blockchain race (e.g., Solana, Ripple), UPCX faces challenges in ecosystem development and market penetration. This MOU represents a critical breakthrough.

MOU Details: Technical Synergy and Market Empowerment

The core of this tripartite collaboration is the transition “from technical vision to real-world implementation.” Paycle will provide blockchain technology expertise, supporting UPCX in refining technical specifications and developing interfaces (e.g., SDKs and APIs) to enhance competitiveness in high-frequency payment scenarios like retail and cross-border settlements. Founded in 2018, Paycle, a Japanese FinTech pioneer specializing in blockchain, AI, and quantum-resistant cryptography, has prior ties with UPCX dating back to 2023. Meanwhile, NTT Digital, as NTT Group's Web3 enabler, will leverage its global telecommunications network to facilitate UPCX's infrastructure adoption by enterprise clients, particularly financial institutions and crypto exchanges, while supporting market expansion in Japan.

The strategic intent of this MOU is clear: the three parties will jointly identify application-layer developers for the UPCX ecosystem, leveraging their respective networks to build a sustainable financial infrastructure. For UPCX, this shifts the paradigm from “solo effort” to “ecosystem synergy”—Paycle provides technical depth, while NTT offers market breadth. As one of the world's most regulated and mature blockchain markets, Japan positions this partnership to accelerate UPCX's global strategy in Asia and beyond. Community feedback has been positive, with many token holders calling this a “pivotal step for UPCX's ascent,” highlighting its role in accelerating DeFi adoption.



Short-Term Impact: Brand Enhancement and Ecosystem Expansion

In the short term, this MOU will significantly boost UPCX's visibility and credibility. NTT's endorsement effectively brands UPCX as a “mainstream player”—as Japan's telecommunications giant, NTT's Web3 initiatives span globally, opening doors to Japanese financial institutions. This is expected to drive increased transaction activity and network usage, attracting more institutional partners through compliant network access. Additionally, UPCX's stablecoin issuance and cross-border payment capabilities will benefit from NTT's global telecom infrastructure, accelerating real-world deployment in retail and international settlement scenarios.

Long-Term Value: From Emerging Player to Infrastructure Provider

For investors, the MOU's long-term value lies in transforming UPCX from an “emerging player” to an “infrastructure provider.” First, technical fortification: Paycle's optimizations will further enhance UPCX's TPS and security, making it ideal for high-frequency scenarios like supply chain finance and DAO payroll automation. This not only boosts token utility (UPC as gas fees and staked assets) but may also attract more stablecoin issuance (e.g., USD/EUR-pegged versions), amplifying network effects.

Second, market expansion and compliance dividends: Japan, as a “blockchain testing ground,” offers replicable experience for markets like Singapore, South Korea, and the EU. NTT's global network will accelerate UPCX's cross-border payment adoption, aiming to build a “sustainable financial economic foundation.” In the long run, as global payment markets shift toward blockchain, UPCX's positioning will capitalize on DeFi and Real-World Asset (RWA) trends, potentially driving multiples in valuation.

Finally, balancing risks and opportunities: Emerging blockchains face high volatility and regulatory uncertainties, but UPCX's compliance focus and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. For long-term holders, UPCX represents a “blue-chip contender” in the payment sector—akin to early Solana's returns but with a more focused vertical.

Conclusion: From MOU to Mainstream, UPCX's Investment Narrative Evolves

The MOU with Paycle and NTT Digital is not only a model of technical collaboration but a catalyst for an emerging payment blockchain to go mainstream. It will accelerate UPCX's global journey, solidifying its leadership in high-performance payment solutions.

For investors, this is a signal worth noting: in a fragmented blockchain payment market, UPCX is building a moat through strategic alliances. Looking ahead, as more real-world use cases materialize, UPCX has the potential to become a “hidden champion” in Web3 payments. Caution is advised, and investors should monitor mainnet data and future developments. UPCX's journey is just beginning, but this step is already cause for excitement.

Home - Reviews - Aleo Blockchain Review: Experience the Seamless Future of Private Web3 Transactions

In the evolving landscape of Web3, privacy remains a paramount concern. Aleo Blockchain emerges as a transformative solution, leveraging cutting-edge zero-knowledge cryptography to redefine confidential interactions on the blockchain. This innovative platform empowers users and developers to build a more private and secure digital future, seamlessly blending discretion with decentralization.











Aleo Blockchain is a pioneering Layer-1 blockchain that prioritizes user privacy through zero-knowledge cryptography. Unlike transparent networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Aleo ensures all transactions and smart contract executions are private by default. This core design protects sensitive user data while maintaining the security and verifiability of a public ledger.

By embedding privacy at its foundation, Aleo Blockchain addresses a significant gap in the blockchain space, offering a platform suitable for applications demanding both confidentiality and compliance. Its innovative approach has attracted substantial support from leading investors who recognize its potential to foster a new era of private web interactions.



The network's foundational philosophy is “privacy by default.” This means user interactions are inherently confidential without requiring extra steps. Traditional blockchains publicly expose transaction details, creating risks for users and enterprises. Aleo Blockchain eliminates this vulnerability by utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). 

This advanced cryptography allows the network to verify information without revealing any underlying personal or financial data. Consequently, users can conduct sensitive operations with guaranteed discretion, making personal and business confidentiality a standard feature.

Aleo's architecture supports a broad spectrum of real-world applications across various sectors. In finance, it enables private payroll, compliant DeFi, and discreet payments. For digital identity, solutions like zPass allow users to prove credentials such as age or residency without unnecessary data exposure. The gaming industry benefits from provably fair mechanisms and true asset ownership without compromising player privacy. 

This versatility extends to other fields like secure data sharing and supply chain management, where Aleo's ability to combine verification with privacy opens new possibilities for business and personal use.

The Aleo Blockchain's ecosystem is powered by its native token, ALEO. It is primarily used for paying network transaction fees and accessing computational resources. The token also plays a crucial role in network incentives, rewarding validators and provers for securing the blockchain and generating zero-knowledge proofs. 

Furthermore, it facilitates community governance, allowing holders to participate in key decisions. With a fixed supply, the ALEO token is designed to support a sustainable economy centered on private decentralized applications, ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized.











Aleo Blockchain employs a novel hybrid consensus algorithm called AleoBFT, which integrates delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) with a proof-generation mechanism known as Proof-of-Succinct-Work (PoSW). Validators, who require a minimum stake to participate, are responsible for confirming transactions and producing blocks. Simultaneously, provers (often called “ZK miners”) use specialized hardware to generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that solve computational puzzles. 

These proofs are verified by validators and included in blocks, ensuring both network security and efficient transaction finality. This combination leverages the scalability of dPoS and the cryptographic security of PoSW.

At Aleo Blockchain's core is zkCloud, an off-chain execution environment comprising snarkVM and snarkOS. snarkVM is a virtual machine that processes private smart contracts off-chain, generating succinct proofs of correct execution without revealing underlying data. snarkOS acts as the decentralized operating system, managing data availability, consensus, and networking. 

This structure allows developers to run complex computations off-chain, submitting only verified proofs to the blockchain, which drastically reduces on-chain congestion and enhances scalability while maintaining privacy.

Aleo Blockchain introduces Leo, a Rust-inspired programming language designed specifically for writing privacy-preserving applications. Leo abstracts low-level cryptographic complexities, enabling developers to create zero-knowledge circuits without deep expertise in ZKPs. Programs written in Leo compile into zk-SNARK circuits, which define the rules for private computations. 

This allows developers to build applications where users can interact with smart contracts and prove transaction validity without exposing sensitive information, such as identity details or financial data.

Aleo Blockchain innovates with a dual-state storage model, offering both private and public on-chain data options. Private states use an encrypted record system, similar to Bitcoin's UTXO model, where data is stored as ciphertext accessible only to owners via decryption keys. Public states employ mappings for transparent data storage, queryable by anyone. Developers can dynamically switch between these states based on application needs, enabling flexibility for use cases like gaming or voting.











The ALEO token is the native cryptocurrency of the Aleo blockchain, designed to power its ecosystem of private applications. It serves as the primary medium for accessing network resources, enabling users to pay transaction fees and deploy programs. Beyond basic utility, the token is fundamental to network security. 

It incentivizes participants like validators and provers, who are rewarded in ALEO for verifying transactions and generating zero-knowledge proofs, thus maintaining the integrity and functionality of the decentralized system. This economic model ensures that all network operations are compensated, fostering a self-sustaining privacy-focused environment.

Aleo's tokenomics are structured to support long-term growth and decentralization. The initial supply at launch was 1.5 billion tokens, allocated to early backers (34%), grants and education (25%), employees and contributors (17%), the Aleo Network Foundation & Provable (16%), and strategic partners (8%). Rewards are distributed to provers solving cryptographic puzzles and validators securing the network, with block rewards set at a constant rate per block. 

The total circulating supply is designed to grow to 2.6 billion over a decade, with an inflation rate decreasing from 12% in year one to 2% by year ten, eventually approaching zero to ensure sustainability.

Investing in ALEO presents a blend of opportunities and risks. Its association with innovative zero-knowledge technology and growing developer interest positions it well in the privacy-centric blockchain sector, suggesting potential for appreciation. However, the token faces significant market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, particularly due to its privacy features, which could attract scrutiny.

Success hinges on widespread adoption of Aleo's technology, and it faces stiff competition from established cryptocurrencies. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance, conduct thorough research, and consider the long-term horizon typical of early-stage ventures in the evolving crypto market.

Aleo Blockchain has implemented various incentive programs to bootstrap ecosystem development and reward early contributors. These initiatives, including prover incentives, testnet participation, and ambassador programs, distribute tokens to participants who help secure and grow the network. Eligible contributors must undergo a claim process involving identity verification and adherence to lockup periods, particularly for U.S. residents subject to a one-year holding restriction.

Aleo Blockchain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain, delivering uncompromising privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. By enabling confidential transactions and programmable discretion, it addresses critical gaps in digital trust. As the ecosystem evolves, Aleo is poised to become foundational infrastructure for a more secure, private, and user-centric decentralized internet.

Binance Coin (BNB) has just moved over $1,000, making it one of the strongest exchange token. Solana (SOL) is also building momentum, with analysts predicting a similar run to $1,000. But as these two seasoned players continue going up, the most potential in 2025 could lie with a newcomer in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For the price of just $0.035 in presale, MUTM is anticipating a 50x return thanks to its lending and borrowing DeFi protocol, and it's the most explosive-growth altcoin among this group.

Binance Coin (BNB) currently exchanges for $985.43, its 24-hour high and low being $980.38 and $1,005.29, up about 9% in the last week. Its rally highlights the huge demand within the Binance ecosystem, like the use of transaction fees, token burning, and usage in Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. 

Resistance seems to be around the $1,000 level, while key support is forming around the $900-$950 level. Compared to BNB's established structure and market positioning, investors are looking at Mutuum Finance, for what they perceive as potential improved percentage gain in the next bull cycle.

Solana (SOL) is trading at $247.60, where it stands close to the $250 level and continues to consolidate after recent activity. The network retains steadfastness in sustaining elevated transactional volume and decentralized application activity, further securing its position within the broader market. 

Current price action suggests a consolidation phase, with interest in seeing if SOL is able to sustain this steadiness before breaking towards greater levels. As Solana maintains its established position,  Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being monitored for possibly greater upside, given its early-stage position in the market. 

Mutuum Finance has achieved a record-breaking presale rate of adoption and has over 16,450 investors buying coins to raise over $16.05 million raised so far. Tokens can be bought at $0.035 per token during Phase 6. Its tiered system is an incentive system and early birds will benefit most.

Mutuum Finance's aim is to revolutionize DeFi. The project has a token giveaway for early adopters by providing $100,000 MUTM where 10 lucky people will receive a reward of $10,000 MUTM.



In addition to the apparent creation of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin onto the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins which have depegged during times of financial stress, the stablecoin introduced by Mutuum will be considered non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and as such can uphold its peg during times of financial stress.

The model capitalizes on the idle collateral reserve stability to be long-term stable with a value preservation guarantee. This positions the stablecoin as a safe store of value, and a safe depository. The top 2025 altcoin punt is in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with minimum 50x ROI for the early adopters.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the altcoin with biggest upside potential among BNB and SOL. Whereas Binance Coin (BNB) just broke above $1,000 with potential to go higher, and Solana (SOL) is trading at the $250 level on its path towards its own $1,000 goal, MUTM has much better percentage gains. At a paltry $0.035 during Stage 6 presale, with more than $16.05M invested and 16,450+ investors signed up, professionals predict 50x gains for early buyers. Lock your tokens in now at Stage 6 before the next price increase and setup for maximum potential.

 Vitalik Buterin said low-risk DeFi protocols can bring in stable revenue for the network, like how Google Search does for Google, but while also ensuring Ethereum's core values remain intact. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said revenue from low-risk decentralized finance protocols could give the network economic stability — much like Google Search supports Google — while letting nonfinancial apps uphold Ethereum's cultural values.  

Low-risk DeFi could address “important tensions” in the Ethereum community over whether apps that bring in enough revenue to economically sustain the ecosystem align with the cultural and ethical values that brought people to Ethereum in the first place, Buterin said in a blog post on Saturday.

The former has been a combination of nonfungible tokens, memecoins, and speculative trading, while the nonfinancial and semifinancial apps that reflect Ethereum's cultural values have either struggled to gain widespread adoption or haven't generated enough fees, he said.

“This disjointness created a lot of dissonance in the community,” Buterin said, before making his case for low-risk DeFi being Ethereum's main fee generator. One example Buterin highlighted was deposit rates for stablecoin lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which hover around 5% for blue-chips like Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) and above 10% for higher risk stables.

Similarly, Buterin noted that Google does many “interesting and valuable things” — such as its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, its open-source AI Gemini models, and more — but the revenue they make from those products is a fraction compared to what it makes through search and advertisements. 

It comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. DeFi TVL tanked massively across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, and TVL figures have largely trailed the performance of top layer 1 tokens this bull market.

However, DeFi has picked up lately amid an increase in regulatory momentum, particularly the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is tipped to push DeFi adoption even further. A recent survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans are open to DeFi if stronger laws are put in place.

Ethereum has the potential to “do much better” than Google due to its decentralization. Unlike Google, Ethereum's decentralized structure better positions low-risk DeFi to align financial success with ethical outcomes, creating harmony between “doing well” and “being good.”

Buterin criticized Google's incentive model, noting that advertising revenue pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive-sum ethos.

While low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the US dollar — particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries — Buterin would like to see other innovations that provide economic support to Ethereum.

Buterin pitched the idea of building cryptoassets that track a basket of currencies and flatcoins that are based directly on consumer price indices.

 Vitalik Buterin said low-risk DeFi protocols can bring in stable revenue for the network, like how Google Search does for Google, but while also ensuring Ethereum's core values remain intact. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said revenue from low-risk decentralized finance protocols could give the network economic stability — much like Google Search supports Google — while letting nonfinancial apps uphold Ethereum's cultural values.  

Low-risk DeFi could address “important tensions” in the Ethereum community over whether apps that bring in enough revenue to economically sustain the ecosystem align with the cultural and ethical values that brought people to Ethereum in the first place, Buterin said in a blog post on Saturday.

The former has been a combination of nonfungible tokens, memecoins, and speculative trading, while the nonfinancial and semifinancial apps that reflect Ethereum's cultural values have either struggled to gain widespread adoption or haven't generated enough fees, he said.

“This disjointness created a lot of dissonance in the community,” Buterin said, before making his case for low-risk DeFi being Ethereum's main fee generator. One example Buterin highlighted was deposit rates for stablecoin lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which hover around 5% for blue-chips like Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) and above 10% for higher risk stables.

Similarly, Buterin noted that Google does many “interesting and valuable things” — such as its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, its open-source AI Gemini models, and more — but the revenue they make from those products is a fraction compared to what it makes through search and advertisements. 

It comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently surpassed $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. DeFi TVL tanked massively across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, and TVL figures have largely trailed the performance of top layer 1 tokens this bull market.

However, DeFi has picked up lately amid an increase in regulatory momentum, particularly the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is tipped to push DeFi adoption even further. A recent survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans are open to DeFi if stronger laws are put in place.

Ethereum has the potential to “do much better” than Google due to its decentralization. Unlike Google, Ethereum's decentralized structure better positions low-risk DeFi to align financial success with ethical outcomes, creating harmony between “doing well” and “being good.”

Buterin criticized Google's incentive model, noting that advertising revenue pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive-sum ethos.

While low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the US dollar — particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries — Buterin would like to see other innovations that provide economic support to Ethereum.

Buterin pitched the idea of building cryptoassets that track a basket of currencies and flatcoins that are based directly on consumer price indices.

Ethereum may have found its killer app. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that low-risk decentralized finance (DeFi) could do for Ethereum what search did for Google. It could provide a reliable, global revenue engine while staying aligned with community values.

For years, Ethereum faced a divide between apps that generated revenue and apps that fulfilled its founding ideals. High-fee activity like NFTs and memecoins brought money but little long-term value. At the same time, projects like ENS, Lens, or privacy protocols were innovative but could not sustain the wider $500 billion ecosystem.

That gap left the community waiting for something that could tick both boxes. In 2025, many now believe Ethereum has it: low-risk DeFi.

Low-risk DeFi refers to simple but powerful tools such as payments, savings, fully collateralized lending, synthetic assets, and transparent exchanges between them. Unlike speculative yield farming or memecoins, these services provide real value and are increasingly secure.

Aave, Maker, and other platforms already offer competitive deposit rates on stablecoins. At the same time, hacks and failures, while still present, are being pushed to the experimental edges of the ecosystem.

Two things changed. First, protocols have matured, lowering risks compared to the early days. Second, traditional finance itself looks shakier in parts of the world. For many, DeFi's transparent and automated systems now appear safer than unstable banks or politicized currencies.

Ethereum's revenue base is also stabilizing. Transaction fees and collateral demand from low-risk DeFi now provide steady economic support while avoiding the perverse incentives that came with speculative bubbles.

The analogy to Google is deliberate. Most of Google's innovation, from AI models to new programming languages, generates little revenue. Search and ads pay the bills. Buterin argued this model incentivized Google to hoard user data and prioritize profit over openness.

Ethereum's low-risk DeFi, by contrast, aligns economics with mission. It enables global and permissionless access to payments and savings while strengthening ETH's role as collateral. It is profitable, sustainable, and culturally congruent.

Low-risk DeFi may be just the foundation. It can evolve into undercollateralized lending, prediction markets for hedging, and new forms of value such as basket currencies or flatcoins. Each step would expand financial inclusion while keeping Ethereum's ethos intact.

If this thesis holds, Ethereum's future may not rest on speculative bubbles or short-lived fads. Instead, its long-term growth could be anchored by the steady, global demand for safe and open financial infrastructure.

 YZi Labs has invested further into Ethena to push USDe adoption across more chains and platforms, while also assisting with the development of a new stablecoin. 

Tech-focused venture capital firm YZi Labs has increased its stake in Ethena, the stablecoin issuer behind USDe, which will assist the digital dollar's adoption across decentralized and centralized platforms.

The investment will assist Ethena USDe's (USDe) expansion on BNB Chain while enabling Ethena to continue building its USDtb stablecoin and an institutional settlement layer, Converge, Changpeng Zhao's YZi Labs said in a statement on Friday.USDtb is backed by short-duration treasury assets, including BlackRock's BUIDL, while Converge is an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain focused on tokenizing real-world assets. 

The move supports YZi's mission to “support open, scalable digital dollar infrastructures that can serve as a backbone of efficiency and liquidity for the entire financial ecosystem.”

Ethena Labs CEO Guy Young added: “The holy grail of digital dollar distribution has always been embedding stable, yield-bearing assets directly into the core of the crypto economy. 

The stablecoin adoption comes as the US Treasury estimated in April that the $295 billion market would boom to $2 trillion by 2028. Momentum was boosted in July by US President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act, seen as one of the most comprehensive stablecoin laws to date.

YZi, formerly Binance Labs, first invested in Ethena through its Season 6 Incubation Program in February 2024, before USDe's public launch. USDe's synthetic dollar is backed mainly by cryptocurrencies and is stabilized through a delta-neutral hedging strategy that keeps its value pegged to $1.

USDe's expansion on BNB Chain will build on its April deployment with new money markets, protocol integrations, and ecosystem partnerships already underway, YZi said.

Since launching, USDe has soared to a $14 billion market cap — trailing only Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC) at $171.5 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Increased adoption of USDe could allow it to slice into USDT and USDC's dominance and broaden its use across the crypto ecosystem.

It comes as YZi — which manages $10 billion worth of assets spread across crypto, AI and healthcare — recently promoted Hyperliquid rival Aster — a new decentralized perpetuals exchange platform that is set to integrate USDe as part of its ecosystem.

Ethena has also won investment support from trillion-dollar asset management firms Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, while crypto VC firm DragonFly also backs the stablecoin issuer.

An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer's disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging.

As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention.

In a commentary published in The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide.

"While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's disease have surged by more than 140%," said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. "At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors."

Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline - potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present.

The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement - reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support.

These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits.

"The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes - previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer - also hold transformative potential for brain health," Hennekens said.

The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience.

"The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous," said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. "Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline - tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs."

On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%.

Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia - amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy.

"While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health," said Hennekens. "Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline."

The first and corresponding author is John Dunn, a medical student at the Schmidt College of Medicine.

The official number of exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- tracked by NASA has reached 6,000. Confirmed planets are added to the count on a rolling basis by scientists from around the world, so no single planet is considered the 6,000th entry. The number is monitored by NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), based at Caltech's IPAC in Pasadena, California. There are more than 8,000 additional candidate planets awaiting confirmation, with NASA leading the world in searching for life in the universe.

"This milestone represents decades of cosmic exploration driven by NASA space telescopes -- exploration that has completely changed the way humanity views the night sky," said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director, Astrophysics Division, NASA Headquarters in Washington. "Step by step, from discovery to characterization, NASA missions have built the foundation to answering a fundamental question: Are we alone? Now, with our upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory, America will lead the next giant leap -- studying worlds like our own around stars like our Sun. This is American ingenuity, and a promise of discovery that unites us all."

The milestone comes 30 years after the first exoplanet was discovered around a star similar to our Sun, in 1995. (Prior to that, a few planets had been identified around stars that had burned all their fuel and collapsed.) Although researchers think there are billions of planets in the Milky Way galaxy, finding them remains a challenge. In addition to discovering many individual planets with fascinating characteristics as the total number of known exoplanets climbs, scientists are able to see how the general planet population compares to the planets of our own solar system.

For example, while our solar system hosts an equal number of rocky and giant planets, rocky planets appear to be more common in the universe. Researchers have also found a range of planets entirely different from those in our solar system. There are Jupiter-size planets that orbit closer to their parent star than Mercury orbits the Sun; planets that orbit two stars, no stars, and dead stars; planets covered in lava; some with the density of Styrofoam; and others with clouds made of gemstones.

"Each of the different types of planets we discover gives us information about the conditions under which planets can form and, ultimately, how common planets like Earth might be, and where we should be looking for them," said Dawn Gelino, head of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), located at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. "If we want to find out if we're alone in the universe, all of this knowledge is essential."

Searching for other worlds

Fewer than 100 exoplanets have been directly imaged, because most planets are so faint they get lost in the light from their parent star. The other four methods of planet detection are indirect. With the transit method, for instance, astronomers look for a star to dim for a short period as an orbiting planet passes in front of it.

To account for the possibility that something other than an exoplanet is responsible for a particular signal, most exoplanet candidates must be confirmed by follow-up observations, often using an additional telescope, and that takes time. That's why there is a long list of candidates in the NASA Exoplanet Archive (hosted by NExScI) waiting to be confirmed.

"We really need the whole community working together if we want to maximize our investments in these missions that are churning out exoplanets candidates," said Aurora Kesseli, the deputy science lead for the NASA Exoplanet Archive at IPAC. "A big part of what we do at NExScI is build tools that help the community go out and turn candidate planets into confirmed planets."

The rate of exoplanet discoveries has accelerated in recent years (the database reached 5,000 confirmed exoplanets just three years ago), and this trend seems likely to continue. Kesseli and her colleagues anticipate receiving thousands of additional exoplanet candidates from the ESA (European Space Agency) Gaia mission, which finds planets through a technique called astrometry, and NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will discover thousands of new exoplanets primarily through a technique called gravitational microlensing.

At NASA, the future of exoplanet science will emphasize finding rocky planets similar to Earth and studying their atmospheres for biosignatures -- any characteristic, element, molecule, substance, or feature that can be used as evidence of past or present life. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has already analyzed the chemistry of over 100 exoplanet atmospheres.

But studying the atmospheres of planets the size and temperature of Earth will require new technology. Specifically, scientists need better tools to block the glare of the star a planet orbits. And in the case of an Earth-like planet, the glare would be significant: The Sun is about 10 billion times brighter than Earth -- which would be more than enough to drown out our home planet's light if viewed by a distant observer.

NASA has two main initiatives to try overcoming this hurdle. The Roman telescope will carry a technology demonstration instrument called the Roman Coronagraph that will test new technologies for blocking starlight and making faint planets visible. At its peak performance, the coronagraph should be able to directly image a planet the size and temperature of Jupiter orbiting a star like our Sun, and at a similar distance from that star. With its microlensing survey and coronagraphic observations, Roman will reveal new details about the diversity of planetary systems, showing how common solar systems like our own may be across the galaxy.

Additional advances in coronagraph technology will be needed to build a coronagraph that can detect a planet like Earth. NASA is working on a concept for such a mission, currently named the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

More about ExEP, NExScI

NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program is responsible for implementing the agency's plans for the discovery and understanding of planetary systems around nearby stars. It acts as a focal point for exoplanet science and technology and integrates cohesive strategies for future discoveries. The science operations and analysis center for ExEP is NExScI, based at IPAC, a science and data center for astrophysics and planetary science at Caltech. JPL is managed by Caltech for NASA.

"Foundation Edition"

The sheer amount of times that people have received everything but the high-end GPU they ordered is frankly too absurd to count at this point. We've already seen metal blocks being delivered instead of a graphics card, pasta and rice packaged inside a 5090 box, and a 5070 Ti that was actually just a bag of salt. In comparison to that, receiving just a bland ol' brick instead of an RTX 5080 seems almost uninspired, but that's exactly what happened to u/GlassHistorical5303.

Our victim (who we'll call Glass for ease) ordered a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 from the firm's official store on Amazon. Unfortunately, what they got was a brick wrapped up in the same anti-static bag that the actual GPU usually comes in. Apart from the obvious implication that someone at the factory might've swapped the card, this actually suggests that a reverse-scam was in effect here. Someone may have gotten the real 5080 they wanted, took it out of the box, replaced it with a brick, and returned it to Amazon who didn't bother to properly check the contents.

You might be wondering how a returned package could be thrown in with the new stuff that's supposed to come from PNY's official store — this is where the issue of "commingling" comes in. That term refers to merging items from different sellers and channels into a single, unified inventory that makes the job super easy for logistics but remains effectively untracked. All the scammer needs to do is match the box's weight, replacing the 5080 with an identically heavy brick, and the scales tip in their favor (no pun intended).

In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Either that or, of course, an Amazon worker genuinely saw the opportunity and took the GPU for themselves. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. While we often find the fiasco entertaining — top comment called this GPU-brick the "Foundation Edition" — it's anything but that for the end user who is now just a sitting duck to the whims of customer service.

Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma befell another customer a year ago, when purchasing from Newegg. It's because of growing scams like these that we advise people to stay vigilant, no matter where you're buying from. Especially if you're shopping used, you may not get something strange in the box, but instead a GPU that literally has no core inside it.

The new, reinvigorated Commodore has announced that its maiden product reached a significant milestone. A few hours ago, the official Commodore account on X shared evidence that the Commodore 64 Ultimate had eclipsed the 10,000 units sold milestone. The statement also offered profuse thanks to the community.

On behalf of the entire Commodore team, a HUGE THANK YOU goes out to you, our incredible community. Hitting 10K pre-orders of the Commodore 64 Ultimate is only possible because of your passion and support.Together, we're not just reliving history, we're building the future… pic.twitter.com/l2YJmQBBgOSeptember 21, 2025

If you unfurl the embedded Tweet, above, you can see the growth in sales charted for the C64 Ultimate (all models). Things got off to a galloping start from the get-go on July 12 this year. From August, we have seen more steady progress in sales numbers. Interestingly, the chart has markers on the timeline to coincide with the ‘Let's Buy Commodore' video trilogy releases. These videos got hundreds of thousands of views (one over 400,000), so the Commodore management were obviously measuring the media impact on sales trends.

Our last report, on how Commodore successfully raked in over $2 million during the C64 Ultimate's debut week, coincided with a video release titled ‘Making History: Signing the Commodore Contract + C64 Ultimate Production Update.' We also saw a very positive blip in sales around that date. Perhaps people felt assured that Commodore was really back.

In a quick follow-up to the 10K milestone Tweet, Commodore reminded its fans that “there's still time to secure your spot in Batch 1 of the Commodore 64 Ultimate pre-orders over at https://www.commodore.net/ to make sure you'll be among the first to receive yours this year.” Pricing for this FPGA-powered retro-futuristic machine featuring the “world's first transparent keyboard circuit board” starts from $299. Readers are reminded that the “Founders Edition will be a one-time run,” and we don't have word on what will succeed it for latecomers – surely something very similar.

Retro computing fans should be cheered by this latest Commodore milestone, even if they aren't particularly interested in experiencing a modern C64. Remember, the new Commodore has quite boldly claimed that it will become a “Founder's Sandbox,” for new computer tech projects. Its roadmap will feature as many as 12 major releases over the next four years – which should be exciting for all computer enthusiasts.

Travelers at major European airports including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin faced significant delays this weekend following what Collins Aerospace described as a “cyber-related incident.”

Collins Aerospace makes technology for airline check-in desks, so after the apparent cyberattack, airlines were forced to revert to manual check-ins, according to the Guardian. According to data from Flightradar24, more than 130 Heathrow flights had been delayed by 20 minutes or more as of 11am on Sunday morning, with 13 flights canceled on Saturday.

A post on the Heathrow social media account said, “Work continues to resolve and recover from Friday's outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in. We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate.”

Heathrow, like other affected airports, has recommended that travelers arrive at least three hours before departure for long-haul flights, and at least two hours beforehand for short-haul flights.

Large tech companies have responded to President Donald Trump's dramatic changes to H-1B visa applications by telling employees with those visas to remain in the United States, according to multiple media reports.

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they're already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.

Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.

According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.

Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday's proclamation.”

This post has been updated with a quote from Karoline Leavitt.

They come in all shapes and sizes, leveraging a broad range of technologies, but some products could leave you scratching your head about the best way to fit them into your setup. Especially tiny sub 1-inch screens.

A peculiar case in point we noticed today is the $2.57 WeAct Display FS, listed on AliExpress. That price point seems irresistible for a highly-portable USB interface second screen. However, its postage stamp dimensions (it has a tiny 0.96-inch diagonal screen), means it is something of a curate's egg. This tiny screen isn't going to worry the makers of the best portable monitors, but could have its niche use cases.

 




The dimensions of the WeAct Display FS are more like a typical thumb drive storage device than a portable monitor. Specifications suggest the entire device measures 43 x 14.5mm, but we don't have a thickness measurement to share.

Another significant way it strays from the portable second screen norms is that WeAct's tiny screen doesn't accept a USB-C or HDMI connection – it has a captive USB-A interface (again, like many USB thumb drives). The connector is reversible in this instance, with an insulator pad supplied for the unused side.

One side of the WeAct Display FS is almost entirely taken up by its screen. As mentioned previously, this has a 0.96-inch diagonal. Using a bit of math, we can work out that the actual screen measures ~0.429 x 0.858 inches (~10.9 x 24.4mm).

Across this tiny display, there are 160 x 80 pixels (thus a 2:1 ratio). We also know the display uses the RGB565 (16-bit) color format, delivering up to 65,536 colors, which should be ample for its touted applications.

WeAct reckons that its little Display FS device is going to be useful for both system monitor and media projection applications. Indeed, two Windows applications are supplied, which are crafted for these purposes.

CNX Software notes that the code upon which the WeAct Studio System Monitor is based is open source. Thus, it is theoretically possible to use the WeAct Display FS and this app on systems other than Windows. Any Python supporting OS should do the trick, but you'll have to do more leg work to use this device as a tiny second screen on macOS or Linux, for example.

The origin of the WeAct Studio Screen Projection app isn't known, and it is thought to be a Windows-only app which emulates a Windows display. It is shown being configured to replay images / video from other screens. CNX Software expects it to be able to be used as a full-screen YouTube video or photo gallery playback device.

If this kind of tiny second screen has you intrigued, but the WeAct Display FS is too small for you, we spotted similar but larger devices on AliExpress. Moving the budget up to $10.76 means you could grab a 3.5-inch IPS Type-C Computer Secondary Screen, which is advertised as a great AIDA64-based system monitor (a very similar screen is $26 on Amazon). Stylishly circular 2.1-inch IPS screens with USB-C connectivity can be grabbed from $27.16 via AliExpress. But that's a significant circular premium to pay. Remember to check postage costs on AliExpress, too.

Personalizing the computers we own — whether it's a phone or a proper desktop — is one of life's few simple comforts. It can bring you joy knowing that your favorite picture will greet you every morning when you start your day. Now, movements behind the Windows 11 development scene indicate that pictures could soon be exchanged for videos. Microsoft has finally added the option to use video files as desktop backgrounds in the latest Windows 11 Insider build, and it works seamlessly, as spotted by @phantomofearth on X.

Windows DreamScene is back! Hidden in the latest Windows 11 Dev/Beta build (26x20.6690) is built in support for setting video files like .mp4 as your desktop background: pic.twitter.com/B4vdtfvqScSeptember 20, 2025

As the tweet says, some of you may remember Windows DreamScene from back in the day. It was a built-in utility that allowed users to put videos as their wallpaper... up until Vista. Unfortunately, DreamScene was pulled from Windows 7 and never made a comeback officially. In the meantime, alternatives like the ever-so-popular Wallpaper Engine rose to fame and replaced DreamScene in the zeitgeist. Many modern gamers today may not even remember that dynamic desktop backgrounds used to be a native feature of the OS.

 




Fortunately, Microsoft is finally answering the community's decades-long prayers and testing this feature. It's available as part of the Windows 11 26x20.6690 Dev/Beta builds, for which you have to join the Windows Insider program. Once in, all you have to do is enable feature ID 57645315 and restart the explorer.exe process in Task Manager. After that, just open settings, and you should see .mp4, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .avi, and .webm in the list of supported file formats when you go to select a new wallpaper. Simply pick a video you want and you're good to go.

Keep in mind that this feature only works on the desktop, not on the lockscreen so you're not going to get those macOS-style aesthetic TikToks out of your utilitarian Windows system anytime soon. More importantly, though, since this is an experimental feature, there's no saying when it will actually make its way to the stable, public release channel — if at all. Similar to the native speed test button that Microsoft is trialing, this feels like a fairly iterative yet obvious improvement that we should, therefore, see go mainstream relatively soon.

An incident at Collins Aerospace shut down the cloud back-end for its cMUSE platform this weekend, crippling kiosks and forcing manual fallback at Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels.

A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace brought parts of Europe's airport infrastructure to its knees this weekend, after a backend outage hit the company's cloud-based check-in system and knocked out self-service kiosks across multiple major hubs. The software in question — Collins' common-use MUSE platform — powers many airports' passenger processing stacks, allowing airlines to share check-in desks, kiosks, and boarding infrastructure through a single backend. On Saturday, that single point of failure failed.

Heathrow, Berlin Brandenburg, and Brussels Zaventem were among the major airports affected, with Brussels cancelling 45 out of 257 departing flights and warning passengers of delays up to 90 minutes. Heathrow said most flights were still running but slowed by manual fallback procedures, while Berlin suspended kiosk access altogether and shifted to direct airline processing.

Collins confirmed that the disruption was the result of a “cyber-related incident,” but has not disclosed the type of attack. What is clear is that the cMUSE outage exposed just how fragile Europe's airport IT stack has become. Designed to be flexible and scalable, cMUSE can be hosted in the cloud or deployed on-prem, but many airports rely on the cloud variant, which centralizes passenger data and logic for easier airline integration.

According to Collins' own documentation, cMUSE supports web-based agent stations, kiosk fleets, and mobile check-in endpoints through a centralized management plane. That's great for cost and updates, but not so great when that control layer goes dark. On-site systems like bag tag printers and biometric scanners are often integrated directly with MUSE, so they're not immune either.

The EU's NIS2 directive, which comes into force in October, broadens the legal definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not just airlines and airports, but IT suppliers that provide essential digital services to them. EASA's Part-IS rules, in parallel, are meant to bring aviation-grade cybersecurity to exactly these kinds of shared platforms, including common-use systems for baggage and check-in.

It's not yet clear how much of Collins' cMUSE infrastructure went down, or how many airline DCS links were affected. But it's clear that fallback worked only because staff rolled back to manual processes, not because systems failed gracefully. Heathrow said Sunday that it was continuing to recover from the outage, adding that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.

Sometimes the smartest way to protect your memories is to keep them off the cloud. Photos, videos, work projects, and all the little files that mark everyday life deserve safe storage without worrying about hacks, lost passwords or online outages. That's where a massive external hard drive comes in handy.

Right now, the Seagate 22TB external hard drive has dropped to just $249 on Amazon, its lowest price ever. That's about $0.01 per gigabyte, a record low cost for this much reliable storage. At launch it was selling for over $500, and today it's even priced lower than Seagate's 20TB model, while costing just about twice as much as a 5TB drive. No surprise it currently sits as the #1 best-seller in external hard drives on Amazon.

See at Amazon

If you're drowning in files, 22TB is a lifesaver. It lets you back up years of photos, hours of 4K or 8K video, hundreds of games or dense project folders without needing to switch between several drives. Every terabyte holds approximately 250,000 photos or over 100 hours of high-definition video, so 22TB is more than enough to safeguard an entire household's digital life with a little left over. And unlike cloud storage, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee.

This Seagate drive is also USB 3.0 compatible so data is transferred easily and rapidly, including large files. Export video production projects, collections of games, or simply perform a routine backup and the process is seamless. Simply plug in and you can transfer files without installing additional software.

Seagate also provides rescue data recovery services, which offers peace of mind if something unfortunate befalls the drive.

It has more than 260,000 Amazon reviews with an average rating of 4.6/5 stars, bearing witness to its high quality and endurance over the decades.

On a practical level, there's also the value calculation: Paying $249 for 22TB means the cost per terabyte is lower than any smaller drives on the market right now. To put it simply, you're getting more space for less money compared to buying multiple smaller-capacity drives. Make sure you don't miss that opportunity.

KPop Demon Hunters has dominated streaming and the box office this summer, but KPop Defamation Hunters landed a win in a different venue: the South Korean courts. The South Korean virtual boy band Plave, which is made up of five members who only ever appear as animations, successfully sued a person who made derogatory comments about the group online.

According to the BBC, the unidentified social media user made a series of insulting posts about the band in July 2024. Among the attacks: he suggested the people behind the virtual band members “could be ugly in real life” and said they gave off a “typical Korean man vibe.” Some of the posts also included profanity, which doesn't seem that offensive, but neither do the posts, so it's probably worth mentioning.

The person who made the posts attempted to argue that the comments were directed at the avatars that front the group and not the real people lending their voices to the virtual band members. The court didn't buy it and declared that the avatars represent someone real, so the attacks extend beyond the virtual fronts to the people behind them.

The victory landed Plave 500,000 South Korean won in total, 100,000 per band member, which works out to just over $70 a pop. Not exactly a fortune for a group that already has more than one million subscribers on YouTube, sold more than 500,000 units of their most recent album in the first week, and performs concerts that attract tens of thousands of fans. It's also much less than the band asked for. They were seeking 6.5 million won for each performer, which would have worked out to about $4,650 per member and $23,250 total. The band claimed that the comments caused emotional stress for the group.

Vlast, the band's label, intends to appeal the damages granted by the court, according to the BBC, arguing that it is too low for a case that sets a precedent for defamation against virtual avatars. While it does seem like the ruling is the first instance of defamation against virtual pop stars, it's not uncommon for Korean music labels to pursue charges against internet trolls. Several labels in the country have made a concerted effort to go after people who badmouth acts online. The virtual band trend, to some extent, is considered a response to the type of attention and pressure that pop stars receive in Korea.

We all want to feel more secure in our own homes, but the reality is that most traditional security cameras are a hassle. The wired ones are a headache to install with all of the cables, and the wireless ones tend to be expensive and still keep you replacing batteries every year. That is why this deal on the eufy security SoloCam S220 is so appealing right now. Amazon has discounted a 2-pack of these outdoor security cameras to just $119 (from $229, 45% off), best price ever, and that's about $59 per camera for solar-powered, wireless 2K security.

See at Amazon

In contrast to the never-ending decisions that have you toggling between cables or battery reminders, the SoloCam S220 solves the biggest headaches: Each camera is fueled by a hidden solar panel that requires only three hours of direct sunlight per day to keep charged all year long. After plugging it up, you never have to give it another thought, and you can set it almost anywhere on your property without having to run cords back into the home. The compact frame makes it unobtrusive and the setup process is as simple as drilling one small hole.

The main appeal of this pack isn't just the price but how complete it feels: You're getting 2K resolution video, which means the image is sharper than standard HD. That extra detail can really matter when you're glancing at motion alerts or zooming in on what set off the camera. Night vision is also improved by the f/1.6 aperture and infrared LEDs, which let in more light so even when it is pitch black you are seeing sharp images of your garden.

Another plus is the AI motion detection built into every device. Rather than constantly ping-pinging you with alerts every time the breeze stirs a twig across the sensor, it recognizes when someone approaches your area. That way, notifications are far more useful as you'll know whether it's your children coming home from school, an incoming package or someone else entirely. Because the data processing is done on the camera itself, the whole system avoids using cloud subscriptions, thus safeguarding your privacy. And best of all, there are no additional or monthly fees.

It is well worth the thought of the peace of mind offered on a daily basis by these cameras. Instead of needing to remember to replace batteries every winter, worry about an intruder stumbling over a cord, or pay monthly subscription fees, you pay once and you're set with solar power and built-in AI. With Amazon now offering this 2-camera set for a mere $119, today is the perfect time to invest in that system.

Getting hired (getting an apartment, ...) is easier in the US as there are significantly less challenges at terminating those contracts by the 'provider' than in e.g. Germany, where it's really hard to fire or evict someone.

Now the flip side of it is - how will they control the outsourcing that typically comes with the H1B restriction? Every enterprise these days has an India development center (banks, telcos, pharma, big-tech, manufacturing, etc.). If they've had the money, they have established it. They can just scale up the hiring there. On second thoughts that's what they were all doing anyway and saying it was AI.

Phil Parkinson has explained how Wrexham were able to contain “best in the league” Josh Sargent when taking on Norwich City. The USMNT striker headed into that contest with six goals to his name, but drew a blank against the Red Dragons as the Welsh outfit claimed a notable 3-2 win at Carrow Road - helping to ease some of the pressure that had been building on their boss.

Ballon d'Or favourite Ousmane Dembélé may still make Monday's award ceremony despite his Paris Saint-Germain side now having to play their postponed Ligue 1 game at Marseille at exactly the same time.

He is injured for the match at the Stade Velodrome and PSG bosses must now decide if he is permitted to go to the Paris event.

The bulk of the Champions League-winning squad will have to miss the bash.

Le Classique was due to take place on Sunday but heavy rain meant it was put back to Monday, despite Marseille playing again on Friday at Strasbourg before hosting Ajax in the Champions League on Tuesday September 30.

The other option was to postpone to December but the league announced a Monday kick-off instead.

The free-scoring England international has already reached 13 through just seven appearances, with his second Bundesliga hat-trick of the 2025-26 campaign being recorded in a thumping victory for Vincent Kompany's side away at Hoffenheim.

The Manchester United defender was called out for "getting away with murder" by the outspoken ex-captain, but has vowed to show more consistency after bouncing back with a strong display against Chelsea.

Arsenal's perfect start to the new Women's Super League season came to an end on Sunday at Manchester United as the Gunners were held to a 0-0 draw in a game they had the better of. Olivia Smith hit the crossbar, Caitlin Foord whistled an effort just wide and Alessia Russo had a decent opportunity through on goal saved as Renee Slegers' side turned the screw in a hard-fought encounter, but the visitors had to settle for a point on the road in the end.

It was United who started brightest, with Melvine Malard the recipient of a good chance inside the opening minute, but Arsenal would grow into the game, and as their pressing started to trouble the Red Devils, opportunities arose. That said, there was a lack of clear-cut opportunites throughout the 90 minutes and the Gunners didn't test opposing goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce enough, with it often from the edge of the box or an unfavourable angle that the looks at goal came.

Even those half-chances dried up in the second period, despite Slegers being able to throw on the likes of Chloe Kelly and Beth Mead from a star-studded bench. There were positives at the other end of the pitch, though, with United themselves limited to few big moments as 18-year-old Katie Reid continued to look incredibly promising in the heart of defence alongside the experienced Steph Catley, whose fantastic block to deny Malard proved crucial in the end as the Gunners were at least able to keep their first clean sheet of the new campaign.

Ruben Amorim capped off Manchester United's hard-fought victory over Chelsea with a classy gesture that has further endeared him to the Red Devils faithful. Despite torrential rain lashing down outside Old Trafford, the United boss stayed until late in the evening to sign autographs and take photos with supporters. The act of appreciation followed a much-needed 2-1 win that lifted pressure and boosted morale.

England's kits for the 2026 FIFA World Cup have reportedly been leaked, with the Football Association seemingly opting for a safe design following the controversy over their Euro 2024 attire.

Leaked images were shared online by the website Footy Headlines which are claimed to be the designs for the England kits for next summer's tournament.

The home kit will maintain the Three Lions' classic white shirt with claims it will also feature ‘modern touches'.

This reportedly includes a jacquard pattern, which will display both a lion and stars.

Red inserts are expected to be featured on the design, complete with a navy outline.

Typical features will include the one star denoting England's 1966 World Cup triumph, which will be placed above the badge.

The collar will reportedly feature the words ‘Happy and Glorious' in a reference to the national anthem.

Should the leaked images prove accurate, the designs would likely avoid the controversy that surrounded England's kit for the 2024 European Championships.

Nike, England's kit provider, had angered a section of supporters after making a 'playful update' to St. George's Cross.

The update had seen the traditional red cross with a navy blue, light blue and pink one.

Amid a backlash against the change, Sir Keir Starmer - then opposition leader - had been among those to call for the design to be changed back.  

'The flag's unifying, it doesn't need to change,' Starmer said at the time. 'We just need to be proud of it. So I think they should just reconsider this and change it back.'  

The controversy led to England's red away kit outselling the home strip for the first time, according to some retailers.

Designs are yet to be confirmed for the away kit for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, but England are expected to return to their traditional red strip.

The Three Lions had worn a blue away kit for Euro 2024.

England are closing in on qualification for the World Cup having moved seven points clear at the top of their qualification group.

Official details on England's kits are likely to be released later this year, after Thomas Tuchel's men seal qualification for the World Cup.

The kits are expected to go on sale next year in the build-up to the tournament.

ENGLAND'S kit for the 2026 World Cup has been leaked.

FA chiefs have opted for a clean and safe design after the controversy surrounding the Euro 2024 shirt.

The Three Lions have continued the classic look with the white home shirt boasting modern touches.

There is an intricate jacquard pattern on the chest and torso displaying a lion and stars.

Red inserts complement a navy trim around the neck and sleeves, similar to the Euro 2020 kit.

The inside of the collar also bears the words 'Happy and Glorious' from the national anthem.

The safe look should help The FA avoid the controversy that surrounded the previous kit, which was used for Euro 2024.

Some fans branded the previous shirt "woke" after the colours of the St George's flag were changed.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer even slammed the FA and Nike for changing the “unifying” St George's flag, but manufacturers refused to revert back to the traditional colours.

The controversy led away shirt sales to better the home top for the first time ever.

England have returned to the traditional red for their away kit for the next World Cup, despite the navy-purple look selling well.

However the design is still yet to be released, or leaked, though it could follow a similar safe style to the home jersey.

The esteemed Golden Ball has been elusive to so many great footballers down the years, but who deserved it the most? 

Back in 1995, the Ballon d'Or became eligible to non-European players for the first time, which helped it to become the most sought-after award in the sport. A grand total of 17 players have won it since then, including African icon George Weah, Brazilian quartet Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaka, and Argentine maestro Lionel Messi, who has dominated the vote over the last 16 years with a record haul of eight wins.

Meanwhile, Portuguese goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo has brought the Golden Ball back to Europe on five occasions, and Mathias Sammer, Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Michael Owen, Pavel Nedved, Andriy Shevchenko, Fabio Cannavaro, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema and Rodri have each claimed the prestigious prize once. All of those players were deserving winners, too, but so were many of the superstars they beat to the top of the podium.

As we edge closer to the 2025 winner being crowned, GOAL has ranked the top 10 greatest footballers to never win the Ballon d'Or, starting with a man who scored a whopping 573 career goals on his way to lifting 34 trophies...

EFL

Wrexham's first league victory over Norwich City being broadcast live on TV in the United States should have surprised no one.

Last season, the club owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney were the only one of the 72 EFL members to have every league fixture shown in the U.S., underlining their big appeal on the other side of the Atlantic.

Throw in the extra intrigue of USMNT striker Josh Sargent leading the Norwich attack and it really was a no-brainer for Paramount+ to make the game one of their three 3pm kick-offs shown live on Saturday.

The presence of the Missouri-born 25-year-old — rated by Phil Parkinson as “the best striker in the league” — meant this was always going to be a stiff test for a Wrexham back line who have been coughing up far too many chances since winning promotion.

It was one they passed as a tweak of formation, with two debutants in Issa Kabore and Dominic Hyam starting in a re-jigged back five, led to Wrexham deservedly prevailing 3-2.

“It's about striking a balance,” said Parkinson when asked about fielding two holding midfielders in a 3-4-2-1 setup. “Football is about trying to be secure at one end and keep the attacking threat that we'd shown so far this season.

“We set out in pre-season with the two systems but the injuries we've had meant we were unable to implement it with the personnel we wanted. This was the first chance.”

The ploy worked well.

It not only afforded Wrexham the freedom to get at their hosts, as two-goal Josh Windass and Lewis O'Brien provided excellent support for lone striker Kieffer Moore. But the defence also looked much more secure than it has all season, even allowing for the two lapses in concentration that were punished ruthlessly by Jack Stacey and Jovon Makama.

It was certainly a big improvement on the mess from the previous week, when QPR were effectively granted the freedom of north Wales in a resounding 3-1 victory that could have been even more emphatic.

Parkinson's response was to bring Manchester City loanee Kabore in for his debut at right wing-back, as Ryan Longman switched to the opposite flank. Hyam also got the nod ahead of Conor Coady at the heart of the defence, as Callum Doyle and Max Cleworth slotted in either side of the former Blackburn Rovers man.

The changes worked brilliantly. Not only did Kabore provide two stunning assists from the right flank — Windass and Longman the beneficiaries — but there was a cohesion to Wrexham's defensive efforts that had been totally lacking against QPR a week earlier.

Along with the pace and power provided by Kabore, perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the afternoon was how seamlessly Hyam slotted into the back three. He read the play well, never shirked a challenge and was a tower of strength in the air.

Considering Hyam was up against Sargent, that was no mean feat. Having been recalled to Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad earlier this month for the friendly double-header against South Korea and Japan, the Norwich captain is eyeing a place at next year's World Cup.

A glance at Sargent's metrics for Norwich points towards someone who makes the most of any service that comes his way. Prior to Wrexham's visit, his five goals had come from 121 touches of the ball spread across five games, according to Opta.

That was a goal 😆

— Wrexham AFC (@Wrexham_AFC) September 20, 2025



Just 21 of those had come in the opposition penalty area, suggesting a ruthless efficiency when the ball did find the striker. Those five goals had come from a mere 16 shots this season.

Moore, by way of contrast, had four goals from the same number of shots but he'd been much more involved, chalking up 195 touches including 11 headed clearances.

Against Wrexham, Sargent saw slightly more of the ball. He had a season's high 35 touches in total, including six in the opposition penalty area. And yet his three attempts came with a combined expected goals (xG) of just 0.09, underling what a good job Hyam and his team-mates did on the U.S. striker.

The one time Sargent did briefly find space from a first-half corner, a combination of Hyam and Doyle ensured he was quickly forced wide before hitting a shot that was blocked.

Otherwise, it was an afternoon to forget for Norwich's talisman, who turned down a big-money move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg during the summer.

“We were up against probably the best striker in the league today in Josh Sargent,” says Parkinson. “We did a lot of work on him, how we felt we had to deal with him. He's a dangerous player but our concentration levels were good.

“There was a lot of fatigue out there eventually, as they tracked his runs, they got tight to him and limited a really good player to very little.”

Parkinson was also full of praise for Kabore, who had an exemplary afternoon down the right. He had 48 touches (only Cleworth with 66 and Ben Sheaf with 61 managed more for the visitors), sent over nine crosses (six more than anyone else in red) and managed two headed clearances to go with his assists for Windass and Longman.

“What can I say about Issy?” adds Parkinson. “The medical team were behind me and saying, ‘His sprint distances are completely off the scale, can we get him off?' But he was doing such a good job defensively.

“For us, we have had very attack-minded wing-backs in recent years. He is that. But we also needed someone with a defensive mindset as well. In one-v-one situations against a really good player in (Papa) Diallo, he had to stick to his task.

“I just hope Pep (Guardiola) doesn't get a video of the game as he might want him back!”

Wrexham are far from the finished article defensively. How can they be when their expected goals against (xGA) stands at 14.5, at least two goals more than any of their peers. They've also faced 115 shots, 14 more than anyone else.

But, there was enough in the Norwich victory to suggest a corner has been turned and that things should continue to improve in the coming weeks as, effectively, a new squad gets to grips with the Championship.

“I wanted the lads to enjoy this game,” adds Parkinson. “Four years ago we were down this way and playing King's Lynn away in front of 800 people. I want people to understand how far we have come.”

As Mexico prepares to welcome millions of visitors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the country is undertaking a major overhaul of its payment systems to fully leverage the anticipated global tourism surge. With an estimated 5.5 million fans expected, seamless, secure, and modern payment infrastructure has become critical for converting international visitor spending into substantial economic gains. The higher average spending of foreign tourists—nearly three times that of local consumers—makes efficient payment processing a strategic necessity across retail, hospitality, entertainment, and food and beverage sectors.The push for modernization is driven not only by transaction volume but also by the diverse payment preferences of global travelers, including credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless options. Streamlined systems will allow businesses to scale operations during peak periods, ensure frictionless transactions at hotels, stadiums, restaurants, and retail outlets, and enhance overall visitor experience. By investing in advanced, agile payment platforms, Mexico aims to transform the influx of international fans into measurable economic growth while positioning its tourism and hospitality sectors for long-term success.Advertisement  Recent data on consumer spending patterns underscores the urgency. International tourists, though they represent a relatively small portion of total transactions, contribute disproportionately to overall spending. On average, foreign visitors spend almost three times more per purchase than local consumers. At points of sale, international tourists are estimated to spend around MX\$1,015 (US\$55) per transaction, compared to MX\$356 (US\$19.33) by domestic shoppers. This significant difference in transaction values illustrates the need for payment systems capable of efficiently handling larger, high-value purchases while minimizing friction.For businesses operating in Mexico during the World Cup, upgrading payment infrastructure is no longer a luxury. Retailers, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues must be able to process a wide array of payment methods quickly and securely. Accepting international credit cards, digital wallets, and contactless payments is essential, as failure to do so could result in lost sales and dissatisfied visitors. Modern payment platforms that combine agility, security, and global compatibility are poised to become strategic enablers of revenue growth rather than mere conveniences.Advertisement  The sports and entertainment sector, in particular, stands to benefit from comprehensive payment integration. From ticket purchases to in-stadium concessions, smooth and reliable payment experiences can significantly enhance customer satisfaction while increasing operational efficiency. Efficient checkout processes reduce queues and transaction bottlenecks, especially during peak times, ensuring that fans enjoy a seamless experience while venues maximize revenue opportunities.Similarly, the food and beverage industry can leverage advanced payment technology to handle surges in demand efficiently. Optimized checkout systems can reduce transaction times from several seconds to nearly instantaneous, enabling businesses to scale operations without compromising service quality. Faster and frictionless payments not only improve customer satisfaction but also increase the number of transactions handled per hour, directly contributing to higher revenues during high-traffic events like the World Cup.Advertisement  Beyond transactional efficiency, the broader tourism and hospitality sectors are beginning to view digital payment experiences as a critical component of service quality. International travelers increasingly expect fast, secure, and contactless payment options. From booking accommodations online to paying for meals, transportation, and entertainment, seamless digital transactions are becoming as important as the physical quality of service. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators that adopt global payment solutions and contactless technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, ensuring that visitors enjoy a hassle-free experience from arrival to departure.Looking forward, businesses preparing for the World Cup must focus on three key pillars of payment modernization:Diversifying payment methods to accommodate international visitor preferences, including credit cards, digital wallets, and other emerging payment technologies.Minimizing friction at checkout to prevent cart abandonment, reduce queues, and speed up transactions across all points of sale.Delivering personalized payment experiences that foster customer loyalty and encourage repeat business beyond the duration of the tournament.The upcoming World Cup presents Mexico with a unique economic opportunity. Effective payment systems can unlock higher spending from international visitors, optimize operations across multiple sectors, and enhance the overall visitor experience. Conversely, outdated or inefficient payment infrastructure could limit revenue potential and damage the country's reputation as a world-class destination for major events.As the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaches, modern, secure, and versatile payment systems will not just support businesses—they will shape the nation's ability to fully capitalize on the influx of global visitors. The tournament represents a chance to demonstrate Mexico's readiness to host millions of international travelers while setting new benchmarks in seamless, high-value transaction management. For companies across industries, investing in modern payment infrastructure is no longer optional—it is a strategic imperative to maximize both operational efficiency and economic gain.Advertisement  Share On:Tags: Digital Payments, mexico tourism, Travel News, World Cup 2026Subscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News

Italy secured a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup final by defeating Ukraine 2-1, with Jasmine Paolini leading the charge. Paolini rallied to win her singles match and teamed up with Sara Errani for the decisive doubles victory. In the other semifinal, the United States will face Great Britain, who are aiming for their first title.

Italy advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup final for the third consecutive year after its doubles pair secured a decisive victory to defeat first-time semifinalist Ukraine 2-1 on Friday.

Jasmine Paolini played a starring role for the Italians, rallying to win her singles match before teaming with Sara Errani to clinch the doubles point.

Kostyuk gives Ukraine the early lead

World No. 26 Marta Kostyuk gave Ukraine a strong start, defeating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2, 6-3. The 23-year-old Ukrainian did not face a single break point and converted four of eight chances on Cocciaretto's serve. The win improved Kostyuk's record to 3-0 against the Italian and to 10-3 overall in singles at the Billie Jean King Cup.

Paolini rallies to even the score

World No. 8 Paolini responded in the second singles match, coming from a set and a break down to beat No. 13 Elina Svitolina 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Svitolina, who led their head-to-head 2-0, appeared headed for another victory after building a 6-3, 4-2 lead. But Paolini stormed back, earning her sixth win in her last seven Billie Jean King Cup matches to level the tie at 1-1. Svitolina, seeking a record-extending 19th victory for Ukraine in the competition, was left disappointed as her team's dream of reaching its first final was put on hold.

Paolini returns with Errani to seal the final berth

Italy turned to its experienced doubles duo, Paolini and Sara Errani, to finish the job. They faced Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok, breaking early for a 3-0 lead before closing out the first set 6-2.

Although the Ukrainians jumped ahead 3-1 in the second set, the Italians reeled off five straight games to complete a 6-2, 6-2 victory and book their spot in Sunday's final. The win underlined Paolini's histrionics in the competition for the second year running. The 29-year-old had come also come from behind in her singles match against Wang Xinyu earlier in the week to help the Italians move into the last four.

He did indeed, in a performance that Knowles also called "pure magic." The American won 80% of the points on his first serve and was never broken, while breaking the Spaniard three times.Entering the match with 13 consecutive match wins, Alcaraz never was able to find the extra gear to overcome a charging Fritz. He made 19 unforced errors in 17 games, while Fritz only made 10 (to go along with 17 winners)."The other three times I've played Carlos, he's broken me first game every single time," Fritz continued. "That's not how you want to start against someone like him. Getting out of that first game was huge, and just playing a lot of the big points with conviction."I didn't second-guess myself. I didn't play too safe. I played with no fear on a lot of the big points."

Part of the "magic," too, might've come from Fritz's connection with captain Andre Agassi.The top-ranked U.S. player called playing under the International Tennis Hall of Famer "an honor" and that the two had been talking shop "all day" in preparation for the match.Read more: “It's time to dance, baby!” Andre Agassi and Yannick Noah bring new blood to Laver Cup"I feel like I've always played some of my best tennis at Laver Cup," Fritz said.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen was never headed on Sunday in Baku to claim his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

Max Verstappen admits his lights-to-flag victory in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was "fantastic" having comfortably controlled Sunday's race to take back-to-back Formula 1 wins.

The Red Bull driver was never headed over 51-laps on the streets of Baku, having held the lead from pole and, after an early Safety Car restart, slowly pulled away from Carlos Sainz and then George Russell, the pair completing the podium.

"I think this weekend has been incredible for us," said Verstappen after his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

"Of course, last [F1] weekend was already great, but for us to win here again is just fantastic. I think also in the race, the car was working really well on both of the compounds [of tyre]. We had clean air all of the time and then you could look after your tyres and it was pretty straightforward.

“Of course, it's not easy around here. It was very windy today, so the car was always moving around a lot, but of course, I'm incredibly happy with this performance.”

With Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri crashing out on the opening lap and title rival Lando Norris only seventh, Verstappen has closed the gap to the top of the table down to just 69 points with seven races remaining.

But the Dutchman was cautious about his title chances despite McLaren enduring its worse weekend of the season and missing out on the Constructors' Championship in Baku.

“It's difficult to say at the moment, but for sure, the last two race weekends have been amazing for us," said Verstappen on mounting a title challenge.

"Singapore is a completely different challenge again with the high downforce, but we will see what we can do there.”

It was a strong day for Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda claiming his best result for the team in sixth having applied late pressure to Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson in the closing stages.

"Happy with it, especially the pace I showed today is a lot different to other race weekends," said Tsunoda.

"I think I got supported a lot from the team to change massively like this internally and also the efforts I put in over the weeks, definitely shows some improvement there.

"Everything matches well and to be able to secure this result, which definitely is a positive. Some bits I can improve for sure and sharpen up more quality but was a good race."

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Esteban Ocon's day in Azerbaijan got even worse with the news that a disqualification had followed up his Q1 exit.

Esteban Ocon has been disqualified from Saturday's Qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after it was deemed that his Haas car had breached F1's Technical Regulations.

After dropping out in the first Q1 phase in 18th position, Ocon and Haas were summoned to see the stewards over an alleged breach of Article 3.15.17 of the FIA Technical Regulations – relating to the rear wing main plane tip deflection test.

According to a note issued by FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer, the deflection figures measured on Ocon's rear wing during post-session checks exceeded the allowed deflection of 0.5mm.

As is the usual outcome with such a technical violation, a follow up from the stewards later confirmed that Ocon had been disqualified from the session.

“The FIA representatives described the test procedure used and reported that the distance between the two sections of RV-RW-PROFILES and RV-RW-TIP inboard of Y=525 varied by more than the permitted 0.5mm (0.6mm on the left side and 0.825mm on the right side,” read the stewards' decision document.

“The calibration of the measuring instrument was verified and valid.

“The team conceded that the test procedure as outlined in the regulations had been followed and explained that the discrepancy was a result of a problem with the production of the assembly of this specific part.

“The stewards determine that the vehicle does not comply with the regulations and hence impose the usual penalty of disqualification from the Qualifying classifications.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Russell battles through illness to take a podium in Baku

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.

After one of the most epic Qualifying sessions in living memory, it's a highly mixed-up starting order for the 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Perhaps the only unsurprising thing was the man who came through it all to grab pole in the dying moments, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

The Red Bull driver's final flyer deprived Williams' Carlos Sainz of P1 glory and the Spaniard thus lines up second. Behind those F1 veterans are two of the youngest men in the field, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.

On row three are the sister Mercedes and Red Bull cars of George Russell and Yuki Tsunoda, while you have to go down to P7 to find the first of the McLarens, that of Lando Norris, who's just ahead of Isack Hadjar in the second Racing Bulls machine.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc complete the top 10, both the McLaren star and the four-time Baku polesitter having crashed heavily in Q3 as drizzle fell around the Baku City Circuit.

At the very back of the order we have Esteban Ocon. The Frenchman originally qualified in 18th place, but was subsequently disqualified after his Haas car failed a post-session inspection due to a rear wing technical infringement.

UPDATED: The man arrested for allegedly shooting into the lobby of Sacramento ABC affiliate KXTV (ABC10) was released from jail on bond Saturday, then taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge, according to Sacramento County Main Jail records.


	Anibal Hernandezsantana, 64, of Sacramento, was arrested in connection with Friday's shooting on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm. 


	Sacramento officials confirmed Hernandezsantana had been released from the jail by Saturday afternoon after posting $200,000 bail. He was then arrested later that day on federal charges, an FBI spokesperson told the Sacramento Bee.

	











	Hernandezsantana is accused of violating federal statute 47 USC 333, which states no person can “willfully or maliciously interfere” with radio communications licensed or authorized by the federal government. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The shooting Friday occurred one day after a protest was held outside the station over the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! 


	The motive of the shooting remains under investigation.


	Hernandezsantana is scheduled to appear in Sacramento federal court Monday. He's due to appear in Sacramento Superior Court Tuesday afternoon on the local charges. according to jail records.


	Officers responded to reports of shots fired at the TV station shortly after 1:30 pm Friday. Sacramento Police Officer Anthony Gamble said at least three gunshots were fired at the building from a passing vehicle. 

	











	Police later was able to identify the vehicle, leading officers to a Sacramento residence and Hernandezsantana's subsequent arrest.


	ABC News photos showed three bullet holes in the window of the building's lobby. The station said a person was in the lobby at the time of the shooting, but was not injured. 


	Hernandezsantana was being booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail. 


	In a statement to ABC News, ABC10 station owner Tegna, said it “is fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees.” Security also has been increased at the station. 


	The demonstration outside the building Thursday was part of widespread protests over ABC's suspension of Kimmel following his comments about Charlie Kirk, including one held outside Disney studios in Burbank and another in Hollywood where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is taped. Attendees at the Sacramento protest held signs reading “First Amendment,” “Resist” and “You're Next” among others.

Bring back Michael Eisner and send Bob Iger off to the Weather Channel.

“The MAGA gang was desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”
What don't people understand about this statement?

The shooter wasn't from the Right Wing party. Even his own family said he was a Left Wing supporter,in a relationship with a Transgender. Stop your ignorance.

Some people get their news from Kimmel, apparently.

Lol

California as a state should break away or at minimum break into 3 or more different states, then maybe the differences being displayed, those associated individuals whom are upset, can run their own environment and see who's plot of land can function without discord, or if anything allow society as a whole discover and witnesses which of the two will last the longest as a civil society.  If anything, what's left over from building the wall in the south can keep those Californians confined to their own desirable homes, neighborhoods, places that they feel comfortable and can express their feelings, emotions, and influences among themselves without any outside interference. Give them what they want and allow them to sleep in the bed(s) that are made. (Example: Look at Spain on a map)

This is treason.  You are not an American. Adults use words to solve their problems and find solutions.

This isn't treason, asshole. Treason is January 6th.

I don't know which is worse…that this shooting might be a “targeted” shooting or a “random” shooting.

What kind of place is Sacramento where random shootings are commonplace?

It's not commonplace.

A handful of wealthy conservative people are to blame for this.  Aside from David (and Larry) Ellison and Shari Redstone (the Sykdance/Paramount merger), another name that people need to know is Nexstar CEO Perry Sook.  The Dallas-based CEO is very conservative and is trying to purchase Tegna in order to become the largest owner of TV stations in the country.  The FCC's rules currently say that no one can own stations that reach more than 40% of the US population – but with the Tegna purchase, Nexstar would exceed 40%.  So naturally, they objected to Kimmel's non-controversial statement so their merger can proceed.  And Sook wants Carr to give Nexstar an exemption so the Tegna purchase can go through.  So blame Carr, Sook, Ellison, Redstone, and a few others for eroding the First Amendment.

How about blame the mental case behind the trigger? This is the way to solve problems? It's not a left/right problem. It's a right/wrong problem and the left has lost their moral compass.

Scott Derrickson has made millions on the unnerving emptiness between fragments of film grain. The horror films the director has made with screenwriter C. Robert Cargill — “Sinister” and “The Black Phone” in particular — have used the aesthetics of Super 8 film to create a suggestive aura of supernatural menace. “The Black Phone 2” is no exception, with grain so dense in certain sequences that the actors are reduced to ghostly silhouettes. It's an effective technique, which is probably why Derrickson keeps using it. 

 










The Super 8 (and modified Super 16) sequences in “The Black Phone 2” provide the film with its most horrific imagery: fragmented shots of red feathers littering the snow around a child's abandoned parka and thick, viscous blood oozing from a tree stump in the frozen woods. These are all echoes — some prophetic, others from the past — that recur in the dreams experienced by Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), younger sister of Finney (Mason Thames), the siblings that were also at the center of the original “The Black Phone.”

Finney triumphed at the end of that film, dispatching child-snatching serial killer the Grabber (Ethan Hawke) with help from the ghosts of his previous victims and one of Gwen's psychic visions. But that doesn't matter in a horror movie, particularly a supernatural one. And so the Grabber is back, calling from beyond the grave to threaten Finney with not only his own demise, but that of his little sister as well. Hawke returns too, grumbling and growling behind a rubber mask (and, eventually, some grisly prosthetics). And thank goodness, because there are some thick blocks of dialogue to get through here, and only an actor of Hawke's caliber could make them work. 

Part of the charm of the “Black Phone” movies is that their threat is anachronistic. The number of pay phones in the United States has fallen sharply since the mobile revolution, making it next to impossible for a disembodied malevolent spirit to terrorize any misfit kids through phone booths today. “The Black Phone 2” takes place in 1981, a fact that's nearly impossible to forget with the repeated, winking era-specific references and lines about a character being “deader than disco.” 

The plot of both films also depends on their teenage characters being relatively unsupervised, an equally anachronistic touch that “The Black Phone 2” shares with its most obvious inspiration: the “A Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. Specifically, Gwen takes on a leading role in this film that's very similar to Patricia Arquette's character in “A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,” but with the staff of a snowed-in Christian summer camp at her back rather than the patients at a youth psychiatric hospital. 

 










These include Ernesto (Miguel Mora), the younger brother of a character from the previous film (also played by Mora) and Gwen's innocent puppy-love suitor; camp supervisor Armando (Demián Bichir), who provides a living link to macabre events that occurred there decades earlier; and Mercedes (Arianna Rivas), Armando's equestrian niece. Attempts to add a bit of Latinx flair to the dialogue largely fizzle. But, like Hawke, Bichir does a heroic job carrying the burden of explaining the film's lore — an essential function in a backstory-heavy effort like this one. 

Most of the flaws in “The Black Phone 2” can be traced back to its screenplay, from some of the more cringeworthy dialogue to the unwieldy chunks of exposition and a thematic thread that affirms the existence of Heaven and Hell, and, therefore, the validity of Christian belief. This is not an unusual message for a horror film — the entire possession subgenre is built on Catholic dogma, as is the “Conjuring” series. What makes it worthy of critique here is the inconsistent way in which it's applied, setting up a more thoughtful take on the hypocrisy of organized religion only to abandon it when it's time to send the Grabber back to Hell. 

Derrickson acquits himself more admirably, adding blood-soaked flair not only to the film's analog sequences but also the digital ones. A scene where Gwen is terrified by the appearance of three boys who were murdered on the campgrounds back in 1957 is a masterclass in creative gore effects, slicing one boy's head in half diagonally on a windowpane, watching it slither to the ground, and leaving it to sputter and twitch as blood pools around what's left of his face. The film also builds on a famous effect from “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” spinning bodies and flinging them around like marionettes whose puppeteer is having a seizure as the characters battle the invisible foe in Gwen's dreams. 

 










Still, a complaint that's also common to contemporary horror films nags at “The Black Phone 2,” in that all of the best things about this movie come from other movies, whether they be the creative team's previous efforts or iconic titles from decades past. (It's not just “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” either; the majority of the action takes place as the characters are snowed in at an isolated location, making comparisons to “The Shining” equally inescapable.) These elements are enjoyable, which is precisely why they're recycled here. And maybe that's good enough for a horror sequel. But good enough will never be more than just that. 

“The Black Phone 2” premiered at Fantastic Fest 2025. Universal Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, October 17.

Troy Kotsur is hoping the mobster role he plays on Netflix‘s Black Rabbit will open further doors for deaf performers in Hollywood.


	The In Cold Light star, who made history as the first male deaf actor to win an Oscar for his supporting role in CODA, portrays Joe Mancuso, the head of the criminal underworld. In the crime-thriller miniseries from Netflix, Jude Law's rising restauranteur is thrust into New York City's dark underbelly when his ne'er do well brother (Jason Bateman) returns with loan sharks on his tail.


	“I'm sure folks in the audience have really never seen a mobster who happens to be deaf. It was really fun and exciting for me to create this character,” Kotsur told People in a recent interview.

	He added, “It was really fun for me to develop this character, a fresh take and a new perspective. It will open up new roles in the future, I hope. We're not just actors who use sign language, we're characters and we can play all different types of characters.”


Black Rabbit, which had its premiere at TIFF, was created by Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, with a logline describing the project as a “propulsive thrill ride and character examination about the way an unbreakable bond between two brothers can shatter their world and everything in its orbit.”


	Also starring in the series, currently streaming on Netflix, is Cleopatra Coleman, Amaka Okafor, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, Troy Kotsur, Abbey Lee, Chris Coy, Dagmara Dominczyk, Odessa Young and Robin De Jesus, with Amir Malaklou, Don Harvey, Forrest Weber, Francis Benhamou, Gus Birney, John Ales and Steve Witting.

Meanwhile, Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell's romantic fantasy 'Big Bold Beautiful Journey' bombs with $3.5 million.


							By

Film Editor


	Anime hit Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – the Movie Infinity Castle is the champion of this weekend's box office, topping the Jordan Peele-produced Him for no. 1.


Demon Slayer, which set a record $70 million U.S. opening last weekend, is looking to bring in $17.3 million this weekend, a tumble of 77 percent but enough for a victory. Him, from Universal and Peele's Monkeypaw, is projected to end the weekend with $13.5 million, down from earlier estimates of $15 million.




Demon Slayer hails from the Sony-owned Crunchyroll, and is already a global smash. It now stands as the top-grossing anime movie of all time globally, with more than $555 million.

	But the weekend brought bad news from other corners of the Sony empire, with the high-profile Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell romantic fantasy A Big Bold Beautiful Journey bombing with a projected $3.5 million, sixth-place finish. Journey centers on a man and a woman who relive key moments from their lives. The feature is Robbie's first starring role since Barbie became a phenomenon two years ago and helped revive the box office. The film earned a B- CinemaScore from audiences and tepid reviews. Kogonada directed the Blacklist script by Seth Reiss.


Him likewise earned mediocre reviews. It stars Tyriq Withers as a top NFL quarterback prospect whose career is upended when he is blind sided by an attacker and suffers brain trauma. He finds a potential way back to greatness in the form of Marlon Wayans' GOAT quarterback, who offers to train him at his private compound. The psychological horror movie hails from director Justin Tipping and received a C- CinemaScore from audiences.

	











	Rounding out the top five are New Line's The Conjuring: The Last Rites, now in its third weekend and expected to earn $12.1 million; Lionsgate's The Long Walk, with $6.3 million; and Focus' Downton Abbey: The Finale, with $6 million.


Sept. 21, 8:13 a.m. Updated with revised estimates.

	Soon after forcing Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves, Sinclair — the broadcasting giant that operates dozens of ABC affiliates — announced it would replace the late-night show Friday with a special dedicated to Charlie Kirk. However, instead of broadcasting the special Friday, Sinclair affiliates aired a rerun of Celebrity Family Feud, Variety reports.


	Just 10 minutes before the Kirk special was set to broadcast, Sinclair issued a statement via social media announcing that it would instead premiere on YouTube. “Tonight, Sinclair will continue to air ABC network programming as scheduled in the late-night time period,” the company wrote Friday night.

	“The Charlie Kirk special will instead be available on The National News Desk's YouTube channel, ensuring viewers can continue to enjoy ABC programming while also providing full access to the special online.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	As of Sunday morning, the YouTube video of the Kirk special has generated just 26,000 views since it was uploaded on Friday night.

	











	Both Sinclair and fellow affiliates giant Nexstar pledged to kick Jimmy Kimmel Live off its U.S. stations following the host's comments about Kirk's assassination during a Monday monologue; soon after,  ABC said is was suspending the late-night show “indefinitely.”


	“Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” said Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”

	The company also stated that it will not lift the suspension on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability,” and called on Kimmel to apologize to Kirk's family, as well as make “a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA.”


	In the aftermath of Kimmel's suspension, the late-night community has thrown their support behind the host, while politicians and celebrities alike have warned against the Trump administration's FCC-backed attacks on free speech.

The star is back in the United States for a limited run of pop-up performances.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	“We're going to teach you a dance,” Chappell Roan says, as if there's anyone in the audience tonight who still doesn't know her infamous “Hot to Go!” choreography.


	In reality, the crowd of thousands at Saturday's (Sept. 20) show at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York, hasn't just been waiting all night for this — many of them have been waiting several months. It's been quite some time since the Missouri native performed in her home country, with the end of 2024 marking a particularly rough period for her. In addition to canceling two stateside shows for mental health reasons, she faced onslaughts of backlash for everything from speaking out about predatory fan behaviors to criticizing Kamala Harris amid the presidential race, leading to her largely stepping back from the internet.

	











	Now, a packed audience dotted with pink cowboy hats and Lady Liberty crowns — nods to Roan's getup at the 2024 Governor's Ball, one of the last times she performed in New York — embraces her completely, every bump in the road forgotten. Looking out at a sea of arms eagerly forming the shapes of the letters “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” (“I think you get it,” she giggles, abandoning her dance tutorial after one run-through), she looks stronger than ever, strutting around the stage in a sexy Captain Hook-esque outfit without missing a note as flames erupt behind her.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Saturday's concert is the first of eight pop-up performances in the U.S. that Roan has generously tacked onto her European Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour, and one of four dates slated for NYC. The setlist is full of high-octane numbers from her 2023 debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, with “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” “Femininomenon,” “After Midnight,” “Naked in Manhattan” (“Can you believe it? We're in New York!” she yells triumphantly midway through), “Guilty Pleasure” and “Casual” preceding “Hot to Go!,” as well as new single “The Subway,” which recently earned Roan her highest-ever peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 3.


	Later in the show, she writhes around on the stage floor while covering Heart's “Barracuda,” sensually serenades a mic stand topped with a blonde wig for the waltzy “Picture You,” line dances with her bandmates to March single “The Giver” and fills up the stadium with impressive high note after high note during “Good Luck, Babe!,” the breakout hit that catapulted the pop singer to superstardom with unprecedented swiftness in spring 2024. The latter two tracks are expected to appear on Roan's next LP, which she plans to start work on after the tour ends in October. (“It took me five years to write the first [album], and it's probably going to take at least five to write the next,” she warned in a recent interview with Vogue.)

A post shared by billboard (@billboard)


	Though Roan is a total force on stage, polished and magnetic while trouncing around a set made to look like an illustrated fairytale castle, the show is not without her signature frankness. She hilariously breaks character at one point to inform the crowd that she'd totally forgotten her entire “a—s” was on display in her outfit until she was taken by surprise at the sight of her own rear-end on one of the big screens behind her. Toward the end, while singing the vulnerable and now-deeply-ironic “California” about worrying she'll never make it in the music business, she interjects, “I just saw someone yawn — that's crazy.”

	











	She also takes a tender moment to address why her return home is so momentous. “It's been quite a year,” she tells the crowd around the halfway point in the show. “I can't believe we're here, honestly. It's crazy. Thank you for sticking with me through it, I know it was … it's been really hard.” 


	“I'm so glad I can come to work like this,” she continues. “I just needed a place like this so bad when I was 13, 14. I just wanted to dress up however I wanted, and I wanted to wear makeup and look weird. So I hope you know that you're welcome here, however you show up today. You are cherished.”


	As Roan dives into “Kaleidoscope,” her fans band together to let her know that the feeling is very much mutual. A dazzling rainbow suddenly appears and winks back at her as she sings, with the concert-goers in the back several rows of the stadium holding up multicolored lights in one unified effort.


	“Everyone look behind you,” she instructs the rest of the crowd before momentarily forgetting the song's lyrics, distracted by the emotionally charged gesture — the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless show. “You've got the rainbow! It's a kaleidoscope! It's so beautiful!”


	After her stay at Forest Hills, Roan will play two nights in Kansas City before closing out the Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour with two nights in Los Angeles. See Roan's full setlist at the first night of her NYC shows below.

Jimmy Kimmel‘s suspension under these circumstances is a fundamental attack on each individual American, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of whether or not you even vote. It affects every single American's ability to lead the life they want to lead, to think whatever they want to think. I truly believe it is that fundamental. That might sound hyperbolic to some people, but I don't think it is.


	I am concerned about the potential elimination of one of the fundamental reasons we love living here and love being Americans. It's not every place on Earth where you can get up every day and you are free from governmental or military threat (at least until recently, with ICE dragging people off the street), where you can express yourself. We want to keep living in a country where you can say what you think, regardless of who agrees with you or disagrees with you, where you can become the person that you want to be, where you can wear what you want to wear, where you can fall in love with whoever you want to fall in love with.

	











	It really goes so far beyond late-night talk-show hosts or comedians. The message I want to send is that just because you're not a professional comedian or you're not in Hollywood doesn't mean you are not deeply affected by the eventual consequences of not speaking up against this, of allowing this to happen. I do fear that centering all these conversations about freedom of speech around a very famous person who's on TV every night will make it very easy for the Donald Trumps and Stephen Millers of the world to make this a coastal elite versus non-coastal elite conversation.

	And that truly isn't what this is. That's just the example this week. The media is on the front lines of this, because Trump is driven crazy by them. The man can't take a joke. But if it can happen to someone as wealthy and powerful and visible as Jimmy Kimmel or Stephen Colbert, think about what they're willing and able to do to any average American who doesn't have Colbert or Kimmel's resources.

	This is not merely about what you can or cannot — or will not — be able to pitch in a writers room at a talk show or a sitcom. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and we're already seeing it, because normalizing what happened to Colbert made it easier for them and empowered Brendan Carr to take that argument to Disney via the FCC. I know that Nexstar is a big part of this, and that, as always, it comes down to the bottom line. [Editor's note: A spokesperson for Nexstar, the nation's largest owner of TV stations, has denied that FCC pressure influenced their decision to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live before his suspension was announced.]


	I've worked for Disney, as so many people in my field have. In my experience, these are good people. I've always enjoyed working for them. I've always had wonderful experiences working for them. Disney has been a very progressive company, actually, especially when it comes to issues that matter to me a lot, like LGBTQ+ issues. The message I would send to them is — and I'm quoting Pete Buttigieg here — if you think that it is worth it to just give Trump and Carr this temporary win and that this will mean that they'll get off your backs, you're wrong. As Pete said, if you're trying to ride this tiger, it will eat you eventually. There is no going back. They are just going to not only want more, but demand it, and exploit business deals and mergers that they know they have approval over to get what they want: to try to control what is being said on TV, online, on any platform.


	These guys saw an opening here to manipulate all of us. And now we're sitting here talking about Jimmy Kimmel and not talking about the psychotic birthday note Trump wrote and gave to his friend Jeffrey Epstein. [Editor's note: Trump has denied any involvement with the letter, and has sued The Wall Street Journal for libel over its story reporting its existence.] They've gotten what they wanted, not only in Jimmy Kimmel getting suspended, but in controlling the national conversation. So we can't let that happen either.

	What they really want is a type of national brainwashing. I know in a way that sounds so crazy, 1980s-level sci-fi stuff. And I'll be honest and say in those early Trump years, you would see people posting Handmaid's Tale memes. I love the spirit and the intentions of that, but for a while there I'd roll my eyes and say, “Things are bad, but it ain't The Handmaid's Tale, exactly. Let's all calm down. It's a bit extreme.” I take that back. I am no longer rolling my eyes. This is it. It will get worse if we don't speak up. We've got to speak up.

	











	They are truly just schoolyard bullies taken to a much higher, more visible level in the public sphere. But they have the souls and the hearts and the fragility and insecurities of that schoolyard bully. And we all know we can't let the bullies win. 


	To be clear, political violence is barbaric and horrifying. I thought the Charlie Kirk story was terrifying. That's not the world we want to live in. That's not how we solve disputes. I'm not for that at all. I don't want anyone to be murdered. The Democratic Party, which I'm affiliated with, I don't agree with everything they say either. But they're the ones who are always campaigning to limit the number of guns on the street. We need to speak up in ethical ways — not violently, but passionately. Speaking up matters. It matters even if you don't have a big following, if you're not an entertainer. I think it counts even more. What we say sometimes just starts to feel like noise. It's like, “All right, there's another liberal celebrity saying what we expect them to say.”


	So if you are not in show business, if you're not known for having a big social media platform, I think it means even more to speak up in whatever way you're comfortable with. Maybe that means talking to your kids and keeping an eye on what is being allowed to be said in school and what's not. Maybe it means going to a protest. Maybe it does mean posting on Facebook or social media or whatever your platform is. But I know there is power in numbers here.

	Tackling the thorny Jimmy Kimmel situation, the head of the National Association of Broadcasters said “government pressure on media” also happened during the Obama and Biden administrations.


	Weighing in after Kimmel's suspension in a blog post that did not mention ABC, Disney or President Trump by name, NAB CEO Curtis LeGeyt called this “an unprecedented time in media history” requiring “a direct conversation about what's at stake.” 


	Kimmel's show was suspended indefinitely by ABC after major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair removed it, citing jokes by the late-night host about the reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. The removal of the show followed open threats to Disney by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Talks are ongoing among stakeholders to seek a resolution to the impasse, with indications in recent days that a path for the show to return was more likely than it being dropped for good.

	LeGeyt affirmed the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, who “must be able to make decisions about the content on our airwaves free from government influence.” Even the perception that broadcasters are being affected by government pressure “is a problem for our credibility and the trust we have built with our audiences.”


	At the same time, LeGeyt notes that government pressure on media “to cover events in a particular way is not new and it has come from both political parties. During the Obama administration, journalists decried the use of the Espionage Act to investigate reporters and demand their confidential sources. Under the Biden administration, reporters faced growing barriers to access, and local affiliate stations were targeted based on the actions of cable news networks. Today, we continue to see veiled threats suggesting broadcasters should be penalized for airing content that is contrary to a particular point of view.


	“These attempts were wrong then, and they are wrong now.”


	The NAB is the main lobbying organization for TV and radio broadcasters.

	











	The Washington-based group, whose power has ebbed amid cord-cutting and the shift to streaming, has been in an awkward position for decades when it comes to the FCC and its members. That tension came into striking view in recent months, as Deadline's Ted Johnson has reported. 


	The organization ran social media ads praising FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for helping “empower our members” by fighting to loosen regulations limiting the business activities of broadcasters. The praise for him came as Carr had launched investigations or inquiries into broadcast networks, some of their owned stations and other outlets, including members of NAB. Those probes were sparked by issues ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion practices to newsroom decision-making.


	Along with the “the obvious constitutional issues” raised by the Kimmel situation, LeGeyt continued in the blog post, there is the difficult state of financial affairs for the industry. “Broadcasters are already fighting for our future, facing extraordinary disruption in the media ecosystem from Big Tech,” he wrote. “If the very act of owning or transferring a broadcast license carries the risk of political interference, it will drive investment further away from local stations at the very moment we need more resources to sustain local journalism.”


	The NAB's efforts to back its members as they face myriad business challenges, the exec concluded, will be “futile if we cannot fulfill our most sacred responsibility: reporting to our communities without fear of government retribution.”

Demanding to give up a source for national security vs trampling free speech bc they're critical of the administration is the not the same thing, Curtis.

When broadcasters were pressured by Democrats, they hired lawyers.  When pressured by Trump, they give in without so much as a fight.

Oh yeah this is all totally normal, nothing to see here, move along.

Holy cow. An organization made up of groups that want mergers and bent the knee, once again, bent the knee.

BULL.  SHIT.

These are NOT the same times as Obama/ Biden and trying to equate the two is fraking wild.

Pot. Meet Kettle.

Did you read anything besides the headline?

I agree with you because these are not those types of times; we are fighting for freedom, rights, and freedom to speak, and they can say what they want. Still, when it comes to someone else saying what they want, we have a problem. I feel this country is turning into Russia. China will no longer be a democratic country; we are now a dictatorship because certain people can do what they want to. Still, people is not realizing this is affecting everybody the rich the poor it doesn't matter what color you are what status you are this affects us all when our rights of being striking this is not about one people this is about all people so when are we going to step up to the plate and your night together because we put these people in office to work for the American people not one person. They are up there working for one person, not the American people, so when will everybody take their blindfolds off, unless you're not together?

Lindsay Arnold is speaking out following critical comments fans made about the premiere of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34. The former dance pro fiercely defended her “DWTS” family.

Let's be better you guys 🫶🏻 if you absolutely HAVE to throw shade come throw it at me I can handle it 😉 #dwts #dwtshottake #spreadlove #bekind #letsbenicepeople 

In a video Arnold shared on TikTok on September 18, she explained just what goes in to making the show, urging fans to rethink their criticisms.

“Here's my hot take on ‘Dancing With the Stars' premiere night … y'all are mean. The amount of videos I've seen starting like that and then they continue to just go on literally trashing the pros, the troupe, the hosts, the judges … I've seen it all,” Arnold said in the video.

“And it's making me sick,” she noted. “Like I literally feel sick to my stomach. You understand that these are real people, right?”

Arnold continued, “This isn't some made-up TV show, and they're all playing their characters.”

Referencing the show “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” the former “DWTS” dance pro explained, “This is not Conrad, Belly and Jeremiah, where we can just comment on their decisions and their choices and their lives like they're just not real people.”

She added, “These are real people, who are doing a job that literally none of you could do.”

Arnold competed on 10 seasons of “Dancing With the Stars,” winning season 25 with her partner, Jordan Fisher.

She also noted that she “would go to bat for” her sister Rylee, who is partnered with Scott Hoying on  the show, “'til the day I die.”

The dancer added, “I care about all those people. That's my family, that's my friends. I'm coming here to say that the job of being a pro is one of the hardest ever.”

Arnold noted that, while “it's okay to have opinions,” fans should stop “bashing and trashing.” She reminded them, “Be better.”

“Please don't make me do another video like this defending all of my friends,” she added, asking fans to “spread a little bit more positivity” about “Dancing With the Stars.”

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

During a September 3 interview with People, Rylee revealed that Lindsay gave her a critical tip for success.

“The best piece of advice that I've ever received from Lindsay, and honestly, the best piece of advice I've ever been given, is to always just remain true to yourself,” the dancer shared. “Always just be yourself, authentically you, because if people don't like you for you, then you're not where you need to be.”

Rylee shared, “Just be yourself and that's going to be where you're going to be the happiest version of yourself, so always just emulate that and be that.”

She added, “It got me through everything. I love her.”

Dua Lipa brought out surprise guest Nile Rodgers to perform Chic's “Le Freak” Saturday at New York's Madison Square Garden as the singer continued the Radical Optimism Tour's tradition of playing local covers at every concert.


	Saturday marked Lipa's third of four nights at the World's Most Famous Arena; her previous shows at MSG featured covers of New York staples Alicia Keys (“No One”) and Blondie (“One Way or Another“). She upped the ante for the third gig, welcoming the legendary Rodgers himself onstage to play guitar on the Number One disco-funk hit:

	“Here in New York, I'm actually spoiled with the choice,” Lipa told the crowd prior to covering Blondie earlier this week. Lipa's MSG run concludes Sunday night with no shortage of New York artists still available to cover.


	Dua Lipa's Australian and New Zealand tour — where her regional covers trend started — saw the singer perform the likes of AC/DC, Lorde, and Kylie Minogue, while also bringing out guests like Troye Sivan, Tame Impala, and Crowded House's Neil Finn. The local covers have continued — though less frequently — as the tour headed to Europe, with Lipa covering Enrique Iglesias' “Hero” in Madrid.

	When the trek reached the U.K. at London's Wembley Stadium, Lipa performed Jamiroquai's “Virtual Insanity” with help from that group's singer Jay Kay. The following night at the same venue, she brought out Charli XCX for a rendition of that singer's “360.”

	In Liverpool, Lipa performed the Zutons' “Valerie” — popularized by Amy Winehouse — with that group's singer Dave McCabe. The next show, in the birthplace of the Beatles, Lipa covered the Fab Four's “Hey Jude.” In Dublin, Lipa did “a song by a late Irish legend,” Sinead O'Connor's “Nothing Compares 2 U.”


	The Radical Optimism Tour has since crossed the Atlantic, opening with two shows in Toronto last week with two more regional covers, Nelly Furtado's “Like A Bird” and Mustafa's “Name of God.” In Chicago, Lipa performed with Chaka Khan and covered Earth, Wind, and Fire before heading to Boston, where she delivered Aerosmith's “I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.”

	As Chappell Roan once sang, in New York you can try things. So it was the perfect place for her to make her big American return. Saturday night in New York was Chappell's first U.S. show in nearly a year, after her summer of conquering European festivals. She's bringing it all back home with a limited series of pop-up gigs in NYC, Kansas City, and L.A., with her new “Visions of Damsels and Other Dangerous Things” show. 


	Saturday night was a triumphant American homecoming for the Midwest princess, the kick-off for her four-night stand at New York's Forest Hills Stadium. It's a historic venue — and way too tiny for a star on her level. But that's why the show had such a special and intimate feel, under the stars, on the first chilly night of September. The whole night felt like a coronation moment for her — and a communal dance-crazed celebration for her hardcore fans.


	Her brief pop-up run is basically a victory lap, after her meteoric rise. “It's been quite a year, huh?” Chappell told the crowd. “Thank you for sticking with me through it. It's been really hard. And I'm so glad that I can come to work like this,” displaying her flamboyantly dressed self. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	She spent the night exploding with queer bravado and supernova presence, on a giant stage designed as a giant gothic castle. The crowd's sing-along energy was ferocious from the start, with the opening one-two punch of “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl” and “Feminomenon,” where Chappell asked “But does it happen?” and got 13,000 NOOOOOs back. Yet she can't help being the super-est, graphic-est, ultra-modern-est force in the house.

	











	When it comes to her Visions of Damsels aesthetic, she goes totally medieval with her fantasy castle, complete with staircase, parapets, drawbridge, and throne. Behind her, there's images of mythical creatures — goblins, dragons, hippogriffs, Pegasus-style flying horses, and wait, what do you call the serpents with wings? But Chappell was the queen of the castle from the start, stomping onstage to an orchestral metal fanfare, wearing a crimson pirate ensemble and her bat-wing fascinator. In one of the night's peak moments, she sat on her throne in a black cape, with a gremlin doll in her lap. “This is Shigella, my tour pet,” she announced. “She/they. And we're gonna sing ‘Coffee.'”


	Like most pop queens of our moment, Chappell builds her live show on straight-up Nineties guitar rock. She's got a kick-ass metal band full of female headbangers, busting out the most classic rock-star moves. (Chappell is a huge fan of kneeling to worship the guitar hero while she plays a solo — a Seventies move that's never been more popular than it is in 2025.) But she also did a fantastic demolition of Heart's “Barracuda” — talk about a song that could have been written for her.


	To the surprise of absolutely nobody, the crowd was dressed to kill — riding the subway to Forest Hills felt like part of the celebration, with all that leather and lace looking awesomely surreal on the E-train in the Saturday-afternoon sunlight. For “Kaleidoscope” the venue lit up like a rainbow, part of the overall queer-celebration vibe, only fitting for the most famous out pop star since Elton. “I just needed a place like this so bad when I was 13, 14,” Roan said. “I just wanted to dress up however I wanted to — I wanted to look weird. I hope that you know you're welcome here, however you show up today. You are cherished.”


	“The Giver” absolutely destroys live, her Shania-coded sapphic stomp into country-disco boot-scoot territory. She coached the audience in the “Hot To Go!” dance, though everybody pretty much already had that down. Chappell roared through the tunes from her debut The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, which dropped almost exactly two years ago, in late September 2023. It's a measure of how massive her rise has been — a show that feels like a greatest-hits set, even though it's practically every song she's ever recorded. Onstage, she comes on like the one-woman culmination of so many all-time pop legends — the perfect fusion of Madonna's aggro flash with Cyndi Lauper's just-wanna just-wanna warmth and Prince's omni-erotic outrageousness.

	But for all her ultra-modern sensibility, she's an old-school show-biz entertainer at heart. Her ballads were torch-song interludes that could have knocked them dead in lounges a century ago. For “Picture You,” she hung a blonde wig on the mic stand and sang to it. “California” had a great moment where she did a double take and laughed, “I just saw someone yawn. That's insane.” She reached back five years for “Love Me Anyway.” “This is an old one — I usually don't even sing it,” she said. “But you guys will pull me through it.” But then her tone shifted slightly when she reached for a skirt that wasn't there. “My god, I forgot my bottom's just a thong,” she said. “I looked at the screen and saw my ass.”


	“The Subway,” her summer single, is her most New York song — she debuted it at the local Governors Ball festival, in the summer of 2024, her last NYC show. It's an urban break-up ballad where the whole city seems to scream her ex's name, as Chappell sings, “I'm still counting down all of the days till you're just another girl on the subway.” It was poignant live, especially when the crowd took over for the closing lament, repeating the lines, “She's got a way/She got away.”


	“If you've got something pink, will you put it in the air so I can see it?” she requested before “Red Wine Supernova.” She got what she asked for with a sea of pink cowgirl hats. She introduced “My Kink Is Karma” with the words, “I wanna dedicate this one to my ex.” But for the big finale, instead of an encore break, she just jumped right into the inevitable show-stopper “Pink Pony Club.” You can tell it's a perfect pop song because it gets more effective — not less — when you hear it for the thousandth time. But to sing it in public is another level of devotion — belting “Santa Monica, you've been too good to me” with thousands of other like-minded fanatics is a truly powerful experience.

	











	The night began with drag performers and opening band Japanese Breakfast, doing songs from their new Melancholy Brunettes and Sad Women. “Chappell Roan is definitely this artist's favorite artist,” singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner said, adding at the end, “See you in the pit.” (Sociological footnote: the biggest crowd sing-alongs on Chappell's pre-show mix tape were Gaga's “Applause,” One Direction's “What Makes You Beautiful,” and — the big surprise — “Stacy's Mom” by Fountains of Wayne. Take a cosmic bow, Adam Schlesinger.)


	It was way back last October when Roan closed out her Midwest Princess tour, after her explosive summer of 2024, when she just seemed to get twice as massive every week. Since then, her only American gigs have been her appearances at the Grammys, Saturday Night Live, and Elton's Oscars party. But she's been a touring machine in Europe, making the festival rounds and bringing her castle with her. So it's a revelation to see how much more brash and confident she's gotten as a live performer— especially since she was never exactly slack in those departments. After the New York stand, she's got only four more pop-up shows, in Kansas City and L.A. As she explained, “I love these three cities so much + wanted the chance to do something special before going away to write the next album.”

	At one point, Chappell recalled, “I think the last time I played New York, it was Brooklyn Steel” — a club seven times smaller than Forest Hills. That was October 2023, when her album was just a few weeks old, yet she was already too massive for the 1800-capacity venue. That's one of the paradoxes of Chappell: She's a performer who's spent virtually her entire performing career playing rooms that feel ridiculously too small for her. But then, any room would. On a night like this, you couldn't imagine any place that could hold a pop-star presence this overwhelming, this emotionally intense, this committed. On the stage in her heels, it's where she belongs.

	Two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa this month on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft. 


	One of the jets was later identified in a lawsuit in U.S. federal court as carrying 14 Nigerian and Gambian nationals to a prison camp in Ghana. They have since been returned to their countries of origin, Ghana said, despite all having credible fears of persecution or torture. The other jet secretly landed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali, according to communications from the flight deck obtained by Rolling Stone. Representatives for the governments of these countries did not respond to emails asking if this jet also included third-country nationals.


	The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by President Donald Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

	











	“The administration is using military secrecy to cover for what is basically a law enforcement/immigration enforcement function,” an activist flight tracker who goes by JJ in DC told Rolling Stone. “If this is being done in our interest, we have a right to know where these deportation flights are going.” 


	While it is legal for military aircraft to turn off their transponders, this is generally reserved for combat and surveillance missions, JJ in DC, who is a military veteran, said. Military flights also cost much more to operate than charter carriers, as much as $28,500 an hour, according to Reuters. 

	











	The Air Force and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide a statement prior to publication. This story will be updated if any of them do.


	Both secret trips were on Air Force C-17 Globemasters. The first one left McChord Field near Tacoma, Wash., on the evening of Sept. 4, stopping at the ICE-detention hub city of Alexandria, La., and the U.S. military outpost at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — which Trump has converted into an ICE facility holding what he has baselessly claimed are “the worst of the worst” deportees. The flight landed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a likely fuel stop, the next afternoon.

	These flights were conducted without the standard transponder signal, called Automatic Dependent Signal-Broadcast, or ADS-B, which transmits constant information about a flight, including registration, location, speed, and altitude, to any receiver within range. The C-17 used an alternative signal transmitting its registration but no location or other flight data — though flight-tracking websites could still approximate its location through a kind of triangulation.  


	It is unclear when exactly the C-17 left St. Croix, because by then it was using another type of signal even harder to detect, in which an aircraft transmits its location via data link only when requested by a specific partner, like an air base. Different flight-tracking websites were able to capture different fragments of the C-17's trajectory — a single blip over the Atlantic Ocean on the night of Sept. 5 and part of a descent toward Accra, Ghana's capital, the next morning. 


	Hours later, a brief signal showed it landing in Cape Verde, probably for crew rest, before returning home. Its ADS-B transponder began transmitting again on Sept 10. Two days later, a lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court alleged the flight held 14 men — 13 from Nigeria and one from The Gambia — who had all been granted protections from removal to their countries of origin for fear of persecution or torture. They were loaded onto the cargo jet in the middle of the night with no advance warning, they alleged, and were only told where they were going when the plane was in the air. One Nigerian man said that after he asked to speak to his lawyers, he was “straitjacketed for several hours” — seeming to refer to the WRAP device ICE uses on immigrants who resist transport, which has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years alleging use of the device has caused permanent injury and even death by asphyxiation.

	Once in Ghana, the men said they were sent to an “abysmal” open-air prison camp and told they would be returned to their countries of origin — something the U.S. government had been barred from doing. Though Judge Tanya Chutkan called the Trump administration's actions “disingenuous,” she ultimately ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to stop it. On Tuesday, Ghana said all of the men had been returned to their home countries, though attorneys told the Associated Press four were still in the Ghana prison.


	Human rights groups say this amounts to chain refoulement — the forcible expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they are vulnerable to return to countries where they face persecution — and violates both domestic and international law.


	“What is alarming today is the emerging pattern of shadowy deportations of people who have not had access to a court or any meaningful form of due process — removals that bear the hallmarks of forced disappearances under international law,” says Rebecca Sharpless, a University of Miami law professor who studies ICE flights.


	Accepting third-country nationals “should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration,” Ghanaian foreign minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said Monday. “Our decision is grounded purely on humanitarian principle and Pan-African empathy.”


	The second C-17 trip began like the first one — Alexandria, Gitmo, St. Croix, no ADS-B transponder but still trackable — before becoming even harder to detect when it left St. Croix. One flight-tracking website captured a few blips as it headed toward the western coast of Africa in the small hours of Sept. 10, and two blips over Senegal later that evening. The other flight-tracking website didn't capture anything at all, which one activist described as “very weird.” 


	Two of the flight deck transmissions Rolling Stone obtained, which are not available on flight-tracking websites, show the pilots planning to land at Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, Liberia, and Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone that morning, with a third transmission showing an intended stop in Mali's capital of Bamako in the early afternoon. The final stop in Senegal was likely for crew rest.


	Two other military aircraft are known to have done ICE missions without broadcasting transponder signals: the jets that carried third-country nationals from a U.S. base in Djibouti to South Sudan and Eswatini in July. 

	











	That same month, Trump held a bizarre “Africa summit” at the White House, gathering five of the continent's 50-plus leaders around a conference table, where he extolled their “very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people” and fished for compliments from his fellow heads of state. (“A tremendous golfer.” “Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.”) And, Trump said, they were making progress on third-country agreements.

	Since then, ICE flights to Africa are surging. A new ICE charter, Paradigm Jet Management, has entered the picture, running at least eight deportation trips to and from the continent in the last six weeks. ICE also sent seven third-country nationals to Rwanda on two Gulfstream jets, and now the Trump administration is threatening to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria (or Syria). Omni Air International carried Russian dissidents to Egypt, where they were forced onto a plane to Moscow, and last week flew an eight-stop deportation mega-route from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where passengers on the last stop likely spent more than 50 hours shackled in handcuffs and leg irons attached to chains around their waists.


	And there have been at least five ICE missions to Africa on military jets, though if the last two are any indication, they are getting increasingly harder to spot.

"To have an external power of financial interest come fuck around with that material diminishes the trust," said the 'Sentimental Value' director about deciding to have all of his films financed in Europe.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Joachim Trier left San Sebastian Film Festival attendees in awe at an event Sunday morning where the Sentimental Value director spoke candidly and eloquently about his career.


	The Danish-Norwegian filmmaker, an Academy Award nominee for his 2021 romantic dramedy The Worst Person in the World, is also known for Reprise (2006), Oslo, August 31st (2011) and Louder Than Bombs (2015). His most recent project, winner of Cannes' Grand Prix this year Sentimental Value, is screening here at the 73rd San Sebastian Film Festival.




	The film follows Trier's frequent collaborator Renate Reinsve as Nora who, along with her sister Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), are faced to confront their strained relationship with their father, a fading director named Gustav Borg (Stellan Skarsgard). Elle Fanning also stars in the movie as a U.S. actress, Rachel Kemp, hoping to be in Borg's next feature.

	Trier spoke — and Reinsve, in attendance, watched on — at the discussion in San Sebastian where he fielded a myriad of questions about his journey to film stardom and working predominantly in Europe. The director explained how he set the precedent to have final cut on all his films when, in the wake of the success of Reprise, he was tasked with finding a U.S. studio to work with.


	“I need final cut, I've had it since film one,” he began. “To me, it's a moral implication of taking responsibility for what the actors give a director — if they show their emotions, their bodies, whatever — we created a movie [and] I carry the responsibility of what they bring to the final product. No one that sits in some studio capacity and invests money should decide that, in my opinion. That's not how art is made… [I have] a moral responsibility towards the cinematographer, maybe being away from his or her family for months on end to work on the vision that me, as a director, and all the others in the team created. To have an external power of financial interest come fuck around with that material diminishes the trust between us and the group.”

	











	“I'm not going to shame people,” he added, “because it's damn hard to make a film and many, many, many films are made every year where the director didn't have final cut, and they're wonderful films.”


	Trier admitted that demanding final cut made it “tough” to get a film financed and while some U.S. producers showed immense support, Reprise was made out of Oslo, Norway and in collaboration with France. “I've worked in the European financing system my whole career and I'm super happy about it,” he added.


	The financing system for cinema in Europe, while it has given Trier “a platform to express myself very freely,” he also believes it is constantly under political threat. “Right-wing political movements are always trying to diminish the idea of soft money support for the arts across most countries in Europe… We need support. And most art has always been supported by someone with an intention of not just making money, but supporting expression and artistic endeavors.”


	At the same time, Trier said the need to have total creative control over his films is something that producers should be in support of. “If you [look at] film history, a lot of the films that commercially worked have also been made by directors that are deeply involved in the script process, deeply involved in the editing and has had a sense of control — the achievements of personal expression is at the core of some of the most successful films, financially.”

	











	Trier continued that his championing of his actors should be mirrored by financiers' attitudes towards filmmakers. “My approach to shielding, protecting, loving, nourishing [actors] is how producers and financiers should work with directors. Don't employ directors unless you really want to support them and love them and help them, and [same with] writers and editors… I want Renate to do well, I want her to do something wonderful and I'm proud of Renate as a director. I think financiers should feel like that with directors and the creative team.”


	Across the session, Trier covered an extensive range of topics, from grieving the late David Lynch and the intersection of film and love (“tenderness is the new punk!”), to believing in the power of the “European auteur” and the cinematic universes they build. When discussing Sentimental Value, Trier, father to two young children, admitted his own fear of failure as a parent played a huge role in writing Skarsgard's part.


	“I said going in, ‘I'm really scared of failing as a father.' And it's very symbolic to make this film for me, because I don't want to be Gustav,” he said. “In Norway, we have had a lot of progression [for] female directors over the last 15, 20 years, and that has been great for us male directors too, because we have gotten a focus on [a] good set culture, where the macho energy is lessened and it's not just all tough guys.”


	This has allowed filmmakers in Norway to have “private conversations” about balancing being an artist with having children, he added. “Actually, the feminist discourse around cinema has helped men also allow ourselves bigger freedom of figuring out how we make movies [as parents].”

Bad Bunny said goodbye to the No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency at El Choli with a bang. On Saturday night, for his “Una Más” show, which was livestreamed by Amazon Music, the Puerto Rican icon brought out a slew of guests, including salsa legend Marc Anthony, RaiNao, Dei V, Ñengo Flow, Arcángel, De La Ghetto, and Jowell & Randy.


	“I have always had the same passion, love for what I'm doing. I promise I will never change. I love you, Puerto Rico. I love you, mom and dad,” Bad Bunny said during an emotional speech at the end of the show, later adding, “It doesn't matter what your issue or problem is, love will always be the solution.” 


	Bad Bunny had Chuwi join him for their collab “Welita,” which they've performed each night of the residency. Then, one of the first surprises of the evening came when Puerto Rican rising star RaiNao dropped by for “Perfumito Nuevo;” newcomer Dei V also made it out to help with his verse on “Veldá.”

	When it was time to perform massive perreo hits like “Safaera,” Benito brought out the reggaeton OGs: veterans Ñengo Flow and Jowell & Randy hit the stage to sing the track from on top of his La Casita B-stage. Jowell & Randy then took over the set to play a medley of their biggest hits, including “El Funeral de la Canoa,” “Hey Mister,” and “Salgo Pa la Calle.”

	 Arcángel and De La Ghetto jumped in at the end of the set to exchange rap verses for “Acho PR” from Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana. Ñengo Flow made a poignant gesture by wearing a jersey with the number 4,645 on it, honoring the death toll from Hurricane Maria.

	For the grand finale, Anthony sidled up next to Bad Bunny and showed off his power vocals for a heartfelt rendition of “Preciosa.” The song, originally written by composer Rafael Hernández Marín in 1937, is a love letter to Puerto Rico that ends with the line “Yo te quiero, Puerto Rico.” (“I love you, Puerto Rico.”) Though it's been reinterpreted by many artists over the decades, Anthony's rendition is among the best known — and he gave it his all while Bad Bunny belted the lyrics with him.

	After Anthony's appearance, Bad Bunny stayed onstage and closed out the show with the emotional “DtMF” and the swaggering “LA MuDANZA.” The latter song turned into an extended mix, where he used the opportunity to introduce the band and everyone who attended the performance.

	Saturday night's show was livestreamed globally on Amazon Music and the streaming service's Twitch channel worldwide. The performance will also be available to replay for 24 hours after the initial live broadcast.


	Along with livestreaming the show, Amazon and Bad Bunny's Good Bunny Foundation reached a multi-year agreement to aid the island by investing in initiatives related to education, technology, food delivery, agriculture support, and economic development.


	“Benito embodies the spirit of Puerto Rico, and together we're creating a celebration that transforms his passion for the island into real impact for its people,” said Rocío Guerrero, an Amazon Music executive, in a press release. “By combining music, Amazon technologies, commerce, and community programs at scale, we're engaging global audiences to this historic moment while strengthening Puerto Rican communities.”


	Last Sunday, Bad Bunny hosted what many thought to be the final show of the residency. However, the following morning, Bad Bunny revealed he'd play one final show on Sept. 20.

	After wrapping the residency, Bad Bunny will kick off his Debí Tirar Más Fotos tour on Nov. 21 in Santo Domingo before traveling across Latin America through late February.

	One person was killed and two more were injured in a stabbing that took place outside of Phish‘s show at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia, on Friday night. 


	Police responded to a violent altercation just after 9:30 p.m. ET, according to a police report from the Hampton Police Division. According to the report published Saturday, the suspect fled the scene on foot, but detectives managed to identify “all parties involved,” adding it appeared “to be an isolated incident.”


	“The first victim was transported to a local hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries,” Cpl. Shaun Stalnaker wrote. “The second victim was also transported and is currently receiving medical treatment. A third adult male victim later arrived at a local hospital as a walk-in, also suffering from a laceration determined to be non-life-threatening.” As of Saturday, a suspect had not yet been identified.


	“The Hampton Police Division is seeking the public's assistance in identifying the suspect in connection with a stabbing that occurred on September 19, 2025.”

	Phish addressed the incident in a statement on Instagram Saturday, saying that while they “don't have more information than what has been reported by the police,” the band was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy.

	“During last night's show, a tragic incident took place in the parking lot outside Hampton Coliseum. There was an altercation behind one of the tents in the unofficial vending area in which someone lost their life and two other people were injured,” the band said. “We don't have more information than what has been reported by the police, who called it an isolated incident, but what we do know is upsetting enough. We are deeply saddened by this and our hearts go out to all of those affected.” 

	











	Phish was performing at the Hampton Coliseum as part of their summer tour. The band's Saturday and Sunday night concerts in Hampton, their final nights on tour, were set to go on as planned.

	Although Eugene Levy has been keeping busy abroad as The Reluctant Traveler, he's always ready to revisit Schitt's Creek.


	Despite his son and co-creator/co-star Dan Levy previously revealing he has a “kernel of an idea” for a new iteration of their beloved Canadian sitcom, the Golden Globe-nominated father apparently has yet to hear it.


	“If he said he had a kernel of an idea for a reboot, he didn't lay it on me. I don't know what he necessarily comes up with, I don't have Instagram,” he quipped on Today‘s ‘Girl Code‘.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Listen, we've always said we would love—obviously, we love this group, we love the cast, we love the show, and we would love to get together and do something,” added Eugene. “It's just, no idea has come up. Nobody has come up with the idea yet. And whatever it is, it has to start kind of on the level where we left off. Otherwise, there's no point.”

	











	Commenting on the potential of a Schitt's Creek movie, Eugene said, “Wow, that's a good prediction. I kind of like that. That gets me excited. Never say never.”


	With fans clamoring for a Schitt's Creek revival ever since its six-season run ended in 2020, Dan teased his “kernel of an idea” for the reboot on Watch What Happens Live in July.


	“I think about it all the time,” said Dan, adding, “I love the show so much, and I don't want to disappoint the show and I don't want to disappoint the fans. And I know it's easy to just take a check and put something out there, but I care about it too much. I'm just waiting for that idea to be the right one. And then maybe, yeah.”


	Following the show's 2020 finale, the show earned Eugene and Dan an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, as well as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Eugene and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Dan, who also won in the writing and directing categories for the final season.

The Oscar-winning helmer behind 'The Dark Knight' and ‘Oppenheimer' ran unopposed to lead the more than 19,000-member union.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	The Directors Guild of America has appointed one of its most celebrated members as its new president.


Christopher Nolan was elected during the union's biennial national convention, with results released Saturday. Nolan, who ran for the top office unopposed, will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the 19,500-member union of directors, associate and assistant directors, unit production managers and stage managers through the 2023 actors and writers strikes.




	“To be elected President of the Directors Guild of America is one of the greatest honors of my career,” the director of Oppenheimer and The Dark Knight said in a statement. “Our industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild's membership for entrusting me with this responsibility. I also want to thank President Glatter for her leadership over the past four years. I look forward to collaborating with her and the newly elected Board to achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.”

	It's a major development for the DGA, given that Nolan is one of the best-known directors of his generation, associated with puzzle box-like stories that play with themes of time and memory. 2000's Memento, starring Guy Pearce, made him a director to watch in Hollywood, while Nolan's take on the Batman franchise, starting with 2005's Batman Begins, earned him a cult following. In the years since, as Nolan has proven to be a box office draw, he has leveraged his celebrity to celebrate seeing films in theaters — and championed the use of the 70mm format.

	Film fans outside the thirty-mile zone may be less familiar, however, with Nolan's union service, even as it has ramped up in the last decade. A DGA member since 2001, Nolan has served on the union's national board and Western directors council since 2015. He is currently the chair of the union's theatrical creative rights committee and its artificial intelligence committee.


	During the convention, the union's 167 delegates additionally re-elected veteran television directors Laura Belsey (The Walking Dead) as the group's national vice president and Paris Barclay (Doctor Odyssey) as its secretary-treasurer. 


	CBS associate director Joyce Thomas was elected assistant secretary treasurer, Malcom in the Middle director Todd Holland was elected first vice president, Apollo 13 helmer Ron Howard was elected second vice president and The Woman King director Gina Prince-Bythewood was elected third vice president.


	The guild's freshly elected leaders will soon be put to the test as the DGA enters its latest negotiations over its basic agreement with studios and streamers next year. On Saturday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — which bargains on behalf of these major employers — released a statement congratulating Nolan. 


	The group said, “We look forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.”

	Nolan called the position “one of the greatest honors of my career,” adding, “Our industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild's membership for entrusting me with this responsibility. I also want to thank President Glatter for her leadership over the past four years. I look forward to collaborating with her and the newly elected Board to achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.”


	In a statement on the election, the AMPTP said, “The AMPTP congratulates Christopher Nolan on his election as President of the Directors Guild of America. We look forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.”


	A DGA member since 2001, serving on its National Board and Western Directors Council since 2015, Nolan also chairs its Theatrical Creative Rights Committee and its Artificial Intelligence Committee.

Thankfully someone who is brilliant and merit based.  Their are way to many C students underneath him that are agenda driven. My bet he sees thru them and gets the Dga back on track.

I haven't seen Chris or Ron show up to any of the board meetings in two years

Maybe now the guild will finally grow a spine.

Genuinely surprised this is something Nolan wants.

Why 6 veeps?

	One of Hollywood's most provocative young voices of the '80s and '90s, Gregg Araki remains optimistic for a new generation of filmmakers.


	Ahead of his appearance at Friday's Academy Museum screening of Mysterious Skin (2004), the ‘New Queer Cinema' alum mused on how there are “very few really interesting voices” being platformed in Hollywood as he spoke with Deadline about the struggles facing young creatives in the film industry.


	“Rick Linklater and I talk about this, 'cause we're like the grandpas of Sundance at this point, and It's so much easier now to make a movie than it used to be,” explained Araki. “But because back in the days, when we were doing Slacker and Living End or [Totally] Fucked Up or whatever then, like on 16 millimeter, it's super hard to shoot. It's just very cumbersome and very difficult, but now with the new technology, iPhones and computers and all these tiny little cameras that shoot 6K, all this technology is so incredible now.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Noting his amazement with Resillion's “incredible” editing capabilities, which he used with his Mysterious Skin 4K restoration, Araki put the software to use on his upcoming film I Want Your Sex.


	“The technology is so advanced and so easy to make a movie now, but there's very few really interesting voices that are using that technology, you know what I mean?” he added. “And it's sort of—I don't wanna say harder to be an artist now, but I do think I feel very fortunate to be the generation I was because I was kind of there when punk rock music came out, when indie film happened.”

	











	Araki continued, “I feel like, to be original, to have a voice, and to be unique in this world, where there's so much content and so many filmmakers, and YouTube and TikTok have so much fucking stuff being created, it's so hard to… cut through the noise and just have a unique voice or be an artist, besides the fact that the world is fucking falling apart. I am always hopeful or optimistic for young artists in their 20s, just doing it and figuring out a way to do it, 'cause I don't think it's the same as it was when when we were doing it.”


	With the cult longevity of his early films like The Living End (1992) and ‘The Teen Apocalypse Trilogy' (1993-'97) putting a new generation of cinephiles in a chokehold, Araki explained the themes of nihilism in his movies are so timeless and “why my fans are so great.”


	“They've been so loyal and dedicated. There's not a lot out there very unique to this day, Doom Generations aren't getting made every day. These movies, they're still so fresh and topical, and they are different than everything else, which I think is a good thing,” he explained. “But it's also why there's a unique and kind of culty—almost like a litmus test of people that love whatever movie it is, Doom Generation, Nowhere, Mysterious Skin, whatever it is.


	“It's like they speak to a very specific sensibility, cause I've had people say, ‘Oh yeah, I've met my partner because they were a fan.' You're like a kindred spirit, it's like you get me 'cause you get this movie, and I think that that's so amazing and cool. And it really means a lot to me that the movies resonate with people in that way,” said Araki.

	After announcing a Charlie Kirk tribute special to take over Jimmy Kimmel‘s time slot, Sinclair backed out of Friday's planned programming.


	The country's largest ABC affiliate group instead shared a YouTube link to the special after making an example of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in a statement announcing they would be giving the remembrance his late-night slot.


	“Tonight, Sinclair will continue to air ABC network programming as scheduled in the late-night time period,” the company shared in a Friday update on X. “The Charlie Kirk special will instead be available on The National News Desk's YouTube channel, ensuring viewers can continue to enjoy ABC programming while also providing full access to the special online.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The latest comes after Disney‘s announcement that the late-night show will be “preempted indefinitely,” following the FCC‘s warning about Kimmel's Kirk comments.


	In a news release, Sinclair previously announced that they will not lift the suspension on Kimmel's show “until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.”

Watch now: https://t.co/2OG7KE9S8Z pic.twitter.com/oRNt3vXnhU


	“Sinclair also calls upon Mr. Kimmel to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family. Furthermore, we ask Mr. Kimmel to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA,” the statement continued. “Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return Jimmy Kimmel Live! to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform.”

	











	Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement, “Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country. We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”


	The stunning suspension of Kimmel comes mere minutes after Nexstar also axed his late-night show on the 32 ABC affiliates it owns out of a total of 200 stations throughout the nation.


	“Nexstar's owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show,” said the company in a statement Wednesday. “Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.”


	Known for his ‘Prove Me Wrong' debates and MAGA POV, activist Kirk was shot dead at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10 in a tragedy that has sent shock through the political and media worlds.


	Having previously mocked Trump over POTUS' take on the NFL and TikTok, Kimmel offered his blunt assessment of the aftermath of Kirk's death in his opening monologue on his September 15 show: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” the host said.

Sinclair and Nexstar will not get further retransmission fees from me.

Drop locals, use my antenna, and get whatever from ESPN and Hulu apps for the small % of live broadcasts.

I am done

I was surprised to see them not pre-empt football or even WNBA for the service. I thought all channels were blocking regular programming to cover this.

An affiliate without ABC programming is what?

I would assume that their value is directly attached to the program deals they have…correct?

Let them go their own way…create their own programming…I'd like to see that.

No apologies will *ever* happen and Sinclair and Nexstar will be paying Kimmel millions, as will Disney and the FCC.

Oh, they are folding…

The 55-year-old son of President Joe Biden participated in the Matthew Perry Foundation's summit on substance abuse, a gathering held at CAA. Biden opened up in a revealing chat with NPR's Brian Mann. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Hunter Biden went deep during a three-hour interview on Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan in July, opening up about how the media covered his crack cocaine addiction, his journey in sobriety and yes, that infamous laptop. But the moment that generated the most headlines came when Biden took aim at George Clooney by saying “fuck him and everyone around him” in response to the actor's column in The New York Times suggesting President Joe Biden drop out of the 2024 election.


	After the self-described “passionate” diatribe, Biden, a frequent target of conservatives and critics of his father, once again became a topic of conversation. Because he used foul language and grew emotional in defending his father, critics assumed that he was back on drugs. “Don and Eric [Trump] went on TV and said that I was smoking crack still, and obviously I had a drug problem. [Former Fox News host turned United States attorney for the District of Columbia] Jeanine Pirro said that when I got a haircut, I must have done that because I was getting drug tested,” Biden recalled Thursday as he participated in the Matthew Perry Foundation's first-ever summit at CAA headquarters in Los Angeles.

	Though he's been the target of such attacks for years, Biden told the summit that he's no longer letting such baseless chatter affect him, especially now that he's been sober for six years. “I don't care. I truly don't care. I had to make a decision that I'm not going to care about what other people think of me, otherwise I would never get out of bed in the morning,” continued Biden, appearing from out of the country on Zoom in CAA's private theater while speaking with NPR's Brian Mann, the outlet's first national addiction correspondent. The theater hosted Matthew Perry Foundation co-founders Doug Chapin and Lisa Kasteler-Calio, his former CAA agent Peter Levine, Warner Bros. Television Group executive vp of publicity and communications Rebecca Marks, CAA's Kevin Huvane and Hylda Queally and The Pitt creator R. Scott Gemmill, the latter of whom participated in a conversation about how his Emmy winning show tackles substance use.

	While Biden's comments are newsworthy, the context of what he said also fit nicely into the summit's theme of stigma around substance abuse and addiction. It's a topic Biden knows a lot about and he shared about the shame that he carried as he battled his addiction, giving credit to his family for never giving up on him even while his dark secrets became fodder for tabloids and his father's political opponents.


	“There's not a family in this country that doesn't have direct experience with substance use disorder and addiction, whether it's alcohol or whether it's crack cocaine. What I really hope is that what I'm able to do is just talk as honestly about it with anyone who wants to talk about it, to give them the hope that today I am more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my entire life. I am healthier than I've ever been in my entire life, and I'm more certain of who I am than I've ever been in my entire life,” Biden explained, adding that he arrived at such a peaceful place thanks to his recovery and owning his story before others could. “The hard part is I made a decision that I was going to be transparent before transparency was forced on me. I did an interview with Adam Entous at The New Yorker. People thought I was crazy at the time, largely because of how honest I was. I didn't say that I was an addict or that I just used cocaine. I talked about the fact that I was crack addict, and when you say you're a crack addict, understandably, people have been conditioned to believe something that is monstrous. They still throw that in my face today.”

	











	He remains unfazed.


	“[Peace] was amazingly given to me by the people that attacked me, and it was given to me in the sense that I don't have to hide anymore. There's not another shoe that's going to drop, at least not another shoe that's true. I have been freed from having to tell white lies anymore about who I am or who I was, and the places that I found myself in addiction,” continued Biden, who revealed that he first discovered he had a problem with alcohol at age 33. Now 55, Biden has been to eight or nine rehabs and checked into multiple outpatient programs. “Nobody comes into recovery on a winning streak. Nobody. And I have been in rooms that I know that I just couldn't die in…without being incredibly shamed, and I'm free of that now. I wish I could give that to everybody, but it is so hard.”


	He said the “level of shaming” that he's experienced over the last five years has been unlike anything he's experienced in his life. But he also put himself through the ringer over not being available to his three daughters while he was in active addiction. “I had an enormous amount of shame over that. And ironically because of the position that I found myself in with my dad running for president and before that [while he was in office], and the incredible focus that they had on me, I was given the gift of not having any more secrets to have to hide,” Biden said. “You'd think that I'm exaggerating, but I truly believe that that's probably the thing that has allowed me to stay clean and sober beyond the love and support of my family. I'm also really proud of myself for having six years [of sobriety] right now. I was given the gift of not having any more of those secrets. It is all out there for anyone to see.”

	











	Biden added that while he still may be in the “white hot spotlight” of news outlets like The Daily Mail, The New York Post, The New York Times and Fox News, he's still got an army of loved ones by his side. 


	“I had people that no matter what would stand by my side, love and respect me, beginning with my dad most importantly, but also my children and my wife, my mom and my sister and an entire network of people that I know I would not have made it without,” he concluded. “What my family never did is they never let me go. I tried with all my life to disappear, but they never, ever, ever cut the cord. They cut the cord in terms of anything that would further my addiction, but my dad, he literally never stopped. Ultimately, when I was ready to reach up from the bottom of the well and pull myself out, which I had to do, I knew that there was a hand there.”

Just about everybody loves a good mystery, but it's not always for the same reasons. Some folks are obsessed with sleuthing and rapidly forming hypotheses on limited information in order to feel a sense or order and control in the universe—true crime docs and Reddit conspiracy threads are their playgrounds. 

For others, the mystery itself is the draw; the romantic idea that something, somehow, can actually remain bewildering in a world of overwhelming surveillance and data bombardment is quite the comforting thought. “May it always remain unsolved,” they might say.

Pop music is chock-full of little mysteries of its own, of course, although the number seems to be dwindling year by year, as obsessed scholars have nearly overturned every single stone ever touched by a Beatle, and every beard ever worn by Bob Dylan. 

Fortunately, there are still 2,843 music mysteries classified as “vaguely uncertain” by the Council for Unnecessary Studies, which gives us the chance to randomly select five of them for an update on our latest investigations. 

The 1993 mega hit ‘I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)' has caused decades of confusion. What exactly was “that”? 

Songwriter Jim Steinman always maintained the answer was right there in the lyrics — each verse includes a list of things Meat Loaf would do for love, followed by the one thing he wouldn't. For example: he'd “run right into hell and back,” but he won't “forget the way you feel right now.” Still, Meat Loaf admitted he loved the ambiguity, and fans continue to debate it like it's pop's ultimate Zen koan.

REM's ‘What's the Frequency, Kenneth?' (1994) was inspired by a bizarre 1986 incident in which American news anchor Dan Rather was attacked in New York by a man repeating the phrase, “Kenneth, what's the frequency?” The attacker, later identified after the song's release as William Tager, was a mentally ill ex-con who was convinced that TV networks were beaming signals into his head. Michael Stipe didn't know that detail at the time, however, so he spun the surreal event into a song about cultural dislocation. 

But is the original mystery actually solved? Do we know for certain that Tager wasn't being victimised by a TV signal, and that Dan Rather, aka Kenneth, didn't know its frequency? Choose your own adventure on that one, I guess.

Carly Simon's sassy 1972 classic ‘You're So Vain' kept fans guessing for generations about which famous jerk might have inspired its biting lyrics. Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, and Warren Beatty were all rumoured suspects, but it was just as fun to insert your own narcissistic ex into the story.

Then, for some reason, in 2015, Simon finally confirmed that at least one verse was indeed about Beatty. Simon insisted multiple men are still implicated, however, and she's never revealed the full list, so again, the game's afoot if you like a good scorn-based whodunnit.

On MF Doom's beloved Mm..Food (2004), a guest rapper billed as Mr. Fantastik appears on ‘Rapp Snitch Knishes,' spitting arguably the best verse on the entire album: “True to the ski mask, New York's my origin / Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion / Accordin' to him, when the D's rushed in / Complication from the wire, testimony was thin.” 

Yet no one has ever confirmed this MC's identity. No photos, no other credits, no social media trail. Some believe he was a New York underground rapper who never pursued a career; others suspect he was Doom himself under an alias, pitch-shifted and disguised. With Doom's death in 2020, the mystery deepened. Unless tapes emerge from the vaults, Mr Fantastik may remain hip-hop's phantom guest — a testament to Doom's love of comic-book alter egos and unsolvable puzzles.

On ‘You Said Something' from her 2000 album Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, PJ Harvey sings of a fleeting but magical moment in New York: “On a rooftop in Brooklyn / At one in the morning / Watching the lights flash / In Manhattan. / You said something / That I've never forgotten.” 

The song repeatedly mentions that “something” but leaves it poetically, romantically, ironically, and frustratingly unquoted. Was it a sweet statement of affection? A riddle? A secret confession? By withholding the detail, Harvey actually creates something far more interesting, as the listener is left to ponder the profundity of some random's rooftop remark that managed to inspire a song this good.

The familiar grounds of Heritage Village took on a different feel under the cloak of darkness on August 23rd. The historic buildings, usually full of life and history, stood silent and unlit, creating an atmosphere of nervous energy. This was the setting for a sold-out public investigation hosted by Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, an event that blended local history with a search for the supernatural, and left this reporter with experiences that defy easy explanation.

The goal of the evening, aside from providing a thrill, was to support a local landmark. Brad Monks, founder of Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, said his group is passionate about giving back.

"We, more than anything, would love trying to help out these types of locations that we do, especially Heritage Village or any museums or anything like that with historical significance in the province," Monks explained. "If we can help out, that's what we like to do."




The strange occurrences began for me inside the Vipond House. Without being touched, my phone suddenly began playing the song "Tightrope Years," specifically at the lyric, "And the years hit rewind." It played through the chorus and stopped. This happened five more times, four inside the house and once more just outside the building, even after we filmed closing all apps and turning the volume completely down. It remains an unexplainable, technological anomaly in a house from a different era.

My experience wasn't isolated. Monks noted that many guests felt something that night. "A lot of people like heard voices, some seen the shadow figures and stuff and things move," he said.

The most profound moment, however, happened inside the Knibbs House. I was attempting to communicate with whatever might be present using a device called a Rempod, which lights up in response to changes in the electromagnetic field. I began a simple yes/no conversation, and after establishing a connection, I asked if the spirit wanted to sing a song. The Rempod lit up for yes.




I suggested a classic children's song: "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."

What happened next was captured on audio and video. A device known as a spirit box, which rapidly scans radio frequencies, creating white noise, began to sing. Through the static, the clear, melodic tune of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" could be heard, seemingly in the voice of a little girl.

For Monks, who has been investigating for over 25 years, these are the moments that challenge even the most hardened skeptics. He is adamant about the authenticity of his group's work.

"I'm not going to jeopardize my experience and my reputation or try to rig something or anything like that," Monks stated firmly. "What you get is what you get. Sometimes, you know, we'll go to a location... and we go there and nothing happens. We come up with nothing. But the majority of the time, we come up with a little bit of something... I always say, if you're a skeptic, come with us for one night and check it out. And I think you'll change your mind on it."




Following the success of the August event, Monks is already in discussions with Heritage Village to plan an even bigger event for next year, with a vision to create a city-wide haunted tour.

"We're hoping not just to have Heritage Village for next year," Monks revealed. "I'm looking at bringing Soo Line on board, and I'm going to talk to, and see if I can get the Tommy Douglas Center on board with it as well."

For now, the grounds of Heritage Village are quiet once more, but for those who were there on that dark August night, the memories of inexplicable songs will linger for a long time.

It's been 20 years since Supernatural first hit television screens on the now-defunct WB back in September 2005, but fans haven't let up on their love for the show. Still making waves on streaming, the show continues on as a fan-favorite in an age where spooky procedurals are mostly a thing of the past. But there's one Season 1 episode that continues to get vast amounts of hate from the Supernatural community, even all these years later. Funny enough, stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki tend to agree with the sentiments themselves — though not for the reasons you might think. That episode? The infamous "Bugs."

If you ask just about any Supernatural fan what the worst episode of the show is, undoubtedly "Bugs" will be listed as at least one of them. Though not the lowest-rated of the show (that dishonor belongs to "Bloodlines"), nor even the most poorly constructed, this Season 1 episode was the first hour of the show to really underwhelm audiences. After fantastic episodes like the haunted mirror-centric "Bloody Mary" or the gross body-horror that is "Skin," fans just didn't think that "Bugs'" little titular antagonists were as frightening as, say, a Wendigo stalking your campsite. When looking back on the show's 20th anniversary, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles reflected on this infamous episode, and when asked if it was the worst of the show, they seemed to agree with the general fan consensus.

"Yes, I think it was [the worst], because of what we went through and what it ended up being," Ackles explained to Entertainment Weekly. "Basically, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze." According to Ackles and Padalecki, the pair were surrounded by somewhere around 70,000 bees for the episode and were being constantly stung during filming. It's one thing to be in a room with a guy wearing a Hook Man costume or with fake vampire teeth, but it's another thing entirely to put your actors in the same room as the creatures (or insects, in this case) that they're supposed to be battling. Padalecki went on to elaborate that things only got worse when they were told by a bee specialist that they had to pretend to swat the bees by simply guiding them across the room rather than actually swatting, which is what the scene called for. "It was the most absurd thing," Padalecki noted.

Of course, the worst part of the whole experience (you know, aside from getting stung several times by bees) was that the bugs didn't do the job. "Then they get to post [production], and the bees didn't show up on camera," Ackles added. "So, they had to VIXFX the bees." In the end, all the pain that Ackles and Padalecki had to experience on set for the sake of authenticity went out the window. Either because of the size of the insects or the camera's frame rate, the bees failed to make their mark on the actual episode. It's no wonder that the Supernatural stars look back in horror at "Bugs," an episode just about anyone would want to forget after that filming experience. Nevertheless, we're still here talking about it 20 years later...

Again, "Bugs" has become notorious among Supernatural fans due to its clear use of genre clichés, an uninspired plot, and stakes that never quite added up when compared to taking down otherworldly ghosts and demons. While perhaps not really the worst of the show (it generally looks better than most later season episodes, like "Raising Hell"), the whole project put Ackles and Padalecki through a literal bug-infested hell, which certainly wasn't worth the effort. Of course, it's also worth noting that Ackles, Padalecki, and Misha Collins all speak poorly of Supernatural's seventh season as well, particularly the strand of episodes where the show was making constant (and childish) jokes about the Leviathan leader Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart). Over 15 years on the air, it's no wonder that Supernatural sometimes got things wrong. But, in some ways, all of that can be traced back to that very first failure in "Bugs."

When pit up against several other Season 1 favorites (of which most episodes from the inaugural season are), "Bugs" stands out as being overly reliant on creeping out the audience rather than truly scaring them. Bugs crawling out through a shower head or bathtub drain don't quite live up to a possessed scarecrow hunting our heroes through an apple orchard or even a demon-possessed pilot trying to crash a plane full of passengers post-9/11. The stakes simply don't feel as high, and the whole idea that this subdivision was being built on cursed Native American land feels like something we've seen many times on The X-Files before (there are some unfortunate similarities to that show's worst episode, "Teso Dos Bichos," which was ironically also directed by the late Kim Manners).

No matter if you feel like "Bugs" really is the worst of Supernatural or simply one of the worst, there's no mistaking that it was the show's first real misfire after several great standalone horror stories. It's easy to look back at Season 1's impressive catalog of episodes and single out episodes like "Bugs" or "Route 666," but the truth is, two subpar episodes in the span of a 22-episode season is pretty impressive for any show, let alone one just getting started. As Supernatural turns 20 this year, revisiting the series reminds us of just how good we had it back when the Winchesters were still hunting on air.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix in the U.S.

Online conspiracy theorists ‘completely dehumanised' Jay Slater after his disappearance in Tenerife, his mother Debbie said

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Jay Slater's mother has called for new regulations to be introduced to curb the spread of misinformation about missing people online as she speaks out in a bid to set the record straight on his final hours.

Debbie Duncan, 57, said “armchair detectives” had been allowed to concoct “shocking” theories and “completely dehumanise” her son after the 19-year-old's disappearance in Tenerife last year. 

A coroner later ruled Jay's death was caused by a traumatic brain injury caused by a fall sustained when he became lost in the treacherous mountains of Park Rural de Teno.

But, speaking to The Times, she said content creators were still unpicking Jay's death online, claiming he is still alive and hiding out, ready to reclaim money raised by an emergency GoFundMe appeal for his grieving family.

“How can you say the F-word on Facebook and have your account removed, but people can say what they like about my son and that's fine?” she asked.

In a separate interview with The Mirror, she said she wanted to “fight for Jay's name” after the media frenzy that surrounded his death.

“To continue making videos (and posting them online) more than 12 months on, going through every bit of detail over and over again is shocking. When will it stop?

“Social media is good for spreading awareness, but can also be the work of the devil.

“If I can save another family from going through the trauma we have had to endure, it will be worth it.”

Her comments come ahead of a Channel 4 documentary,The Disappearance of Jay Slater, which airs on Sunday, 28 September at 9pm.

The programme will give unprecedented access into the 19-year-old's final hours, which became the subject of countless conspiracy theories and media reports in June 2024.

An apprentice bricklayer from Lancashire, Jay had gone on holiday to the New Rave Generation (NRG) festival in Tenerife with his friends, Lucy Law and Bradley Geoghegan.

On the night of his disappearance, he had been out at the Papagayo nightclub in Playa de Las Americas when he decided to return to the Airbnb of Ayub Qassim and Steven “Rocky” Roccas, two men he had met during the holiday. The villa was 23 miles northwest of Playa de las Americas, surrounded by the rocky national park Rural de Teno.

He later phoned Ms Law to say he was lost in the mountains and had cut his leg on a cactus. His phone then died, and a huge manhunt was launched.

Rescue teams scoured the treacherous terrain for weeks in the burning sun in a bid to find the teenager – all the while, conspiracy theorists online sent Debbie and her family on “wild goose chases”.

After 29 days, his body was uncovered in what a coroner later called a “particularly dangerous” area of the vast park. He died instantly from a traumatic brain injury as a result of a fall. The 19-year-old had traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine in his body, according to toxicologists.

But even the coroner's ruling didn't stop misinformation swirling online. Theories that he had been kidnapped by drug dealers whom he owed money, or had staged his own death, can still be found, 15 months on from his death.

Debbie told The Mirror: “What we have had to endure has really opened my eyes.

“It is not just us who are horrified by what has gone on – professional people are horrified too. I wanted this documentary to be made because I want to show Jay is a real person and not just the face of a story.

“I want to show everyone we are a normal family. Jay was a popular guy with a lot of friends and it's been hard to watch it. I cried all the way through, but I hope it will finally shut down the armchair detectives. It's been very well put together.”

CBS' S.W.A.T. wrapped its seven-season run this past year, and while the show's upcoming spin-off is going to bring back some of the core characters, there are several mysteries that the new series isn't likely to touch on. Shemar Moore's Daniel "Hondo" Harrison, who was the central figure of SWAT throughout its run, will be returning for the spin-off, but he's the only name permanently attached.

While SWAT season 8 worked hard to ensure that many of the characters that viewers had gotten to know over the years had the majority of their loose ends tied up, the series wasn't certain on whether it'd be picked up for another season. After two separate cancelations, SWAT was actually canceled at CBS after its recent season, meaning the series finale wasn't technically planned.

Though the finale was able to clean up the loose ends of the series in some ways, it wasn't able to ensure that every unfinished story was revisited while also providing an interesting case for 20-Squad. Allowing the series to do what it does best by Hondo and the rest of 20-Squad working through a high-stakes case was more important than revisiting the past.

As SWAT fans prepare to see how SWAT Exiles evens out, it's clear that the show is planning to focus on the new squad of SWAT team members than on the past cast members from the CBS series. While Moore will return, along with what appear to be shorter appearances by Jay Harrington and David Lim, who played Deacon and Tan, others aren't slated yet.

SWAT had eight seasons worth of story to tell, bringing viewers into a universe for long stretches where they got to know the members of 20-Squad. Although things changed for some, like Dominique Luca (Kenny Johnson) or Jim Street (Alex Russell), their stories were still important to SWAT fans. Unfortunately, many loose ends may not be tied up by the new spin-off.

While Luca's time on SWAT wasn't short, it was clear that by the end of his time on the series, there were some underlying issues that may have been pushing Johnson away from the show. Even so, Luca's exit was traumatic to SWAT fans and 20-Squad. After a serious on-duty shooting where he was hit multiple times, Luca suffered permanent nerve damage.

Deciding that he wasn't interested in sticking to administrative work, Luca chose to take an early retirement from the LAPD. Despite being a legacy member of SWAT who had struggled for years carrying around the weight of being a generational team member, Luca chose to end his career honorably and move on to something new. 

Though Luca's decision made sense due to his injury, it was difficult for fans to get behind, especially knowing that he was one of the most consistent SWAT team members on the show. Steady and loyal, Luca's departure was hard on everyone. While Luca could appear on SWAT Exiles, it's not likely that his whereabouts or current state will make it to the spin-off.

Early on in the SWAT canon, Jessica Cortez (Stephanie Sigman) was one of the central figures of the show. Her relationship with Hondo framed the first dramatic arc of the series, and though things fizzled out with their romance quickly, there was always a question lingering within the first seasons about the show choosing to revisit their romantic relationship someday.

Although Cortez was a big part of the first seasons of the series, her quick exit from the show was a shock to the system. At the end of SWAT season 2, it's revealed that Cortez is taking on an undercover assignment with the FBI. The assignment, which was meant to be temporary at first, ultimately becomes a long-term position.

Though Sigman was pregnant and left the show, the explanation for Cortez's disappearance often left SWAT fans at a loss. It was clear she wouldn't be returning, but leaving the door partially open and never really replacing her was a tough pill to swallow. It's unlikely that Exiles will choose to revisit Cortez or give updates on what she's been up to.

While Commander Robert Hicks (Patrick St. Esprit) became a major piece of SWAT's puzzle after Cortez's departure, he's always been an incredibly difficult character to watch. Hicks, who's dealt with family issues throughout his time on SWAT along with his professional problems, made it clear that he wasn't going to deal with either as he navigated tricky business with 20-Squad.

SWAT season 8 saw Hicks facing professional trouble as he worked through a tough case with Deputy Chief Bennett (Merrin Dungey) keeping a close eye on his work. After what Bennett deemed a slip up, Hicks was put on suspension, but after he helped the team with another critical case, she chose to keep him in his role, valuing his contributions.

Though Hicks was ultimately not ousted from SWAT and kept in his role, it was clear that the fallout from Bennett's disciplinary action was taking a toll on the leader as the season came to a close. While Exiles may give an update on what happened to Hicks after SWAT came to a close, the spin-off isn't likely to be as in-depth as viewers would like.

SWAT's biggest romantic storyline focused on Street and Chris Alonso (Lina Escola) throughout the first five seasons of the series, but the show left them off on a confusing note. While Chris and Street spent years dancing around each other's feelings, it was clear that the pair were going to wind up together from nearly the beginning of the show.

Even so, Chris and Street's relationship was never easy. By the time they finally got together, Escola was exiting the show and, ultimately, left Street on his own, mentioning that they were still together from time to time. Russell, who spent SWAT season 6 preparing for his own exit, ultimately left the show on a high note, revealing he was proposing.

SWAT fans have long since believed that Street and Chris, either engaged or married, would be returning to the show for its end, but with sudden cancelation after sudden cancelation, SWAT never had the chance to bring them back. Now, while the couple is presumably together, it feels unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will explain what happened to the pair or bring them back.

As two of the main cast members throughout the final seasons of SWAT, Miguel "Miko" Alfaro (Niko Pepaj) and Zoe Powell (Anna Enger Ritch) were some of the most entertaining parts of the show after Street and Chris' departure. Alfrao, who was an old rival of Street and transferred in from Long Beach as well, worked to prove himself throughout the series. 

Powell, who began appearing with recurring guest spots on the show before becoming a full-fledged cast member later on, was another big presence on 20-Squad throughout the final seasons. Working through personal issues as she got to know the son she gave up for adoption during her first years on SWAT, Powell's human storylines were an anchor point for SWAT's final seasons.

Although SWAT wrapped both Alfaro and Powell's stories to some degree, their interpersonal issues weren't worked through in the same way that others' problems were before the show came to an end. Alfaro, who often had issues with Tan during his time on screen, didn't get validated as much as he could've, while Powell's relationships were never fully resolved. It's unlikely we'll see resolutions on Exiles.

The key character who joined SWAT post-Chris and Street was Devin Gamble (Annie Ilonzeh), who joined during the final season of the series to bring more drama than any other new recruit had in the past. Gamble, whose father murdered a cop in the past, was someone that 20-Squad wasn't prepared to defend when she made it onto the squad.

Even so, Gamble tried her best to fit in and ensure that she was prepared at all times. Facing distrust, prejudice, and flat-out hate from offices outside of 20-Squad, Gamble's up and down with the LAPD was incredibly difficult. While the series ended on a somewhat high-note for Gamble, it was fairly unstable for her to work with the team until the very end.

Though Gamble reaches a point of acceptance by the end of SWAT, it's clear that there's still a fair bit of work to be done for her to fit in with the rest of 20-Squad as a whole. While Exiles may choose to share more about Gamble, it's unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will devote genuine time to her story as they move forward.
