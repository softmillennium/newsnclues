                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just about everybody loves a good mystery, but it's not always for the same reasons. Some folks are obsessed with sleuthing and rapidly forming hypotheses on limited information in order to feel a sense or order and control in the universe—true crime docs and Reddit conspiracy threads are their playgrounds. Pop music is chock-full of little mysteries of its own, of course, although the number seems to be dwindling year by year, as obsessed scholars have nearly overturned every single stone ever touched by a Beatle, and every beard ever worn by Bob Dylan. Fortunately, there are still 2,843 music mysteries classified as “vaguely uncertain” by the Council for Unnecessary Studies, which gives us the chance to randomly select five of them for an update on our latest investigations. Songwriter Jim Steinman always maintained the answer was right there in the lyrics — each verse includes a list of things Meat Loaf would do for love, followed by the one thing he wouldn't. For example: he'd “run right into hell and back,” but he won't “forget the way you feel right now.” Still, Meat Loaf admitted he loved the ambiguity, and fans continue to debate it like it's pop's ultimate Zen koan. (1994) was inspired by a bizarre 1986 incident in which American news anchor Dan Rather was attacked in New York by a man repeating the phrase, “Kenneth, what's the frequency?” The attacker, later identified after the song's release as William Tager, was a mentally ill ex-con who was convinced that TV networks were beaming signals into his head. Michael Stipe didn't know that detail at the time, however, so he spun the surreal event into a song about cultural dislocation. Do we know for certain that Tager wasn't being victimised by a TV signal, and that Dan Rather, aka Kenneth, didn't know its frequency? Choose your own adventure on that one, I guess. Carly Simon's sassy 1972 classic ‘You're So Vain' kept fans guessing for generations about which famous jerk might have inspired its biting lyrics. Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, and Warren Beatty were all rumoured suspects, but it was just as fun to insert your own narcissistic ex into the story. Then, for some reason, in 2015, Simon finally confirmed that at least one verse was indeed about Beatty. Simon insisted multiple men are still implicated, however, and she's never revealed the full list, so again, the game's afoot if you like a good scorn-based whodunnit. Yet no one has ever confirmed this MC's identity. Some believe he was a New York underground rapper who never pursued a career; others suspect he was Doom himself under an alias, pitch-shifted and disguised. Unless tapes emerge from the vaults, Mr Fantastik may remain hip-hop's phantom guest — a testament to Doom's love of comic-book alter egos and unsolvable puzzles. On ‘You Said Something' from her 2000 album Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, PJ Harvey sings of a fleeting but magical moment in New York: “On a rooftop in Brooklyn / At one in the morning / Watching the lights flash / In Manhattan. The song repeatedly mentions that “something” but leaves it poetically, romantically, ironically, and frustratingly unquoted.</p>

Visit weyburn.ca for the latest traffic restrictions and road closures around Weyburn. The familiar grounds of Heritage Village took on a different feel under the cloak of darkness on August 23rd. The historic buildings, usually full of life and history, stood silent and unlit, creating an atmosphere of nervous energy. This was the setting for a sold-out public investigation hosted by Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, an event that blended local history with a search for the supernatural, and left this reporter with experiences that defy easy explanation. The goal of the evening, aside from providing a thrill, was to support a local landmark. Brad Monks, founder of Canadian Paranormal Expeditions, said his group is passionate about giving back. "We, more than anything, would love trying to help out these types of locations that we do, especially Heritage Village or any museums or anything like that with historical significance in the province," Monks explained. It played through the chorus and stopped. This happened five more times, four inside the house and once more just outside the building, even after we filmed closing all apps and turning the volume completely down. "A lot of people like heard voices, some seen the shadow figures and stuff and things move," he said. I was attempting to communicate with whatever might be present using a device called a Rempod, which lights up in response to changes in the electromagnetic field. What happened next was captured on audio and video. A device known as a spirit box, which rapidly scans radio frequencies, creating white noise, began to sing. For Monks, who has been investigating for over 25 years, these are the moments that challenge even the most hardened skeptics. He is adamant about the authenticity of his group's work. "I'm not going to jeopardize my experience and my reputation or try to rig something or anything like that," Monks stated firmly. Sometimes, you know, we'll go to a location... and we go there and nothing happens. I always say, if you're a skeptic, come with us for one night and check it out. And I think you'll change your mind on it." Following the success of the August event, Monks is already in discussions with Heritage Village to plan an even bigger event for next year, with a vision to create a city-wide haunted tour. "We're hoping not just to have Heritage Village for next year," Monks revealed. "I'm looking at bringing Soo Line on board, and I'm going to talk to, and see if I can get the Tommy Douglas Center on board with it as well." For now, the grounds of Heritage Village are quiet once more, but for those who were there on that dark August night, the memories of inexplicable songs will linger for a long time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been 20 years since Supernatural first hit television screens on the now-defunct WB back in September 2005, but fans haven't let up on their love for the show. Still making waves on streaming, the show continues on as a fan-favorite in an age where spooky procedurals are mostly a thing of the past. But there's one Season 1 episode that continues to get vast amounts of hate from the Supernatural community, even all these years later. Funny enough, stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki tend to agree with the sentiments themselves — though not for the reasons you might think. If you ask just about any Supernatural fan what the worst episode of the show is, undoubtedly "Bugs" will be listed as at least one of them. After fantastic episodes like the haunted mirror-centric "Bloody Mary" or the gross body-horror that is "Skin," fans just didn't think that "Bugs'" little titular antagonists were as frightening as, say, a Wendigo stalking your campsite. "Yes, I think it was [the worst], because of what we went through and what it ended up being," Ackles explained to Entertainment Weekly. According to Ackles and Padalecki, the pair were surrounded by somewhere around 70,000 bees for the episode and were being constantly stung during filming. It's one thing to be in a room with a guy wearing a Hook Man costume or with fake vampire teeth, but it's another thing entirely to put your actors in the same room as the creatures (or insects, in this case) that they're supposed to be battling. Padalecki went on to elaborate that things only got worse when they were told by a bee specialist that they had to pretend to swat the bees by simply guiding them across the room rather than actually swatting, which is what the scene called for. "Then they get to post [production], and the bees didn't show up on camera," Ackles added. It's no wonder that the Supernatural stars look back in horror at "Bugs," an episode just about anyone would want to forget after that filming experience. Again, "Bugs" has become notorious among Supernatural fans due to its clear use of genre clichés, an uninspired plot, and stakes that never quite added up when compared to taking down otherworldly ghosts and demons. Of course, it's also worth noting that Ackles, Padalecki, and Misha Collins all speak poorly of Supernatural's seventh season as well, particularly the strand of episodes where the show was making constant (and childish) jokes about the Leviathan leader Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart). Over 15 years on the air, it's no wonder that Supernatural sometimes got things wrong. When pit up against several other Season 1 favorites (of which most episodes from the inaugural season are), "Bugs" stands out as being overly reliant on creeping out the audience rather than truly scaring them. The stakes simply don't feel as high, and the whole idea that this subdivision was being built on cursed Native American land feels like something we've seen many times on The X-Files before (there are some unfortunate similarities to that show's worst episode, "Teso Dos Bichos," which was ironically also directed by the late Kim Manners). No matter if you feel like "Bugs" really is the worst of Supernatural or simply one of the worst, there's no mistaking that it was the show's first real misfire after several great standalone horror stories. It's easy to look back at Season 1's impressive catalog of episodes and single out episodes like "Bugs" or "Route 666," but the truth is, two subpar episodes in the span of a 22-episode season is pretty impressive for any show, let alone one just getting started. As Supernatural turns 20 this year, revisiting the series reminds us of just how good we had it back when the Winchesters were still hunting on air. Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix in the U.S. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Jay Slater's mother has called for new regulations to be introduced to curb the spread of misinformation about missing people online as she speaks out in a bid to set the record straight on his final hours. Debbie Duncan, 57, said “armchair detectives” had been allowed to concoct “shocking” theories and “completely dehumanise” her son after the 19-year-old's disappearance in Tenerife last year. But, speaking to The Times, she said content creators were still unpicking Jay's death online, claiming he is still alive and hiding out, ready to reclaim money raised by an emergency GoFundMe appeal for his grieving family. “How can you say the F-word on Facebook and have your account removed, but people can say what they like about my son and that's fine?” she asked. In a separate interview with The Mirror, she said she wanted to “fight for Jay's name” after the media frenzy that surrounded his death. “To continue making videos (and posting them online) more than 12 months on, going through every bit of detail over and over again is shocking. “If I can save another family from going through the trauma we have had to endure, it will be worth it.” An apprentice bricklayer from Lancashire, Jay had gone on holiday to the New Rave Generation (NRG) festival in Tenerife with his friends, Lucy Law and Bradley Geoghegan. The villa was 23 miles northwest of Playa de las Americas, surrounded by the rocky national park Rural de Teno. He later phoned Ms Law to say he was lost in the mountains and had cut his leg on a cactus. His phone then died, and a huge manhunt was launched. After 29 days, his body was uncovered in what a coroner later called a “particularly dangerous” area of the vast park. The 19-year-old had traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine in his body, according to toxicologists. But even the coroner's ruling didn't stop misinformation swirling online. Theories that he had been kidnapped by drug dealers whom he owed money, or had staged his own death, can still be found, 15 months on from his death. Debbie told The Mirror: “What we have had to endure has really opened my eyes. I wanted this documentary to be made because I want to show Jay is a real person and not just the face of a story. “I want to show everyone we are a normal family.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>wrapped its seven-season run this past year, and while the show's upcoming spin-off is going to bring back some of the core characters, there are several mysteries that the new series isn't likely to touch on. While SWAT season 8 worked hard to ensure that many of the characters that viewers had gotten to know over the years had the majority of their loose ends tied up, the series wasn't certain on whether it'd be picked up for another season. After two separate cancelations, SWAT was actually canceled at CBS after its recent season, meaning the series finale wasn't technically planned. Though the finale was able to clean up the loose ends of the series in some ways, it wasn't able to ensure that every unfinished story was revisited while also providing an interesting case for 20-Squad. While Moore will return, along with what appear to be shorter appearances by Jay Harrington and David Lim, who played Deacon and Tan, others aren't slated yet. SWAT had eight seasons worth of story to tell, bringing viewers into a universe for long stretches where they got to know the members of 20-Squad. Although things changed for some, like Dominique Luca (Kenny Johnson) or Jim Street (Alex Russell), their stories were still important to SWAT fans. Unfortunately, many loose ends may not be tied up by the new spin-off. While Luca's time on SWAT wasn't short, it was clear that by the end of his time on the series, there were some underlying issues that may have been pushing Johnson away from the show. Even so, Luca's exit was traumatic to SWAT fans and 20-Squad. After a serious on-duty shooting where he was hit multiple times, Luca suffered permanent nerve damage. Deciding that he wasn't interested in sticking to administrative work, Luca chose to take an early retirement from the LAPD. Despite being a legacy member of SWAT who had struggled for years carrying around the weight of being a generational team member, Luca chose to end his career honorably and move on to something new. Though Luca's decision made sense due to his injury, it was difficult for fans to get behind, especially knowing that he was one of the most consistent SWAT team members on the show. Steady and loyal, Luca's departure was hard on everyone. While Luca could appear on SWAT Exiles, it's not likely that his whereabouts or current state will make it to the spin-off. The assignment, which was meant to be temporary at first, ultimately becomes a long-term position. Though Sigman was pregnant and left the show, the explanation for Cortez's disappearance often left SWAT fans at a loss. It was clear she wouldn't be returning, but leaving the door partially open and never really replacing her was a tough pill to swallow. While Commander Robert Hicks (Patrick St. Esprit) became a major piece of SWAT's puzzle after Cortez's departure, he's always been an incredibly difficult character to watch. SWAT season 8 saw Hicks facing professional trouble as he worked through a tough case with Deputy Chief Bennett (Merrin Dungey) keeping a close eye on his work. After what Bennett deemed a slip up, Hicks was put on suspension, but after he helped the team with another critical case, she chose to keep him in his role, valuing his contributions. Though Hicks was ultimately not ousted from SWAT and kept in his role, it was clear that the fallout from Bennett's disciplinary action was taking a toll on the leader as the season came to a close. Even so, Chris and Street's relationship was never easy. Russell, who spent SWAT season 6 preparing for his own exit, ultimately left the show on a high note, revealing he was proposing. SWAT fans have long since believed that Street and Chris, either engaged or married, would be returning to the show for its end, but with sudden cancelation after sudden cancelation, SWAT never had the chance to bring them back. Now, while the couple is presumably together, it feels unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will explain what happened to the pair or bring them back. Alfrao, who was an old rival of Street and transferred in from Long Beach as well, worked to prove himself throughout the series. Working through personal issues as she got to know the son she gave up for adoption during her first years on SWAT, Powell's human storylines were an anchor point for SWAT's final seasons. Although SWAT wrapped both Alfaro and Powell's stories to some degree, their interpersonal issues weren't worked through in the same way that others' problems were before the show came to an end. Alfaro, who often had issues with Tan during his time on screen, didn't get validated as much as he could've, while Powell's relationships were never fully resolved. Gamble, whose father murdered a cop in the past, was someone that 20-Squad wasn't prepared to defend when she made it onto the squad. Even so, Gamble tried her best to fit in and ensure that she was prepared at all times. Facing distrust, prejudice, and flat-out hate from offices outside of 20-Squad, Gamble's up and down with the LAPD was incredibly difficult. While Exiles may choose to share more about Gamble, it's unlikely that SWAT's spin-off will devote genuine time to her story as they move forward.
