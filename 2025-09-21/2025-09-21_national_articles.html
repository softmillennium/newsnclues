                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.” • France plans to recognize a Palestinian state at next week's UN General Assembly as international alarm builds over the ongoing war and starvation crisis in Gaza. Canada, Australia and the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. We're ending our live coverage for now, but you can scroll down to look back at developments as they happened, and see here for a full round-up of today's events. A senior Hamas official has told CNN today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine is a “welcomed step.” “Any step to strengthen the legitimate Palestinian rights, foremost among them the fully sovereign Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem and the right to self-determination, is a welcomed step,” Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, told CNN on Sunday. However, Naim added that this recognition must be “accompanied by practical measures on the ground to affirm these rights and thwart the Zionist plans that explicitly reject any Palestinian political entity.” For context: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.” Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now responded to today's move by the UK, Canada and Australia to formally recognize Palestine, vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.” The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank. We're hearing now from Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar, who has condemned today's move by Australia, Canada and the UK to recognise a Palestinian state as “infuriating and immoral.” It cannot be perceived as anything other than encouragement of terrorism,” Saar said in a video statement. “On the other hand — it is a reward to the Palestinian Authority, which, as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently explained, is still engaged in ‘Pay for Slay' policies, paying terrorists — and by doing so, is also clearly encouraging terrorism and violating its obligations under the agreements with us,” he added. “The future of the Land of Israel will not be decided in London or Paris — it will be decided here, in Jerusalem,” Saar added. While we've been focusing on western nations recognizing a Palestinian state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said there was “some progress” in talks with Syria, raising the possibility of peace. At a cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu said: “Our victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah have opened a window to a possibility that was not even imagined before our recent operations: the possibility of peace with our northern neighbors.” Israeli and Syrian delegations met in Paris in August – the first time that the new Syrian government acknowledged direct talks with Israel. Al-Sharaa left for New York Sunday to take part in the UN General Assembly. In his statement announcing Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada had expected the outcome would have been achieved through a “negotiated settlement.” The Canadian leader cited Hamas' “longstanding rejection of Israel's right to exist and a two-state solution” as a key factor behind the move. It is imperative that Hamas release all hostages, fully disarm, and play no role in the future governance of Palestine. Hamas has stolen from the Palestinian people, cheated them of their life and liberty, and can in no way dictate their future,” Carney said. The decision marks a “longstanding commitment to a two-state solution,” the statement from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. The Knesset speaker Amir Ohana dismissed Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a “modern-day appeaser who chose dishonour.” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded by saying that the time when Britain and other countries determined Israel's future was over. There's been no statement yet from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that the United Kingdom was formally recognizing a Palestinian state and reviving hope for a two-state solution, in step with Australia and Canada. The British Prime Minister acknowledged that hope for a two-state solution was fading, but insisted: “We must not let that light go out.” Starmer said that recognition was not a reward for Hamas, as Israel has claimed. The UK's call for a two-state solution means that Hamas can have no future, he said. Starmer also said the immense destruction in Gaza was “utterly intolerable” and must end. Israel must stop its cruel tactics and allow aid to surge into Gaza, he said. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Sunday's decision was “an important step to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution, at a time when it is now under unprecedented threat.” “Recognition is only one part of what must be a stronger and wider push for peace,” Cooper added. Australia has just followed Canada's lead in officially recognizing the “independent and sovereign” State of Palestine. “In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Affairs minister Penny Wong said in a joint statement. “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before Sunday's announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.” Ahead of Carney's statement, senior Canadian officials pushed back on Israel's negative reaction to the decision, telling CNN that recognizing Palestine is “not being done to confront or punish Israel.” “Our sincere communication efforts are to explain this and do everything in our power to prevent the voices that are trying to make this a confrontational gesture from gaining the day,” one senior Canadian official said. Canadian officials added that they believe recognition keeps a two-state solution in play despite Israel's open opposition to the prospect of a Palestinian state. Carney's announcement in July also provoked criticism from US President Donald Trump, who promptly suggested that the move would hurt Canada in any trade talks with the United States. As British Prime Minister Keir Starmer looks set to recognize a Palestinian state later today, Brits in London appeared split over the move. Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.” But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today. “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said. As we've reported, US President Donald Trump “disagrees” with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over recognition of Palestinian statehood. As a growing number of countries have denounced Israel's actions in the enclave, the US has not only stood by its ally but provided it with consistent political cover and military support. President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce that France is recognizing a Palestinian state during the conference, saying in recent days that the move would isolate Hamas. It is a largely symbolic move that some nations have taken in recent months or plan to take in the weeks ahead, and one that Trump administration officials have condemned as counterproductive to peace efforts. It was founded by Huda Ammori and climate activist Richard Barnard in 2020, when the group took its first action to shut down the UK operations of Elbit Systems – Israel's largest weapons manufacturer – and stated its commitment to “ending global participation in Israel's genocidal and apartheid regime.” Since it was founded, Palestine Action has also, among other actions, occupied, blockaded, spray painted and disrupted the Israeli-French drone company UAV Tactical Systems and the global arms giant Leonardo. However, it was the group's late June 2025 action – when activists broke into Britain's largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, and vandalized two Airbus Voyager refueling planes with paint and crowbars – that spurred serious government action. Days later, then-UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper – who was made foreign secretary in a recent cabinet reshuffle – designated Palestine Action as a terror group, placing it on equal footing with organizations such as Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS – sparking condemnation from United Nations experts, human rights groups, and politicians. Hundreds have been arrested trying to protest the activist group's ban. The ministry - which does not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties - says the cumulative death toll as a result of Israeli military operations since October 2023 had reached 65,283. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.” An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold. People in the area told CNN Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza. “I think today the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected, and when taking responsibility of that colonial era, because that era has led us directly to the genocide in Gaza today,” Zomlot added. They and several other European governments believe recognition should be part of two-state negotations - however distant that prospect. German chancellor Friedrich Merz has been a long-time opponent of recognizing a Palestinian state and won't be attending the UN General Assembly in New York this week where France and Saudi Arabia will harness international support for the move. “The German government is not currently considering recognizing Palestinian statehood,” Merz said on Thursday in Madrid. Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni said in July that recognizing a Palestinian state before it was established could be counterproductive. Japan has taken a similar stance and does not plan to recognize a Palestinian state at UN meetings next week, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said on Friday. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has faced mounting pressure from within his own party to officially recognize Palestine as a state, with Labour MPs and voters having long voiced their horror at Israel's war. In 2020, the UK's human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for “unlawful” acts of harassment and discrimination during Corbyn's leadership. In recent months, amid a mounting sense of horror over Israel's military campaign in Gaza both in the UK and globally, Starmer had found himself under pressure from his cabinet ministers to immediately recognize Palestine as a state. Previous governments had withheld from making the move, saying it must come as part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine on a two-state solution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona. GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — President Donald Trump and prominent members of his “Make America Great Again” movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere. The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand. “We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service.

Hong) “I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference,” said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. Trump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death. He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised “the life and legacy” of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday. All (Republicans) were saying was ‘Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'” Trump told reporters. “And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that. Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred. Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach. “I think he spoke on more than just politics,” said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. Kirk “was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader. Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president. Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak. Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes. Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that “the movement my husband built will not die.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many have been attempting to relocate from the city, where 1 million people once lived, to the southern Gaza Strip following Israeli military calls for a full evacuation. Hundreds of thousands remained in the city, the territory's largest and already in ruins from nearly two years of war and struggling with famine.

Displaced Palestinians walks through a tent camp in Muwasi, an area that Israel has designated as a safe zone, in Khan Younis southern Gaza Strip, Sunday, Sept. 21, 2025. CAIRO (AP) — Israeli strikes in Gaza City and at a refugee camp killed more than 40 people, including 19 women and children, health officials said on Sunday, as several European countries and leading U.S. allies moved to recognize a Palestinian state. Health staff said a nurse who worked at the hospital was among the dead, along with his wife and three children. Another strike that targeted a group of people in front of a clinic in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least eight Palestinians, according to the Al-Awda Hospital. In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said Sunday that an Israeli drone strike in the southern city of Bint Jbeil killed five people, among them three children, and two others were wounded. The latest Israeli military operation, which began this week, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire further out of reach. The Israeli military, which has told Palestinians to leave, hasn't given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Israel says the operation is meant to pressure Hamas into freeing hostages and surrendering. On Sunday, a group of more than 60 Jewish and Arab organizations representing about 1,000 activists, including some veteran organizations promoting peace and coexistence, known as It's Time Coalition, called for an end to the war, the release of the hostages and the recognition of a Palestinian state. “We refuse to live forever by the sword. On Saturday night, tens of thousands of people in Israel protested, calling for an end to the war and a hostage deal. Israeli bombardment over the past 23 months has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza, destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine. On Sunday, Australia, Canada and the U.K. announced formal recognition of Palestinian statehood. “A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.” Other prominent Western countries are preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood at the gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. Netanyahu said he would announce Israel's response after a trip next week to the U.S., where he is to meet President Donald Trump at the White House. In a statement Sunday, the military stated it killed Majed Abu Selmiya, who it said was a sniper for Hamas' military wing and was preparing to carry out more attacks in the Gaza City area, without providing evidence. Dr. Selmiya told The Associated Press that his brother, 57, suffered from hypertension, diabetes and had vision problems. As the attacks continue, Israel has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City to move south to what it calls a humanitarian zone and opened another corridor south of the city for two days this week to allow more people to evacuate. Palestinians were streaming out of Gaza City by car and on foot, though many are unwilling to be uprooted again, too weak to leave or unable to afford the cost of moving. Along the coastal Wadi Gaza route, those too exhausted to continue stopped to catch their breath and give their children a much-needed break from the difficult journey. Aid groups have warned that forcing thousands of people to evacuate will exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. They are appealing for a ceasefire so aid can reach those who need it. Pope Leo XIV criticized what he described as the “forced exile” of Palestinians from Gaza, saying there was no future for the “martyred” Gaza Strip based on violence and vendetta. During his Sunday noon blessing, Leo issued another appeal for peace and expressed appreciation for the work of Catholic organizations active in helping Palestinians, which had representatives present in St. Peter's Square. Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting that Israel's victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah “have opened a window for the possibility of peace with our neighbors to the north.” “We are holding talks with the Syrians -- there is some progress, but still a vision for the future,” he said. Relations with the new Syrian government have been tense, with Israel carrying out airstrikes over the summer in what it says were steps to protect Syria's Druze community. Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said in an interview on Syrian state television on Sept. 12 that negotiations with Israel for a security deal are still ongoing. He hopes that Israeli troops will return to where they were before the fall of Assad's government under a disengagement agreement in 1974.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (not shown) hold a joint press conference at the Prime Minister's Office, during Rubio's visit, in Jerusalem, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. A woman walks past a vehicle that was burnt overnight by Israeli settlers in an attack that left three Palestinians killed and burnt several vehicles and damaged homes, according to residents in the West Bank village of Kafr Malik, east of Ramallah, Thursday, June 26, 2025. Israeli flags flutter on top of a hill that is adjacent to Palestinian properties that were under attack by Israeli settlers overnight, leaving several burnt vehicles and damaged homes, residents said, in the West Bank village of Bruqin, near Salfit, Friday, May 23, 2025. Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established. Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly. But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.” Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods. The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city. Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing. Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow. The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March. Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction. Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.” Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state. The U.S. has not taken a public position on the issue, but in an interview with Fox News, Rubio linked “this conversation about annexation” to the issue of statehood recognition. It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.</p>

Colin Cowherd asks whether or not this was surprising, and what it means for the legendary head coach. Jordon Hudson may have given her boyfriend, North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick, a pep talk before his game against UCF, but it didn't work out for the Tar Heels on Saturday in Central Florida. The Tar Heels were blown out 34-9 as UCF dominated on its home turf, dropping North Carolina to 2-2 in Belichick's inaugural college football coaching campaign. Before the game, Hudson was spotted talking to Belichick on the sideline, which has become a common occurrence since his debut at North Carolina in another blowout loss to TCU earlier this season. Head coach Bill Belichick of the North Carolina Tar Heels and girlfriend Jordon Hudson look on prior to a game against the UCF Knights at FBC Mortgage Stadium on Sept. 20, 2025 in Orlando, Florida. It's unclear what Hudson, 24, and Belichick, 73, were discussing on the field, but video captured Hudson whispering in Belichick's ear before kickoff. "Their team played well, certainly better than we did. "There are a lot of things that we need to do a better job of, and they were just better than us today," Belichick added. Gio Lopez, Belichick's quarterback, threw for only 87 yards with two interceptions before suffering a right leg injury in the third quarter that knocked him out of the game. This was Belichick's first loss since his debut against the Horned Frogs. North Carolina turned the tide with a 20-3 win over Charlotte and blew out Richmond 41-6 last week to reach 2-1 entering Saturday. Hudson has been a regular presence on the sideline before games despite some disagreeing with it when she was spotted before the TCU game. Her name was even mentioned by TCU player Bud Clark, who went viral after commenting on Instagram Live following the 48-14 rout. Jordon Hudson walks across the North Carolina Tar Heels sideline prior to a game against the UCF Knights at FBC Mortgage Stadium on Sept. 20, 2025 in Orlando, Florida. "Belichick gotta call for his girlfriend," Clark, who had a pick-six in the win, was heard saying in a clip. Hudson and Belichick created the wrong type of stir leading up to the 74-year-old coach's debut, most notably with a controversial "CBS Sunday Morning" interview. Hudson said, "We're not talking about that," when Belichick was asked how the couple met. Emails obtained by WRAL show Belichick addressing the controversy over his romantic and professional relationship with Hudson, where he claimed CBS "secretly" had a camera focused on her despite her request to sit off camera. "I met Jordon randomly on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. That is no secret," Belichick wrote in another email. "Jordon was not dodging the specific question regarding how we met, but rather was preventing the interview from continuing to probe into personal matters." North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick and girlfriend Jordon Hudson look on from the sideline vs TCU at Kenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on Sept. 1, 2025. North Carolina football general manager Michael Lombardi insisted that Belichick's relationship with Hudson isn't a distraction for the program. "I mean, a lot of it is just noise," he told ESPN Radio's "Marty & McGee" in June. And, for me, to really even attack anybody who's saying it, gives them credibility. Which I don't, because it's a completely false narrative." Scott Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Charlie Kirk memorial service in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday, Sept. 21, draws major roadway traffic with mourners desperate to help remember and celebrate the life of the slain conservative activist. With Sunday's focus on the memorial for Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona — an event that more than 100,000 people are expected to attend — University of Alabama students remembered Kirk for his faith and inspiration on Wednesday in their own ceremony. Former reality TV star Savannah Chrisley, conservative activist CJ Pearson, and political commentator Alexis Wilkins all spoke. Also making an address was Kieghan Nangle, 22, executive assistant to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Nangle, an Alabama alum, said Erika Kirk's strength has been and will continue to be an inspiration for scores of young women. "If Erika [Kirk] could stand before the world with power and bravery just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy," said a young Christian this week. "Charlie's wonderful wife, Erika, needs an army behind her, and every person in this country has what it takes to rise to that occasion," Nangle said in her speech. "If Erika could stand before the world with power and bravery, just 48 hours after the love of her life and the father of her children were taken from her, then each of us can do our part to stand behind her and carry on Charlie's legacy," said Nangle. Nangle said she was introduced to TPUSA in 2021 when she attended the Young Women's Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas. Kieghan Nangle, seen at left, spoke at the University of Alabama this week in a tribute to Charlie Kirk. "Charlie and TPUSA taught me and my peers lessons that I believe if they weren't taught, my generation's lives and our country would look very different today," Nangle told Fox News Digital. "The organization taught me how to stand firm in my convictions." Many millennials and members of Gen Z are returning to church, reading Scripture and expressing a desire for greater spiritual depth, Fox News Digital previously reported. TPUSA has said that campus chapter requests have surged by the thousands after Kirk's assassination, as Fox News Digital has reported. "Our hard work of talking to students daily and bringing speakers to campus allowed organizations to boom on campus today, with over 300 people at their meeting this past week, and the organization is now the largest student-led organization on campus," said Nangle. "The organization was the outlet I didn't know I needed during college," she added. Nangle, at right, serves as executive assistant to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. She said she shook his hand just a few weeks ago — thanking him for changing her life. Ashley J. DiMella is a Lifestyle reporter with Fox News Digital.

When Cassie Donegan was crowned Miss America, she never imagined her victory would be quickly overshadowed by a wave of criticism targeting her appearance. Several users online quickly flooded social media with harsh critiques of Donegan's pageant makeup. Some even claimed runner-up Sadie Schiermeyer, representing Texas, should have won instead. Donegan, who represented New York at the competition on Sept. 7 in Orlando, Florida, told Fox News Digital she's not letting the hateful words get under her skin. Cassie Donegan was crowned Miss America on Sept. 7, 2025, at the Walt Disney Theater in Orlando, Florida. "The reality is, when something big happens like this, there are going to be many opinions," she said. But I'm surrounded by so much love and so much support and so many people who are holding me up … I'm just not allowing [their negativity] to cloud the really incredible thing that's happening." Cassie Donegan, an accomplished singer, showcased her talent during the competition. Donegan pointed out that she's more focused on being a role model for younger girls across the country. "I'm able to look at these little girls and say, ‘I am not much different than you are right now, and you are so capable of doing anything you want to do,'" she said. "I want them to believe in themselves, because if they don't, no one else will. And if there's even a small part of me that brings that spark out of them, then I've done my part. Last year's Miss America winner, Alabama's Abbie Stockard, awarded her successor with the coveted crown, sash and title. Miss America, a glitzy competition, was born from a 1921 Atlantic City beauty contest just a year after women were given the right to vote, the Associated Press reported. Many participants say the organization – a large provider of scholarship assistance to young women – has been life-changing, opening doors for them both personally and professionally. Cassie Donegan competed against 52 other contestants from all 50 states. Last year's Miss America winner, Abbie Stockard of Alabama, crowned her successor. Donegan's win included a $50,000 tuition scholarship, plus an additional $3,000 scholarship for her performance in the preliminary talent competition. Donegan said surrounding herself with people who "pour positivity into you" is key to combating hateful words online. "It's hard not to open my phone and want to go and see what people are saying, but curiosity really does kill the cat. … I once heard that other people's opinion of you is not your business. Their opinion of me is valid because that is their truth, but it doesn't mean that it's my opinion of me. Cassie Donegan was representing New York (John Nacion/Getty Images for Empire State Realty Trust) "[I ask myself], ‘Would they say that to me directly if it wasn't behind a screen?' Miss America Cassie Donegan visits the Empire State Building on Sept. 17, 2025 in New York City. My mom had a lot of health problems. She had her first of multiple strokes when I was only nine years old. Some days, we didn't even know if certain utilities were going to be on. Cassie Donegan isn't fazed by online trolls who criticized her pageant look. "But if you allow life and your circumstances to control your outcome, then it would potentially keep you from standing in spaces like Miss America." "I was not in a $10,000 gown," she continued. The makeup I used, some of it came from drugstores. The other part was sponsored by an incredible makeup sponsor. Miss America Cassie Donegan spoke to Fox News Digital about her tough childhood. If even one person can understand that and believe that about themselves, that their circumstances do not decide their outcome … then I have been successful in my job this year." Cassie Donegan wants to emphasize the message of unity during her reign. Donegan said one message she wants to highlight during her reign is unity during a divided time in our nation. Miss America Cassie Donegan's win was a hot topic on social media. "I come from a long line of veterans. My brother is now also in the process of potentially … joining our military as well. "I think just seeing that dedication day in and day out to protecting our country and … protecting the things that our country was founded on — being able to have equality for all. Being able to have spaces that are filled with love and kindness. Being able to look at your neighbor and say, ‘Your journey matters just as much as my journey.'" Miss America Cassie Donegan claimed a $50,000 tuition scholarship. "Something so wonderful about my job as Miss America is that while I may have my own beliefs or opinions, I do get to create … a safe space," she reflected. "It is a space for you to be able to stand and say your truth, live your truth, be your truth, and understand that there is love here, there is a community here. We can have these rooms full of people from different backgrounds, different walks of life and be able to have these really authentic moments of connection and conversation." Cassie Donegan said she wants to be a role model for young girls. "I think once we're able to hear each other, understand each other, we can start seeing unity," Donegan added.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over her social media posts pertaining to the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a Friday episode of "The Source." Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., sparred with CNN host Kaitlan Collins on Friday over a video the liberal lawmaker shared on social media and her remarks about Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk. Collins pressed Omar on why she reposted a video that said, "Kirk was Dr. Frankenstein and his monster shot him through the neck." "Because there were a lot of things in the video that I did agree with. We don‘t have to agree with every single word, but I do believe he was a reprehensible, hateful man. He didn‘t believe that we should have equal access to anything. Singling out Collins, Omar asked, "How do you not… find that reprehensible, Kaitlan?" Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 while speaking at a campus event in Utah. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., sparred with CNN host Kaitlan Collins on Friday over a video the liberal lawmaker shared on social media and her remarks about Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Omar asked Collins, "You think I don't have the brain processing power like you or a White man?" The CNN host said, "Of course not" as Omar asked her if she would find that reprehensible. "I'm not asking why you think he's reprehensible. I think you're obviously allowed to have your own views. That's why we have you on here so often. Because we like to hear your views and what you think on something. I just think it was the video where it called him Dr. Frankenstein and said his monster shot him through the neck. And in the days after his shocking death, that happened as a result of his views or happened as a result as he was sharing his views publicly with people, that people found it jarring to hear such criticism of that in the immediate aftermath of his death," Collins said. Omar said she found it jarring that people wanted to memorialize Kirk and excuse "reprehensible things" that he said. "It is one thing to care about his life, because obviously so many people loved him, including his children and wife. But I am not going to sit here and be judged for not wanting to honor any legacy this man has left behind, that should be in the dustbin of history, and we should hopefully move on and forget the hate that he spewed every single day," Omar continued. Omar was criticized over an interview she did with Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan after Kirk's assassination. Omar expressed condolences for Kirk's family but went on to criticize him during the interview. "But what I do know for sure is that Charlie Kirk was someone who once said, ‘Guns save lives' after a school shooting," Omar said. "Charlie was someone who was willing to debate and downplay the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police … downplay slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth should never exist." Omar went on to lament that there are a "lot of people who are out there talking" about Kirk "just wanting to have a civil debate," prompting Hasan to interject and call it a "complete rewriting of history."

"Pawn Stars" boss Rick Harrison tells Fox News Digital how Las Vegas buffets are disappearing due to changing eating habits, while food halls become the new trend as fewer tourists are visiting. For decades, Las Vegas buffets were a tourist jackpot. Today, food halls are a big draw. Even "Pawn Stars" boss Rick Harrison has noticed the evolution of people's eating habits, calling the buffet's decline an example of "Darwinism." "You know, 100 years ago, lobster was considered poor people's food, so everything has changed," Harrison told Fox News Digital in a video interview from his restaurant, Rick's Rollin Smoke Barbeque & Tavern. The once-famous buffets in Vegas have given way to trendy Strip food halls in recent years. Canteen Food Hall debuted at the Rio Hotel & Casino in Jan. 2024, taking over the former Carnival World Buffet space. The Big Top Food Court at Circus Circus, which opened in 2021, replaced a small portion of the venue's buffet. "We don't cut the time," Harrison saidl. Harrison said all the meat at his restaurant is locally sourced. "Pawn Stars" boss Rick Harrison spoke bluntly about the evolving food scene in Las Vegas. "We're kind of known for our burnt ends," he added. Harrison said he was born and raised in North Carolina, which he called "mostly the barbecue capital of the world." His restaurant, which is next to the pawn shop, receives thousands of visitors every day, he said. "People from overseas don't know about American barbecue, and when they find out about it, they absolutely love it," Harrison said. Harrison said his Las Vegas restaurant is known for the burnt ends he serves (not pictured). With tourism numbers down in Vegas, many people have pointed to the expensive pricing, especially when it comes to food. "I wouldn't fall for the gimmicks," he said, noting there are still places to eat "a good ol' American steak" for $50 to $80. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority recently released its numbers for July visitors, noting a 12% drop from last year. There are still places in Vegas to eat "a good ol' American steak" for relatively reasonable prices, said Vegas insider Rick Harrison. There were 3,089,300 visitors in July compared to over 3.5 million last year, while occupancy on the Strip dropped 7% from 86.5% in 2024. "You have everything from a food court to five-star restaurants," Harrison said. "So, it's a little bit of everything here. … You got something for every budget here." Ashley J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gunman opened fire in a New Hampshire country club Saturday, killing one person and wounding “several other” people, authorities said. Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke said the person who died at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua was an adult male. One person was killed and two others were wounded by gunfire Saturday before the suspect was taken into custody, authorities said. The person who died at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua was a 59-year-old man identified as Robert Steven DeCesare, according to New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke. Authorities identified the suspect as Hunter Nadeau, 23, and said he had been arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder for knowingly shooting DeCesare. Witnesses at the scene said the shootings took place in a restaurant adjacent to a wedding that was taking place. Tom Bartelson of Pepperell, Massachusetts, who was at the country club, described a chaotic scene that unfolded near his nephew's wedding. He said he heard the shooter say “the children are safe” and “free Palestine” and appeared to be targeting someone. “Getting together for a dance for the bride and groom and then all chaos went off,” he said. Wedding DJ Michael Homewood credited the chair strike with preventing an even worse shooting. “He hit him over the head with a chair, and he probably saved a bunch of lives just doing that,” Homewood told WCVB-TV. Investigators were still working to determine a motive, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley said. Authorities said there is no known connection between Nadeau and DeCesare. Authorities had initially thought there could be two shooters but later said there was only one. “Additional charges likely will be brought, including for the additional shooting victims,” Formella and Rourke said in a statement. They said they expect Nadeau to be arraigned at the Ninth Circuit Court in Nashua on Monday. In addition to three gunshot victims, others at the scene suffered injuries including lacerations, a broken hand and blunt force trauma, Nashua Fire Rescue said Sunday. Nashua Fire Rescue said it assisted about 100 people from the scene to a nearby firehouse, mostly on foot. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement Sunday that the attorney general's office will assist Nashua police with the investigation and that she and her husband were “praying for the victims and their families.” Nashua is about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of Boston, just across the Massachusetts border. The mother of DeCesare, the man who was killed, had earlier described not being able to find her son after he was shot. They saw my son go down and they saw blood,” said Evie O'Rourke of Salem, New Hampshire. Sophie Flabouris, another witness who was at the scene, told WCVB-TV that someone hit the suspect over the head with a chair to subdue him. “We had just gathered around the dance floor. We were about to do a Greek smashing of the plates and throwing the dollar bills. Emily Ernst, who was at the scene, said she saw a gunman in all black. “I ran through the kitchen for my life.” Bartelson said some people dropped to the ground and attempted to get away from the scene. There was a lot of panic, he said. “We were trying to keep family members safe,” he said. “Keep everybody down and try to find safe spots.”</p>

More than 100,000 heavy hearts are set to converge on Arizona's State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., today to commemorate the life of Charlie Kirk — the fiery young activist who ignited fierce loyalty, sharp, yet civil debate, and whose shocking assassination has left a movement in mourning. Those in attendance at Kirk's service, which begins at 11 a.m. local time in Glendale, will hear from Republican political heavyweights including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, close allies, and family members who will pay tribute to the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA. Turning Point USA volunteers walk past the State Farm stadium ahead of the memorial service of Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, on September 20, 2025. Kirk's widow, Erika, will speak about his legacy and her new role at the helm of the powerful national organization he built. The service is anticipated to be both a moment of mourning and a declaration of continuity, signaling how his movement intends to carry forward without its founder. Kirk was assassinated on Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The charismatic Kirk, known for his signature debates on college campuses, sat beneath a white tent emblazoned with the slogan "Prove Me Wrong," taking open-mic questions from a crowd of thousands. Moments later, a single shot ended his life. Charlie Kirk throws hats to the crowd after arriving at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025 in Orem, Utah. At 18, Kirk dropped out of community college to co-found Turning Point USA. By his mid-20s, he became the youngest speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2016 and a household name in conservative circles. By 31, he commanded a $95 million political empire, galvanized millions of followers online and established a direct line to Trump. Charlie Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA, was killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. His death leaves behind an energetic movement that indisputably reshaped conservative youth politics. With backing from Republican donors like Foster Friess, Kirk turned the scrappy campus operation into one of the fastest-growing conservative nonprofits in America. Today, it's a political juggernaut — its revenue, according to tax filings, soared from just $2 million in 2015 to $85 million in 2024. Add in revenue from its political action arm, Turning Point Action, and the haul climbs well above $95 million. After his death, TPUSA has seen a massive surge in inquiries for new college chapters as the organization works to advance Kirk's vision. Charlie Kirk was a conservative activist who led Turning Point USA. He also told Fox News Digital that he has "personally received hundreds of offers to work" for TPUSA. Kirk's widow, recently tapped to head the organization, vowed to carry on her husband's mission in her first public comments since his death. "To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die," Kirk said on Sept. 12. No one will ever forget my husband's name. Kirk said that TPUSA's annual "AmericaFest" conference in Phoenix this December will continue as scheduled. Amanda covers the intersection of business and geopolitics for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during the POW/MIA National Recognition Day Ceremony at the Pentagon, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, in Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reviews troops during the POW/MIA National Recognition Day Ceremony at the Pentagon, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, in Washington. The Pentagon says it will require credentialed journalists at the military headquarters to sign a pledge to refrain from reporting information that has not been authorized for release — including unclassified information. Journalists who don't abide by the policy risk losing credentials that provide access to the Pentagon, under a 17-page memo distributed Friday that steps up media restrictions imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump. “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified,” the directive states. Advocates for press freedoms denounced the non-disclosure requirement as an assault on independent journalism. The new Pentagon restrictions arrive as Trump expands threats, lawsuits and government pressure as he remakes the American media landscape. It is getting only what officials want them to see,” said National Press Club President Mike Balsamo, also national law enforcement editor at The Associated Press. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel personality, highlighted the restrictions in a social media post on X. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility,” Hegseth said. “Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.” Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job. The Defense Department also was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out. On Saturday, the Society of Professional Journalists also objected to the Pentagon's move, calling it “alarming.” “This policy reeks of prior restraint — the most egregious violation of press freedom under the First Amendment — and is a dangerous step toward government censorship,” it said in a statement Saturday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Homan, now the president's border czar, was recorded last year accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash by undercover FBI agents in an investigation the Trump Justice Department later closed, The New York Times reported Saturday. Homan was investigated for potential bribery and other crimes after he agreed to help the undercover agents, posing as businessmen, secure government contracts in a second Trump administration, the report says. Investigators began looking into Homan after the original target of a case suggested that a payment to Homan could lead to federal border security contracts, The Times reported. The DOJ shut down the case after Trump began his second term this year, over doubts prosecutors could prove Homan — who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the president's first term — had agreed to a specific act in exchange for the cash and because he was not in a government position at the time. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the matter, which originated under the Biden administration, was subject to a full review by officials with the FBI and DOJ, who “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.” CNN has attempted to reach Homan for comment. He told CNN affiliate WWNY in Carthage, New York, on Sunday that there's “nothing to it” when asked about reports of the investigation. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, slammed the matter as a “blatantly political investigation” and called Homan “a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant.” “This blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using its resources to target President Trump's allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country,” she said in a Saturday statement. A career law enforcement officer, Homan served as the public face of the first Trump administration's aggressive efforts to step up immigration enforcement before retiring in 2018. After leaving government, he became a Fox News contributor. He also contributed to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president, which Trump distanced himself from during his campaign. Speaking from the stage in Milwaukee, Homan warned immigrants who “Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law: You better start packing now. Less than a week after Trump won reelection, he announced Homan would serve as his administration's border czar. This story has been updated with additional information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during the American Cornerstone Institute's Founder's Dinner at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate in Mount Vernon, Va., Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will award Ben Carson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the third such award he's announced this month. He didn't know this,” Trump said in a speech during an event at Mount Vernon for American Cornerstone Institute, founded by Carson. A former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Carson, 74, went on to serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration. The one-time rivals developed a strong bond, and Carson — seen at one point as among the top contenders for Trump's running mate in the 2024 campaign — served as Trump's national faith chairman during last year's race. A staunch social conservative who has opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage, Carson has become a popular conservative speaker and author. The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors. Trump bestowed the honor on 24 people during his first term and has already announced two other recipients since his return to the White House. Trump mentioned no date for giving the honor to Carson, but other honorees are already in the pipeline. Earlier this month, Trump said he would bestow the award on former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, two days after his longtime political ally was seriously injured in a car crash. During a Sept. 11 commemoration event at the Pentagon, Trump announced that he would posthumously give the award to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month and whose memorial service Trump plans to attend Sunday in Arizona.</p>
