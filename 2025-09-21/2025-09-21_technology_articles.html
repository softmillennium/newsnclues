The sheer amount of times that people have received everything but the high-end GPU they ordered is frankly too absurd to count at this point. In comparison to that, receiving just a bland ol' brick instead of an RTX 5080 seems almost uninspired, but that's exactly what happened to u/GlassHistorical5303. Our victim (who we'll call Glass for ease) ordered a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 from the firm's official store on Amazon. You might be wondering how a returned package could be thrown in with the new stuff that's supposed to come from PNY's official store — this is where the issue of "commingling" comes in. That term refers to merging items from different sellers and channels into a single, unified inventory that makes the job super easy for logistics but remains effectively untracked. In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma befell another customer a year ago, when purchasing from Newegg. It's because of growing scams like these that we advise people to stay vigilant, no matter where you're buying from. Especially if you're shopping used, you may not get something strange in the box, but instead a GPU that literally has no core inside it.

From August, we have seen more steady progress in sales numbers. These videos got hundreds of thousands of views (one over 400,000), so the Commodore management were obviously measuring the media impact on sales trends. Our last report, on how Commodore successfully raked in over $2 million during the C64 Ultimate's debut week, coincided with a video release titled ‘Making History: Signing the Commodore Contract + C64 Ultimate Production Update.' We also saw a very positive blip in sales around that date. Perhaps people felt assured that Commodore was really back. In a quick follow-up to the 10K milestone Tweet, Commodore reminded its fans that “there's still time to secure your spot in Batch 1 of the Commodore 64 Ultimate pre-orders over at https://www.commodore.net/ to make sure you'll be among the first to receive yours this year.” Pricing for this FPGA-powered retro-futuristic machine featuring the “world's first transparent keyboard circuit board” starts from $299. Readers are reminded that the “Founders Edition will be a one-time run,” and we don't have word on what will succeed it for latecomers – surely something very similar. Retro computing fans should be cheered by this latest Commodore milestone, even if they aren't particularly interested in experiencing a modern C64.

A post on the Heathrow social media account said, “Work continues to resolve and recover from Friday's outage of a Collins Aerospace airline system that impacted check-in. Heathrow, like other affected airports, has recommended that travelers arrive at least three hours before departure for long-haul flights, and at least two hours beforehand for short-haul flights.

According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth. Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday's proclamation.” This post has been updated with a quote from Karoline Leavitt.

They come in all shapes and sizes, leveraging a broad range of technologies, but some products could leave you scratching your head about the best way to fit them into your setup. A peculiar case in point we noticed today is the $2.57 WeAct Display FS, listed on AliExpress. That price point seems irresistible for a highly-portable USB interface second screen. This tiny screen isn't going to worry the makers of the best portable monitors, but could have its niche use cases. The dimensions of the WeAct Display FS are more like a typical thumb drive storage device than a portable monitor. Specifications suggest the entire device measures 43 x 14.5mm, but we don't have a thickness measurement to share. Another significant way it strays from the portable second screen norms is that WeAct's tiny screen doesn't accept a USB-C or HDMI connection – it has a captive USB-A interface (again, like many USB thumb drives). One side of the WeAct Display FS is almost entirely taken up by its screen. Across this tiny display, there are 160 x 80 pixels (thus a 2:1 ratio). We also know the display uses the RGB565 (16-bit) color format, delivering up to 65,536 colors, which should be ample for its touted applications. WeAct reckons that its little Display FS device is going to be useful for both system monitor and media projection applications. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Thus, it is theoretically possible to use the WeAct Display FS and this app on systems other than Windows. Any Python supporting OS should do the trick, but you'll have to do more leg work to use this device as a tiny second screen on macOS or Linux, for example. The origin of the WeAct Studio Screen Projection app isn't known, and it is thought to be a Windows-only app which emulates a Windows display. It is shown being configured to replay images / video from other screens. CNX Software expects it to be able to be used as a full-screen YouTube video or photo gallery playback device. If this kind of tiny second screen has you intrigued, but the WeAct Display FS is too small for you, we spotted similar but larger devices on AliExpress. Stylishly circular 2.1-inch IPS screens with USB-C connectivity can be grabbed from $27.16 via AliExpress.

Personalizing the computers we own — whether it's a phone or a proper desktop — is one of life's few simple comforts. Now, movements behind the Windows 11 development scene indicate that pictures could soon be exchanged for videos. Microsoft has finally added the option to use video files as desktop backgrounds in the latest Windows 11 Insider build, and it works seamlessly, as spotted by @phantomofearth on X. It was a built-in utility that allowed users to put videos as their wallpaper... up until Vista. Unfortunately, DreamScene was pulled from Windows 7 and never made a comeback officially. Many modern gamers today may not even remember that dynamic desktop backgrounds used to be a native feature of the OS. Fortunately, Microsoft is finally answering the community's decades-long prayers and testing this feature. After that, just open settings, and you should see .mp4, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .avi, and .webm in the list of supported file formats when you go to select a new wallpaper. Keep in mind that this feature only works on the desktop, not on the lockscreen so you're not going to get those macOS-style aesthetic TikToks out of your utilitarian Windows system anytime soon. More importantly, though, since this is an experimental feature, there's no saying when it will actually make its way to the stable, public release channel — if at all. Similar to the native speed test button that Microsoft is trialing, this feels like a fairly iterative yet obvious improvement that we should, therefore, see go mainstream relatively soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An incident at Collins Aerospace shut down the cloud back-end for its cMUSE platform this weekend, crippling kiosks and forcing manual fallback at Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace brought parts of Europe's airport infrastructure to its knees this weekend, after a backend outage hit the company's cloud-based check-in system and knocked out self-service kiosks across multiple major hubs. The software in question — Collins' common-use MUSE platform — powers many airports' passenger processing stacks, allowing airlines to share check-in desks, kiosks, and boarding infrastructure through a single backend. Heathrow, Berlin Brandenburg, and Brussels Zaventem were among the major airports affected, with Brussels cancelling 45 out of 257 departing flights and warning passengers of delays up to 90 minutes. Heathrow said most flights were still running but slowed by manual fallback procedures, while Berlin suspended kiosk access altogether and shifted to direct airline processing. Designed to be flexible and scalable, cMUSE can be hosted in the cloud or deployed on-prem, but many airports rely on the cloud variant, which centralizes passenger data and logic for easier airline integration. According to Collins' own documentation, cMUSE supports web-based agent stations, kiosk fleets, and mobile check-in endpoints through a centralized management plane. On-site systems like bag tag printers and biometric scanners are often integrated directly with MUSE, so they're not immune either. The EU's NIS2 directive, which comes into force in October, broadens the legal definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not just airlines and airports, but IT suppliers that provide essential digital services to them. EASA's Part-IS rules, in parallel, are meant to bring aviation-grade cybersecurity to exactly these kinds of shared platforms, including common-use systems for baggage and check-in. Heathrow said Sunday that it was continuing to recover from the outage, adding that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.

Photos, videos, work projects, and all the little files that mark everyday life deserve safe storage without worrying about hacks, lost passwords or online outages. That's where a massive external hard drive comes in handy. Right now, the Seagate 22TB external hard drive has dropped to just $249 on Amazon, its lowest price ever. That's about $0.01 per gigabyte, a record low cost for this much reliable storage. At launch it was selling for over $500, and today it's even priced lower than Seagate's 20TB model, while costing just about twice as much as a 5TB drive. No surprise it currently sits as the #1 best-seller in external hard drives on Amazon. Every terabyte holds approximately 250,000 photos or over 100 hours of high-definition video, so 22TB is more than enough to safeguard an entire household's digital life with a little left over. And unlike cloud storage, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee. Export video production projects, collections of games, or simply perform a routine backup and the process is seamless. Simply plug in and you can transfer files without installing additional software. Seagate also provides rescue data recovery services, which offers peace of mind if something unfortunate befalls the drive. It has more than 260,000 Amazon reviews with an average rating of 4.6/5 stars, bearing witness to its high quality and endurance over the decades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KPop Demon Hunters has dominated streaming and the box office this summer, but KPop Defamation Hunters landed a win in a different venue: the South Korean courts. The South Korean virtual boy band Plave, which is made up of five members who only ever appear as animations, successfully sued a person who made derogatory comments about the group online. Among the attacks: he suggested the people behind the virtual band members “could be ugly in real life” and said they gave off a “typical Korean man vibe.” Some of the posts also included profanity, which doesn't seem that offensive, but neither do the posts, so it's probably worth mentioning. The victory landed Plave 500,000 South Korean won in total, 100,000 per band member, which works out to just over $70 a pop. Not exactly a fortune for a group that already has more than one million subscribers on YouTube, sold more than 500,000 units of their most recent album in the first week, and performs concerts that attract tens of thousands of fans. It's also much less than the band asked for. They were seeking 6.5 million won for each performer, which would have worked out to about $4,650 per member and $23,250 total. Vlast, the band's label, intends to appeal the damages granted by the court, according to the BBC, arguing that it is too low for a case that sets a precedent for defamation against virtual avatars. While it does seem like the ruling is the first instance of defamation against virtual pop stars, it's not uncommon for Korean music labels to pursue charges against internet trolls. Several labels in the country have made a concerted effort to go after people who badmouth acts online. The virtual band trend, to some extent, is considered a response to the type of attention and pressure that pop stars receive in Korea.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. We all want to feel more secure in our own homes, but the reality is that most traditional security cameras are a hassle. Amazon has discounted a 2-pack of these outdoor security cameras to just $119 (from $229, 45% off), best price ever, and that's about $59 per camera for solar-powered, wireless 2K security. In contrast to the never-ending decisions that have you toggling between cables or battery reminders, the SoloCam S220 solves the biggest headaches: Each camera is fueled by a hidden solar panel that requires only three hours of direct sunlight per day to keep charged all year long. That extra detail can really matter when you're glancing at motion alerts or zooming in on what set off the camera. Night vision is also improved by the f/1.6 aperture and infrared LEDs, which let in more light so even when it is pitch black you are seeing sharp images of your garden. Another plus is the AI motion detection built into every device. Rather than constantly ping-pinging you with alerts every time the breeze stirs a twig across the sensor, it recognizes when someone approaches your area. That way, notifications are far more useful as you'll know whether it's your children coming home from school, an incoming package or someone else entirely. And best of all, there are no additional or monthly fees. Instead of needing to remember to replace batteries every winter, worry about an intruder stumbling over a cord, or pay monthly subscription fees, you pay once and you're set with solar power and built-in AI. With Amazon now offering this 2-camera set for a mere $119, today is the perfect time to invest in that system. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a choice they are making. It seems eminently sensible to stop cheap labour from abroad in such a situation. It's not a coincidence Microsoft is run by an Indian. And particularly international companies care little where their work is done, as long as it improves the bottom line. If anything, what is the difference between an employee and a contractor if you can just terminate them once you're done with them? Getting hired (getting an apartment, ...) is easier in the US as there are significantly less challenges at terminating those contracts by the 'provider' than in e.g. Germany, where it's really hard to fire or evict someone. Quite convenient to show the data such that it serves a narrative and hide the details. Well, more tech talent for India and China it seems. Not if the US has any way to prevent that. Sure, Trump could make Nvidia invest 5b into Intel. But that's only pacifying the shareholders among his cronies. It might not play well with the infinite guest worker crowd, but it gets tiring to see generations having the same experience that has extended back into at least the early 2000s. Those kind of people don't fall from trees and know that their expertise is well sought after. And if the US is not a safe or attractive choice, they go elsewhere. While not ideal, I don't see the guest worker programs being a good thing unless the affected firms experience (and cannot escape or mitigate) a certain fiscal pain, especially if it involves revenue from global capability centers. This would be stupid five or ten years ago. Right now however, we have enough tech people in the country for the current job market. Every enterprise these days has an India development center (banks, telcos, pharma, big-tech, manufacturing, etc.). They can just scale up the hiring there. On second thoughts that's what they were all doing anyway and saying it was AI. But I guess with enough coercive force, it just might work with your own populus too. It will be quite telling how well-subscribed the upcoming lottery is with this new rule.If H1-B is truly about finding rare talent, it should have limited effect.
