                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention. "While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's disease have surged by more than 140%," said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline - potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits. "The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes - previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer - also hold transformative potential for brain health," Hennekens said. The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. "The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous," said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. "Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline - tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia - amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. "While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health," said Hennekens. "Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The official number of exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- tracked by NASA has reached 6,000. The number is monitored by NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), based at Caltech's IPAC in Pasadena, California. "This milestone represents decades of cosmic exploration driven by NASA space telescopes -- exploration that has completely changed the way humanity views the night sky," said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director, Astrophysics Division, NASA Headquarters in Washington. This is American ingenuity, and a promise of discovery that unites us all." Although researchers think there are billions of planets in the Milky Way galaxy, finding them remains a challenge. In addition to discovering many individual planets with fascinating characteristics as the total number of known exoplanets climbs, scientists are able to see how the general planet population compares to the planets of our own solar system. For example, while our solar system hosts an equal number of rocky and giant planets, rocky planets appear to be more common in the universe. Researchers have also found a range of planets entirely different from those in our solar system. There are Jupiter-size planets that orbit closer to their parent star than Mercury orbits the Sun; planets that orbit two stars, no stars, and dead stars; planets covered in lava; some with the density of Styrofoam; and others with clouds made of gemstones. "Each of the different types of planets we discover gives us information about the conditions under which planets can form and, ultimately, how common planets like Earth might be, and where we should be looking for them," said Dawn Gelino, head of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), located at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Fewer than 100 exoplanets have been directly imaged, because most planets are so faint they get lost in the light from their parent star. To account for the possibility that something other than an exoplanet is responsible for a particular signal, most exoplanet candidates must be confirmed by follow-up observations, often using an additional telescope, and that takes time. That's why there is a long list of candidates in the NASA Exoplanet Archive (hosted by NExScI) waiting to be confirmed. "We really need the whole community working together if we want to maximize our investments in these missions that are churning out exoplanets candidates," said Aurora Kesseli, the deputy science lead for the NASA Exoplanet Archive at IPAC. "A big part of what we do at NExScI is build tools that help the community go out and turn candidate planets into confirmed planets." The rate of exoplanet discoveries has accelerated in recent years (the database reached 5,000 confirmed exoplanets just three years ago), and this trend seems likely to continue. Kesseli and her colleagues anticipate receiving thousands of additional exoplanet candidates from the ESA (European Space Agency) Gaia mission, which finds planets through a technique called astrometry, and NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will discover thousands of new exoplanets primarily through a technique called gravitational microlensing. At NASA, the future of exoplanet science will emphasize finding rocky planets similar to Earth and studying their atmospheres for biosignatures -- any characteristic, element, molecule, substance, or feature that can be used as evidence of past or present life. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has already analyzed the chemistry of over 100 exoplanet atmospheres. And in the case of an Earth-like planet, the glare would be significant: The Sun is about 10 billion times brighter than Earth -- which would be more than enough to drown out our home planet's light if viewed by a distant observer. NASA has two main initiatives to try overcoming this hurdle. The Roman telescope will carry a technology demonstration instrument called the Roman Coronagraph that will test new technologies for blocking starlight and making faint planets visible. With its microlensing survey and coronagraphic observations, Roman will reveal new details about the diversity of planetary systems, showing how common solar systems like our own may be across the galaxy. NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program is responsible for implementing the agency's plans for the discovery and understanding of planetary systems around nearby stars.
