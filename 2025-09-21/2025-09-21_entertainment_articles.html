                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED: The man arrested for allegedly shooting into the lobby of Sacramento ABC affiliate KXTV (ABC10) was released from jail on bond Saturday, then taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge, according to Sacramento County Main Jail records. Anibal Hernandezsantana, 64, of Sacramento, was arrested in connection with Friday's shooting on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm. Sacramento officials confirmed Hernandezsantana had been released from the jail by Saturday afternoon after posting $200,000 bail. He was then arrested later that day on federal charges, an FBI spokesperson told the Sacramento Bee. Hernandezsantana is accused of violating federal statute 47 USC 333, which states no person can “willfully or maliciously interfere” with radio communications licensed or authorized by the federal government. Hernandezsantana is scheduled to appear in Sacramento federal court Monday. He's due to appear in Sacramento Superior Court Tuesday afternoon on the local charges. Officers responded to reports of shots fired at the TV station shortly after 1:30 pm Friday. Sacramento Police Officer Anthony Gamble said at least three gunshots were fired at the building from a passing vehicle. Police later was able to identify the vehicle, leading officers to a Sacramento residence and Hernandezsantana's subsequent arrest. Hernandezsantana was being booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail. In a statement to ABC News, ABC10 station owner Tegna, said it “is fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees.” Security also has been increased at the station. The demonstration outside the building Thursday was part of widespread protests over ABC's suspension of Kimmel following his comments about Charlie Kirk, including one held outside Disney studios in Burbank and another in Hollywood where Jimmy Kimmel Live! Attendees at the Sacramento protest held signs reading “First Amendment,” “Resist” and “You're Next” among others.

Bring back Michael Eisner and send Bob Iger off to the Weather Channel. “The MAGA gang was desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” What don't people understand about this statement? Some people get their news from Kimmel, apparently. California as a state should break away or at minimum break into 3 or more different states, then maybe the differences being displayed, those associated individuals whom are upset, can run their own environment and see who's plot of land can function without discord, or if anything allow society as a whole discover and witnesses which of the two will last the longest as a civil society. If anything, what's left over from building the wall in the south can keep those Californians confined to their own desirable homes, neighborhoods, places that they feel comfortable and can express their feelings, emotions, and influences among themselves without any outside interference. (Example: Look at Spain on a map) Adults use words to solve their problems and find solutions. What kind of place is Sacramento where random shootings are commonplace? A handful of wealthy conservative people are to blame for this. Aside from David (and Larry) Ellison and Shari Redstone (the Sykdance/Paramount merger), another name that people need to know is Nexstar CEO Perry Sook. And Sook wants Carr to give Nexstar an exemption so the Tegna purchase can go through. So blame Carr, Sook, Ellison, Redstone, and a few others for eroding the First Amendment. This is the way to solve problems? It's a right/wrong problem and the left has lost their moral compass. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Scott Derrickson has made millions on the unnerving emptiness between fragments of film grain. “The Black Phone 2” is no exception, with grain so dense in certain sequences that the actors are reduced to ghostly silhouettes. Related Stories See Which Countries Have Submitted Films for Best International Feature at the 2026 Oscars Screen Talk Remembers Robert Redford, Roots for ‘A House of Dynamite,' and Assesses the International Oscar Race Finney triumphed at the end of that film, dispatching child-snatching serial killer the Grabber (Ethan Hawke) with help from the ghosts of his previous victims and one of Gwen's psychic visions. And so the Grabber is back, calling from beyond the grave to threaten Finney with not only his own demise, but that of his little sister as well. And thank goodness, because there are some thick blocks of dialogue to get through here, and only an actor of Hawke's caliber could make them work. The number of pay phones in the United States has fallen sharply since the mobile revolution, making it next to impossible for a disembodied malevolent spirit to terrorize any misfit kids through phone booths today. “The Black Phone 2” takes place in 1981, a fact that's nearly impossible to forget with the repeated, winking era-specific references and lines about a character being “deader than disco.” The plot of both films also depends on their teenage characters being relatively unsupervised, an equally anachronistic touch that “The Black Phone 2” shares with its most obvious inspiration: the “A Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. Specifically, Gwen takes on a leading role in this film that's very similar to Patricia Arquette's character in “A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,” but with the staff of a snowed-in Christian summer camp at her back rather than the patients at a youth psychiatric hospital. These include Ernesto (Miguel Mora), the younger brother of a character from the previous film (also played by Mora) and Gwen's innocent puppy-love suitor; camp supervisor Armando (Demián Bichir), who provides a living link to macabre events that occurred there decades earlier; and Mercedes (Arianna Rivas), Armando's equestrian niece. But, like Hawke, Bichir does a heroic job carrying the burden of explaining the film's lore — an essential function in a backstory-heavy effort like this one. Derrickson acquits himself more admirably, adding blood-soaked flair not only to the film's analog sequences but also the digital ones. A scene where Gwen is terrified by the appearance of three boys who were murdered on the campgrounds back in 1957 is a masterclass in creative gore effects, slicing one boy's head in half diagonally on a windowpane, watching it slither to the ground, and leaving it to sputter and twitch as blood pools around what's left of his face. The film also builds on a famous effect from “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” spinning bodies and flinging them around like marionettes whose puppeteer is having a seizure as the characters battle the invisible foe in Gwen's dreams. Still, a complaint that's also common to contemporary horror films nags at “The Black Phone 2,” in that all of the best things about this movie come from other movies, whether they be the creative team's previous efforts or iconic titles from decades past. These elements are enjoyable, which is precisely why they're recycled here. And maybe that's good enough for a horror sequel. But good enough will never be more than just that. Universal Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, October 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Troy Kotsur is hoping the mobster role he plays on Netflix‘s Black Rabbit will open further doors for deaf performers in Hollywood. In the crime-thriller miniseries from Netflix, Jude Law's rising restauranteur is thrust into New York City's dark underbelly when his ne'er do well brother (Jason Bateman) returns with loan sharks on his tail. “I'm sure folks in the audience have really never seen a mobster who happens to be deaf. It was really fun and exciting for me to create this character,” Kotsur told People in a recent interview.

Black Rabbit, which had its premiere at TIFF, was created by Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, with a logline describing the project as a “propulsive thrill ride and character examination about the way an unbreakable bond between two brothers can shatter their world and everything in its orbit.” Also starring in the series, currently streaming on Netflix, is Cleopatra Coleman, Amaka Okafor, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, Troy Kotsur, Abbey Lee, Chris Coy, Dagmara Dominczyk, Odessa Young and Robin De Jesus, with Amir Malaklou, Don Harvey, Forrest Weber, Francis Benhamou, Gus Birney, John Ales and Steve Witting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just 10 minutes before the Kirk special was set to broadcast, Sinclair issued a statement via social media announcing that it would instead premiere on YouTube. As of Sunday morning, the YouTube video of the Kirk special has generated just 26,000 views since it was uploaded on Friday night. Both Sinclair and fellow affiliates giant Nexstar pledged to kick Jimmy Kimmel Live off its U.S. stations following the host's comments about Kirk's assassination during a Monday monologue; soon after,  ABC said is was suspending the late-night show “indefinitely.” Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” said Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.” Bad Bunny Closes Historic Puerto Rico Residency With Marc Anthony, RaiNao, and More Guests One Dead, Two Injured in Stabbing Outside Phish Concert: 'We Are Deeply Saddened By This' ICE Is Deporting People to Africa on Nearly Un-Trackable Military Flights Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're going to teach you a dance,” Chappell Roan says, as if there's anyone in the audience tonight who still doesn't know her infamous “Hot to Go!” choreography. In reality, the crowd of thousands at Saturday's (Sept. 20) show at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York, hasn't just been waiting all night for this — many of them have been waiting several months. It's been quite some time since the Missouri native performed in her home country, with the end of 2024 marking a particularly rough period for her. In addition to canceling two stateside shows for mental health reasons, she faced onslaughts of backlash for everything from speaking out about predatory fan behaviors to criticizing Kamala Harris amid the presidential race, leading to her largely stepping back from the internet. Now, a packed audience dotted with pink cowboy hats and Lady Liberty crowns — nods to Roan's getup at the 2024 Governor's Ball, one of the last times she performed in New York — embraces her completely, every bump in the road forgotten. Looking out at a sea of arms eagerly forming the shapes of the letters “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” (“I think you get it,” she giggles, abandoning her dance tutorial after one run-through), she looks stronger than ever, strutting around the stage in a sexy Captain Hook-esque outfit without missing a note as flames erupt behind her. Saturday's concert is the first of eight pop-up performances in the U.S. that Roan has generously tacked onto her European Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour, and one of four dates slated for NYC. The setlist is full of high-octane numbers from her 2023 debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, with “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” “Femininomenon,” “After Midnight,” “Naked in Manhattan” (“Can you believe it? We're in New York!” she yells triumphantly midway through), “Guilty Pleasure” and “Casual” preceding “Hot to Go!,” as well as new single “The Subway,” which recently earned Roan her highest-ever peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. The latter two tracks are expected to appear on Roan's next LP, which she plans to start work on after the tour ends in October. (“It took me five years to write the first [album], and it's probably going to take at least five to write the next,” she warned in a recent interview with Vogue.) Though Roan is a total force on stage, polished and magnetic while trouncing around a set made to look like an illustrated fairytale castle, the show is not without her signature frankness. She hilariously breaks character at one point to inform the crowd that she'd totally forgotten her entire “a—s” was on display in her outfit until she was taken by surprise at the sight of her own rear-end on one of the big screens behind her. She also takes a tender moment to address why her return home is so momentous. As Roan dives into “Kaleidoscope,” her fans band together to let her know that the feeling is very much mutual. A dazzling rainbow suddenly appears and winks back at her as she sings, with the concert-goers in the back several rows of the stadium holding up multicolored lights in one unified effort. After her stay at Forest Hills, Roan will play two nights in Kansas City before closing out the Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour with two nights in Los Angeles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel‘s suspension under these circumstances is a fundamental attack on each individual American, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of whether or not you even vote. That might sound hyperbolic to some people, but I don't think it is. I am concerned about the potential elimination of one of the fundamental reasons we love living here and love being Americans. It's not every place on Earth where you can get up every day and you are free from governmental or military threat (at least until recently, with ICE dragging people off the street), where you can express yourself. It really goes so far beyond late-night talk-show hosts or comedians. The message I want to send is that just because you're not a professional comedian or you're not in Hollywood doesn't mean you are not deeply affected by the eventual consequences of not speaking up against this, of allowing this to happen. I do fear that centering all these conversations about freedom of speech around a very famous person who's on TV every night will make it very easy for the Donald Trumps and Stephen Millers of the world to make this a coastal elite versus non-coastal elite conversation. But if it can happen to someone as wealthy and powerful and visible as Jimmy Kimmel or Stephen Colbert, think about what they're willing and able to do to any average American who doesn't have Colbert or Kimmel's resources. This is not merely about what you can or cannot — or will not — be able to pitch in a writers room at a talk show or a sitcom. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and we're already seeing it, because normalizing what happened to Colbert made it easier for them and empowered Brendan Carr to take that argument to Disney via the FCC. I know that Nexstar is a big part of this, and that, as always, it comes down to the bottom line. [Editor's note: A spokesperson for Nexstar, the nation's largest owner of TV stations, has denied that FCC pressure influenced their decision to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live before his suspension was announced.] I've worked for Disney, as so many people in my field have. I've always had wonderful experiences working for them. Disney has been a very progressive company, actually, especially when it comes to issues that matter to me a lot, like LGBTQ+ issues. The message I would send to them is — and I'm quoting Pete Buttigieg here — if you think that it is worth it to just give Trump and Carr this temporary win and that this will mean that they'll get off your backs, you're wrong. They are just going to not only want more, but demand it, and exploit business deals and mergers that they know they have approval over to get what they want: to try to control what is being said on TV, online, on any platform. These guys saw an opening here to manipulate all of us. [Editor's note: Trump has denied any involvement with the letter, and has sued The Wall Street Journal for libel over its story reporting its existence.] They've gotten what they wanted, not only in Jimmy Kimmel getting suspended, but in controlling the national conversation. So we can't let that happen either. Bill Maher Defends 'Compatriot' Jimmy Kimmel, Slams ABC: 'Stands for Always Be Caving' What they really want is a type of national brainwashing. I know in a way that sounds so crazy, 1980s-level sci-fi stuff. And I'll be honest and say in those early Trump years, you would see people posting Handmaid's Tale memes. I love the spirit and the intentions of that, but for a while there I'd roll my eyes and say, “Things are bad, but it ain't The Handmaid's Tale, exactly. It will get worse if we don't speak up. They are truly just schoolyard bullies taken to a much higher, more visible level in the public sphere. To be clear, political violence is barbaric and horrifying. I thought the Charlie Kirk story was terrifying. That's not the world we want to live in. I don't want anyone to be murdered. We need to speak up in ethical ways — not violently, but passionately. What we say sometimes just starts to feel like noise. It's like, “All right, there's another liberal celebrity saying what we expect them to say.” So if you are not in show business, if you're not known for having a big social media platform, I think it means even more to speak up in whatever way you're comfortable with. Maybe that means talking to your kids and keeping an eye on what is being allowed to be said in school and what's not. But I know there is power in numbers here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weighing in after Kimmel's suspension in a blog post that did not mention ABC, Disney or President Trump by name, NAB CEO Curtis LeGeyt called this “an unprecedented time in media history” requiring “a direct conversation about what's at stake.” Kimmel's show was suspended indefinitely by ABC after major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair removed it, citing jokes by the late-night host about the reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. Talks are ongoing among stakeholders to seek a resolution to the impasse, with indications in recent days that a path for the show to return was more likely than it being dropped for good. Sinclair Moves Charlie Kirk Special To YouTube Instead Of Taking Over Kimmel Slot Mark Ruffalo Warns Disney's Stock Price Will Drop "A Lot Further" If ABC Cancels 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' LeGeyt affirmed the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, who “must be able to make decisions about the content on our airwaves free from government influence.” Even the perception that broadcasters are being affected by government pressure “is a problem for our credibility and the trust we have built with our audiences.” At the same time, LeGeyt notes that government pressure on media “to cover events in a particular way is not new and it has come from both political parties. Under the Biden administration, reporters faced growing barriers to access, and local affiliate stations were targeted based on the actions of cable news networks. Today, we continue to see veiled threats suggesting broadcasters should be penalized for airing content that is contrary to a particular point of view. That tension came into striking view in recent months, as Deadline's Ted Johnson has reported. The organization ran social media ads praising FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for helping “empower our members” by fighting to loosen regulations limiting the business activities of broadcasters. The praise for him came as Carr had launched investigations or inquiries into broadcast networks, some of their owned stations and other outlets, including members of NAB. Those probes were sparked by issues ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion practices to newsroom decision-making. “Broadcasters are already fighting for our future, facing extraordinary disruption in the media ecosystem from Big Tech,” he wrote. “If the very act of owning or transferring a broadcast license carries the risk of political interference, it will drive investment further away from local stations at the very moment we need more resources to sustain local journalism.” The NAB's efforts to back its members as they face myriad business challenges, the exec concluded, will be “futile if we cannot fulfill our most sacred responsibility: reporting to our communities without fear of government retribution.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. When broadcasters were pressured by Democrats, they hired lawyers. When pressured by Trump, they give in without so much as a fight. Oh yeah this is all totally normal, nothing to see here, move along. I agree with you because these are not those types of times; we are fighting for freedom, rights, and freedom to speak, and they can say what they want. Still, when it comes to someone else saying what they want, we have a problem. I feel this country is turning into Russia. China will no longer be a democratic country; we are now a dictatorship because certain people can do what they want to. Still, people is not realizing this is affecting everybody the rich the poor it doesn't matter what color you are what status you are this affects us all when our rights of being striking this is not about one people this is about all people so when are we going to step up to the plate and your night together because we put these people in office to work for the American people not one person. They are up there working for one person, not the American people, so when will everybody take their blindfolds off, unless you're not together?

Arnold continued, “This isn't some made-up TV show, and they're all playing their characters.” Referencing the show “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” the former “DWTS” dance pro explained, “This is not Conrad, Belly and Jeremiah, where we can just comment on their decisions and their choices and their lives like they're just not real people.” She also noted that she “would go to bat for” her sister Rylee, who is partnered with Scott Hoying on  the show, “'til the day I die.” Arnold noted that, while “it's okay to have opinions,” fans should stop “bashing and trashing.” She reminded them, “Be better.” “Please don't make me do another video like this defending all of my friends,” she added, asking fans to “spread a little bit more positivity” about “Dancing With the Stars.” A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"To have an external power of financial interest come fuck around with that material diminishes the trust," said the 'Sentimental Value' director about deciding to have all of his films financed in Europe. Joachim Trier left San Sebastian Film Festival attendees in awe at an event Sunday morning where the Sentimental Value director spoke candidly and eloquently about his career. His most recent project, winner of Cannes' Grand Prix this year Sentimental Value, is screening here at the 73rd San Sebastian Film Festival. The film follows Trier's frequent collaborator Renate Reinsve as Nora who, along with her sister Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), are faced to confront their strained relationship with their father, a fading director named Gustav Borg (Stellan Skarsgard). “To me, it's a moral implication of taking responsibility for what the actors give a director — if they show their emotions, their bodies, whatever — we created a movie [and] I carry the responsibility of what they bring to the final product. Trier admitted that demanding final cut made it “tough” to get a film financed and while some U.S. producers showed immense support, Reprise was made out of Oslo, Norway and in collaboration with France. The financing system for cinema in Europe, while it has given Trier “a platform to express myself very freely,” he also believes it is constantly under political threat. “Right-wing political movements are always trying to diminish the idea of soft money support for the arts across most countries in Europe… We need support. At the same time, Trier said the need to have total creative control over his films is something that producers should be in support of. “My approach to shielding, protecting, loving, nourishing [actors] is how producers and financiers should work with directors. I think financiers should feel like that with directors and the creative team.” When discussing Sentimental Value, Trier, father to two young children, admitted his own fear of failure as a parent played a huge role in writing Skarsgard's part. “In Norway, we have had a lot of progression [for] female directors over the last 15, 20 years, and that has been great for us male directors too, because we have gotten a focus on [a] good set culture, where the macho energy is lessened and it's not just all tough guys.” This has allowed filmmakers in Norway to have “private conversations” about balancing being an artist with having children, he added. “Actually, the feminist discourse around cinema has helped men also allow ourselves bigger freedom of figuring out how we make movies [as parents].” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christopher Nolan was elected during the union's biennial national convention, with results released Saturday. Nolan, who ran for the top office unopposed, will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the 19,500-member union of directors, associate and assistant directors, unit production managers and stage managers through the 2023 actors and writers strikes. “Our industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild's membership for entrusting me with this responsibility. I also want to thank President Glatter for her leadership over the past four years.

Film fans outside the thirty-mile zone may be less familiar, however, with Nolan's union service, even as it has ramped up in the last decade. On Saturday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — which bargains on behalf of these major employers — released a statement congratulating Nolan.
