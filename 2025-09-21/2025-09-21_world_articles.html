                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Sunday said tech and media giants Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch will be a part of the group to take over TikTok's algorithm in the acquisition of the social media platform's US operations. “You know, they're very well-known people. And Larry Ellison is one of them. I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved,” Trump said on Fox News' “Sunday Briefing,” referring to Lachlan Murdoch — the CEO of Fox Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News — and the son of Fox Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch. Trump added that Rupert Murdoch “is probably going to be in the group.” Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch would not be investing as individuals. Participating in the TikTok consortium could provide a boost for Fox Corp., which has been making many digital media investments to offset declining areas of business like broadcast television. Trump's comments are a change from the consortium of investors previously named in the TikTok deal. The Trump administration had said that the group of investors would include Ellison's company, Oracle, along with Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that TikTok will have seven board members, six of whom will be American. The makeup of American investors is required by the bill passed by Congress in April 2024, which required a nationwide ban of TikTok operations in the United States unless the social media app sold about 80% of its assets to American investors. Ellison's company began hosting TikTok's US data in 2020. Trump said Friday that he had “a very productive call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and that progress was made toward finalizing the deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Massive memorial service: Huge crowds of mourners have made their way inside a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, for the funeral of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month. • Outpouring of grief: Erika Kirk, who is taking the helm at her late husband's organization, Turning Point USA, will also speak. Almost all the available seats inside appear to be full just after 9:30 a.m. local time. More than 200,000 mourners may try to attend the service, a Glendale Police Department spokesperson told CNN. We have already seen some notable names in the crowd today, including several lawmakers, conservative influencers and Republican officials. A number of Trump administration officials and Cabinet members who will speak at Charlie Kirk's memorial have both publicly and privately credited the conservative activist for their current positions. Kirk took an active role during Donald Trump's transition ahead of the president's second term, temporarily moving his family down to Florida and helping vet the officials. Many of these officials had Kirk on speed dial and would text with him on a regular basis until his death, sources told CNN. Vice President JD Vance, a close friend of Kirk's, will also speak at his memorial. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth privately credited Kirk with getting him confirmed in the Senate. Kirk launched an active campaign against Ernst, threatening to primary her and getting his large following on board. Trump's health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said Kirk was a leading architect of Kennedy's endorsement of Trump and crucial to him getting his Cabinet position. Sources said Kirk stressed the importance of Kennedy's “Make America Healthy Again” movement to Trump's team and how the former independent presidential candidate would open new avenues of voters to Trump. Kirk called getting Kennedy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed “mission critical.” Kirk used his enormous platform to promote Gabbard, who will also speak today. Kirk privately called senators and their associates when it looked as though she might not make it through the confirmation process, a source told CNN at the time. Here's another look at the crowds outside State Farm Stadium, where many tens of thousands of mourners will honor Charlie Kirk at today's memorial service: Almost all available seats inside State Farm Stadium now appear full a little after 9:30 a.m. local time. Today's crowd is full of young adults who felt connected to Charlie Kirk, who began building Turning Point USA — the most influential young conservative organization in the country — when he was still a teenager. Luke Bravo, from Fresno, California, said Kirk's assassination hit him hard. He said he was looking forward to hearing in particular from Erika Kirk — who was named CEO of Turning Point and is poised to take on a significant profile in conservative politics. Starting early this morning, we saw huge crowds forming outside State Farm Stadium. As soon as the doors open, they filed in to Charlie Kirk's memorial service — but even as seats began to fill up, it feels on the ground like it barely made a dent on the still-growing number of mourners outside. While tens of thousands of people gather to memorialize Charlie Kirk, his Turning Point USA group is taking an opportunity to organize. Attendees were also handed flyers for America Fest 2025, TPUSA's annual conference in December, with discount codes to attend. “I wanted to be here to honor him and his life and his family, what he stood for,” Pamela Milton told CNN. When asked about why he decided to attend the service, Craig told CNN, “To show my love and support for America and Charlie Kirk.” Craig described hearing the news of Kirk's death as devastating and “like losing a brother.” “I'd really like to hear positive influence, how we're going to move forward with unity and help bring this country back together, what it should be,” Craig said. Other attendees shared similar words about their hopes for the service and said they are happy to be in attendance to honor Kirk. Lines of attendees continue to snake through the stadium as people find their seats. Ballistic glass surrounds the podium at Charlie Kirk's memorial service today inside Arizona's State Farm Stadium, where a high-profile lineup of speakers — including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance — are set to take the stage. The glass-secured podium, positioned front and center, reflects security measures now standard at grand and open-space events featuring the president, especially after last year's assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. President Donald Trump briefly spoke with reporters before he departed for Charlie Kirk's memorial in Arizona. “Yeah, I would,” he told reporters while leaving the White House for Arizona to attend Kirk's memorial service. Pressure on Justice Department: “Pam Bondi is doing a great job,” he told reporters. “I think Pam Bondi is going to go down as one of the best attorney generals of the ages.” The comments come after Trump in a social media post Saturday put pressure on Bondi to bring criminal charges against several political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James. A Glendale Police Department spokesperson now tells us more than 200,000 may try to attend today's memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk — double the previous estimate of 100,000. Over 200,000 people have registered for the event on Turning Point USA's website, Jose Santiago told CNN today. Desert Diamond Arena, which will serve as an overflow site, has a seating capacity of around 19,000. The atmosphere is far from that of a typical funeral. Attendees, many of whom have been waiting since the early morning hours to get inside, are mostly wearing red, white and blue — as suggested by organizers — with virtually no one coming in black. The crowd spans a range of ages, from teenagers to older folks. Right now, Christian musicians are on stage playing worship music as the crowd continues to arrive. People are beginning to take seats in the second tier. Streams of attendees — many wearing apparel with Charlie Kirk's likeness — are parking miles away and walking to the stadium. As a long procession of motorcycles donning American flags wove through the congestion, many motorists stepped out of their vehicles and applauded, with some yelling, “God bless America!” — Josh Campbell, Glendale, Arizona Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, who is accused of killing prominent conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, with aggravated murder and announced they would seek the death penalty. In addition to aggravated murder, prosecutors outlined six other charges against Robinson. Prosecutors presented two charges of witness tampering for directing his roommate to delete “incriminating” text messages and to stay silent if questioned by police, the court filing states. Read here for a full rundown of the key takeaways. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have vowed to go after Democrats and liberal organizations in the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, describing their actions as retribution. “I think this is right out of the authoritarian playbook,” Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in her first televised interview since the 2024 election. “They're taking a terrible crime, this awful murder of this young man, and they are trying to use it, along with others of their rationales, to go after their political opponents.” Clinton said the United States has “a violence problem,” pointing to the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. In such moments, Clinton argued, “leadership should try to bring people together.” Asked if ABC's yanking of Jimmy Kimmel's show after apparent pressure from Trump's Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is state censorship, Clinton said it “is a very clear example of that,” adding that free speech must always be protected — not only when it's favorable, which she argued is the Trump administration's approach. “And you defend free speech that is used against holding people in power accountable through satire, humor, barbed attacks. CNN is here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where huge crowds of mourners are expected to gather for the funeral of Charlie Kirk. This video from a short time ago shows a line already stretching across the parking lot as attendees wait to enter the memorial service. “We want to look at as a time of healing,” Trump said. “That something like this could have happened is not even believable so we will have a very interesting day, a very tough day.” When asked what message he wants to share with Kirk's family, the president said, “I will just give them my love, there's nothing much you can say.” The memorial service for Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at a Utah university this month, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners to a football stadium in Glendale, Arizona. In addition to the president, Turning Point USA has also said that Vice President JD Vance and Kirk's widow, Erika, will deliver remarks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Murano resident reported children, aged between 12 and 13, to the police Italy might be a football-loving country but that did not stop police in Venice from pursuing a group of unlikely targets: 14 children who fell foul for playing the game in a public square, leading to fines presented to their parents, in a move that has sparked a debate about the rights of young people to play outdoors. The children, aged between 12 and 13, were playing football earlier this month in Pino Signoretto square in Murano, an island of about 4,500 inhabitants in the Venetian lagoon, when a resident, annoyed by the noise they were making, reported them to the police. Police officers then went to the square and identified each child before their parents were summoned and ordered to pay a €50 (£43) fine on their behalf. Antonio Trampus, the father of one of the children, told La Stampa: “My son called me in tears. The police wouldn't listen to reason. Instead, they immediately took their names and addresses.” But the parents argue that Pino Signoretto square was never included in the list of banned areas as it was only recently created after the neighbourhood was redeveloped. The case sparked debate in Venice, with local councillor Marco Gasparinetti arguing that the police intervention was disproportionate and questioning the priorities in a city grappling with overtourism, pickpockets and a dwindling local population. Referring to the parents being summoned to the police station, Gasparinetti wrote on Facebook: “Were they scammers? Gasparinetti added that it should have been enough to take the ball away and tell the children to stop playing. Corriere del Veneto reported that the children might have been penalised due to their age, because areas where ball games are permitted are exclusive to children under 11. Paolo Poggi, a retired professional footballer who was born in Venice, also contributed to the debate. “Long live children who spend time outdoors,” he told La Nuova Venezia newspaper. “The rules are sacrosanct, but common sense is needed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poised and devout Erika Kirk has been violently thrust into spotlight since her husband's assassination When 23-year-old Erika Kirk was named Miss Arizona, contenders saw her as a poised, devout woman with a sense of purpose that elevated her above the competition. These qualities have been put to the test since her husband, the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, was shot dead while speaking to students on a university campus in Utah last week. Mrs Kirk, now 36, has been thrust violently into the national spotlight. In the days since her husband was assassinated and she was forced to tell her two young children that their father would not be coming home because he was “on a work trip with Jesus”, she has emerged with her sense of mission intact. “I will never let your legacy die,” she vowed to Kirk in a tearful address earlier this week. On Thursday, she was named the chief executive and board chairman of Turning Point USA, her husband's conservative activist group. Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point's chief operating officer, said she was the obvious candidate to replace Kirk at the helm shortly after her appointment. He added: “Erika Kirk has been the bravest soul I've ever seen in my entire life. Caitlin Fitz-Maurice, who competed in the 2012 Miss Arizona pageant won by Mrs Kirk, remembered her as a young woman mature beyond her years. Upset after placing as runner-up in the competition, she recalled Mrs Kirk encouraging her to seek out a “greater purpose”. “I was more obsessed with trivial things – back then I wasn't really thinking about the future a lot,” Ms Fitz-Maurice told The Telegraph. She was like, ‘you have a greater purpose, go for that'.” What she professes, it's how she lives,” added Ms Fitz-Maurice, who went on to study at George Washington University and qualify as a lawyer. She later turned down an offer to become a cast member of the reality TV series Summer House, although she did appear in one episode. She met Charlie Kirk in a New York burger restaurant in 2018 for what was supposed to be a job interview but quickly turned into “banter over theology, philosophy and politics”, she later recalled. After marrying in 2021, Mrs Kirk cast herself as her husband's “helpmate” in her “biblical role” as a wife and was frequently at his side during Turning Point events. Kirk, a Maga firebrand who seemed happiest when fighting in the trenches of culture wars, appeared almost bashful when he introduced his wife on an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show podcast. She returned to the same podcast studio – this time alone – after her husband was allegedly shot dead by 22-year-old student Tyler Robinson. “Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith,” she said in an emotional speech. “Now and for all eternity, he will stand at his saviour's side, wearing the glorious crown of a martyr.” She brought her husband's body home to Arizona with JD Vance, the US vice-president, on Air Force Two. Some compared the grim journey made by the newly-widowed Mrs Kirk, who emerged from the plane with her head bowed and dark sunglasses covering her eyes, to Jackie Kennedy returning from Dallas after John F Kennedy's assassination. Turning Point USA, which he founded in 2012, has emerged as a powerful force on hundreds of college campuses. Mrs Kirk was named its chief executive on Thursday after being urged by friends to take the reins of a movement that suddenly found itself rudderless. But I think that she is convicted by her beliefs, both religious and political.” Brian Darling, a Republican strategist, said he expected Kirk's legacy to be continued through “a bigger Turning Point USA organisation”, which has reported thousands of requests for new chapters since his death. Figures with ties to the movement told The Telegraph they were being approached by donors outraged by Kirk's murder to grow its presence. Ms Fitz-Maurice hopes Mrs Kirk will emerge as a major political force. “I know people talk about it, in circles, that they hope she runs for president.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president to speak at event in Glendale, Arizona, as number of rightwing commentators including Steve Bannon and Elon Musk attend Students who debated with Kirk: ‘His goal was to defeat us' US right claimed free speech was sacred – until the Charlie Kirk killing Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service. Trump, alongside other high-profile cabinet members including JD Vance and defense secretary Pete Hegseth, are set to deliver remarks on Kirk. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life's work – “when people stop talking, that's when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies. Kirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. They are also closely examining his very style of debate. Donald Trump has arrived on Air Force One in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service. Trump, alongside other high-profile cabinet members including JD Vance and defense secretary Pete Hegseth, are set to deliver remarks on Kirk. Here are some images coming through the newswires from State Farm stadium as Charlie Kirk's memorial service goes under way: He subsisted on bananas and other sugary provisions to keep him alert. Six years later, Wallin said he encountered Kirk again during the 2024 presidential election and was surprised when the organizer, by then a hugely prominent figure in Maga politics, remembered him. Many sang along with the lyrics, while some raised their hands and swayed. The event, like Turning Points itself, has blended faith and politics for a new generation of conservatives. Chris Tomlin, a Christian music singer, is singing now along with the audience, which joins him for the refrain: “You will always be holy / holy forever.” As he left the White House for Phoenix this morning, Donald Trump praised Charlie Kirk's mobilization of college students through Turning Point USA, the organization that he founded instead of going to college himself. “He had a hold on youth because they loved him. And if you go back 10 years, those colleges were dangerous places for conservatives. As our colleague Alice Speri reported, TPUSA has over 900 chapters on college campuses and claims to have “incubated” more than 350 rightwing influencers over the years. Kirk himself, however, was broadly unpopular among college students, according to polling after his death. Research done for Puck last week revealed that 70% of students surveyed, at community colleges, technical colleges, trade schools, and public and private four-year institutions, said that they disagreed with Kirk's views. Just 30% said they agreed with what he had to say. Loud applause rang out when the monitor showed an image of Kirk. Charlie Kirk's memorial service is set to begin shortly. Officials and prominent Maga world influencers are filling the arena. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert was among those who have arrived. Conservative activist Scott Presler posed for photos and Steve Bannon was spotted being escorted around into the venue. Elon Musk said on X he was in attendance. Credentialed alongside the traditional press corps are several new media podcast hosts, YouTubers and young influencers, including some children – a testament to his vast influence on young conservatives. In the days leading up to today's memorial service, AI-generated tributes to Charlie Kirk, which appeared to present his own commentary from beyond the grave, filled the internet and were even played during services at megachurches. One of the first to appear was a reassuring message in an AI clone of Kirk's voice that was created within hours of Kirk's death and then played last Sunday at Dream City church, the Phoenix megachurch where Kirk worshipped, and held political events, including a Trump rally in 2020. Dream City Church in Arizona played the AI of Charlie Kirk on a Sunday as if he was speaking to them at their church service from beyond the grave. One of the many AI-generated messages created immediately after Kirk's death was a video shared by a far-right English nationalist that pictured him with an angel's wings, urging his supporters to double down on support for Israel, and vilifying supporters of Palestine, including an AI-generated image of a scowling Greta Thunberg. He's definitely looking down on us all🕊️❤️So keep up the fight, stand up, speak out peacefully and let's Unite The Kingdom tomorrow 🇬🇧🇺🇸🇮🇱 @TRobinsonNewEra pic.twitter.com/y2tcXOJMQm Unlike in many other countries, hate speech is protected by US law unless it incites imminent violence or constitutes a true threat. But that did not deter the nation's top law enforcement officer, who also suggested that – for example – a print shop employee who refused to print flyers memorializing Kirk could be “prosecuted”. Since Kirk was shot to death while speaking to college students in Utah earlier this month, the US has been gripped by a bitter debate about the relation between political speech and violence. But Trump, JD Vance, White House adviser Stephen Miller and other top Republicans have framed Kirk's death as the consequence of what they claim is unchecked and violent rhetoric, which they blame on the left wing alone. It is a remarkable turn from prominent American conservatives, who until Trump's return to power in January had long complained of a censorious leftwing “cancel culture” but now seem happy to reframe that, too, as “consequence culture”. Christina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she has been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. This morning, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service. Sawick said going forward she hoped more Americans would accept – even if they don't support – the president and his message. “I want people to get behind our president,” she said. Pursuant to federal law, the FBI and/or other federal partners may take security action that results in the interference, disruption, seizure, damage to or destruction of any drone deemed to pose a credible safety or security threat.” “What you're seeing here is not just a tribute to his movement, you're seeing a revival of his message: faith, family, freedom,” Barke said, gesturing to the swelling crowd of supporters. Though only 31, Kirk left a lasting spiritual and political legacy, Barke said. Thousands of people lined up early to fill a football stadium in Arizona for Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where the US president, Donald Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and other prominent Maga allies will pay tribute to the slain conservative activist. Marjorie Taylor Greene has also issued a tribute to Charlie Kirk ahead of his memorial service. Kirk had pioneered a style of ideological warfare against what he viewed as bastions of leftism, helping turn campuses into cultural battlefields and paving the way for Donald Trump's unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement's ideological agenda. “Charlie Kirk will be remembered as one of the foremost architects of the political strategy of treating faculty and students with whom he disagrees as enemies to be defeated,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education. Inside, many followers of Kirk, the vast stadium was dotted with red MAGA hats and American flags. Some supporters were already in tears as they listened to a Christian rock group that was performing on stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The date was Feb. 8, 1954 and young David Edmonston had an upset tummy. When the young physician-researcher at Boston Children's Hospital learned of David's symptoms– which soon included a telltale rash – he beelined for the boy's boarding school, where a measles outbreak was under way. “He asked if I would help the world,” David later recalled. More than two millennia after a cattle pathogen spilled over into human populations, the virus that causes measles had finally been isolated from the blood of an American schoolboy. Dr. Michael Kapusta inoculates children with the measles vaccine at St. Teresa's school in Toronto on Dec. 13, 1965.James Lewcun/The Globe and Mail “Today we are on the threshold of eliminating another dangerous disease – measles,” U.S. health officials announced in 1967. Six decades later, that threshold has yet to be crossed. Measles remains very much a part of the human condition. This year has seen an alarming resurgence in countries where measles is considered eliminated, including Canada and the U.S., both of which are struggling to extinguish their largest outbreaks in decades. Public reception to the measles vaccine in 1963 was relatively muted compared with the jubilation and public weeping that erupted when an effective polio vaccine was announced, pediatrician Adam Ratner says in Booster Shots: the Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health. “Inconsistent messages, unclear availability and limited public understanding of why one might want to vaccinate a child against measles in the first place ... hindered the availability and success of the measles vaccine.” Experts knew that one barrier to vaccination was the widespread belief that measles was a normal and ultimately harmless part of childhood. In reality, measles annually killed more Canadian children than polio, a disease that struck parents with terror. Measles can also weaken the immune system, in addition to causing complications such as deafness, blindness or brain swelling.) The first two licensed vaccines for measles were also less than ideal. One, made with a “killed” or inactivated virus, was well tolerated but offered inferior protection (it would be taken off the market by the early seventies). An electron microscope image of a measles virus particle.Cynthia Goldsmith/The Associated Press The better-performing vaccine, made with a weakened version of the live virus, was prone to causing high fevers and even rash. But this was cumbersome and expensive, especially compared with the polio vaccine, which sold at just six or seven cents a shot. “We with large families feel the $10 charged by physicians is a little steep for each child.” This included an attenuated version of the live measles virus that minimized side effects. But measles outbreaks continued, and health officials bemoaned Canada's low vaccination rates. Internal documents show how Alberta's measles outbreak began to spiral out of control In the early eighties, Canadian public health departments envied their counterparts in the U.S., where the incidence rate for measles was six times lower, owing in part to laws that mandated vaccinations for school-aged children. In 1982, Ontario and New Brunswick passed similar legislation (today, they remain the only Canadian provinces with such laws). Within just two years, these organizations had successfully pressured the province into amending legislation to allow for exemptions based on conscientious objection. One year later: “Measles cases in 3 provinces at 5-year high.” This paved the way for Canada to achieve a historic milestone in 1998: measles elimination, meaning it had been free of continuous transmission for more than 12 months. The virus that once infected up to 90,000 Canadians a year no longer circulated in this country. But that same year delivered the biggest setback yet to global elimination efforts. The damaging paper had landed at a pivotal moment, however, with the Internet providing a new and powerful substrate for disinformation to spread through. Opinion: Ending vaccine mandates is a cynical political play – and it threatens children's lives The first two decades of this millennium saw periodic measles flare-ups in Canada ignited by importations of the virus by infected travellers. Then, starting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine vaccinations, eroded public health care infrastructure and gave rise to a powerful wave of mistrust against the medical establishment – ideal conditions for measles to stage a comeback. In North America, this ancient virus is once again on the move. “Measles is one of those diseases like smallpox that can be eradicated. A couple of generations of near 100 per cent vaccination and we would eradicate it, and then we can take it off the vaccine schedule and nobody has to worry about it,” Dr. Najera said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Colonel General Alexander Lapin has been dismissed from military service, Russian pro-government media outlet RBC reported on Sept. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. The general has long been associated with battlefield setbacks since 2022. Lapin commanded Russia's Central Military District during Ukraine's September 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive, where Russian defenses collapsed and multiple cities were retaken. This earned him public criticism from Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov as "a good-for-nothing" general. The Wall Street Journal later reported that gaps in Russian defenses under Lapin let Ukraine advance. Nine months later, Moscow launched a counteroffensive supported by 12,000 North Korean troops, eventually retaking most of the territory but at a cost of 80,000 soldiers killed or wounded. Russian pro-government media outlet Tatar-inform reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, that Lapin will now serve as an assistant to Tatarstan's head, Rustam Minnikhanov. In 2022, Ukraine's prosecutor general named Lapin a suspect in waging an aggressive war against Ukraine and violating the country's territorial integrity and inviolability. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Mr Robinson, 22, has been charged with murdering Kirk, the conservative activist, shot dead at a Utah university last week. Prosecutors laid out formal charges against Mr Robinson and last week revealed messages to his transgender roommate, with whom Robinson was in a relationship, which they said amounted to a confession.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Behind Napa's rise stood an unlikely figure: a Russian émigré who fled revolution, crossed Europe, and brought Old World science to the New. His name was Andre Tchelistcheff – the godfather of American winemaking. Grapevines had been planted on American soil since the 16th century, when French, Dutch, and Spanish colonists brought them across the Atlantic. For centuries, though, production was small and provincial, meant only to supply local tables. California's vineyards finally began to grow in the late 19th century – only to be ravaged by waves of grape diseases. Between 1920 and 1933, the industry collapsed almost entirely. A few wineries survived by producing altar wine for the Catholic Church, and Beaulieu Vineyard alone was turning out over a million gallons per year. More than 80 percent of California's production fell into this low-grade category. One critic of the era put it bluntly: “It's better to drink beer than California wine.” Andre Tchelistcheff was born in Moscow in 1901, into a noble family whose lineage stretched back to the fifteenth century. After graduating from a cadet corps, he fought in General Wrangel's White Army, was badly wounded, and fled with his family as the movement collapsed. Like many Russian émigrés, they began a long journey through Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia before finally settling in Europe. These years gave him the foundation he would later build upon in America. By the late 1930s, his reputation was growing. Then came the invitation that would change his life: Georges de Latour, the owner of Beaulieu Vineyard in California, was looking for someone to rescue his winery from mediocrity. Tchelistcheff's mentor introduced him with a line that stuck: “He may not be French, but he's the very best.” California in the 1930s had everything nature could offer a winemaker – sun-drenched valleys, fertile soils, and a Mediterranean climate. Cellars were stiflingly hot, presses were cooled by dumping in blocks of ice, and equipment stood rusting in the corners. Hygiene was almost nonexistent: workers didn't wash their hands, larvae bred in barrels, and dead rats were even left floating in fermentation tanks. Tchelistcheff was every inch a European aristocrat – always immaculately dressed, precise in his manners, addressing men as “my dear sir” and women as “madam.” In remote Napa, this refinement made him an object of ridicule. His young son was even beaten up at school for wearing a French-style uniform. It was into this unlikely environment – a land of promise wrapped in provincial roughness – that Andre Tchelistcheff began his American experiment. Tchelistcheff's first act in California was simple but radical: he demanded order. He introduced cold fermentation for white wines and malolactic fermentation for reds – practices that would later become standard worldwide. He drastically reduced the use of sulfur dioxide, which had been added to Californian wines in reckless quantities. Local workers could hardly believe it; one foreman even suggested dumping in a whole bucket of the chemical “just in case.” Tchelistcheff pushed for Cabernet Sauvignon, convinced that Napa's soil and climate could rival the Old World's best. After overcoming resistance from the vineyard's owners, he finally got his way. By the 1940s, it had become a symbol of American fine wine, poured at White House receptions and recognized as California's first truly world-class vintage. No single winemaker, however brilliant, could transform an entire industry alone. Tchelistcheff's true legacy came through his students. After Georges de Latour's death, Beaulieu Vineyard passed into the hands of corporate owners more interested in profits than in quality. Frustrated by marketing gimmicks and budget cuts, Tchelistcheff left the winery in 1973 after more than twenty-five years. It turned out to be a turning point. Studying the soils of the Pacific Northwest, he saw that Cabernet Sauvignon could thrive in Washington, while Pinot Gris would do well in Oregon. With his guidance, his nephew Alexander Golitsyn – another Russian aristocrat in exile – founded Quilceda Creek Winery, later hailed as one of America's finest producers of Cabernet. Michelle, steering it toward Gewürztraminer, Semillon, and Riesling, which put Washington State on the wine map. For centuries, French winemakers dismissed the New World as incapable of true greatness. British wine merchant Steven Spurrier organized a blind tasting in Paris, pitting French classics against upstart California wines. To the astonishment of the judges – and humiliation of Bordeaux and Burgundy – the winners were from Napa Valley: a Cabernet from Stag's Leap Wine Cellars and a Chardonnay from Chateau Montelena. Both had been made by Tchelistcheff's students. News of the upset reached Tchelistcheff while he was touring Bordeaux. Ever the diplomat, he told his assistant not to mention it to their hosts: “If we tell them right now, the French might take offense – and after all, we're their guests.” The so-called “Judgment of Paris” became a turning point in global wine history. Even in his later years, Tchelistcheff remained restless. In the early 1980s he returned to Europe, not as a refugee but as a master, sought out by winemakers across the continent. One of them was Lodovico Antinori, scion of a dynasty that had been making wine in Tuscany since the fourteenth century. Antinori wanted to plant Cabernet Sauvignon in the coastal soils of Bolgheri. Their debate became almost comic: Antinori crossed out “Merlot” on the vineyard map and scribbled “Cabernet,” while Tchelistcheff crossed it back again. Today it is considered one of Italy's most prized and expensive wines – a legacy born not in Florence or Bordeaux, but from the instincts of an old exile from Moscow. Friends urged him to, but he always refused. “I am a child of revolution,” he explained. “I know what it means to lose everything overnight. Andre Tchelistcheff died in Napa Valley in 1994, at the age of ninety-two – the place where he had arrived as an outsider and which he helped turn into one of the world's great wine regions.

"The Russian invaders' air fleet in the temporarily occupied Crimea has been reduced again as a result of successful combat operations," HUR wrote on Telegram. The Mi-8 is a medium-lift helicopter widely used by Russia for transport, reconnaissance, and combat support. It can carry troops and equipment or be outfitted as a gunship. The radar destroyed was identified as the 55Zh6U Nebo-U, a mobile early-warning system capable of detecting stealth aircraft and cruise missiles at long ranges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese government recently instructed companies not to buy Nvidia chips, citing concerns about national security and alleged violations of its antimonopoly laws. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar initially estimated that Nvidia could see $56 billion in revenue from China next year after President Trump lifted H20 export restrictions. Indeed, Forrester Research analysts recently commented, "Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible." However, President Donald Trump has dragged Nvidia into his trade war with China, and political crossfire has been a constant problem for the company. Both countries have used national security as justification to restrict the sale or purchase of the company's products, and investors recently got some more bad news on that front. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Nvidia took a $4.5 billion write-down in the first quarter, when President Trump extended export restrictions to include H20 graphics processing units (GPUs). Those semiconductors, scaled-back versions of the H100 GPU and H200 GPU, had been designed specifically for Chinese companies in compliance with Biden-era export controls. So, Nvidia was left with inventory it could not sell when Trump changed the terms. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly insisted that export bans would not slow progress in China, the second-largest artificial intelligence (AI) market in the world, but would instead stifle U.S. technology leadership. Interestingly, while the president cited national security as grounds for export controls, he made a deal with Huang in July that allows Nvidia to sell H20 GPUs in China, provided the government gets 15% of sales. The unprecedented arrangement raised questions about whether the national security risks were a gambit for Trump to exert influence over the private sector or whether he is prioritizing business interests over national security. Regardless, Trump's decision to lift the export restrictions was a win for Nvidia. Huang says the AI market in China is currently a $50 billion opportunity and is growing at a rate of 50% annually. Shortly after Trump negotiated a revenue-sharing arrangement with Nvidia, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made comments that upset Chinese authorities. I think fourth best is where we have come out," he told CNBC. While nothing about Lutnick's statement is particularly surprising -- it is widely known that the H20 GPU is a scaled-down version of more powerful accelerators like the H100 and H200 -- his choice of words and callous delivery rankled leaders in Beijing. More recently, the Chinese government accused Nvidia of violating its antimonopoly laws when it acquired networking specialist Mellanox in 2020. In turn, Beijing's top cybersecurity regulator urged Chinese companies not to buy RTX Pro 6000D chips, which are designed to support industrial AI workloads. Indeed, while Alibaba Group, Tencent, and TikTok-parent ByteDance have historically been major buyers of Nvidia hardware, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that those companies are now leaning more heavily on domestic chips. That is undoubtedly bad news for Nvidia and its shareholders because it means China is unlikely to be a material source of revenue anytime soon. For context, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar estimated that Nvidia would earn $56 billion in revenue from China next year. Indeed, the way the winds are blowing, some analysts question whether Nvidia will see any revenue from China next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 90% of British citizens do not support London's upcoming recognition of Palestinian statehood, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing a JL Partners survey. The poll, conducted between August 19 and 31 among 2,118 respondents, found that 87% opposed the unconditional recognition of a Palestinian state, while only 13% expressed their backing. Support for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision was lowest among opposition parties, with just 6% of Conservative voters and 8% of Reform UK voters in favor. Among Labour supporters, only 11% backed the move. The survey also showed that 51% of respondents oppose recognition while Hamas remains in power, and 40% said recognition should come only after Hamas agrees to a ceasefire and releases Israeli hostages. Seventeen percent rejected recognition under any circumstances. Critics argue that the move would undermine London's ability to influence both Israel and Hamas. On July 29, the prime minister's office warned it would recognize Palestine before the start of the UN General Assembly session in September if Israel continued to block humanitarian aid to Gaza and did not end its military operation in the enclave. Amid the escalating conflict, the Foreign Office later confirmed that recognition would proceed in September. The high-level week of the UN General Assembly will run from September 23 to 27, as well as on September 29.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ENERGODAR /Zaporozhye region/, September 21. The plan for the potential transition of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) into power generation mode is being successfully implemented, including addressing the most critical issues - ensuring sufficient water for reactor cooling and securing external energy supply, ZNPP Director Yuri Chernichuk told TASS. "Work is proceeding across all elements of the plan. In areas such as staffing and licensing, progress is more visible. As for other aspects, they are not yet as obvious, but work is underway in every direction. This includes the most frequently discussed issues, including ensuring the plant's power supply, maintaining the transmission lines required for generation, hydrotechnical facilities, and keeping water levels adequate for the plant's operation. Work is being carried out across all these areas," Chernichuk said. On February 18, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev told TASS that, under his directive, a major program was being prepared for bringing ZNPP back online. He later noted that the state corporation had already drawn up a comprehensive plan for the phased commissioning of the plant, which is currently under review by the Russian government. At the same time, Likhachev emphasized that the program could only be carried out once military threats from Ukrainian forces are removed.</p>
