                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama responded to ABC's decision to indefinitely take Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air and warned of "government coercion." "After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like," Obama said in a post on X. "This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it," he said in a response. Washington has largely split along party lines in the wake of ABC's shocking suspension of the late-night host on Wednesday following Kimmel's comments on the shooting of Charlie Kirk. The Jimmy Kimmel fallout is ramping up. President Donald Trump and his allies have praised the network's decision to "indefinitely" suspend Kimmel after Carr, a Trump appointee, pressured Disney before local TV stations revolted, and ultimately, ABC took action. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. "These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead." In contrast, Democrats are aghast, saying that Kimmel's suspension is an affront to the First Amendment. On Thursday, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a lengthy letter to Carr, calling his actions "corrupt political intimidation," and asking for the FCC to turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, the affiliated TV station operator, starting from January 20. "The Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) apparent weaponization of its federal regulatory authority and ABC's preemption of programming that may be critical of President Trump represents a dangerous escalation in attacks on press freedom and protected speech," the Committee wrote in the five-page letter signed by Rep. Robert Garcia. "Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. At a press conference alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday morning, Trump doubled down. "You can call that free speech or not," Trump said. "He was fired for lack of talent." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Kimmel's suspension "outrageous." "It's a page right out of Xi's playbook. This is just despicable, disgusting, and against democratic values," Schumer said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday night. Vice President JD Vance has not yet directly weighed in on Kimmel's suspension, but on Thursday morning, he made a joke about it. "Everyone please congratulate @marcorubio, the new host of ABC's late night show," Vance wrote on X. Marco Rubio holds several jobs in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and Acting Archivist of the United States. He's been the subject of several jokes about holding multiple jobs, and has occasionally made light of it himself. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Democratic leadership released a joint statement condemning ABC's move and calling on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to resign for engaging "in the corrupt abuse of power." "Media companies, such as the one that suspended Mr. Kimmel, have a lot to explain," the lawmakers continued. It may also be part of a corrupt pay-to-play scheme. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Carr is "a great guy," but the way he pressured Disney "is dangerous as hell." "He says, 'We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way,'" Cruz said during an episode of his podcast "Verdict" that was released on September 19. "And I got to say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' The former GOP presidential hopeful said he's worried about Carr's actions could backfire on conservatives if Democrats retake the White House. On September 18, Garcia signed a letter requesting the FCC turn over all internal communication and documents related to ABC and Sinclair, starting from Trump's inauguration day. The deadline to turn over these documents is October 2. "Every American has a duty to stand up for our First Amendment values," Garcia said. "We will not be silent as our freedoms are threatened by corrupt schemes and threats. "We stand ready to work with any media organization willing to resist any attempts of unlawful coercion of editorial decisions and expose any abuse of federal authority to suppress constitutionally protected speech," wrote Garcia in the letter. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Republican Party of engaging in censorship after Kimmel's suspension. The @GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time." Cassidy has a history with Kimmel, dating back to when Republicans unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, during Trump's first term. Kimmel later attacked Cassidy's bill, which led to a simmering feud. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a moderate Republican, said he was uncomfortable with Kimmel's suspension in an appearance on C-SPAN Washington Journal on Thursday morning. "I think it would have been better just to shame him," Bacon said. I get a little worried about this cancel culture that we have." Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut went directly after Carr after the FCC chair praised Nexstar for pulling Kimmel off the air, which preceded ABC's decision. "This is a massive, history making abuse of your power," Murphy wrote on X. "It will define your legacy and one day you will come to regret punishing free speech and trying to destroy democracy." Taylor Budowich, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, cheered on Kimmel's suspension. "Normal, common sense Americans are no longer taking the bullshit and companies like ABC are finally willing to do the right and reasonable thing. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested that the FCC played a key role in Kimmel's suspension — and that media companies are to blame as well. "Last-minute settlements, secret side deals, multi-billion dollar mergers pending Donald Trump's approval," Warren wrote on X. "Trump silencing free speech stifles our democracy. It sure looks like giant media companies are enabling his authoritarianism." Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democrat and frequent Trump critic, said that if Democrats retake the House, they will investigate matters like this. "And to the FCC chairperson and anyone involved in these dirty deals, get a lawyer and save your records, because you're going to be in this room." During an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press," Sen. Rand Paul called Carr's remarks suggesting that the FCC would take action against Disney-owned ABC "absolutely inappropriate." "Brendan Carr's got no business weighing in on this, but people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don't have the right to employment," he said. "Virtually everybody employed, probably including yourself, has a code of conduct in your contract that you have to adhere to." Paul said networks are entitled to pull content they don't agree with. "The FCC should have nothing to do with it, but I do think a couple of networks pulled out. Sinclair pulled out — they were disgusted by the comments. He added, "But the government's got no business in it and the FCC was wrong to weigh in."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's xAI has designed its Grok chatbot to be deliberately provocative. The workers who train xAI's chatbot have seen firsthand what it means to carry out this vision. In conversations with more than 30 current and former workers across a variety of projects, 12 told Business Insider they encountered sexually explicit material — including instances of user requests for AI-generated child sexual abuse content (CSAM). Sexual material and CSAM crop up across nearly every major tech platform, but experts say xAI has made explicit content part of Grok's DNA in ways that set it apart. Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, which largely block sexual requests, xAI's strategy could complicate things when it comes to preventing the chatbot from generating CSAM. Business Insider verified the existence of multiple written requests for CSAM from what appeared to be Grok users, including requests for short stories that depicted minors in sexually explicit situations and requests for pornographic images involving children. In some cases, Grok had produced an image or written story containing CSAM, the workers said. More recently, workers have been told they should also alert their manager. The agreements covered projects geared toward adult content and general projects that involved annotating Grok's overall image generation or text generation capabilities, as explicit content could pop up at random. One document reviewed by Business Insider said that workers might encounter the following content: "Media content depicting pre-pubescent minors victimized in a sexual act, pornographic images and/or child exploitation; Media content depicting moment-of-death of an individual," and written descriptions of sexual and physical abuse, hate speech, violent threats, and graphic images. Fallon McNulty, executive director at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Business Insider that companies focused on sexual content need to take extra care when it comes to preventing CSAM on their platforms. It's unclear whether the volume of NSFW content or CSAM increased after xAI introduced its "Unhinged" and "Sexy" Grok voice functions in February. Like other AI firms, xAI tries to prevent AI-generated CSAM. Business Insider was unable to determine whether xAI data annotators review more such material than their counterparts at OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta. Musk has previously called the removal of child sexual exploitation material his "priority #1" when discussing platform safety for X. The team that trains Grok has had a tumultuous month. Over 500 workers were laid off; several high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated; and the company appears to be moving away from generalists toward more specialized hires. Musk recently posted on X that training for Grok 5 will begin "in a few weeks." Some tutors told Business Insider that NSFW content has been difficult to avoid on the job, whether their tasks involve annotating images, short stories, or audio. Projects originally intended to improve Grok's tone and realism were at times overtaken by user demand for sexually explicit content, they said. XAI has asked for workers willing to read semi-pornographic scripts, three people said. Shortly after the February release of Grok's voice function — which includes "sexy" and "unhinged" versions — workers began transcribing the chatbot's conversations with real-life users, some of which are explicit in nature, as part of a program internally referred to as "Project Rabbit," workers said. It briefly ended this spring, but temporarily returned with the release of Grok companions, including a highly sexualized character named "Ani," and a Grok app for some Tesla owners. "It was supposed to be a project geared toward teaching Grok how to carry on an adult conversation," one of the workers said. Some of the things people asked for were things I wouldn't even feel comfortable putting in Google," said a former employee who worked on Project Rabbit. "It made me feel like I was eavesdropping," they added, "like people clearly didn't understand that there's people on the other end listening to these things." Musk has said the company plans to release a child-friendly AI companion. Another worker who was assigned to an image-based initiative called "Project Aurora" said the overall content, particularly some of the images they had to review, made them feel "disgusting." "It actually made me sick," one former worker said. Employees can opt out of any project or choose to skip an inappropriate image or clip, and one former worker said that higher-ups have said workers would not be penalized for choosing to avoid a project. Earlier this year, several hundred employees opted out of "Project Skippy," which required employees to record videos of themselves and grant the company access to use of their likeness, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. Still, before the mass opt-outs of Project Skippy, six workers said that declining to participate in projects could be difficult. Four other former workers said the company's human resources team narrowed the flexibility for opting out in an announcement on Slack earlier this year. As a consequence of the AI boom, regulators have seen an uptick in reports of AI-generated content involving child sexual abuse, and it has become a growing issue across the industry. Lawmakers are figuring out how to address a variety of AI-generated content, whether it's purely fictional content or an individual using AI to alter real-life images of children, Pfefferkorn, the Stanford researcher, said. In an ongoing class action complaint against Scale AI — which provides training and data annotation services to major tech firms like Alphabet and Meta — workers accused the company of violating federal worker safety laws by subjecting contractors to distressing content. In 2023, Time reported that OpenAI was using data annotators in Kenya to review content that included depictions of violent acts and CSAM. Spokespeople for OpenAI and Meta said the companies don't allow content that harms children on their platforms. In April, xAI posted several roles that involved red teaming. Allowing an AI model to train off illegal material would be risky, Dani Pinter, senior vice president and director of the Law Center for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, told Business Insider. "For training reasons alone, they should be very cautious about letting that type of content in their machine learning portal," Pinter said, adding that it's important the chatbots are trained not to spit back CSAM in response to user requests. "The drum we're beating right now is, it's time to practice corporate responsibility and implementing safety with innovation," Pinter said. "Companies can't be recklessly innovating without safety, especially with tools that can involve children." The Department of Justice has already started pursuing cases involving AI-generated CSAM. Spokespeople for Anthropic and OpenAI told Business Insider that the companies don't allow CSAM and have strict policies in place to prevent it. XAI did not file any reports in 2024, according to the organization. NCMEC told Business Insider it has not received any reports from xAI so far this year. NCMEC said it received about 67,000 reports involving generative AI in 2024, compared with 4,700 the year before. Do you work for xAI or have a tip?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and prominent members of his "Make America Great Again" movement were paying tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America's fraught political atmosphere. The memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand. "We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today," Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. Kirk's assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event. The lower bowl of the stadium quickly filled with mourners dressed in red, white a blue, as organizers suggested. "I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference," said Crystal Herman, who traveled from Branson, Missouri. Trump has blamed the "radical left" for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death. He criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised "the life and legacy" of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday. All (Republicans) were saying was 'Please condemn the assassination of a human being,'" Trump told reporters. "And (Democrats) said, 'No, no, we're not going to do that.'" Dozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. A 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he "had enough" of Kirk's hatred. Turning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach. The crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk's memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people. "I think he spoke on more than just politics," said Michael Link, 29, who stopped outside the stadium to take in the scene. His impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores. Kirk "was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them," Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. Kirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader. Kirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Arizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president. Scheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak. Longtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes. Kirk's widow, who has been named Turning Point's new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that "the movement my husband built will not die."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, the White House announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, sparking a wave of confusion and panic as companies and workers scrambled to make sense of the order. Three tech workers from across the US explained how they spent Friday night and Saturday. Two spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking to the media; Business Insider has verified their identities. I studied engineering back home in India and got recruited into a US-based tech company straight out of college. I received my H-1B right away and moved to the US in 2013. The green card backlog for Indian-born applicants has kept me on an H-1B for 12 years, with no clear end in sight. The last 36 hours have felt like being on call for a production outage, except the system being debugged is my career. At first, it wasn't clear whether this applied to new H-1B applications, renewals, or even H-4 dependents, such as my wife. I was also worried about who would have to pay the fees — employees or their companies — and if firms would be willing or able to pay this fee for thousands of H-1B workers. I have been constantly checking YouTube, LinkedIn, and the White House official channels for clearer instructions. Many companies have already advised employees to avoid travel, and some friends who were abroad on H-1Bs have even been asked to return before September 21st. I saw my friends who were visiting India book last-minute flights to get back to the US after calls with their human resource teams. My sister, who recently gave birth, also planned to travel soon, but canceled her trip this weekend. She would have been flying back with my mother, who was visiting us, and I had to scramble to find someone who could make the trip back to India with our mom. The White House's update that it would only impact people in the next lottery cycle brought a lot of relief. The anxiety of this weekend and the lack of a clear pathway to a more permanent residency are now making us rethink things. I've been with my current company since graduating from the program. I was anxious leading up to it and had already started exploring what my fallback options could be. I found out about the new White House order on the H-1B visa on Friday from friends who began checking up on me and whether the new rules would affect me. I opened ChatGPT and asked what exactly the order was, what criteria of H-1B holders it affected, and if there were any changes to alternative visas like the E-B1 or E-B2. More than H-1B, I was hoping there were no changes to the green card routes. I was planning a holiday in a couple of months, but I've punted planning that trip and buying tickets. After years in the US, my spouse and I have the mindset of not letting these changes affect us too much. We say that if we're here temporarily, let's make the most of it and continue to grow in our careers by making ourselves more indispensable. Since the administration changed, I've also been making sure we are renewing our documents and getting our passport stampings done proactively and not waiting until the last minute. It's made me feel the pain of new graduates and how difficult it would be for them to come to the US, pay off student loans, and get an opportunity to find an employer that would be supportive of them working here. That will be a big challenge, at least for the next 12 months, but I'm hoping people are still supportive of the highly skilled talent that comes through. I was fortunate enough to get my H-1B visa on my first attempt when I was still in graduate school. Even though I did not move from India with the expectation to stay in the US long term, I felt relieved to get the visa and thought it gave me an option to stay longer if I wanted. I've worked for multiple Big Tech companies since graduating and am currently a software engineer at a tech firm based in Silicon Valley. I instantly started Googling and reading about it, trying to figure out what exactly had happened. I spoke to my wife, who was out of town for the weekend, and we decided she should not travel back to India for her visa stamping. We're waiting for things to cool down before booking any tickets. After our call, I was frustrated, so I went to play pickleball with my friends to work out some of those emotions. I came home to a call from my mom back in India. I told them we should wait for things to settle down before making a big decision. My friends, most of whom work at Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft, are all in the same boat. New guidance from the immigration authority about existing H-1B holders has made me feel like I'm off the hook, but my wife and I are still waiting for more confirmation before making travel plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Berkshire Hathaway has completely exited its extremely profitable equity investment in the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD. That followed a 41% jump in the value of the position during that year's second quarter to $9 billion. By crossing below that level, Berkshire no longer had to disclose subsequent sales under the Hong Kong exchange's rules, so as far as we knew the company owned 54 million shares. A Berkshire spokesperson confirmed that the entire BYD position has indeed been sold. Berkshire made its initial purchase 17 years ago at the urging of Charlie Munger. At the 2009 annual meeting, he told shareholders that even though it looked like "Warren and I have gone crazy," he saw the company and its CEO, Wang Chuanfu, as a "damn miracle." BYD shares increased by roughly 3890% during the years Berkshire owned them. Buffett has not explained in detail why Berkshire started selling, but, in 2023, he told CNBC's Becky Quick that BYD is an "extraordinary company" being run by an "extraordinary person," but "I think that we'll find things to do with the money that I'll feel better about." Around the same time, Berkshire sold almost all of the company's Taiwan Semiconductor stake, roughly $4 billion of stock, just months after the shares were purchased as he "reevaluated" the geopolitical risk posed by Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China. Warren Buffett has not been speaking publicly in the last few years about his generally liberal political views, telling shareholders in 2022 that some people get "sustainably mad" and "take it out on our companies," potentially harming employees and shareholders. It is, however, reasonable to assume that he doesn't see eye-to-eye on most issues with President Donald Trump. But they do agree, at least partially, on one thing: U.S. businesses should not chase very short-term goals. "This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies," he wrote. The SEC tells CNBC it is "prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies." Buffett, who famously favors making decisions for the long run, has strongly urged companies to stop providing quarterly earnings-per-share guidance. A 2018 Wall Street Journal opinion piece co-written by JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon says, "In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability." That happens, they said, when companies cut back on long-term beneficial spending to meet or beat their own short-term forecasts when earnings are affected by outside factors they can't control. They argue that "financial markets have become too focused on the short term" and quarterly guidance "is a major driver of this trend." Buffett and Dimon stress they are not against the reporting of earnings every quarter. They just don't like companies forecasting what those earnings will be. Companies, they said, should "continue to provide annual and quarterly reporting that offers a retrospective look at actual performance so that the public, including shareholders and other stakeholders, can reliably assess real progress."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>iPhone Air is the big newcomer among Apple's latest lineup that went on sale Friday, but inside the slim phone's raised plateau is another new piece of hardware that signals a renewed focus on artificial intelligence. Apple's custom A19 Pro chip introduces a major architecture change, with neural accelerators added to each GPU core to increase compute power. Apple also debuted its first ever wireless chip for iPhone, the N1, and a second generation of its iPhone modem, the C1X. It's a move analysts say gives Apple control of all the core chips in its phones. Until now, Broadcom was the main provider of wireless and bluetooth chips for iPhones, although Apple has made networking chips for the AirPods and Apple Watch for nearly a decade. Arun Mathias, Apple vice president of wireless software technologies and ecosystems, gave CNBC an example of the N1's improved Wi-Fi functionality. "One of the things people may not realize is that your Wi-Fi access points actually contribute to your device's awareness of location, so you don't need to use GPS, which actually costs more from a power perspective," Mathias said. "By being able to do this more seamlessly in the background, not needing to wake up the application processor as much, we can do that significantly more efficiently." For iPhone modems, Qualcomm has been the sole provider since 2020. Qualcomm has long warned investors of the coming change. "It may not be as good as Qualcomm's yet, in terms of just overall throughput and performance, but they can control it and they can make it run at lower power. So you're going to get better battery life," said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies, a technology research and consulting firm. He expects Apple to "completely phase out" Qualcomm in the "next couple of years." Neither Qualcomm or Broadcom saw much market impact following Apple's announcement, and both companies will maintain licensing deals with Apple for certain core technologies. Apple's three new chips come amid increasing pressure from Wall Street about the company's AI strategy. "They probably won't ever have their own Apple model like Google or OpenAI," Bajarin said. "They're still going to run those services on iPhone, right? Apple has been making its own system on a chip, or SoC, since the A series launched with the iPhone 4 in 2010. The latest generation A19 Pro has a new chip architecture that prioritizes AI workloads, adding neural accelerators to the GPU cores. "We are building the best on-device AI capability that anyone else has," Millet told CNBC. "Right now we are focused on making sure that these phones that we're shipping today, or shipping soon, will be capable of all the important on-device AI workloads that are coming." One "built-in AI" feature Millet highlighted is the new front camera that uses AI to detect a new face and automatically switches to taking a horizontal photo. Apple's original AI hardware, its Neural Engine, was first unveiled back in 2017. Instead, it's all about adding compute power to the GPUs. And so when you look inside the Neural Engine, for example, you have a lot of dense matrix math. We didn't have that capability in our GPU. Bajarin told CNBC that Apple's neural accelerators may work similarly to the tensor cores on Nvidia's AI chips, such as the H100. "We're integrating neural processing in a way that allows someone who's writing a program to one of those small processors, extending the instruction set so they have a new class of computer that they have access to right there, and they can switch back and forth between 3D-rendering instructions and neural-processing instructions, all seamlessly inside the same microprogram," Millet said. "It's actually positioned in concert with where the system on a chip, the A19 Pro is positioned," said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing. All bigger core chips, however, may be Apple-designed in every iPhone as soon as next year, according to Bajarin. "We expect that there would be modems coming to Mac. We would expect there's modems coming to iPad. There's probably N variants of the networking chip coming to Mac," Bajarin said. When CNBC asked Apple's Millet if neural accelerators will be in the GPU cores of M5, the next anticipated SoC for Mac, he said, "We have a unified approach to architecture." The iPhone maker plans to manufacture at least some of its custom chips in the U.S., at facilities like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's new campus in Arizona, where CNBC got a tour of the first completed fab. Apple's A19 Pro is made at the leading edge of TSMC's 3-nanometer node. While TSMC is working toward 3nm production in Arizona by 2028, it's not there yet. "If you need to be on the leading edge, it's going to be Taiwan for the time being," Bajarin said. In August, Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips from companies not making domestically. That same day, Apple increased its U.S. spending commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. CEO Tim Cook said part of that will go toward creating an "end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America." "This is obviously why Apple and Tim Cook are on their mission and out there talking about investing in America." As part of that plan, Bajain said Apple could give struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel "serious consideration if 14A really does deliver on all of its promises." Although, he added, it's "going to be awhile" before Intel "becomes a viable option." For now, Apple is committed to making chips at TSMC Arizona. "We are super excited about TSMC's push into U.S. manufacturing. Obviously it will help us from a time zone perspective, and we also appreciate that the diversity of the supply is also really important," Millet said. When asked if he knows how much of Apple's $600 billion U.S. spend will go toward custom silicon, Millet said, "I hope it's a lot."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neither of us had any ties to the city, and before we met, neither of us expected to stay there after graduation. Although my husband and I both wanted children, we knew we wouldn't have them right away, and allowing family to take a backseat to work seemed like the right choice at the time. But things didn't work out the way I had planned. My daughter was born with multiple disabilities and complex medical needs. Caring for her and working a 9-to-5 job wasn't feasible. Additionally, not knowing whether she would live until her first birthday prompted me to reevaluate how I wanted to live my life. I wound up leaving my position as a full-time attorney and pieced together several part-time and freelance jobs I could do from home instead. Moreover, by the time my daughter was born, I had established a full life in DC. My husband and I once again briefly considered moving to be closer to family, but it still didn't seem like the best idea for us. My husband and I went on to have three more children. After each child's birth, we once again discussed moving back to Philadelphia or St. Paul, but with every passing year, leaving DC seemed more difficult, especially if it meant starting over with a new job. Now that my kids, now aged 10 through 19, and my parents, now in their mid-70s, are older, I think we made a mistake in deciding to raise my children far away from any family. Since I left traditional employment just a few years after graduation, it's clear that my career would not have suffered from living somewhere without as many job opportunities. My husband may have wound up with a very different career trajectory in Philadelphia or St. Paul, but I think the trade-off would have been worth it. I love the life we built in DC, and my children are happy. We take advantage of all the city has to offer, from a seemingly endless number of free museums to a vast national park. Still, I often think about how much they missed out on by not growing up close to cousins, grandparents, and a big extended family that loves them. The chaos of life means that visits were not nearly as frequent as I had hoped they would be. Selfishly, I also realize that my life would have been easier if I lived near family who could help when life seems overwhelming or babysit for a night out with my husband. My parents needed help too, but leaving my four kids who needed me made frequent or extended visits impossible. My father passed away a few months ago, and I will always regret that I couldn't spend more time with him when he was sick. However, if I could go back and do things over, I would choose being closer to family over better job opportunities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Forty years later, not much has changed for the next generation of young founders. While the AI boom is sending millions in venture funding to 20-something entrepreneurs, many still aren't buying furniture. Some live on mattresses in the office, while others keep their apartments' clutter to a minimum. ThirdLayer operates out of a live/work-zoned loft that was previously occupied by another Y Combinator startup. In the kitchen, the sink was full of dishes because everyone likes to "sit and work" and not "do chores," per 22-year-old cofounder Regina Lin. They have plastic utensils and rarely cook. "This stack of ramen used to be a lot bigger," Lin said, pointing to a tower of different instant noodle brands. Next to the kitchen is their common area, where they film social videos, store their prop gimmicks, and often house overnight guests. Lin said that she sleeps there from 4 to 7 a.m., "and then I escape to my bedroom before anyone in the morning comes and sees me passed out there." The floor is filled with standing desks. Lin's desk is littered with Blue Bottle cups; she said that she usually has at least four. Affixed to one desk is a bed for their cat, Tobi. Lin thought a cat would be "good for company culture." ThirdLayer has beds both upstairs and downstairs. Julia Alvarenga, ThirdLayer's intern, got the most prized room downstairs: a storage closet. The company's design engineer also lives there, and they outfit the downstairs couch as a bed when remote employees visit. Lin sleeps in a king-size bed; she said she wanted a smaller mattress so that they could fit more, but it was too big to get out the door. Her cofounder, Kevin Gu, sleeps on a couch just feet away. The room has a closet, though it doesn't have any racks to hang clothes. Lin suspects that it was built as a room to take calls. The founders leave their suitcases in there, and Lin also stacks her clothes in a large plastic bin next to her bed. If Lin wants to do her makeup or get ready for the day, she'll go downstairs to the bigger common bathroom, she said. 25-year-old Docket cofounder Boris Skurikhin's mattress is on the floor. His makeshift nightstand is a short cardboard box, on which he stacked his computer and a biography of physicist Andrei Sakharov. His clothes are folded and stacked against the room's windows. Skurikhin doesn't like clutter; he says the almost empty room allows him to walk around and think. In their doorway is a small "conversational table" where Skurikhin sometimes eats lunch or dinner. Ghai does not have time to cook food — "DoorDash is my best friend," she said — but keeps some supplies on hand for when she hosts friends or hackathons. In her living room, Ghai is playing meditative music — something she "always" has on. I'll wake up in the morning and walk around with my incense." The Airbnb also has a small patio, one of Ghai's non-negotiables: "I need to be able to walk outside on days when I'm working for 12 hours." The porch is also an ideal spot to sit out and have a coffee in the morning, or to smoke a joint, she said. Ghai's desk is not in her bedroom, another non-negotiable while picking an Airbnb. She needs separation, she said, and having a separate desk area allows her to create a "little WeWork." The first thing that she does every morning is make her bed. I need you to walk into my house and be like, 'Is this a staged home?'" "I like to do my little art projects," she said. He's the only one who sleeps there full-time, but the office has cots and a couch for those who work particularly late. Upstairs is more bed space and a conference room, but the area is currently strewn with Sirota's clothes. "We just moved a month ago and I've been super traveling, so we haven't set up this area yet," he said. Sirota's room will eventually be upstairs, too, he said, and it will have an actual mattress and a closet. Outside, Sirota has a tent set up. Photos of tents pitched in what was inaccurately described as the X office recently spread around the social media platform, which Eragon recreated for a marketing stunt. Next to the tent is a stationary bike for office use. Eragon is part of Andreessen Horowitz's accelerator, A16z Speedrun. Sirota said he was meeting Ben Horowitz that week, and on his desk was a copy of Horowitz's "What You Do Is Who You Are." There was a bag of leftover McDonald's from an Uber Eats delivery. Stacked up high on his desk were at least five canisters of Zyn nicotine pouches. 26-year-old TrainLoop founder Jackson Stokes' apartment doesn't have a living room. It's worked for him: "We were just never actually here," he said, explaining that he'll spend 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the office on a normal day. That apartment also didn't have a dishwasher. The company coffee maker is much nicer. He recently bought a $1,500 machine for the TrainLoop office. Stokes wants to have a nice bedroom. He called it a "bit cluttered" — there's a plant on top of the coffee machine — but said that he'd been "nesting." He has a bottle of wine from winning first place at an OpenAI hackathon and a bottle signed by his YC group partner, Michael Seibel. There's also a bottle of Clase Azul, which is still sealed because "we don't drink that much." "I actually have not rung the bell on this one yet," Stokes said of the bottle's topper. "But I have rung the bell on others." 23-year-old Haokun Qin and his Gale cofounder moved into their Toronto apartment two months ago: "We just shoved our stuff in here, and we've been here maybe half the time." He keeps his room basic, just "whatever I need to sleep." His favorite thing in the room, Qin said, was the protein shakes that he stores under his bed. In his bathroom, Qin has a variety of skincare products. "I don't even know what it is, but half the stuff my mom bought, and half the stuff I bought on Amazon over time," he said. In his apartment's living area, Qin has floor-to-ceiling windows. He points out one to The Velocity Incubator, a local startup program. His office, he says, is a three-minute walk away. Opening his freezer, Qin pulls out an ice pop and laughs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the biggest questions facing Uber and other companies experimenting with self-driving cars is who will own and maintain all those vehicles without gig workers. While speaking this month at a summit hosted by the "All-In" podcast, Khosrowshahi fielded a question about how Uber would handle ownership of the self-driving cars that it plans to add to its operations in the coming years. All-In posted a video of the conversation on Wednesday. "All of these cars are going to be financeable," he said. Before becoming Uber's top executive, Khosrowshahi was CEO of travel search site Expedia. He said that major hotel brands like Hilton or Marriott don't typically own their hotels. "Those hotels are owned by financial-only players," Khosrowshahi said at the event. A decade from now, some investors could play a REIT-like role for companies that use lots of self-driving vehicles, Khosrowshahi said at the All-In event. The company's ride-hailing drivers are independent contractors who use their own cars to shuttle passengers around cities or deliver food to customers' doors. Uber pays the drivers for each gig that they complete. While human Uber drivers will likely be around for years, Khosrowshahi also said at the summit that self-driving cars could eventually leave many people out of work. For Uber, the challenge will be finding a business model that has all the benefits of self-driving cars while owning as little as possible. Do you have a story to share about Uber or other gig work?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disruption at some European airports continued for a second day on Sunday after a cyberattack targeted check-in technology company Collins Aerospace. The U.K.'s largest airport, Heathrow, was among those affected, along with airports in Berlin and Brussels. Brussels Airport on Sunday asked airlines to cancel half of Monday's scheduled departing flights as issues with its check-in system remain unresolved. Collins Aerospace "provides check-in and boarding systems for several airlines across multiple airports globally," Heathrow Airport said in a post on X Saturday. Collins' parent company, RTX, said in a statement to Reuters that it was aware of "cyber-related disruption" to its MUSE software. "The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations," RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies, said in a statement emailed to Reuters. CNBC has contacted RTX for comment and is awaiting a response. Aviation analytics provider Cirium told CNBC that on Sunday so far, 38 departures and 33 arrivals had been canceled across Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, as of 10 a.m. London time. Brussels saw the highest number of flight cancellations, at 15. Heathrow said it was working to "resolve and recover" following the Collins outage that impacted check-in. "We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate," it said on X. "We encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to Heathrow and to arrive no earlier than three hours for long-haul flights and two hours for short-haul." Brussels said on its website Sunday that the cyberattack was having "a large impact on the flight schedule and unfortunately causes delays and cancellations of flights." It advised travelers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport. Dublin Airport was also affected, but said it expects to operate a full schedule on Sunday. This means that the check-in and bag drop processes may take slightly longer than normal," the airport said on X. While British retailer Marks & Spencer earlier this year said a recent cyberattack, which left food shelves bare and brought online sales to a standstill, would wipe out almost one-third of its annual profits. However, Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at cybersecurity firm Check Point, noted that the aviation industry was a particularly target for cybercriminals given its reliance on shared digital systems. "These attacks often strike through the supply chain, exploiting third-party platforms that are used by multiple airlines and airports at once," she said in an emailed statement. "When one vendor is compromised, the ripple effect can be immediate and far-reaching, causing widespread disruption across borders." To improve resiliency, she said aviation companies should ensure software systems are regularly updated and well-tested backup systems are in place. She also called for better information-sharing between the technology providers, airlines and governments. "Cyberattacks rarely stop at national borders, so the faster one country can identify and report an attack, the faster others can take action to contain it," she said. "A joined-up defence will be far more effective than siloed responses." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>
