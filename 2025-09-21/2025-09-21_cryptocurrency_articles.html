                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's slow ascent towards establishing new highs has continuously encountered significant opposition in the past few weeks. Below is how the latest on-chain data answers some of these questions In a September 20 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson reemphasized his early prediction of $117,000 as a critical resistance zone for the Bitcoin price. Wedson referenced his post published exactly a week ago, which utilized two main on-chain metrics — the CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) Channel, and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price — in reaching his conclusion. This metric is typically used in highlighting zones of long-term support or resistance based on the movement of aged coins. By extension, the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price is a metric that shows the average cost basis of Bitcoin, adjusted with specific Fibonacci ratios. It displays mathematical levels of extension or retracement around the Bitcoin average holder's cost. According to the analyst, these two metrics had aligned perfectly, pointing out $117,000 as a zone where retracement was likely to occur. In the same post on X, Wedson pointed out specific price actions to watch out for in terms of Bitcoin's price progression and what a potential breach could mean. A deeper correction could even drag Bitcoin to as low as $100,000—a price level that may attract institutions for accumulation. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,660, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has long wrestled with the “non-ouroboros” problem: how to generate real revenue beyond speculative loops of buying, selling, and leveraging tokens on its chain. For years, memecoins, non-fungible tokens, and incentive-driven decentralised finance apps have propped up activity but failed to provide a sustainable foundation for Ethereum's nearly $100 billion DeFi economy according to DefiLlama data. Now, as Wall Street is increasingly betting on Ethereum as the backbone of the stablecoin boom, co-founder Vitalik Buterin argues that “low-risk DeFi,” which includes things like payments, savings, and collateralised lending, could finally give the network its flagship revenue engine. “Non-financial and more experimental applications, are crucially important for Ethereum's role in the world and for its culture,” Buterin wrote in a blog post published Sunday. That's a major shift from Ethereum's earlier years, when DeFi was synonymous with double-digit yields on risky liquidity farms and frenzies over cartoon NFTs. Buterin admits he was “more suspicious of DeFi” then, describing its main appeal as “making money from trading highly speculative tokens.” Today, he says, the centre of gravity has moved toward simpler financial products. The supply of stablecoins on Ethereum has ballooned 700% since the start of 2021 to more than $160 billion, while real-world assets like tokenised US Treasuries have grown from almost nothing into a $9 billion market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - XRP vs MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analyst Debate Highlights Best Altcoins to Buy for Q4 Breakouts Both tokens have captured market attention, but for very different reasons. XRP, with its established payment network and growing institutional traction, is viewed as a steady large-cap poised for further gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, meanwhile, is the fast-rising presale token attracting headlines with bold growth projections. Analysts in XRP's corner argue that it has something presale tokens can't replicate – proven adoption. With the token trading near $3.05, many believe it could push toward $5 if institutional flows continue. Proponents point to Ripple's ETF filing in the U.S. as another potential catalyst. “XRP is past the stage of speculation,” one analyst explained. Unlike XRP, which moves in measured increments, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the possibility of 50x-type returns if early momentum sustains. Its presale has already exceeded expectations, raising millions and capturing a growing online community. “This is about entering before the real rally begins,” another analyst said. “XRP might double, but MAGACOIN FINANCE could multiply many times over.” The debate ultimately comes down to a matter of risk tolerance. XRP is a relatively safer option backed by years of development and regulatory clarity. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, thrives on being new and untested – qualities that make it risky but also capable of delivering the type of explosive gains rarely found in established tokens. Investors weighing the two have to decide whether they want incremental growth or asymmetric upside. Historically, both approaches have worked – blue-chip altcoins like XRP provide stability, while early-stage tokens often deliver the most spectacular rallies. With Ethereum ETF speculation, Bitcoin whale accumulation, and retail momentum all heating up, the final quarter of the year is shaping up to be decisive. For XRP, the question is whether adoption milestones can push it into new price territory. For MAGACOIN FINANCE, the test is whether presale enthusiasm translates into sustained momentum once trading begins. XRP offers established strength, backed by adoption and institutional legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers bold potential, driven by presale energy and speculative appetite. This content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In another step toward establishing Europe's economic and digital sovereignty, European Union finance ministers on Friday agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank that would be independent of the U.S.-based Visa and Mastercard systems. The European Commission first proposed a digital euro currency in 2023, but discussions heated up last year, according to Reuters, as the drive to reduce Europe's dependence on U.S. and other non-EU technologies gathered momentum.

As in the U.S., some European bankers have expressed concern that a fiat-backed digital currency would drain funds from traditional banks, limiting their ability to make loans in fiat and undercutting the traditional financial system. In response to the Commission's original proposal in 2023, Finance Watch, a non-profit advocacy group founded in 2011 as a counterweight to financial industry lobbying, warned that a digital currency could also harm consumer privacy by enabling government financial surveillance, Reuters reported at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most controversial features of President Donald Trump's second term is his relentless criticism of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining elevated interest rates – a stance Trump argues is unnecessarily costly to the American economy. Trump is aggressively attempting to undermine the Fed's board, threatening an institution long known for its political independence. Ironically, this very assault risks backfiring, deepening what Trump and others describe as a Fed that is "behind the curve," potentially leading to a deeper sell-off in the U.S. dollar. That leaves policy data driven (thus late) rather than pre-emptive. That's bad for the USD," the market insights team at Lloyds Bank led by Nicholas Kennedy, said in a note to clients on Sept. 18. The move followed a temporary judicial block issued by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who prevented the ousting of Cook, a Biden appointee, pending further legal proceedings. According to the Lloyds Bank market insights team, such attacks are likely to increase as Powell enters the final months of his term as Chairman. At its core, Trump's campaign reflects a desire for a Fed more responsive to his economic worldview, which demands ultra-low rates around 1%, down significantly from the present 4%. Trump has argued that current rates keep mortgage costs prohibitively high for many Americans, hindering homeownership and imposing billions in unnecessary debt refinancing expenses. He frames this as a staggering missed opportunity on an otherwise “phenomenal” economy. Meanwhile, many economists agree that rates remain too high given signs of weakening labor markets and consumer health. Thus, the Federal Reserve is widely perceived as “behind the curve” – a technical term meaning it is too slow to cut rates in response to evolving economic conditions. Yet, Trump's insistence on forcing faster rate cuts risks pushing the Fed further behind this curve. So, unlike typical policymakers who adjust with measured calm in response to data, Powell and his colleagues now operate under intense political pressure and public scrutiny from the White House. They face a classic catch-22: face accusations of succumbing to political pressure in case of rapid rate cuts (even if they do so independently); wait too long and risk the potential deepening of an economic slowdown. However, this posture can exacerbate the problem: delayed rate cuts keep monetary policy out of sync with economic conditions, much like a patient who resists mild medication only to require drastic doses once a fever spikes. The subsequent high doses of rate cuts could be interpreted by markets as a sign of panic, leading to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if a simple mobile game could reshape an entire cryptocurrency landscape? This meteoric success has prompted an avalanche of speculation regarding the PENGU token, rapidly captivating both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. As the interplay between gaming and cryptocurrency garners unprecedented interest, institutional investors are zeroing in on this NFT phenomenon. What does this unprecedented rise imply for Pudgy Penguins' trajectory and the overarching narrative of crypto expansion? Crafted by Mythical Games, the game proves that engaging and enriching gameplay can act as a catalyst for mass adoption in blockchain-based entertainment. Such explosive popularity is a clear signal of substantial demand for fresh Web3 experiences, drawing in both gaming devotees and crypto aficionados in droves. By employing tools like the Early to the Party Soulbound Token (SBT), they're not just creating gamers; they're engendering unwavering community loyalty and enriching engagement among players. Luca Netz, Pudgy Penguins' CEO, asserts that this wave of developments is not solely about igniting short-term enthusiasm; it's about solidifying the brand's reputation within the industry. The surge in engagement from Asian investors demonstrates a widening acceptance of cryptocurrency assets, thereby positioning Pudgy Penguins as a compelling investment prospect for those dabbling in digital assets. Pudgy Penguins' ascent isn't merely a tale of organic growth; it's significantly underpinned by strategic alliances that amplify its visibility in the marketplace. Partnerships with heavyweights like Mythical Games and various financial institutions lend crucial credibility. These collaborations merge digital payment solutions with traditional finance, reflecting compliance with dynamic regulations while elevating standards for the entire crypto ecosystem. The broader ramifications of these partnerships reveal a revealing trend: institutional investors are increasingly inclined to back projects that outline clear growth strategies and innovative frameworks. This growing sentiment is mirrored in the soaring prices of PENGU tokens amidst rising trade volumes and favorable market sentiment. Historical patterns demonstrate that market behaviors often hinge on the short-lived triumphs from games or hot NFT drops; true stability, however, lies in continuous innovation paired with prudent fiscal governance. For Pudgy Penguins, the challenge will be sustaining momentum through a fortified framework that champions ongoing progress and community involvement. Industry experts warn that simply riding the wave of excitement isn't sufficient; without a balanced approach that intertwines engaging gameplay with sustainable growth, the brand risks perpetuating a lingering “meme coin” reputation. As Pudgy Penguins charts a course toward audacious financial products in the crypto domain, a strategic and holistic methodology is imperative to ensure enduring success. As Pudgy Penguins and its PENGU token continue to capture headlines, a widening array of observers is drawn into their captivating success narrative. However, navigating the labyrinthine market conditions amid mounting regulatory scrutiny will remain a critical test.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But when layered against all other stocks, an even more interesting pattern emerges. As Bitcoin advocate and founder of The Network State, Balaji Srinivasan, muses: Stripe CEO Patrick Collison ruminated on similar data, highlighting a trend emerging across Google, Apple, and Microsoft. He questioned why the companies exhibited the same growth dynamics when they are “ostensibly in totally different businesses,' to which Balaji replied: Almost every action that was once done offline is moving online, and routed through tech companies.” Patterns that would once have been dismissed as coincidences now seem to signal something deeper. The “secular shift” is economist-speak for a permanent, structural change. From grocery orders to financial transactions, human interactions, and even remote work, the COVID-accelerated rush to digital has become the main route for commerce and connection. Balaji's response to Collison's question made explicit what many now intuitively sense: tech companies aren't just growing, they're becoming the primary infrastructure for life itself. “Legacy” sectors like real estate, banking, and manufacturing are being reoriented, rewired, or outright replaced by software. In Balaji's words, almost every offline activity is “routed through tech companies,” as digital-first solutions offer scale, efficiency, and global reach previously unimaginable. This is not an innovation cycle but a replatforming. For investors and founders, these trends reinforce a simple imperative: bet on digital, or risk obsolescence. The parallel growth patterns across disconnected verticals suggest that internet penetration is now the single biggest driver of economic fate. Tech companies, with their network effects and digital rails, become the middlemen for everything. They reinforce the winner-take-most dynamic so apparent in today's markets. For policymakers, there's a warning: the digital divide will only widen unless deliberate intervention closes it. As more actions from life are intermediated by platforms, the cost of being unconnected grows. The trajectory of Magnificent 7 stocks, and, in particular, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, shines a light on a future where the majority of human action runs through software.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Algorand network, founded by MIT's Silvio Micali, is set to make crypto sustainable. Its high efficiency and eco-conscious design offer a cleaner, more secure digital future. Algorand carries a distinct consensus protocol: pure proof of stake. Proof of work systems, which include bitcoin, are energy-intensive. PPoS has the structure for scalability, security, and decentralization but a minimal environmental footprint. FinTech Magazine reported that Algorand's PPoS mechanism operates like a lottery system. A verifiable random function selects validators for each transaction block. Unlike other blockchains, Algorand's validators need less computational power to reach network consensus, effectively reducing energy consumption. A lightweight approach means node operation demands minimal hardware. This saves computing resources and promotes decentralization without compromising sustainability. Algorand's commitment to energy efficiency is a positive development for the blockchain industry. EnergySage has your back with free and transparent quotes from fully vetted providers that can help you save as much as $10k on installation. To get started, just answer a few questions about your home — no phone number required. Within a day or two, EnergySage will email you the best local options for your needs, and their expert advisers can help you compare quotes and pick a winner. Algorand demonstrates that a high-performance blockchain can exist with little impact on global pollution. Enabling more eco-friendly blockchains without escalating the planet's overheating problem is crucial. "We're committed to an open, secure, and inclusive blockchain ecosystem — and that requires clear, consistent policy," Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden said. Algorand also enhances sustainability through its supply chain traceability. Platform solutions such as Wholechain allow real-time tracking of goods. Authenticity verification and compliance assurance are key features that support businesses. The capabilities reduce waste, combat fraud, and ensure accountability across supply chains. Should the government offer tax incentives for energy-saving home upgrades? Algorand works with ClimateTrade partners to offset its carbon footprint as well. It achieves carbon-neutral status with an on-chain record for transparency. But there's also potential for the industry to drive green tech solutions. Blockchains designed with efficiency in mind serve many purposes. They can provide supply chain management, carbon markets, and transparent environmental tracking. Prioritizing energy-efficient protocols while leveraging tech innovations will benefit people and the planet. Algorand combines speed, security, genuine decentralization, and high transaction volumes.

As EU lawmakers near a decision on the “Chat Control” law, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms. As European lawmakers near a decision on the controversial “Chat Control” legislation, privacy experts warn it could break public trust in digital communication and push users toward Web3 platforms. Critics say this effectively creates a backdoor into encrypted systems, contradicting the EU's own commitments to privacy. “Client-side scanning would enable the monitoring of content on user devices prior to transmission, including in cases where there is no indication of unlawful activity,” she explained.

Fabrega raised concerns over the broader impact such surveillance would have on public trust. The erosion of trust in traditional messaging platforms could prompt users to explore decentralized Web3 alternatives, platforms built to protect user data through encryption by design. “This is true self-custody for data,” he added, noting that the end-user maintains sovereignty over their information from “cradle to grave.” Fabrega echoed the sentiment, stating that “privacy-conscious users will increasingly explore decentralized Web3 alternatives” if Chat Control is passed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid the rapid evolution of blockchain technology, payment-focused public blockchains, as critical infrastructure bridging traditional finance and the Web3 world, are encountering unprecedented opportunities. For an emerging blockchain positioned to “optimize payment and financial services,” this MOU is not merely a technical partnership but a milestone in UPCX's transition from proof-of-concept to mainstream adoption. It signals UPCX's entry into Japan—one of the world's leading markets for Web3 adoption, with over 12 million verified crypto users—and leverages NTT's global telecommunications network to expand worldwide. UPCX's Positioning: Unique Advantages of a High-Performance Payment Blockchain UPCX is an open-source decentralized payment network built on Graphene blockchain technology, integrating Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms, optimized specifically for payment and financial scenarios. Its core strengths address pain points of traditional blockchains in payment applications, achieving high throughput (up to 100,000 TPS), 1-second confirmation times to overcome latency issues, low gas fees for cost efficiency, and seamless bidirectional cross-chain transfers with Ethereum via the UPCX Bridge. Unlike general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, UPCX functions as a “multifunctional Web3 toolbox,” supporting stablecoin issuance, non-custodial custody, multi-signature payments, and scheduled/recurring payments, delivering a “smartphone-like intuitive” blockchain payment experience. As a nascent project, UPCX launched its mainnet in early 2025 and was listed on Japan's BitTrade exchange, emphasizing regulatory compliance. The core of this tripartite collaboration is the transition “from technical vision to real-world implementation.” Paycle will provide blockchain technology expertise, supporting UPCX in refining technical specifications and developing interfaces (e.g., SDKs and APIs) to enhance competitiveness in high-frequency payment scenarios like retail and cross-border settlements. Meanwhile, NTT Digital, as NTT Group's Web3 enabler, will leverage its global telecommunications network to facilitate UPCX's infrastructure adoption by enterprise clients, particularly financial institutions and crypto exchanges, while supporting market expansion in Japan. For UPCX, this shifts the paradigm from “solo effort” to “ecosystem synergy”—Paycle provides technical depth, while NTT offers market breadth. As one of the world's most regulated and mature blockchain markets, Japan positions this partnership to accelerate UPCX's global strategy in Asia and beyond. Community feedback has been positive, with many token holders calling this a “pivotal step for UPCX's ascent,” highlighting its role in accelerating DeFi adoption. In the short term, this MOU will significantly boost UPCX's visibility and credibility. Additionally, UPCX's stablecoin issuance and cross-border payment capabilities will benefit from NTT's global telecom infrastructure, accelerating real-world deployment in retail and international settlement scenarios. For investors, the MOU's long-term value lies in transforming UPCX from an “emerging player” to an “infrastructure provider.” First, technical fortification: Paycle's optimizations will further enhance UPCX's TPS and security, making it ideal for high-frequency scenarios like supply chain finance and DAO payroll automation. This not only boosts token utility (UPC as gas fees and staked assets) but may also attract more stablecoin issuance (e.g., USD/EUR-pegged versions), amplifying network effects. Second, market expansion and compliance dividends: Japan, as a “blockchain testing ground,” offers replicable experience for markets like Singapore, South Korea, and the EU. NTT's global network will accelerate UPCX's cross-border payment adoption, aiming to build a “sustainable financial economic foundation.” In the long run, as global payment markets shift toward blockchain, UPCX's positioning will capitalize on DeFi and Real-World Asset (RWA) trends, potentially driving multiples in valuation. The MOU with Paycle and NTT Digital is not only a model of technical collaboration but a catalyst for an emerging payment blockchain to go mainstream. It will accelerate UPCX's global journey, solidifying its leadership in high-performance payment solutions. Looking ahead, as more real-world use cases materialize, UPCX has the potential to become a “hidden champion” in Web3 payments. It supports fast payments, smart contracts, cross-asset transactions, user-issued assets (UIA), non-fungible tokens (NFA), and stablecoins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Binance Coin (BNB) has just moved over $1,000, making it one of the strongest exchange token. Solana (SOL) is also building momentum, with analysts predicting a similar run to $1,000. But as these two seasoned players continue going up, the most potential in 2025 could lie with a newcomer in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For the price of just $0.035 in presale, MUTM is anticipating a 50x return thanks to its lending and borrowing DeFi protocol, and it's the most explosive-growth altcoin among this group. Compared to BNB's established structure and market positioning, investors are looking at Mutuum Finance, for what they perceive as potential improved percentage gain in the next bull cycle. The network retains steadfastness in sustaining elevated transactional volume and decentralized application activity, further securing its position within the broader market. Current price action suggests a consolidation phase, with interest in seeing if SOL is able to sustain this steadiness before breaking towards greater levels. As Solana maintains its established position,  Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being monitored for possibly greater upside, given its early-stage position in the market. Mutuum Finance has achieved a record-breaking presale rate of adoption and has over 16,450 investors buying coins to raise over $16.05 million raised so far. Tokens can be bought at $0.035 per token during Phase 6. The project has a token giveaway for early adopters by providing $100,000 MUTM where 10 lucky people will receive a reward of $10,000 MUTM. In addition to the apparent creation of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin onto the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins which have depegged during times of financial stress, the stablecoin introduced by Mutuum will be considered non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and as such can uphold its peg during times of financial stress. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the altcoin with biggest upside potential among BNB and SOL. Whereas Binance Coin (BNB) just broke above $1,000 with potential to go higher, and Solana (SOL) is trading at the $250 level on its path towards its own $1,000 goal, MUTM has much better percentage gains. At a paltry $0.035 during Stage 6 presale, with more than $16.05M invested and 16,450+ investors signed up, professionals predict 50x gains for early buyers. Lock your tokens in now at Stage 6 before the next price increase and setup for maximum potential.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin argued that low-risk decentralized finance (DeFi) could do for Ethereum what search did for Google. It could provide a reliable, global revenue engine while staying aligned with community values. For years, Ethereum faced a divide between apps that generated revenue and apps that fulfilled its founding ideals. High-fee activity like NFTs and memecoins brought money but little long-term value. At the same time, projects like ENS, Lens, or privacy protocols were innovative but could not sustain the wider $500 billion ecosystem. In 2025, many now believe Ethereum has it: low-risk DeFi. Low-risk DeFi refers to simple but powerful tools such as payments, savings, fully collateralized lending, synthetic assets, and transparent exchanges between them. Unlike speculative yield farming or memecoins, these services provide real value and are increasingly secure. Aave, Maker, and other platforms already offer competitive deposit rates on stablecoins. First, protocols have matured, lowering risks compared to the early days. Second, traditional finance itself looks shakier in parts of the world. For many, DeFi's transparent and automated systems now appear safer than unstable banks or politicized currencies. Transaction fees and collateral demand from low-risk DeFi now provide steady economic support while avoiding the perverse incentives that came with speculative bubbles. Most of Google's innovation, from AI models to new programming languages, generates little revenue. Buterin argued this model incentivized Google to hoard user data and prioritize profit over openness. Ethereum's low-risk DeFi, by contrast, aligns economics with mission. It can evolve into undercollateralized lending, prediction markets for hedging, and new forms of value such as basket currencies or flatcoins. Each step would expand financial inclusion while keeping Ethereum's ethos intact. If this thesis holds, Ethereum's future may not rest on speculative bubbles or short-lived fads. Instead, its long-term growth could be anchored by the steady, global demand for safe and open financial infrastructure.</p>
