                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Battle over Trump's agenda: President Donald Trump expressed confidence after meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning as he made a personal pitch for passing his sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. • Ukraine war talks: Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war in Ukraine. His remarks come a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A new “special review panel” will conduct another review of the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced today. The panel will “thoroughly examine previous investigations,” Hegseth's memo said. An administration-wide after-action review of the withdrawal was released in April 2023, and the State Department released their own damning after-action report in June 2023. A Senate Appropriations hearing on Tuesday broke into a tense exchange about health funding cuts and their impact on disease research. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the committee's top Democrat of standing by as chronic disease spiked in the country after Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, asked who made the decision to fire or push out thousands of workers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). What to know about Phelps' case: Natalie Phelps has stage IV colorectal cancer and she has expressed concerns that her treatment will be delayed after NIH staffing cuts. CNN previously reported that Phelps was accepted into the trial last month, but her tumor needed to grow before she could begin treatment. Capito, the subcommittee's top Republican, also expressed apprehension about NIH funding cuts. “I'm concerned that our science, our country, is falling behind in my biomedical research,” she said at the start of the hearing, adding that NIH-funded basic research is behind buprenorphine and naloxone nasal spray, which are used to combat the opioid epidemic, new Alzheimer's drugs and hundreds of novel cancer treatments. While she acknowledged that “wasteful spending of taxpayers dollars must end, she also urged that the funding appropriated by Congress for fiscal year 2025 should be “spent in a timely manner, in particular for the vital biomedical research which could lead to life saving breakthroughs in science.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier today for the first time since his confirmation hearing and he defended his overhaul of the State Department amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding. He is now testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee and is expected to testify before House committees over the next days as well. Here's what else Rubio has told the Senate committees so far : This post has been updated with Rubio's testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee. It will include nearly 7,000 soldiers, 370 vehicles and 70 aircraft, according to a document reviewed by CNN. He's also set to deliver remarks and participate in an enlistment event as part of the pomp and circumstance Trump has been eager to put on display. Nearly 7,000 soldiers will march the parade route alongside 370 vehicles, including both historic and modern-day machinery, according to a document seen by CNN. The parade will showcase vehicles, machinery and uniforms from every war. “Our great new CFO went through the ‘24 and ‘25 budgets of the Kennedy Center and found $26 million in phantom revenue, fake revenue. We're going to refer this to the US attorney's office here,” Grenell said during a Kennedy Center board dinner at the White House that President Donald Trump and other board members attended. CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center for comment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the continued involvement of the United States in peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia was “important,” as he voiced his country's commitment to further direct talks with the Kremlin. It is important that America continues to be a participant in the peace-making process,” Zelensky said following yesterday's call between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. It is American influence that can save many lives if it influences Putin for the sake of ending the war,” Zelensky said. Following his two-hour call with Putin, Trump said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.” The Ukrainian president added that discussions were underway regarding future direct talks between Ukraine and Russia. “We continue to work at various levels with the United States on sanctions. Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky found themselves in a familiar position earlier today as the commander-in-chief met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill: opposing each other. Walking into his closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Trump singled out Massie directly, who opposes the president's legislative agenda. I think he's a grandstander, frankly,” Trump said ahead of the meeting. I think he should be voted out of office.” Massie is comfortable being the lone no vote against Trump, and he has staked out a rare position in the Republican Party where he finds his most consistent company to be his state's senator, GOP Sen. Rand Paul. And they probably have the votes anyway to pass it. President Donald Trump had a blunt message for Republicans during his meeting with the House GOP conference this morning: Stop negotiating and move ahead with his massive domestic policy bill, according to sources in the room. It was a message directed to the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of Northeastern lawmakers who are making demands to change the bill. Trump also had an exchange with GOP New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who made his case for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, according to a source in room. Trump's message: Time to stop haggling and move ahead with vote. Elon Musk on Tuesday said he would spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward – potentially signaling a retreat on the part of President Donald Trump's largest campaign benefactor and one of the most controversial figures to emerge in his administration. But Musk also left the door open to changing his mind, adding: “If I see a reason do political spending in the future, I will do it.” Musk, the world's richest man, spent more than $290 million in the 2024 campaign to help elect Trump and Republicans to Congress and previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump, CNN and other outlets have reported. It's not clear whether the Tesla CEO's remarks signal any change in that financial pledge. A Musk political aide on Tuesday declined to comment. More context: Musk's prominent role in slashing federal spending through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency has made him a prominent political target for Democrats, who made him the centerpiece of their winning strategy in last month's election for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. Musk has begun to pull back from his once-prominent role in the administration. In the at-times contentious interview Tuesday, Musk insisted that his position in government does not pose a conflict of interest with his varied business interests. President Donald Trump told House Republicans directly this morning to not let the debate over state and local taxes, known as SALT, impede the passage of his legislative agenda, according to a senior White House official. Trump told reporters after the meeting that he never said he was “losing patience” and that it was a “meeting of love.” But several holdouts indicated after the meeting that they still weren't sold on the massive tax bill. : It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes. It's unclear if President Donald Trump was able to move the needle with key Republican hardliners who are currently opposed to approving his sweeping legislative agenda. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris poured cold water on the idea that  Trump moved the needle in convincing him and other hardliners to soften their positions. “No, we are still a ways away, but we can get there,” said Harris, who has called for more time to work through the negotiations. Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, who like other hardliners want more time with the bill, told CNN he wasn't sure if Trump changed his mind to vote this week. “He's comfortable with every faction that exists within our conference,” Higgins said. He made it pretty clear we need to quit screwing around.” South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said Trump did a “great job” in his meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, but did not yet commit to voting for the bill. This post has been updated with additional comments from GOP lawmakers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said habeas corpus “is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” – misstating the legal principle that President Donald Trump is considering suspending to accelerate deportations. During a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Noem was asked by Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept. Hassan cut her off: “Excuse me, that's incorrect.” She explained it's a legal principle that requires the government to provide a reason for detaining people. It allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court. Meanwhile with regards to a DHS reality show, Noem said there are “no plans whatsoever” for her agency to participate in one. President Donald Trump warned Republican lawmakers not to touch Medicaid except for waste fraud and abuse during today's meeting, according to two sources. His comments come as questions have been raised over how many Americans would lose access to Medicaid benefits under Republicans' proposed package. Trump didn't sound particularly warm to fighting for state and local taxes (SALT), the source said. GOP Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said Trump was “very serious” about the state and local tax deduction — a key sticking point in talks on his agenda bill. But President Trump is very firm on this bill passing and being a good product,” she said. Asked whether holdouts on the bill got the president's message, Boebert said: “President Trump is speaking directly to many people individually.” Trump is meeting with House GOP members as key conservatives remain opposed to approving his sweeping tax and spending bill. This post has been updated with comments from Boebert. President Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that Republicans are “tremendously unified” despite party infighting over his sweeping budget and tax cuts bill. I don't think we've ever had a party like this. There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're not going to get,” Trump said arriving on Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican conference. He praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate GOP leader John Thune, adding that “we're a very unified party.” “And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to be – It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,” Trump said. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. Before going behind closed doors to meet with the House Republican conference, Trump told reporters: “This is really just a pep talk.” The president acknowledged his tax and spending cuts bill would be amended but that it would move forward as GOP leadership plans to bring it to a vote in the House this week. This post has been updated with more of Trump's remarks. Conservative hardliner Rep. Thomas Massie called the White House's insistence that President Donald Trump's major policy bill would not raise the US deficit “a joke.” That's a joke,” the Kentucky Republican told CNN while heading into the House GOP meeting that Trump is scheduled to attend. He's the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] director. I mean, over here, the people in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add $20 trillion to debt over the next 10 years, which is $3.5 to $5 trillion more than would have been added otherwise,” he said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that the sweeping bill aimed to advance Trump's legislative agenda “does not add to the deficit” — despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise. Asked if he's concerned about pressure on him to support the bill as it currently stands, Massie told CNN: “They wrote off my vote weeks ago.” House GOP leaders are hoping to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” later this week and send it over to the Senate. Speaker Mike Johnson has been engaging in last-ditch negotiations over several unresolved issues involving Medicaid, green energy tax credits and the state and local tax deduction. Here are key things to know about what is in the bill: What's more, it would fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce plan, which contains contentious cuts to Medicaid, would reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis. • Republicans are aiming to make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation's outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans. • Overall, the House is looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the legislation's sweeping tax breaks and investments in defense and immigration control. Read more about what is in the House GOP package. President Donald Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will meet with House Republicans Tuesday as they negotiate his sweeping tax and spending cuts package. This marks the sixth time that Trump has been on Capitol Hill this year for various engagements including a meeting with Republican senators during the transition period, his indoor Inauguration ceremony, the National Prayer Breakfast, Friends of Ireland luncheon and delivering an address to a joint session of Congress. Trump's motorcade departed from the North Lawn, without an opportunity for press to shout questions. Although he was unanimously confirmed as top US diplomat, some Democrats have since expressed regret and disappointment at Rubio's foreign policy stances as well as his overseeing of the destruction of the US Agency for International Development and sweeping changes at the State Department. According to his prepared opening statement, Rubio plans to argue that a proposed budget of $28.5 billion “will allow the Department to fulfill its mission while also proposing the rescission of $20 billion in duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs.” Such a proposal is tens of billions of dollars lower than past State Department budgets. “A core principle of this reorganization is the belief that what matters is not the size of budgets but the agility with which they can be deployed,” he will say, according to his prepared remarks. The top US diplomat will claim that the State Department has “found billions” in foreign aid awards “diverted to ideological causes, including climate activism, diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ initiatives in foreign nations.” As he has done in the past, he will applaud “the world's most talented diplomatic workforce,” but plans to say that “they deserve better.” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that President Donald Trump will call on House Republicans “to get in line” to pass his legislative agenda this morning. Johnson said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who was on his way to Capitol Hill we've been working on reconciliation for more than a year, as you all know, and it all comes down to these details,” Johnson said. “And I think the president is going to encourage everyone this morning to get in line and get the votes done. We need to deliver this to the American people, the America first agenda is all wrapped up in one big bill, and we're really excited to deliver it this morning so we're delighted.” Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Trump is “always the closer,” and the president wanted to come speak with everyone on Capitol Hill again. Scalise Pushed back on Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris' previous suggestion that Republicans delay debate on the current draft of the legislative bill further, saying GOP leadership's plan is still to hold a full House vote Wednesday or Thursday. This post has been updated with reporting on Scalise's remarks. As President Donald Trump trades the Oval Office for the halls of Congress today, his main priority is to urge his party to stop squabbling and make progress on moving a major piece of legislation that contains his core promises from the campaign trail, White House officials tell CNN. His campaign-driven goals to deliver sweeping tax cuts and no tax on tips and overtime pay are what Trump cares most about — the rest is simply negotiating to the finish line. With a slim majority in the House leaving little room for detractors, his attempt to do so will be a major test of his dealmaking abilities. “The White House isn't freaking out yet,” one person close to Trump told CNN. He and the team understand that pushing through a bill of this size is going to take time. House Speaker Mike Johnson did not come to a resolution with members of the SALT (state and local tax) caucus last night, but members were promised more data in the morning and that talks will continue. Not a final resolution yet but I think we are getting close,” Johnson told reporters following the roughly one-hour meeting late Monday evening. Following the meeting, New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino said leadership presented lawmakers with “proposals” to consider but they are seeking additional clarity and data. “The speaker is doing everything he can to get us to yes and I think everybody in that room really appreciates the meeting.” Republican leadership is targeting a Wednesday or Thursday floor vote. : It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes. It's the third known time the two leaders spoke since Trump was inaugurated in January and comes as he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Russian president's refusal to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. Here's what we know about developments after the Trump-Putin call: What Putin said: The Russian president said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” and thanked him for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” according to Russia state news agency TASS. Putin also said Trump “expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace.” The two leaders did not discuss a timeframe for talks, a Kremlin spokesperson said. What Trump said: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump announced on Truth Social after his call. Trump informs allies: Trump also said on Truth Social that after his call with Putin ended, he immediately informed the following leaders about the contents of the call after it ended: Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb. US-Russia prisoner swap: Putin and Trump also discussed a US-Russia prisoner swap, involving nine people for nine others, Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said. On the ground: Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching attack drones on one another overnight, hours after Putin spoke by phone with Trump. What to know: House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted a request from Republican Maine state lawmaker Laurel Libby to restore her voting power for the next legislative session after she was censured earlier this year for expressing opposition to transgender athletes competing in girls sports in a controversial post on X. Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented. Libby was censured in February by a Democratic-controlled Maine House after she posted on social media about a Maine high school girls' indoor track and field state championship, where the transgender student who won first place in girls' pole vault had competed in the boys' division the previous year. Libby is an outspoken critic on the issue of allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports. Last month, she joined Attorney General Pam Bondi at a press conference where Bondi announced that the Justice Department would be suing Maine for refusing to comply with President Donald Trump's ban on transgender athletes in high school sports. In a scathing dissent Tuesday, Jackson argued that the decision to intervene in cases where there was not apparent emergency was “both in­equitable and unwise.” Libby had not “asserted that there are any sig­nificant legislative votes scheduled in the upcoming weeks; that there are any upcoming votes in which Libby's partici­pation would impact the outcome; or that they will other­wise suffer any concrete, imminent, and significant harm while the lower court considers this matter,” Jackson wrote. Jackson said she was concerned by the fact that the high court was intervening on an emergency basis despite there being no clear indication that Libby would miss any votes before the censure was reviewed by lower courts. “Not very long ago, this court treaded carefully with re­spect to exercising its equitable power to issue injunctive relief at the request of a party claiming an emergency,” Jackson said, asserting that justices often declined to intervene in such cases absent “the most critical and exigent circumstances.” “Today's court,” Jackson wrote, “barely pauses to acknowledge” what she described as “important threshold limitations on the exercise of its own authority.” This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blue-state House Republicans seeking a higher state and local tax cap emerged from the House Republican conference meeting without moving an inch on their opposition. Several House Freedom Caucus members, who have urged deeper cuts into Medicaid spending, also left the meeting as holdouts. Trump specifically pointed to Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) in the meeting, telling him, “I know your district better than you do. Lawler and fellow New York Rep. Nick LaLota (R) were unconvinced by Trump's speech. Lawler said he's still a “no” on the reconciliation bill, which calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks. I'm one of only three Republican members that won in a district [former Vice President] Kamala Harris won, and I did so for reasons,” Lawler said. He said on Monday that the GOP wouldn't have the majority “if you didn't have members in seats like mine.” “And so if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease [the Freedom Caucus], it's not happening,” Lawler added. He thinks the president is still on board to “do right by middle class Americans,” despite Trump seeming to soften on SALT. “We don't want to benefit Democrat governors,” the president said. LaLota interpreted the president's message on SALT as “figure it out.” And I hope the president's presence motivates my leadership to give us a number that we can go sell back at home … All they need from this town is [a] little salt. SALT Republicans are meeting with Johnson at 2 p.m., per Punchbowl News. The President is clear: he wants EVERY Republican to vote yes.” Dusty Johnson (R-SD) said that Trump was the “most animated” he's seen on policy. Trump denied he was losing patience with House Republicans, calling it a “meeting of love.” “I didn't even talk about that — in fact, it's the opposite. I'm not losing patience, we're ahead of schedule … Why don't you go back to your source and tell them they're liars, if the source even exists,” Trump said. “Don't f*** around with Medicaid,” Trump said simply. Centrists such as Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who had expressed concerns about reforms to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, were pleased with Trump's messaging on the beneficiary program. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) said he's not 100% satisfied with the bill and told reporters leaving Tuesday's meeting with Trump that he thought the president did a “great job.” Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) is also unmoved by Trump's plea for unity, adding that he doesn't think the president has secured enough votes to pass the legislation. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), former chairman of the HFC, told reporters he was still a no on the current deal, but said he is “looking through it.” “I think that there's some things that we could move easily to make it more comfortable for a lot of people like myself,” Burlison said. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who has an icy relationship with Trump due to his frequent opposition to Republican-backed spending bills, is still a “hard no” on the bill. However, he said he thinks Trump was able to convince the Freedom Caucus and SALT Caucus folks to “give up their fights.”“I predict they get the bill passed,” Massie said. Trump hasn't had very kind words to say about Massie lately. It's just not — doesn't change the facts,” Massie added. Some Republicans are pleased with what they heard, but understand it will take more than an impassioned speech from Trump. “I think you get the sort of vibe that everybody's, you know, ‘rah, rah,' and we're together, and then everybody walks out of the room,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford (R-AK) told reporters. Both Norman and Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), who have said they are not pleased with the legislation as it stands, sit on the committee. Harris and Roy have said they think it would be best to postpone the Rules vote, as more work must be done. “But let's be clear, there are still very strong outstanding questions, and I think there are people across the entire conference who recognize that, and it is a mistake for this important of a policy to jam it through.” Johnson, however, is in high spirits after the meeting with Trump and is moving full steam ahead with pushing for a floor vote as soon as Wednesday evening. At a press conference following lawmakers' meeting with Trump, he said there was “high energy and high excitement” inside the conference room. He said, “Failure is not an option,” and expressed confidence that Republicans could pass the legislation this week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• On the stand: Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, is testifying in the federal sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs. • Earlier testimony: Earlier today, Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, testified about threats she said Combs made against her and her daughter. Over four days last week, Cassie Ventura — who dated Combs and is one of his accusers — testified that she endured physical and sexual abuse from him and detailed how Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.” If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Hayes said he always met them at a hotel in New York City. When the jury comes back, Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, will continue testifying. The jury is in day seven of Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial. Here's a recap of what witnesses said on the stand: Male escort Sharay Hayes will continue testifying after the break. Sharay Hayes, testifying about his first interaction with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy Combs” at Trump International Hotel in New York City, said he didn't know the man in the room was Combs. On another occasion when he joined Combs and Ventura at a hotel, Hayes testified, the TV displayed a message: “The Essex House would like to welcome Mr. Sean Combs.” Hayes said he was a fan of Combs and already followed him on social media at the time. Hayes joined the couple for similar interactions about eight to 12 times in total, he testified. Testifying more about the first encounter he had with Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura, Sharay Hayes said he followed Ventura's lead and “mimicked” what she did. Hayes said that when Ventura began to pour baby oil on herself, he did too. Sharay Hayes continued describing his first encounter with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs, at Trump International Hotel in New York City: Ventura told him to ignore her husband, Hayes said. “I was specifically told to not acknowledge her husband, try not to look at him, no communication or anything,” he testified. After explaining the situation, Ventura handed him “a stack of cash” and said he could change into underwear or a towel in the bathroom. Sharay Hayes testified that he met Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura sometime in the fall of 2012. She said it was her birthday and her husband said she could hire an exotic dancer for the occassion. Hayes said he met Combs and Ventura at Trump International Hotel in New York City that first time. “I don't have any questions for you,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said after greeting her. Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, said she visited Cassie and Combs in LA in August 2016 for her daughter's 30th birthday. One of Combs' security guards was standing between them, she said. “I was yelling, screaming, and trying to hit him,” she said, but said that she was not able to hit him. Regina Ventura said Combs eventually gave her the phone, but then he took Cassie's car. “She was bruised, and I wanted to make sure that we memorialized it,” Regina Ventura said. These photos were first admitted into evidence during Cassie Ventura's testimony Regina Ventura, the mother of Cassie Ventura, said Sean “Diddy” Combs contacted her around the same time Cassie Ventura told her Combs threatened to release sexually explicit videos of her. Regina Ventura said she and her husband took a home equity loan to obtain the $20,000 for Combs. Combs' bookkeeper sent Regina Ventura an email with wiring instructions she said, so she went to the credit union and then wired the money from her and her husband's account to the Bad Boy account. Regina Ventura said did it because she was “scared about my daughter's safety.” She said about four or five days later, the money was returned to her account, but she did not have any communications with Combs about it. Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, testified that her daughter emailed her in December 2011 to say Sean “Diddy” Combs was threatening to release explicit sex tapes of Cassie. This appears to mesh with Cassie Ventura's earlier testimony that Combs threatened Cassie in December 2011 when he learned she was dating Scott Mescudi, also known as rapper Kid Cudi. The email said, according to Regina Ventura: “The threats that have been made towards me by Sean ‘Puffy' Combs are that are that he is going to release 2 explicit sex tapes of me. The email also was sent to one of Combs' employees, Regina Ventura said. I did not know the other person, but knew that he was going to try to hurt my daughter,” Regina Ventura said. Remember: This is what Cassie Ventura said last week about the threat: “He (Combs) told me about videos that he had that he was going to release, and that he was going to hurt Scott and I,” she said, adding the videos he was referring to were of sexual performances called “Freak Offs.” Cassie Ventura also testified Combs told her Kid Cudi's car would be blown up in his driveway before it happened. Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who took the stand late this morning, may help prosecutors make the argument that her daughter was coerced and can speak to Cassie Ventura's state of mind, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN's Kate Bolduan Tuesday. “I think they're going to get to any behavioral differences as it relates to Cassie's behavior when she got into the relationship” with Sean “Diddy” Combs “versus ongoing and ending the relationship. It speaks to her real state of mind,” Jackson said. “Because this issue of coercion is a big battleground. Prosecutors have also said Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011 Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo argued she should not be allowed to say that in court as it could be prejudicial to Combs, but Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up, and he'd deal with it then. Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Regina Ventura to identify Sean “Diddy” Combs in a photo and explain how she knew him. Regina Ventura said she first met Combs in 2006 when her daughter, Cassie Ventura, signed with Combs' record label, Bad Boy Records. Regina Ventura said when her daughter and Combs started dating in New York City, she'd see her daughter about three or four times a year. When Cassie Ventura moved to California with Combs, Regina Ventura said she saw her less frequently, usually around the holidays. The jury is coming back in now and court proceedings are resuming. Prosecutor Emily Johnson is questioning Regina Ventura for the government. On redirect examination, David James testified that Combs once asked him to falsely report to police about an altercation between Combs and the music mogul's then-chef in Combs' house in Alpine, New Jersey. James said he didn't want to make a false report to police, so he drove around New Jersey for a while. This is the same chef – a woman – that James had testified that he, himself, had been in an altercation with in Florida. James testified that Combs told him, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is done cross-examining David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs. On cross-examination, Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo returned to David James' testimony that he overheard Sean “Diddy” Combs tell a business associate that Cassie Ventura was “moldable” and that he had her “right where I want her, she's young.” James said this conversation occurred “very early on” in Combs' and Ventura's relationship. He said that Kim Porter, the mother of several of Combs' children, had recently moved to LA, and Combs had been spending more time there. During the cross-examination of David James, the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs talked of a time he was in an altercation with one of Combs' chefs, and about how Combs confronted him about it. When asked by defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, James acknowledged that he got into an altercation with one of Combs' then-chefs, a woman, at Combs' Star Island home in Florida. When he told Combs what had happened, Combs told James, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again, James testified. James did so, and she eventually forgave him, he testified. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James to confirm that he never told Sean “Diddy” Combs before or after he procured cocaine for Combs' friend while they were on a yacht in Saint-Tropez. Agnifilo suggested Combs wasn't involved at all in the situation and James fulfilled the request because he wanted to. David James testified that there was camaraderie among Sean “Diddy” Combs' staff and that they would often say Comb's record label, Bad Boy Records, was a family. James confirmed that he felt a sense of mission working for Combs, and defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked what that mission was. “To make sure that he was happy and prepared for the day,” James responded. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo has followed up on David James' earlier testimony that Sean “Diddy” Combs typically had a “rider” that listed preferred items that should be in a location before Combs arrived. Heinz ketchup, for example, was always on the list, James said. Earlier today: James talked of other items he'd lay out before Combs' arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security for reimbursement. James had testified yesterday that part of his job was to prepare hotel rooms for Combs with a list of items, and to “get every environment comfortable.” David ﻿James, a former assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testfiied that when he purchased “personal items,” including condoms, baby oil, and personal lubricant, for Combs, he would ask the security for cash from Combs' bag. James said he was instructed not to submit these items for reimbursement through the company because they were “items he didn't want to have a record for.” Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked James to confirm that meant the company didn't pay for these items. David James testified that one of Sean “Diddy” Combs' assistants had to go to the hospital for dehydration after working with Combs for 24 hours straight. He testified there was a common saying among Combs' security guards: “You know what rhymes with tired? David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is an important prosecution witness for his ability to tell jurors what it was like in the music mogul's inner circle, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. “Remember about the overall charges, you're looking at RICO,” continued Jackson. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, is used to describe 35 offenses, including kidnapping, murder, bribery, arson and extortion. “So what prosecutors are doing is getting to this bad behavior, not just to dirty Diddy up, which they're doing effectively,” Jackson said. I can't get out,” Ventura told him, according to James. The defense obviously vehemently objects to that, denies it.” Over four days last week, Ventura testified she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated the “Freak Offs.” David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he typically rode in a second car to accompany Combs wherever he went. James said there was usually a second car traveling with Combs for security reasons. Combs' security personnel typically operated a second car to the right of the vehicle transporting Combs to prevent anyone from “pulling up on him” and potentially assassinating him, James said. When Sean “Diddy” Combs would go out in public, people would be “almost in a mob around him,” asking for autographs and trying to meet him, Combs' former assistant David James said. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked if Combs tended to be gracious in these situations. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo suggested repeatedly that David James actually left D-Roc, one of Sean “Diddy” Combs security guards, at the restaurant and he went back with Combs to get him. James denied this each time, testifying that it wouldn't have made sense to leave him there with Suge Knight outside, wielding a gun. James had testified yesterday he traveled extensively with the music mogul, including internationally. “I just respect Mr. Combs from a business perspective,” James said. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James if he was granted immunity for his testimony. James said he wasn't sure of the details that were brokered by his attorney, but he believes he signed a proffer agreement, a type agreement that gives a person some protection from prosecution. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo referenced documents from David James' meetings with the government, highlighting one where his account of the Mel's Diner event ended before he returned to Combs' home. He said the government had instructed him not to say anything that could incriminate himself. Agnifilo asked James whether he spoke up at any point when Combs was allegedly telling him to get back in the car to return to Mel's Diner or when Combs was sitting in the back seat with three guns. James said, “Respectfully Sir, you have someone with three guns in this close proximity, I didn't think I had the option to say something.” Agnifilo also grilled James about his conversations with prosecutors Tuesday morning before he took the stand again, asking if James was prepped on how to handle the Mel's Diner incident. James said they mentioned Agnifilo's style, garnering laughs in the courtroom. David James testified about an occasion when he went with Combs' security guard to a diner to get food for Combs and the staff. When they got there, the security guard saw Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight and approached him. They talked briefly before the guard and James went inside to order. Knight was gone when they got back to the restaurant, James said. James said he was “shook up” by the incident. James said he gave his notice soon after the incident, offering to stay with Combs for six more months to train a replacement. The prosecution's direct questioning of David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, has finished. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is now questioning James on cross-examination. David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified about an incident when one of Combs' Cartier bracelets went missing, prompting his security to search through all of his and his then-girlfriend's belongings. On two other occasions when Combs' possessions went missing, James had to take a lie detector test administered by a man who claimed to have formerly worked for the FBI, he testified. On both occasions, James' results showed no discrepancies, he said. James said one of Combs' security agents told him that another former employee, Capricorn Clark, also had to take a lie detector test previously. David James, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former assistant, is detailing several occasions where he said he supplied Combs' friends with drugs. On a trip with Combs to Saint-Tropez, a friend of Combs texted James asking him to get cocaine, he testified. James said he arranged for the cocaine for Combs' friend, but said Combs didn't ask him to do it. On another occasion, during a party in Los Angeles, James recalled how Combs sent him back to the house to get ecstasy for a friend. David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he saw Combs take drugs and give them to his friends. On a couple occasions, James procured drugs for Combs' friends, he testified. A person called “One Stop” often brought drugs to Combs, James said. James understood Combs often took Percocet while he was operating his businesses, and preferred to take ecstasy at night, he said. David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that occasionally, Combs would ask him to bring certain items — usually an iPod or food — to his hotel rooms while he was staying there. James said it took him about an hour to get there, and when he knocked on the door, nobody answered. He entered the room with his own key and saw Cassie Ventura lying on her back in the hotel room with a white comforter up to her neck. “She did not move when I entered the room,” he testified. James mentioned that he did not speak with Combs or Ventura about the incident afterward because it wasn't his job to discuss their personal affairs. James said he would set up things for Combs' before is arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. James said he would often replenish items for Combs during trips. If he was restocking food and drinks, James said he would pay for them and get reimbursed by Bad Boy Entertainment. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security to be reimbursed from the cash in Combs' bag. David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he was on the computer at Combs' home one night when Combs was out at a club with Cassie Ventura, another assistant, and security. “As soon as he entered the door, he bee-lined straight for me” and pulled up the computer's search history, James said. Combs told him that someone had written a blog post “lying” about him hitting Ventura, and he wanted to see if James had written it, the former assistant testified. James said he did not see Ventura that night, but two days later, Combs directed him to bring her food at a nearby hotel. When James brought the food to her hotel room, he was “surprised” to see a member of Combs' staff answer the door instead of Ventura herself. She stayed at the hotel for about a week, he testified. David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he did not personally observe physical violence between Combs and Cassie Ventura, but heard them argue about her career more than once. In those arguments, she would express a desire to branch out more into modeling and acting, but Combs would tell her she had to focus on her music career, James testified. Ventura had testified she signed a contract with Combs' company, Bad Boy Records, in early 2006; the pair first began dating around 2007 and split in 2018. He described Kim Porter – who shared three children with Combs – as Combs' “main girlfriend,” and then listed four other women, including Ventura, who were his “other girlfriends.” David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand. Sean “Diddy” Combs' sister is in court today. His children and mother — who have been inside the courtroom on other days — are not yet there today. Like yesterday, it appears the start of testimony this morning will be delayed because not all jurors are are there. Four jurors are not yet there, a courtroom deputy said. Yesterday, proceedings were delayed because a juror was running late. When proceedings do resume: David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, is expected to resume testimony that he started yesterday. James is the first of Combs' former assistants to testify in Combs' racketeering and sex trafficking trial, and the seventh witness to be called by prosecutors so far. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are debating upcoming testimony from David James, who will continue testifying this morning, and Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who's expected to take the stand later today. Prosecutors argue Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. The money demand came within days of Combs allegedly threatening Cassie Ventura and Kid Cudi and threatening to release sexually explicit videos of her. Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. The money was wired back to her without explanation days later. Prosecutors say the jury should hear this evidence they say speaks to the coercive control Combs held over Casandra Ventura. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo also noted Combs gave the money back. Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up during Regina Ventura's testimony later today and he'd deal with it then. The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering and sex-trafficking trial heard testimony from three witnesses yesterday. Dawn Richard, a former member of the musical group Danity Kane:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Battle over Trump's agenda: President Donald Trump expressed confidence after meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning as he made a personal pitch for passing his sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. • Top administration officials testify: Several Cabinet secretaries are in the hot seat on Capitol Hill today — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — as they defend their agencies' budgets in front of respective committees. • Ukraine war talks: Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war in Ukraine. His remarks come a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today for the first time since his confirmation hearing and he defended his overhaul of the State Department amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding. Here's what else Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations committee: It is important that America continues to be a participant in the peace-making process,” Zelensky said following yesterday's call between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. It is American influence that can save many lives if it influences Putin for the sake of ending the war,” Zelensky said. Following his two-hour call with Putin, Trump said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.” The Ukrainian president added that discussions were underway regarding future direct talks between Ukraine and Russia. “We continue to work at various levels with the United States on sanctions. Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky found themselves in a familiar position earlier today as the commander-in-chief met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill: opposing each other. Walking into his closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Trump singled out Massie directly, who opposes the president's legislative agenda. I think he's a grandstander, frankly,” Trump said ahead of the meeting. I think he should be voted out of office.” Massie is comfortable being the lone no vote against Trump, and he has staked out a rare position in the Republican Party where he finds his most consistent company to be his state's senator, GOP Sen. Rand Paul. And they probably have the votes anyway to pass it. President Donald Trump had a blunt message for Republicans during his meeting with the House GOP conference this morning: Stop negotiating and move ahead with his massive domestic policy bill, according to sources in the room. It was a message directed to the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of Northeastern lawmakers who are making demands to change the bill. Trump also had an exchange with GOP New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who made his case for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, according to a source in room. Trump's message: Time to stop haggling and move ahead with vote. Elon Musk on Tuesday said he would spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward – potentially signaling a retreat on the part of President Donald Trump's largest campaign benefactor and one of the most controversial figures to emerge in his administration. But Musk also left the door open to changing his mind, adding: “If I see a reason do political spending in the future, I will do it.” Musk, the world's richest man, spent more than $290 million in the 2024 campaign to help elect Trump and Republicans to Congress and previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump, CNN and other outlets have reported. It's not clear whether the Tesla CEO's remarks signal any change in that financial pledge. A Musk political aide on Tuesday declined to comment. More context: Musk's prominent role in slashing federal spending through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency has made him a prominent political target for Democrats, who made him the centerpiece of their winning strategy in last month's election for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. Musk has begun to pull back from his once-prominent role in the administration. In the at-times contentious interview Tuesday, Musk insisted that his position in government does not pose a conflict of interest with his varied business interests. President Donald Trump told House Republicans directly this morning to not let the debate over state and local taxes, known as SALT, impede the passage of his legislative agenda, according to a senior White House official. Trump told reporters after the meeting that he never said he was “losing patience” and that it was a “meeting of love.” But several holdouts indicated after the meeting that they still weren't sold on the massive tax bill. : It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes. It's unclear if President Donald Trump was able to move the needle with key Republican hardliners who are currently opposed to approving his sweeping legislative agenda. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris poured cold water on the idea that  Trump moved the needle in convincing him and other hardliners to soften their positions. “No, we are still a ways away, but we can get there,” said Harris, who has called for more time to work through the negotiations. Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, who like other hardliners want more time with the bill, told CNN he wasn't sure if Trump changed his mind to vote this week. “He's comfortable with every faction that exists within our conference,” Higgins said. He made it pretty clear we need to quit screwing around.” South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said Trump did a “great job” in his meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, but did not yet commit to voting for the bill. This post has been updated with additional comments from GOP lawmakers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said habeas corpus “is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” – misstating the legal principle that President Donald Trump is considering suspending to accelerate deportations. During a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Noem was asked by Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept. Hassan cut her off: “Excuse me, that's incorrect.” She explained it's a legal principle that requires the government to provide a reason for detaining people. It allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court. President Donald Trump warned Republican lawmakers not to touch Medicaid except for waste fraud and abuse during today's meeting, according to two sources. His comments come as questions have been raised over how many Americans would lose access to Medicaid benefits under Republicans' proposed package. Trump didn't sound particularly warm to fighting for state and local taxes (SALT), the source said. GOP Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said Trump was “very serious” about the state and local tax deduction — a key sticking point in talks on his agenda bill. But President Trump is very firm on this bill passing and being a good product,” she said. Trump is meeting with House GOP members as key conservatives remain opposed to approving his sweeping tax and spending bill. This post has been updated with comments from Boebert. President Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that Republicans are “tremendously unified” despite party infighting over his sweeping budget and tax cuts bill. I don't think we've ever had a party like this. There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're not going to get,” Trump said arriving on Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican conference. He praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate GOP leader John Thune, adding that “we're a very unified party.” “And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to be – It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,” Trump said. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. Before going behind closed doors to meet with the House Republican conference, Trump told reporters: “This is really just a pep talk.” The president acknowledged his tax and spending cuts bill would be amended but that it would move forward as GOP leadership plans to bring it to a vote in the House this week. This post has been updated with more of Trump's remarks. Conservative hardliner Rep. Thomas Massie called the White House's insistence that President Donald Trump's major policy bill would not raise the US deficit “a joke.” I mean, over here, the people in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add $20 trillion to debt over the next 10 years, which is $3.5 to $5 trillion more than would have been added otherwise,” he said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that the sweeping bill aimed to advance Trump's legislative agenda “does not add to the deficit” — despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise. Asked if he's concerned about pressure on him to support the bill as it currently stands, Massie told CNN: “They wrote off my vote weeks ago.” House GOP leaders are hoping to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” later this week and send it over to the Senate. Speaker Mike Johnson has been engaging in last-ditch negotiations over several unresolved issues involving Medicaid, green energy tax credits and the state and local tax deduction. Here are key things to know about what is in the bill: What's more, it would fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce plan, which contains contentious cuts to Medicaid, would reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis. • Republicans are aiming to make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation's outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans. • Overall, the House is looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the legislation's sweeping tax breaks and investments in defense and immigration control. Read more about what is in the House GOP package. President Donald Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will meet with House Republicans Tuesday as they negotiate his sweeping tax and spending cuts package. This marks the sixth time that Trump has been on Capitol Hill this year for various engagements including a meeting with Republican senators during the transition period, his indoor Inauguration ceremony, the National Prayer Breakfast, Friends of Ireland luncheon and delivering an address to a joint session of Congress. Trump's motorcade departed from the North Lawn, without an opportunity for press to shout questions. Although he was unanimously confirmed as top US diplomat, some Democrats have since expressed regret and disappointment at Rubio's foreign policy stances as well as his overseeing of the destruction of the US Agency for International Development and sweeping changes at the State Department. According to his prepared opening statement, Rubio plans to argue that a proposed budget of $28.5 billion “will allow the Department to fulfill its mission while also proposing the rescission of $20 billion in duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs.” Such a proposal is tens of billions of dollars lower than past State Department budgets. The top US diplomat will claim that the State Department has “found billions” in foreign aid awards “diverted to ideological causes, including climate activism, diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ initiatives in foreign nations.” As he has done in the past, he will applaud “the world's most talented diplomatic workforce,” but plans to say that “they deserve better.” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that President Donald Trump will call on House Republicans “to get in line” to pass his legislative agenda this morning. Johnson said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who was on his way to Capitol Hill we've been working on reconciliation for more than a year, as you all know, and it all comes down to these details,” Johnson said. “And I think the president is going to encourage everyone this morning to get in line and get the votes done. Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Trump is “always the closer,” and the president wanted to come speak with everyone on Capitol Hill again. Scalise Pushed back on Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris' previous suggestion that Republicans delay debate on the current draft of the legislative bill further, saying GOP leadership's plan is still to hold a full House vote Wednesday or Thursday. This post has been updated with reporting on Scalise's remarks. As President Donald Trump trades the Oval Office for the halls of Congress today, his main priority is to urge his party to stop squabbling and make progress on moving a major piece of legislation that contains his core promises from the campaign trail, White House officials tell CNN. His campaign-driven goals to deliver sweeping tax cuts and no tax on tips and overtime pay are what Trump cares most about — the rest is simply negotiating to the finish line. With a slim majority in the House leaving little room for detractors, his attempt to do so will be a major test of his dealmaking abilities. “The White House isn't freaking out yet,” one person close to Trump told CNN. He and the team understand that pushing through a bill of this size is going to take time. House Speaker Mike Johnson did not come to a resolution with members of the SALT (state and local tax) caucus last night, but members were promised more data in the morning and that talks will continue. Not a final resolution yet but I think we are getting close,” Johnson told reporters following the roughly one-hour meeting late Monday evening. Following the meeting, New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino said leadership presented lawmakers with “proposals” to consider but they are seeking additional clarity and data. “The speaker is doing everything he can to get us to yes and I think everybody in that room really appreciates the meeting.” Republican leadership is targeting a Wednesday or Thursday floor vote. : It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes. Here's what we know about developments after the Trump-Putin call: What Putin said: The Russian president said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” and thanked him for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” according to Russia state news agency TASS. Putin also said Trump “expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace.” The two leaders did not discuss a timeframe for talks, a Kremlin spokesperson said. What Trump said: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump announced on Truth Social after his call. Trump informs allies: Trump also said on Truth Social that after his call with Putin ended, he immediately informed the following leaders about the contents of the call after it ended: Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb. US-Russia prisoner swap: Putin and Trump also discussed a US-Russia prisoner swap, involving nine people for nine others, Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said. On the ground: Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching attack drones on one another overnight, hours after Putin spoke by phone with Trump. What to know: House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.</p>

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump administration has helped launch the first-ever U.S. mine for a critical mineral largely dominated by China, which controls about half of global production, Fox News Digital has learned. Antimony has a myriad of national security uses – including in military tools like night-vision goggles, explosives, flame-retardants, tracers, lasers, nuclear weapons production, military clothing and ammunition. It also plays a role in the bloodless AI arms race, as a component in semiconductors and infrared technology, as well as its use increasing the hardness of alloys like lead and copper. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet military personnel in the dining facility during an unannounced visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Dec. 26, 2018. While not technically considered a rare earth element because of its placement on the periodic table, antimony is considered critical and less common than other elements. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum played a leading role in the groundbreaking effort to boost U.S. energy dominance and self-reliance in terms of critical minerals and natural resources. The antimony stibnite mine will be used to mine for gold as well, Fox News Digital has learned. The mine's opening is another example of a critical global supply chain shifting stateside, as Burgum and other officials aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers for national security and economic stability. The National Energy Dominance Council, an executive branch advisory group founded in February by executive order and led by Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was a key player in the opening of the mine. Burgum issued the mine's 404 permit – which governs dredging and discharge into American waters -- on Thursday to Boise-based Perpetua Resources. The Stibnite Gold Project from Perpetua Resources would include three open pits in pursuit of gold and antimony at the site of decades-old mines. "We are immensely proud to achieve this milestone. It's time to move forward and take the Stibnite Gold Project into a new and exciting phase of development," Cherry said in a statement. "We believe this [Trump] administration's commitment to boosting efficiency without compromising rigorous environmental standards can have a transformational impact on American mining," he added. It is expected to cut foreign reliance on that critical mineral by one-third. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital. He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.

DHS shares new body camera video footage from the episode at Delaney Hall Detention Center. The Department of Justice has accused Rep. LaMonica McIver of assaulting two federal agents at the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey last month, according to a new charging document. The document cites bodycam footage from law enforcement officers who recorded events as McIver and two other New Jersey lawmakers stormed the ICE facility. Prosecutors say the first officer McIver allegedly assaulted was a Homeland Security Investigations agent and the second was an ICE agent. The DOJ accuses McIver of having "slammed her forearm into the body of a uniformed HSI agent and reached out and tried to restrain the agent by forcibly grabbing him." The charging document also states that McIver "pushed an ICE officer & used her forearms to forcibly strike the agent." Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman are being targeted in a new House GOP resolution. McIver rejected the charges in a public statement, arguing they are "purely political." "Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall in my district," she wrote. "We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka." "This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right. Democrat Rep. LaMonica McIver is facing charges for allegedly assaulting two federal agents. Prosecutors say McIver helped create a "human shield" and blocked agents from handcuffing Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after he ignored numerous warnings to leave the property and was told he would be arrested. When the HSI agent told the mayor he was going to arrest him, McIver interjected and yelled "Hell no! Members of Congress bust into ICE detention facility in New Jersey (X / @RepBonnie) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem weighed in on the charges against McIver on Monday, saying, "no one is above the law." "If any person, regardless of political party, influence or status, assaults a law enforcement officer as we witnessed Congresswoman McIver do, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," the secretary wrote. "We thank our brave ICE law enforcement officers for their service to this great nation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where he suggested that failure to pass his “big, beautiful” tax bill could cost Republicans their House of Representatives majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Now, with two Democratic vacancies due to the deaths of Reps. Sylvester Turner (D-TX) and Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Republicans have a 220-213 advantage, meaning Johnson can afford to lose just three votes to pass legislation along party lines. I think it's going to be the biggest bill ever passed, and we got to get it done,” he stated, noting that a few Republican maybes will “grandstand” before final votes, even if failing to extend his 2017 tax cuts would result in a tax increase on more than two-thirds of households. “Or, you'll get a massive tax increase — you'll get a tax cut the likes of which we've never had before. This is bigger than any Ronald Reagan tax cut.” Trump declared that any GOP lawmakers voting against the bill “wouldn't be a Republican for much longer. “I'm a cheerleader for this party, and I'm a cheerleader for the country — much more importantly for the country — but I'm a cheerleader for the party, and we're going to go up, and I think we're going to have a very good discussion,” he explained. Trump singled out Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), a fiscal conservative who traditionally votes no on spending matters, saying he “should be voted out of office.” Massie opposes Trump's bill. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) said the House GOP's campaign arm will stick to its longstanding policy of not spending money in primary elections, meaning they won't rescue incumbents facing possible Trump-backed challengers. Trump's beefed-up tax cuts mark Republicans' first true legislative test of the president's second term in office, but Johnson has been saddled with wrangling opposing wings of the Republican Party, one that wants to see more deficit reducing measures included in the bill and the other is pushing for boosted tax benefits for their own constituencies. “I don't think there's anybody that's more well-suited to be speaker of the House, especially in a case like this.”</p>

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Forecasters warned Monday that more tornados and storms were possible in the central U.S. as people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up from severe weather that has killed more than two dozen people in four days. WASHINGTON (AP) — As nasty tornadoes popped up from Kansas to Kentucky, a depleted National Weather Service was in scramble mode. The agency's office in Jackson, Kentucky, had begun closing nightly as deep cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began hitting. It's a scenario likely to be repeated as the U.S. is on track to see more tornadoes this year than in 2024, which was the second-busiest tornado year on record. But he acknowledged that staffing cuts have “made it harder on us.” But, I mean, most of the people take those important duties seriously, so we're going to do what it takes to cover it,” Thompson said. “I hope we're not in the same staffing situation long term. It would be hard to sustain this for months or years.” Anthony Broughton stands amid his destroyed home following severe weather in the Sunshine Hill neighborhood of London, Ky., Saturday, May 17, 2025. The Storm Prediction Center had tallied 883 local tornado reports this year as of Monday, which was 35% higher than average for this time of year. They describe an agency that's somehow getting forecasts and warnings out in time, but is also near the breaking point. “They'll continue to answer the bell as long as they can, but you can only ask people to work 80 hours or 120 hours a week, you know for so long,” said Elbert “Joe” Friday, a former weather service director. Tom DiLiberto, a weather service meteorologist and spokesman who was fired in earlier rounds of the job cuts, said the situation is like a boat with leaks “and you have a certain amount of pieces of duct tape and you keep moving duct tape to different holes. Forecasters warned Monday that more tornados and storms were possible in the central U.S. as people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up from severe weather that has killed more than two dozen people in four days. As of March, some of the weather service offices issuing tornado warnings Friday and Sunday were above the 20% vacancy levels that outside experts have said is a critical threshold. Technologies used to predict tornadoes have significantly improved, but radar can't replace a well-rested staff that has to figure out how nasty or long-lasting storms will be and how to get information to the public, said Karen Kosiba, managing director of the Flexible Array of Mesonets and Radars (FARM) facility, a network of weather equipment used for research. “There really are not enough people to handle everything,” said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Howard Bluestein, who chased six tornadoes Sunday. Dennis Clark goes through the remains of his house that was destroyed by severe weather in London, Ky., Saturday, May 17, 2025.

Ames tugboat, sunk in 1923, was recently found in the waters of Lake Michigan near Manitowoc, Wisconsin. A long-lost shipwreck sitting in the waters of Lake Michigan was recently discovered by a fisherman – to the surprise of local officials. "These kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface," Tamara Thomsen, a maritime archaeologist at the Wisconsin Historical Society, said in a statement. "It sat there for over 100 years and then came back on our radar completely by chance." Thomsen added, "We are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to." It was "one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the lakes," according to officials. Thomsen told Fox News Digital the ship had "outlived its usefulness" by the time that it was intentionally sunk. "Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day." She added, "Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day." Thomsen also noted that it became somewhat of a spectacle for the ships to be set on fire while they were dismantled. Thomsen also estimates that 13 ships were abandoned in the Maritime Bay near Manitowoc. Divers have only been able to locate three, but they're still keeping their eyes peeled for them. "We only find them when they are uncovered by storms if someone sees them before they are covered again – it needs to be perfect timing," she said. The maritime archaeologist also noted that a large propeller, measuring 10.5 feet in diameter, still sits at the shipwreck site. Other than that, only small artifacts were found. The find is especially remarkable because Thuss's step-grandmother garnered a reputation for finding shipwrecks herself, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. "'Shipwreck Suzze' Johnson, who took up the hobbies of operating a powered parachute and ultralight plane as a retiree, has incredibly discovered a variety of shipwrecks from the air in the recent past, including three shipwrecks in three days in Lake Michigan in 2015," the historical organization said. The tugboat was damaged in a collision in 1889, but was repaired and had a relatively long lifespan. Last May, the Wisconsin Historical Society identified 11 ancient canoes in a Madison lake, including one boat that dated back to 2500 B.C. Later that year, the organization announced the discovery of the John Evenson, a tugboat built in 1884 that was also discovered in Lake Michigan.

Elon Musk had already turned Twitter into a right-wing echo chamber since purchasing it in 2022, and spent several chaotic months earlier this year as Trump's government efficiency henchman. Jeff Bezos has revamped the Washington Post's editorial section to build support for “personal liberties and free markets.” Mark Zuckerberg decided to get rid of fact-checkers at Meta. It was a massive show of power that revealed how possible it is for these wealthy men to remake our culture in their own image, transforming how we speak to each other and what we know to be true. Using that power on Trump's behalf seems to have paid mixed dividends for Silicon Valley, but it nonetheless makes clear how important it is to understand their worldview and their vision for the future. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online. Which is why it is striking to note that Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg share a favorite author: Iain M. Banks, the Scottish science fiction writer best known for his Culture series. Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. “The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Bezos told GeekWire in 2018, adding, “there's a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.” Bezos has attempted twice to adapt the series for TV at Amazon, once in 2018 and again in February. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg picked the Culture novel Player of Games for his book club in 2015. Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. His original name for the neuralink — a computer chip that can be implanted in human brains, pioneered by his neurotechnology company — was the neural lace, a piece of telepathic technology that Banks came up with in the Culture books. In 2018, Musk declared himself “a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks.” (It's worth noting that in 2018, Musk was under fire for union busting but had not yet waded so far into national politics or declared public war against the “woke mind virus.”) Plenty of us like and even identify with pieces of pop culture whose politics we don't entirely agree with, like the libertarian Little House on the Prairie books or the Christian Chronicles of Narnia. Still, the Banks Culture series, which consists of 10 books released between 1987 and 2012, is not politically coded so much as it is downright didactic. “The Culture is hippy commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism,” Banks said in an interview with Strange Horizons in 2010, in a line that's only barely more explicit than the books themselves. The Culture series takes place in a post-scarcity galactic society known only as the Culture, which strictly values empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation. What does it do about civilizations where slavery is legal? The politics of these books are not subtle, and they are also not compatible with the existence of billionaires. So it's worth thinking about why the broligarchs have so consistently cited a socialist author as an inspiration. What do they find tantalizing about Banks' work? Banks takes as his starting principle for the Culture the idea that a space-faring civilization will have to be socialist to be effective. Banks further reasons that each spaceship or planet in the Culture will have to be reasonably self-sufficient to survive. There is no money and no want; therefore, there can't be any billionaires or any economic inequality. This is not a world in which supremely wealthy people who use their power to influence the social fabric make sense. “Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without,” Banks concluded in a 1994 Usenet post in which he lays out his full theory of the Culture. In the Culture, should someone commit an action that most people agreed was unacceptable, everyone responds with social shaming rather than the rule of law: They stop inviting the person in question to parties. In other words, like a group of proper leftists, they deal with misbehavior by social cancellation, that great threat against which the broligarchs have declared war. The Culture's citizens have invented vastly powerful AIs that take care of governance for them. This delegation frees up the Culture citizens themselves to indulge in what Banks describes as “the things that really mattered in life, such as sports, games, romance, studying dead languages, barbarian societies and impossible problems, and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness.” Those who are burdened with too much ambition to be content in such a soft life take on (unpaid) jobs managing the Culture's relationships with other civilizations, mostly for the prestige and the adrenaline rush of it all. This vision appears to have influenced Musk's idea of a future in which AI has rendered work “optional,” so that “if you want to do a job that's kinda like a hobby, you can do a job.” Musk allows that there would need to be “universal high income” for this plan to work, but outlines no ideas as to how such an ambitious policy could take effect. In the meantime, in our own world, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla are all infamous for requiring employees to work abusively long hours. Anyone can change gender just by thinking about it, and most people do at least once in their lives, a state of affairs Banks argues is responsible for its strict regime of gender equality. Meanwhile, Musk is notoriously anti-trans, Zuckerberg has been leaning into the retrograde gender ideologies of the manosphere as he tweaks Meta's policies to allow more hate speech, particularly toward LGBTQ+ people, and Amazon has removed LGBTQ+ rights support from its website. The most detestable villain in Banks's series is Joiler Veppers, a wealthy man in a civilization less evolved than the Culture, who uses his riches to purchase and influence media outlets, undercut labor unions, and rape his indentured servants. Veppers's money comes from a family fortune built in the computer game industry, and he compounds that fortune by investing in the servers to a series of virtual reality hellscapes, where unfortunates are horribly tortured for all eternity. If you want to know how Banks views capitalist tech billionaires, you don't have to hunt very hard. In the Culture series, a capitalist tech billionaire is the literal devil, only he couldn't be bothered to build hell himself. Read through this light, the Culture's technological prowess offers the brute force that backs up its warm and fuzzy ideology. The Culture can afford to be idealistic and worry about its moral culpability because it has better technology than all the other civilizations it faces off with, which means it will nearly always win in a fight. If you think of yourself as a titan of industry who is making that technology for your own culture — who is providing the brute force that allows for wishy-washy moralizing — there is a certain easy comfort that comes with this alignment. The Culture is not good because they are strong. The Culture is not good because they are strong. To avoid this idea when reading Banks, you would have to be exquisitely attuned to the pleasurable spectacle of technology and the power that tech offers its users, and then ignore everything else. That's why this group has a propensity for big, pointless stunts, like trips to almost-space and carting a kitchen sink through Twitter headquarters and threatening to punch one another in a public fight. It's as though they feel entitled to their power because their favorite book taught them that the side with the best tech always wins, and the most important thing you can do with that tech is put on a show. They seem not to have read deeply enough to understand what the book was really trying to say: that the most important thing powerful people can do is use their power to make the world freer, fairer, and more pleasurable for everyone else.

President Donald Trump gives an update on the 'big beautiful' budget bill as he touts early wins of his presidency. President Donald Trump delivered a "pep talk" to Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in an effort to pass his "big, beautiful bill." Trump's visit found House Republicans split between spending-hawk holdouts who wanted to cut more of the deficit and moderates who sought to expand tax deductions for Americans. Trump himself has pushed tax cuts and emphasized on Tuesday that he only seeks to cut "waste, fraud and abuse" from Medicaid. We don't want any waste, fraud, or abuse," Trump said ahead of the meeting. Other than that, we're leaving it, Medicare. Trump was extremely complimentary of House Speaker Mike Johnson as he spoke to reporters ahead of the House Republicans' weekly meeting on the Hill. It is not clear whether Trump will meet with individual holdouts directly. President Donald Trump is headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Republicans voting on his "big, beautiful bill." This man has done a fantastic job. It's only been recently, but this man has done a fantastic job. He's a real unifier," Trump said of Johnson, who stood beside him. "I don't think anybody else could have done it. We had – I just said to your cohorts downstairs, we had a majority of one for a period of was and he gets it together and we actually cast this and nobody else came," he told reporters. "He's done a fantastic job, the Speaker. Trump told reporters after the meeting that it had been a "meeting of love" and rejected reports that he is losing patience. "I think it was really great. That was a meeting of love, let me tell you. I think it was a meeting of love," he said. House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing lawmakers to pass President Trump's massive budget bill. "They literally are trying to take health care away from millions of Americans at this very moment in the dead of night," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday. "If this legislation is designed to make life better for the American people, can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in the morning?" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has derided Trump's "big, beautiful bill" as a handout for the wealthy. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news that Biden is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer that has already spread to his bones came as yet another book about his condition as president hit the shelves, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios. Top Democratic strategist David Axelrod said “conversations” about Biden's health and mental acuity as president “should be more muted and set aside for now as he's struggling through this.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) was more pointed in his response to whether Biden's cancer diagnosis raised new questions about his ability to serve or transparency regarding the former president's medical condition. “It seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward at a time when they actually are taking health care away from the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. “Maybe let's not play partisan games with a cancer diagnosis, okay?” posted Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Vice President Kamala Harris‘s adviser, in response to those wondering if Biden's latest health scare was similar in nature to what has been reported in books such as Original Sin. When Vice President JD Vance wished Biden well but questioned whether this was another example of the former president's health receiving insufficient scrutiny, Politico's Jonathan Martin described it as “a real-time depiction of somebody struggling between the responsibilities of high office and the temptations that come with being totally online.” President Donald Trump has also called Biden's diagnosis “very sad” while expressing skepticism about the timeline. But knowing what we know now about the extent of Biden's age-related decline and his team's efforts to conceal it from the public, questions about this sudden diagnosis of an advanced cancer that apparently went undetected while in office seem valid. If Democratic elites had listened to their party's rank-and-file voters, who told pollsters they wanted another option in 2024, they would not have been sent scrambling in the weeks following that debate. If journalists had not been so eager to accept the “cheap fakes” explanation for video footage of seemingly bad Biden outings, they wouldn't be writing mea culpas about their Biden age and health coverage months after he left office. The new Biden books aren't being written by conservatives or partisan Republicans. For whom was Biden's decision to seek reelection “disastrous,” if not the Democrats? The latest devastating health news for Biden should be handled sensitively and compassionately. Hopefully, that conversation will happen before new books lamenting old Biden coverage decisions are published years from now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, who has already bashed “grandstanders” holding up the bill, will head to Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning to speak at the House Republicans' weekly conference meeting, a sign that leadership is putting pressure on holdouts. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks. “We're almost there, and I'm very optimistic that we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered,” Johnson said on Monday afternoon. “It's going to be a big thing for the country.” GOP leadership aides did not provide any specific details as to what was in the handshake agreement, but Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC) said on Sunday night that they had made progress with moving up both the effective date of the Medicaid work requirements and the date of repeal of several IRA clean energy tax credits. Aides characterized the fight over Medicaid as “push and pull conversations.” “I think it's the desire of every Republican, always has been, to make work requirements real and actionable as soon as possible,” the speaker said Sunday. And I think that's a good change in the policy.” Johnson was optimistic last week that they would be able to reach an agreement on SALT over the weekend, but GOP leadership aides said Monday that there are still “unsolved issues” to iron out. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), another SALT Republican, agreed that the debate over SALT should have “been dealt with months ago.” He said it “certainly appears” that leadership took the SALT Republicans for granted and “that they felt they could just jam us.” Lawler also scoffed at Freedom Caucus members who have said the SALT caucus is asking for too much, stating, “Good luck getting what they want.” “We wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine, who won,” Lawler said. There are also mixed discussions on adjustments to the federal-state cost-sharing of Medicaid, or FMAP, with lawmakers going back and forth about whether it's on the table. “But let's be clear, there are still very strong outstanding questions, and I think there are people across the entire conference who recognize that, and it is a mistake for this important of a policy to jam it through.” Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), Freedom Caucus chairman, said, “I think it's pretty obvious that we think we need more time,” calling the discussions “complicated.” When asked if leadership should delay the Rules vote, Lawler said they had “better have a good number tonight.” “The body has a right to vote on it,” Norman added. A whip notice to lawmakers, obtained by the Washington Examiner, notes that an additional vote session could be added on Wednesday should Johnson call for a vote on the budget legislation. “It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver on the Make America Great Again agenda responsible for President Trump's landslide victory on Nov. 5,” she said. Not all Republicans' votes are dependent on Trump's remarks at the conference meeting. Harris told reporters that he's “just not sure there's anything the president can tell me tomorrow that would change my mind at this point. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who frequently detracts from his party over spending, is likely to be one of the three “no” votes Johnson can afford. Eyes will be on Roy and Norman, as well as Freedom Caucus members and like-minded lawmakers such as Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) and Tim Burchett (R-TN), to see whether they will be swayed to vote in favor of the bill. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) blasted the GOP for holding a 1 a.m. hearing on the reconciliation bill, accusing Republicans of wanting to “hide what's in it.” “House Republicans, in particular, are once again shamefully bending the knee and serving as nothing more than a rubber stamp for Donald Trump's extreme agenda,” he added.</p>

(AP) — More tornadoes plowed through the central U.S. on Monday, ripping apart buildings and knocking out power as people from Texas to Kentucky continued to clean up from days of severe weather that killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings. At least four tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service. Across Oklahoma, at least 10 homes were destroyed and multiple buildings were damaged, including a fire station that was wiped out, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. A spokesperson for the agency said they have not received any reports of injuries or deaths. Around 115,000 customers were without power in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us. Parts of several highways were also closed due to flooding or storm damage. In northwest Arkansas, severe weather caused a Halsey concert to be canceled and a municipal airport had to close temporarily Monday night so crews could remove debris from the field. And in Oklahoma, Tulsa Public Schools canceled all afterschool activities. Northern Texas saw softball-sized hail measuring 4 1/2 inches (11.4 centimeters) in diameter, according to Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist with the service's Weather Prediction Center. Earlier Monday in St. Louis, where officials estimated a Friday tornado damaged 5,000 buildings and may cost well over $1 billion, the mayor warned that federal assistance could take weeks. Kentucky has been hardest hit by the storms. A devastating tornado late Friday into early Saturday damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. Small aircraft stored there had large dents in them and even wings ripped open. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,” said London Mayor Randall Weddle. Officials in Kansas and Texas also were evaluating damage from late Sunday storms. The Kentucky storms that killed 19 people were part of a weather system that caused seven deaths in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. Lonnie Nantz hid in a hallway with his wife, two daughters and a grandson as the one-story brick home they bought near London in 1977 was destroyed around them. London city worker Ashley Taylor was back on the job Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky — the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night. In surrounding Laurel County, first responders mourned one of their own. The injured woman turned out to be Leatherman's wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected by an EF3 tornado with winds up to 150 mph (240 kph) that slammed areas north and west of downtown Friday. “I'm not happy about the fact we're still waiting from all of that damage two months ago,” Hawley said. Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief David Richardson said last week he plans to shift responsibility for disaster recovery to states this year as part of an agencywide transformation and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.” Spencer said during a news conference Monday evening that emergency protocols put in place in 2021 were not followed, possibly preventing sirens being activated to warn residents about the tornado. In Texas, several tornadoes touched down west of Fort Worth on Sunday, including an EF1 with peak winds of 105 mph (169 kph) that caused damage in and around Gordon, the weather service said Monday.

Interim US Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, left, arrives to the courthouse in Newark, N.J., Thursday, May 15, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver is being charged with assault after a skirmish with federal officers outside an immigration detention center, said New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, who also announced Monday that she was dropping a trespassing case against the Newark mayor whose arrest led to the disturbance. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba wrote on social media that McIver is facing a charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement, but court papers providing details were not immediately released or publicly available online. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka speaks to protesters outside of Delaney Hall, a recently re-opened immigration detention center, in Newark, N.J., Wednesday, May 7, 2025. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. Within minutes of Habba's announcement, McIver's Democratic colleagues cast the prosecution as an infringement on lawmakers' official duties to serve their constituents and an effort to silence their opposition to an immigration policy that helped propel the president back into power but now has emerged as divisive fault line in American political discourse. At the same time, Habba announced that her office agreed to dismiss a misdemeanor charge against Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested after he attempted to join McIver and two other members of New Jersey's congressional delegation inspecting the facility in their oversight capacity. “The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe,” Habba said in a statement. She denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight. “This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police” on it. Interim US Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, left, arrives to the courthouse in Newark, N.J., Thursday, May 15, 2025. It isn't clear from bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene. In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said McIver was being charged after a “thorough review of the video footage” and investigation by Homeland Security Investigations. “This Administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.” As of Monday night, neither McIver nor her attorneys had gotten charging documents from prosecutors, according to an emailed statement from a spokesperson for her attorney. “Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. He said he will “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” and “continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations.” Baraka called McIver a “daughter of Newark” and said he stood with her. “I fully expect her to be vindicated,” he said. She was then elected to a full term in November. “House Democrats will not be intimidated by the Trump administration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FLE - Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert, poses for a portrait with the Dilbert character in his studio in Dublin, Calif., Oct. 26, 2006. The creator of the Dilbert comic strip, which was canceled by most newspapers two years ago over the creator's racist comments, said Monday that he has been diagnosed with the same aggressive prostate cancer as former President Joe Biden. “I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,” Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, “Real Coffee with Scott Adams. Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer. “It's basically intolerable,” he said of the pain. Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do. Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams. On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a “hate group” and said he would no longer “help Black Americans.” Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work. The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped “Dilbert” in 2022, said the comic strip “went from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.”</p>
