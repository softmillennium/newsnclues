Kuzmanovska, MD, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Disclosure: Dafina B. Kuzmanovska, MD, PhD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Editor's Note:The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians, but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. They report no history of hematuria, hematemesis, fever, or chills. They also do not note any other associated symptoms, prior surgeries, or medical conditions. The patient was previously seen by his pediatrician and is undergoing a workup. Upper gastroendoscopy performed at a nearby hospital 2 weeks ago had revealed chronic gastritis with erosive changes in the antral region. Triple treatment for Helicobacter pylori, however, did not lead to any improvement. Abdominal ultrasonography also performed at that time showed mild nephrocalcinosis. Family history is negative for diabetes mellitus and porphyria. Upon physical examination, the child is thin and mildly ill-appearing. The patient's respirations are regular and unlabored at 14 breaths/min. The child is in mild distress secondary to his epigastric discomfort. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and normal respiratory effort is noted. The patient's extremities show no edema, and brisk capillary refill is noted. Routine laboratory tests reveal a normal complete blood count and normal values for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and magnesium. Chest radiograph demonstrating combined hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular interstitial infiltrates in the upper lung zone. During the hospital course, additional laboratory tests are performed. The results of a purified protein derivative test are negative. Urinalysis performed on several occasions shows a specific gravity of 1.003 and a pH of 5, with normal urinary sediment. On several occasions, marked hypercalciuria is observed, with a calcium level of 14 mg/kg and a urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (mmol/mmol) that ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Ultrasonography is performed, on which the parathyroid glands appear normal. The specimen exhibits tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with tubular calcium deposits. Dystrophic calcifications are present in some of the tubules. Negative results are obtained for immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals inflammatory cellular substrate CD68, macrophages, and lymphoid population. The clinical picture of this patient was dominated by nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as malaise, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. He had no history of maculopapular rashes, erythema nodosum, arthritis, chronic lymphocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or uveitis. He also did not have any coughing or exertional dyspnea. The child did have vomiting and polyuria, which were caused by hypercalcemia. The renal biopsy specimen indicated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with tubular calcium deposits, without glomerular abnormalities. In addition, the chest radiograph demonstrated combined hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular interstitial infiltrates in the upper lung zone. The chest radiography findings, when considered along with the hypercalcemia, rash, and renal biopsy results, are consistent with stage 2 radiographic sarcoidosis. Symptoms of Fanconi syndrome in children are failure to thrive, growth retardation, and rickets, which does not describe this patient. Diagnosis is by demonstrating glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria. Although a variety of glomerular lesions, including IgA nephropathy, are described as glomerular damage in sarcoidosis, they are not distinguishable from their primary form. [3] Moreover, this patient has a tubulointerstitial nephritis which is seen more often in sarcoidosis than IgA nephropathy (the latter is typically more a glomerulonephritis). Bartter syndrome, a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder, is associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and low to normal blood pressure,[4] which does not describe this patient. [1] Measuring baseline serum calcium levels is recommended to screen for abnormal calcium metabolism in patients with sarcoidosis, even in asymptomatic patients. It may be caused by endogenous synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from subcutaneous fat necrosis, granulomatous disease, or by excessive exogenous vitamin D intake. [1] Hypercalcemia may also result from primary hyperparathyroidism or from increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein caused by certain malignancies. [6] Lastly, hypercalcemia may occur in patients with hypophosphatemia, vitamin A intoxication, or blue-diaper syndrome, or it may occur in association with use of certain medications, most notably hydrochlorothiazide and other thiazide diuretics. If the PTH level is low (as it was in this patient), additional calciotropic hormones may be assayed if appropriate testing is available. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by an increased cellular immune response to an unknown antigen and the formation of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. As noted previously, an intact PTH level at the time of hypercalcemia is important in narrowing the differential diagnosis. If the PTH level is low (as it was in this patient), additional calciotropic hormones may be examined if appropriate testing is available. Calcitriol then travels to the intestinal cells and promotes luminal absorption of calcium and phosphate into the circulation. Hypercalcemia is accompanied by hypercalciuria and, eventually, nephrocalcinosis (as seen in this case). Hypercalcemia may also eventually cause renal failure both by causing dehydration and by inducing renal vasoconstriction, thereby reducing the glomerular filtration rate. Excess PTH production can produce significant bone loss, which is not seen in this patient. [7] High levels of magnesium are not directly linked to sarcoidosis. Pediatric sarcoidosis is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of 0.6 to 1.02 per 100,000 children. [8] Two distinct forms of childhood sarcoidosis appear to exist. Older children usually present with a multisystem disease similar to the adult manifestation, with frequent lymphadenopathy and pulmonary involvement. In contrast, early-onset childhood sarcoidosis is a unique form of the disease characterized by the triad of rash, uveitis, and arthritis, usually in patients who are younger than 4 years. Pulmonary disease and abnormal findings on chest radiography are more common in children with sarcoidosis aged 8-15 years, compared with those younger than 4 years. [9] Bilateral hilar adenopathy is the most common finding on chest radiography in children; it occurs in almost all cases. Pulmonary parenchymal involvement is common and most often appears radiographically as an interstitial pattern; however, nodular, alveolar, and fibrotic patterns have also been noted. Of note, although chest radiography may be sufficient for the diagnosis, high-resolution chest CT may be helpful in evaluating lung changes[1,9] and is superior to conventional CT for detecting and demonstrating diagnostic findings in the lungs. [1] The serum ACE level is increased in many patients with sarcoidosis. Sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic test is limited. The serum ACE level may be normal in patients with active disease. Many children with sarcoidosis have palpable peripheral lymph glands. The lymph nodes generally are firm, nontender, discrete, and easily movable. Hepatosplenomegaly often occurs in children with sarcoidosis at some point in their clinical course, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction is rare. Ocular involvement is very common in children with sarcoidosis, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including a slit-lamp examination, is essential (particularly in young children). Sarcoidosis may affect any part of the eye or orbit. Anterior uveitis (also called "iritis" or "iridocyclitis") is the most frequently noted lesion. Sarcoid-associated uveitis can be acute or chronic and may vary from an isolated iridocyclitis to a bilateral panuveitis syndrome. If left untreated, the disease may cause synechiae, corneal opacities, glaucoma, and, eventually, blindness. Renal involvement is not well characterized in published series of childhood sarcoidosis. Histopathologic studies have revealed epithelioid granuloma formation, interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells, interstitial fibrosis, tubulitis, tubular atrophy, mesangial hyperplasia, glomerular fibrosis, and vascular involvement. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy for sarcoidosis, but immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory agents are viable therapeutic options for patients who do not respond to or experience adverse effects from corticosteroids. The published data most extensively documents treatment with methotrexate,[1,8] but favorable responses have been noted with leflunomide, azathioprine, and antimalarial and antimicrobial agents, as well as with tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors. [9,11] For cutaneous sarcoidosis that cannot be controlled by local treatment, consideration of oral glucocorticoids is suggested. [11 More recently, repository corticotropin injection been suggested as an alternative in patients who are on high-dose prednisone. Hypercalcemia and renal failure reversed completely, as did the pulmonary changes seen on radiography. Renal nephrocalcinosis persisted, however, despite symptomatic and biochemical improvement. During corticosteroid therapy, measurement of the urinary beta-2-microglobulin concentration by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proved a valuable monitoring tool for assessing recovery of the tubular impairment. Chest radiography obtained after 3 weeks of corticosteroid therapy showed resolution of the findings seen in the original chest radiograph. This patient represents a rare case of sarcoidosis presenting with acute renal failure and hypercalcemia as the initial manifestations. As noted previously, hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is uncommon[1] and usually results from autonomous production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by macrophages within the granuloma. At that point, calcitriol travels to the intestinal cells and facilitates luminal absorption of calcium and phosphate into the circulation. Hypercalcemia is accompanied by hypercalciuria and, eventually, nephrocalcinosis. A rare cause of clinically manifested hypercalcemia is vitamin D intoxication, which may be caused by excessive exogenous vitamin D intake. Hypercalcemia may also result from primary hyperparathyroidism or from increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein caused by certain malignancies. As noted previously, corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy for sarcoidosis,[1,9] but viable therapeutic options include immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory agents for patients who do not respond to or experience adverse effects from corticosteroids. Published data mainly documents treatment with the immunosuppressant methotrexate,[1,8] but favorable responses have been seen with leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and antimalarial and antimicrobial agents, as well as with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Treatment options do not include fungicides, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics; granulomatous pulmonary infections caused by mycobacteria and fungi should have been ruled out. [1] For cutaneous sarcoidosis that is not controlled by local treatment, oral glucocorticoids could be considered. [11] For patients on high-dose prednisone, a suggested alternative is repository corticotropin injection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A regimen that spares patients recovering from cataract surgery the burden of using antibacterial and anti-inflammatory eye drops several times a day for weeks and instead uses an injection to administer those drugs immediately after the procedure is nearly as effective at preventing complications as the traditional drop regimen at a fraction of the cost, a study of both approaches found. “Our study aims to underscore the benefits of the dropless cataract surgery approach as a promising alternative to the traditional drop regimen, particularly for populations where adherence to postoperative drops is challenging,” Yousef Yousef, a medical student at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, New York, told Medscape Medical News. “We hope our findings will encourage broader adoption of the dropless protocol by cataract surgeons, potentially establishing it as a new standard of care.” Yousef presented results from a retrospective chart review of 544 eyes that had cataract surgery at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2025 Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City. The researchers found no significant differences in best-corrected visual acuity. A multivariate regression analysis showed the dropless protocol was not associated with increased risks for either complication, he added. The dropless protocol has three key potential advantages over the traditional approach, Yousef said: Convenience for patients, improved drug bioavailability, and lower cost. “The traditional drop protocol requires patients to administer three different medications four times daily over a 4-week tapering period,” he told Medscape Medical News. “Intracameral injection bypasses these barriers, delivering a more direct treatment,” he said. “In contrast, the dropless approach costs just $15.91 per eye when a single vial is used for approximately 10 cases.” The new data are important because few randomized clinical trials have compared the dropless and traditional protocols for treating pain and inflammation and preventing infections after cataract surgery, according to Neal Shorstein, MD, a retired cataract surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. “There are an accumulating number of observational studies, so this adds to the retrospective, observational literature, and that's a good thing because different locations and practice environments add to the experience,” said Shorstein, an adviser to the Seva Foundation, a nonprofit group that develops eye care programs in underserved regions. Triesence, another formulation of triamcinolone used in some dropless protocols, has a smaller particle size, he said. Yousef and Shorstein reported having no relevant financial relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A combination of two drugs could improve outcomes and reduce the need for toxic chemotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the commonest cancer in childhood and one that can be particularly difficult to treat in older patients, according to Cambridge scientists. Although the research has so far only been conducted in cell lines and mice, the team is seeking funding to begin clinical trials in patients shortly. More than 500 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with B-ALL, many of whom are children, where it makes up 40% of all childhood cancers. Outcomes tend to be much poorer for older children and adults. Every week, I see adult patients who are undergoing treatment for this incredibly aggressive form of leukemia, and although the chemotherapy can cure many of them, the side effects are often really challenging. We need to find treatments that are kinder and more effective." In recent years, new treatments have begun to emerge, including bone marrow transplants and immunotherapies such as CAR-T cell therapy, but these also come with significant side effects and are expensive. Now, in research published today in Nature Communications, a team led by Dr Richardson and colleague Professor Brian Huntly has developed a new treatment with the potential to be less toxic than current treatment and to be effective in all age groups. These are cells produced in our bone marrow that play an important role in our immune systems, producing antibodies to protect us from infection. However, in B-ALL, the body produces an overabundance of these cells that build up in our bone marrow and stop healthy blood cells from developing. They can also spread to other parts of the body. "There's a constant stream of these cells coming out through the bone marrow into the immune system," said Dr Richardson. "The ones that cause cancer are very primitive and not yet useful. Treatments for B-ALL focus on killing these malignant B-cells. Venetoclax is already used to treat a related condition, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It works by targeting the protein BCL2 within the B-cells, causing them to die through a process of 'programmed cell death' known as apoptosis. However, venetoclax is not consistently effective in B-ALL. The team was studying another gene called CREBBP, certain mutations of which contribute to disease progression and are also associated with resistance to chemotherapy in B-ALL. When BCL2 activity is subsequently inhibited – for example by using venetoclax – it leads to cell death, but by a completely different process known as ferroptotic programmed cell death. The researchers used a new drug called inobrodib, developed by CellCentric, a University of Cambridge spinout company, to switch off CREBBP in human and mouse models of B-ALL. Combining it with venetoclax potently killed early-stage B-cells, even those cells that carried a genetic mutation making them resistant to venetoclax treatment alone. Professor Brian Huntly, also from the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Head of the Department of Haematology, said: "These are very promising findings, and even though our work was only in mice, we're optimistic that we will see similar effects in patients. Venetoclax and inobrodib have already been used together in an early-stage clinical trial for AML, so we know they are safe to use. We now want to trial our approach in adults and teenagers with B-ALL." This makes this approach potentially much safer than CAR-T cell therapy, for example, which can permanently eradicate the body's ability to produce B-cells. Dr. Richardson, who is also a Fellow at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, added: "The good news is that the cost of venetoclax is expected to fall in coming years with the introduction of generic alternatives, making its use much more cost effective." Professor Huntly and Dr Richardson are Honorary Consultant Hematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Professor Huntly is Chair of the Haematology Service at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. "I'm very pale anyway, thanks to my Irish Heritage, but the GP thought I look particularly pale," she says, "so she ordered a blood test. She thought it might be low iron or anaemia." It turned out to be five-and-a-half weeks of chemotherapy. Prior to her treatment, Gill had been a biomedical researcher studying tumour-suppressing proteins before becoming a programme manager at the Medical Research Council. She knew all about clinical trials – including the fact that patients on trials seem to fare better even when receiving only the placebo – and so requested she join one. She was enrolled onto a trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital, one of the UK's leading cancer hospitals, where she received treatment. Gill was given chemotherapy alongside rituximab, a trial immunotherapy drug. Chemo drugs can attack every part of your body, not just the cancer. The side effects were terrible, she says, from vomiting and diarrhoea (giving way to horrific constipation) to migraines, hair loss and fatigue. Because she was immunosuppressed, she was unable at times to see her daughter, who developed infections after just starting nursery. After her first round of chemo, Gill would come home for a week before returning to hospital for more treatment in an ongoing cycle, giving countless blood samples, bone marrow biopsies and lumbar puncture tests and receiving regular chemotherapy into her spine. (The one bright spot, she says, was the steroid dexamethasone, which "can make you feel an awful lot better than you should. So, while my husband was trying to cope with everything at home, with our two-year-old and short working days, I was busy planning a kitchen extension from my hospital bed and overwhelming him with my plans!") With her background in medical research, she knew this was a risky procedure and that she could die as result of the transplant or her blood cancer relapsing – and that even if successful, it was going to make her very ill. I treated it as a project, like, 'Right, you've got to get rid of this cancer'. And then after the treatment, she had to take immunosuppressants to prevent the stem cells turning her immune system against her. It worked: the transplant was a success and Gill's leukemia is now in remission. I still don't know who my donor is, but I'm so grateful to them for signing up to do something so altruistic. Even so, Gill's life has not returned to normal. It has become what many cancer survivors describe as a "new normal". Other later side effects have included early menopause, steroid-induced diabetes, cataracts, osteomyelitis in both lower legs and a susceptibility to infections. She believes her cognition and memory have also taken a hit. Yet despite this, Gill has found a new life as an ambassador for Blood Cancer UK, talking to other patients, researchers and politicians about ALL, sitting on interview panels for the charity, advising on its five-year strategy, and many more tasks. She has also taken on walking challenges to raise money for Blood Cancer UK, Anthony Nolan and the Royal Marsden: three charities that have helped her immensely over the years. But she is also keen to stress that in the 12 years since her treatment, things have improved and there are better treatments now available. "The doctors I meet all want to see kinder, more targeted treatments," she says. "Anything that we can do to improve treatments so more people can survive their blood cancer and fewer people have to go through incredibly harsh therapies is a win-win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes may also be effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer. This is shown by an international study in which researchers at Umeå University, Sweden, have participated. The researchers have found that drugs that regulate a particular protein have a key role in reducing prostate cancer recurrence among diabetic patients. For the first time, we have clinical observations showing that prostate cancer patients with diabetes who received drugs targeting the protein remained relapse-free during the period we followed them." Lukas Kenner, visiting professor at Umeå University and one of the study's lead authors What the research team, led by Professor Kenner, has now shown is that patients who were treated for prostate cancer and who also had diabetes, who were treated with drugs that regulate the PPARy protein, managed without recurrence of prostate cancer. In studies of cell cultures, researchers also observed that the drug in question, pioglitazone, not only inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells but also drives a metabolic reprogramming of the cancer cells, weakening their ability to grow. "The findings are very promising, but further clinical studies are needed to both confirm the results and to investigate whether the treatment can also be used in patients with prostate cancer who do not have diabetes," says Lukas Kenner. The research has been conducted as a combination of studies on cells and mice as well as a retrospective study of 69 prostate cancer patients with type 2 diabetes that was followed by the Medical University of Innsbruck in 2014–2023. In certain types of cancer, PPARγ can contribute to tumor growth or metabolic changes. Thereby it modulates the signalling pathway and aims to counteract tumor-promoting effects by changing the cellular metabolism but may also reduce inflammation. The anti-diabetic PPARγ agonist Pioglitazone inhibits cell proliferation and induces metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOS ANGELES — Mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) that occur more frequently or severely during specific seasons — known as seasonality patterns — are associated with treatment response and different characteristics and subtypes of the disorder, new research suggested. “A take-home message is that people should start to think about seasonality with respect to distinct seasons; it shouldn't just be that a patient has seasonal features or not,” co-investigator Mete Ercis, MD, research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, told Medscape Medical News. Because this was a cross-sectional study, causality cannot be implied, he noted. “We can say, for example, that people who had early onset of bipolar disorder tended to have higher seasonality, but we cannot say which came first,” Ercis said. Although about 25% of patients with BD experience seasonality, there is no standardized definition or classification of patterns, and the few studies on the topic have shown mixed findings, researchers noted. The current study included 1702 patients (mean age, 41.4 years; 62% women) enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank who had data on seasonality. Of these, 45% had at least one type of seasonality and were divided into one of four groups on the basis of when their prevailing mood episodes occurred: Fall-winter depression, spring-summer hypomania, the first two groups combined (biphasic seasonality), and indeterminate seasonality, used when a patient had seasonality patterns that did not fit the other categories. “One thing that was striking was we noticed the treatment resistance to lithium or mood stabilizers were in individuals who had fall-winter depression but not in the other seasonality groups,” Ercis said. “I was not expecting that, although it makes sense. I thought any seasonality would be associated with treatment resistance, but actually that was not statistically significant,” he added. Spring-summer hypomania was linked to a lower likelihood of rapid cycling (odds ratio, 0.36; P < .001) and a lower number of lifetime antidepressants used (P = .01). Higher counts of lifetime antipsychotics and any psychotropics were linked to biphasic seasonality (P = .03 for both) and with indeterminate seasonality (P < .001 for both). Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Adrian Preda, MD, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine, noted that because of the study's design, “obviously you cannot comment on cause and effect.” Instead, the investigators presented correlations, he pointed out. “They were looking at different types of seasonality, which was interesting because usually we don't separate seasonal bipolar disorder into different subtypes,” said Preda, who was not involved with the research. He noted that the link between seasonality and a higher count of antipsychotics made him wonder whether patients with seasonality are at risk of receiving more antipsychotic prescriptions, or if greater antipsychotic use is somehow increasing the risk for seasonal episodes. “We can't know that, but it's an interesting finding,” he said. “I think this study has very interesting correlations — but we need to know a little bit more in order to say, ‘This is the cause,'” he concluded. Ercis and Preda reported having no relevant financial relationships.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new guidelines for the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) published in Neurodegenerative Diseases, serve as exemplary clinical recommendations for clinicians and healthcare providers, supporting the advancement of Alzheimer's disease treatment in Switzerland. The Swiss Memory Clinics (SMC) network, a group of specialized clinics in Switzerland that diagnose and treat patients with dementia, has released new national guidelines on the use of anti-amyloid mAbs – such as Lecanemab and Donanemab – for treating Alzheimer's disease in Switzerland. Lecanemab is now also authorized by the European Commission under strict conditions. Published in the 11 April 2025 issue of Neurodegenerative Diseases, a Karger journal, the paper represents a coordinated effort by the SMC network to ensure safe, effective, and ethical implementation of these emerging therapies. Serving as a clinical practice guide for clinicians and healthcare providers, it facilitates the implementation of emerging treatment options in the field of Alzheimer's disease. The paper outlines criteria for patient selection, biomarker confirmation, APOE genotyping, ARIA monitoring via MRI, and the infrastructure required to support safe treatment delivery. It also emphasizes the importance of informed consent and recommends the creation of a national patient registry. The guidelines stem from interdisciplinary discussions between clinicians in the SMC network--neurologists, geriatricians, old-age psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists, and patient organizations, including representatives of academic and non-academic memory clinics--between August 2023 and December 2024. They provide the first country-specific framework for integrating mAbs into clinical practice. In a joint statement, lead authors Dr. med Ansgar Felbecker and Professor Giovanni B. Frisoni, commented: “We built an expert group of specialists to provide recommendations in Switzerland on when to use anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in the care of Alzheimer's disease patients. Our hope is that this guidance will help with the approval of these new drugs in other countries for patients who qualify for this care.” While the paper provides a country-specific framework for the use of mAbs in clinical routine, the authors hope that as Alzheimer's disease care enters a new therapeutic era, these guidelines can balance innovation with clinical responsibility—offering a model for other nations navigating similar questions. It is great that the journal Neurodegenerative Diseases serves as a home for such important guidance that has the potential to impact thousands of patients,” Professor Gilles Allali, Editor in Chief of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Karger Publishers Posted in: Drug Discovery & Pharmaceuticals | Healthcare News Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Headway in Alzheimer's disease care: New guidance provides recommendations for use of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at The University of Osaka has identified a crucial brain region involved in motor learning during reaching movements. This discovery clarifies a long-standing question in neuroscience about how the brain detects and corrects motion inaccuracies, with potential applications in developing new rehabilitation methods. Adaptation in motor control, such as correcting errors when reaching for an object, is fundamental to daily activities. The red nucleus, divided into magnocellular (RNm) and parvocellular (RNp) regions, is a subcortical structure historically associated with movement coordination, but the function of RNp has been less understood. In macaque monkeys, researchers discovered that a tiny brain region called the parvocellular red nucleus (RNp) sends "error signals" needed to correct reaching movements. These signals come in two forms—one during movement, and one after. When RNp was electrically stimulated just after a reach, the monkeys gradually changed their movement direction, showing learning over time. Stimulating a nearby region (RNm) had no effect, proving RNp's unique role in motor learning. This research reveals for the first time that the parvocellular red nucleus acts as a central hub for motor error detection and correction, mediating motor learning through its connection to the cerebellum. The findings open new avenues for developing rehabilitation technologies targeting precise brain regions to aid recovery in patients with motor impairments due to stroke or injury. As Shigeru Kitazawa, lead author of the study remarks, "Improving motor skills depends on our ability to detect and correct errors. Identifying how and where the brain performs could also lead to better ways to understand and treat rare brain diseases that make it hard for people to move or control their body properly."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food cravings are the downfall of many dieters, who feel locked in an eternal battle with their willpower to resist the tempting sweets, snacks and other foods they love. However, researchers in food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign say in a new study that eating dessert may be the optimal strategy for losing weight, keeping it off and keeping cravings at bay. Dieters in a clinical trial who incorporated craved foods into a balanced meal plan lost more weight during the 12-month weight-loss program and their cravings remained minimal through the subsequent 12 months of maintenance. Then-graduate student Nouf W. Alfouzan and nutrition professor Manabu T. Nakamura, who published their findings in the journal Physiology and Behavior, said that dieters' food cravings decreased while losing weight and remained minimal as long as they did not regain weight. The participants were part of a larger project conducted with physicians at Carle Clinic in Urbana, Illinois, that aimed to broaden the outreach of an in-person weight-loss program called the Individualized Dietary Improvement Program by converting it to an online format called EMPOWER. If they have a lot of cravings, it is very difficult to lose weight. Even when they are able to control their cravings and lose weight, if the cravings come back, they regain the weight." Although many dieters reported in prior research that their cravings decreased while losing weight, Nakamura and Alfouzan said it remained unclear whether these changes persisted when they reached their weight-loss goal or quit dieting while trying to maintain their weight. Alfouzan, the first author of the current study, wanted to investigate that along with whether reduced cravings correlated with greater weight loss. The dietary program used in the study educates dieters about key nutrients, helping them make informed decisions about their food selections until sustainable dietary changes are achieved, Nakamura said. Dieters used a data visualization tool that plots foods' protein, fiber and calories so they can enhance nutrition while minimizing the calories they consume. During the first year, participants engaged in 22 online nutrition education sessions created by scholars at the university's Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning that included strategies for dealing with cravings. "If you are eating and snacking randomly, it's very hard to control," Nakamura said. Our plan used an 'inclusion strategy,' in which people incorporated small portions of craved foods within a well-balanced meal." Every six months participants completed a questionnaire about their cravings for specific foods. Using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always), individuals rated themselves on statements such as, "Whenever I have food cravings, I find myself making plans to eat" and "I have no willpower to resist my food cravings." The intensity of each dieter's cravings was calculated by adding their scores for all 15 statements. Of these, 20 people completed the yearlong maintenance program, but because a few regained some of what they had lost, their average weight loss was 6.7%, the researchers found. The team also found that individuals' craving for food in general and for specific types of foods such as sweets and carbohydrates diminished during the year of weight loss and stabilized during maintenance. This finding suggests that individuals' reduced cravings correlated with decreased body fat rather than the negative energy balance of dieting, Nakamura said. "This basically debunks the hungry fat cell theory, a longstanding hypothesis that fat cells become starved for energy and trigger cravings, causing dieters to eat and ultimately regain what they lost. Of the 24 participants who remained in the study at 12 months, more than half reported they used the inclusion strategy to manage cravings, some people as frequently as one to three times a day, while others used it once a week or more. Those who used the strategy lost significantly more weight compared with other participants and experienced significant reductions in their cravings for sweet and high-fat foods, the researchers found. Consistency is another key to managing cravings and weight, Nakamura said. "The popular myth is you have to have a very strong will to fend off temptation, but that is not the case. Fluctuations in eating patterns, meal times and amounts trigger cravings, too.
