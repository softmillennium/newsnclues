                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national team must get back to winning ways this summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup, but they'll have to do so without three top talents. Not named were Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna, Juventus's Weston McKennie and Tim Weah. The three players were not released by their clubs for international duty given the overlap with FIFA's new Club World Cup and Gold Cup. Both players should be viewed as starters in midfield and attack respectively, meaning Pochettino will need to call on second-choice options. It's a big opportunity for whoever receives playing time given how close the World Cup is. In Reyna's case, despite his lack of recent appearances, he's still viewed by fans as a top talent waiting to be unlocked by Pochettino. Fans have cried out for more creativity, let alone a spark in attacking scenarios. Pulisic has played in the number 10 role under this coach, but he's best deployed out wide where he can threaten defenders and create scoring opportunities. Forcing him to dictate the start of attacks hampers his ability elsewhere. Reyna is the solution there, for many, but given his limited playing time under Pochettino and lack thereof during the latter years of the Gregg Berhalter era, missing Gold Cup could cause his stock to fall even further. Reyna's made just 15 appearances this season for Dortmund in the Bundesliga. A groin injury kept him out for most of the early season, but he's made just two appearances in Germany's top flight since Mar. Perhaps Dortmund will use him during the Club World Cup where he can first and foremost impress his national team coach, but also raise his stock at the club level so he can earn more playing time at Dortmund or elsewhere if they choose to sell him this summer. Pochettino likely will opt for a wealth of experience given the aforementioned absences, but he needs to also start cultivating talent from Major League Soccer like Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang, Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White and Sebastian Berhalter. Players that show out during Gold Cup should likely get opportunities to further impress during the September friendlies against Japan and South Korea. Somehow, he has just enough time every matchday to tweet when an Arsenal player scores a goal. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are planning for midfielder Jude Bellingham to have surgery on a persistent shoulder problem after the 2025 Club World Cup. Bellingham, 21, dislocated his left shoulder against Rayo Vallecano in November 2023. The Athletic reported in October that Madrid sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had indicated their understanding was that Bellingham would require surgery at some point to ensure the shoulder fully heals properly, and to avoid a high risk of further dislocations. The busy football calendar has not yet provided Bellingham with an opportunity to undergo surgery, given the time off to recover it will demand. It is planned he will undergo surgery at the same clinic used by Ferland Mendy, Antonio Rudiger and Eder Militao for their respective quadriceps, meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) operations this season. It is unclear whether Bellingham had suffered previous shoulder problems before the dislocation against Rayo during his debut season in Spain, but Madrid staff sources said in 2023 they were aware of shoulder problems during his spell at Borussia Dortmund between 2020 and 2023. Photos show him wearing shoulder support on two occasions when playing for the German club. Bellingham has made 51 appearances in all competitions for Madrid this season, providing 14 goals and 14 assists. The inaugural Club World Cup runs from June 15 to July 13. Madrid will play Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg in Group H.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL breaks down where PSV's four Americans stand after the trophy parade With six games remaining, PSV were nine points back of Ajax in the Eredivisie. They'd led the Dutch top flight at one point by as much as nine points, but following Ricardo Pepi's injury in the winter, their form fell off a cliff. Yet, there they were on Monday, parading the league title around Eindhoven. It was a comeback or a collapse for the ages, depending on who you ask, and at the center of it all, all season long, were the club's four American stars. The U.S. men's national team midfielder was one of the Eredivisie's best all season long, calling into question just how long he'll actually be playing in the Dutch league. And then there's Richy Ledezma, who deputized so admirably for Dest during his recovery that he, too, became a vital piece of the PSV puzzle. Aside from Pepi, who continues to recover from his injury, the other three could be with the USMNT this summer. All four, meanwhile, are commanding discussions about their future. Heading into the 2025-26 season, though, it'll be interesting to see where the club's four Americans will be when it all gets going.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium. The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten. [You could win $25K in the Women's Bracket Mayhem contest. Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday. They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result. And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup. "We didn't show aggression with the ball" — nor without it. "The first half was really painful to see," Pochettino said. They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Portuguese officials have remained silent on any imminent changes, Mourinho's recent five-word response to swirling rumors has only added fuel to the fire. According to multiple reports from Turkish media, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is eyeing Jose Mourinho as a potential successor to Roberto Martínez, whose contract runs until July 31, 2026. The move, if completed, would represent Mourinho's first venture into international management. The 62-year-old tactician is currently under contract with Fenerbahce, but his first season in Turkey has been underwhelming, marked by elimination in both the Europa League and Turkish Cup, and falling short in the Super Lig title race, which was sealed by rivals Galatasaray. Despite the setbacks, he remains a towering figure in Portuguese soccer, and his appointment would bring him back into contact with Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he famously managed at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. Their relationship during that period was complex but fruitful: Ronaldo scored 168 goals in 164 appearances under Mourinho, a staggering record of efficiency and brilliance. While speculation intensified across Turkish and Portuguese outlets, Mourinho finally addressed the rumors during a post-match press conference following Fenerbahce's 2-1 win over Eyupspor. With all eyes on him, the experienced boss delivered a calm but defiant denial. I am a loyal person,” he told reporters. That moment — Mourinho's five-word phrase, “I am a loyal person” — quickly grabbed headlines. It poured cold water on reports of active talks, but many saw the denial as strategic rather than conclusive. Insiders suggest Mourinho is weighing his options, especially as the FPF is reportedly unwilling to pay the Yellow Canaries' release clause, complicating any immediate move.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON (May 20, 2025) - U.S. Soccer announced today that Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson will join the U.S. Women's National Team for a pair of friendlies against China PR and Jamaica during the upcoming FIFA window. Patterson will depart for camp this weekend following Houston's match against Bay FC at Shell Energy Stadium. The first friendly is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. CT on Saturday, May 31 against China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. Fans can follow that match live on TNT, HBO Max in English or Universo and Peacock in Spanish. Patterson earned her first cap and first start for the U.S. Women's National Team during their most resent set of friendlies. She made her senior team debut on April 5 against Brazil after she entered the match late in the second half. Patterson scored her first goal of the season earlier this month against Racing Louisville on May 2. Houston close a two-match homestand on Saturday, May 24 as they host Bay FC for Kids Nights at 4 p.m. CT. Following the FIFA international window, the team will travel to Florda to face Orlando Pride FC on Saturday, June 7. The club will return to Shell Energy Stadium to celebrate their annual Pride Night on Friday, June 13 as they host San Diego Wave FC at 7 p.m. CT. Tickets for that match are available on SeatGeek.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A city report says that the cost of some services the province said it would pay for out of its $97-million contribution are “substantially higher” than budgeted, which may leave Toronto on the hook for more money. A city report says that the cost of some services the province said it would pay for out of its $97-million contribution are “substantially higher” than budgeted, which may leave Toronto on the hook for more money. Toronto expects it will cost $380 million to stage six games for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Toronto may be forced to take on a greater share of hosting costs for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as the city and Premier Doug Ford's government remain at odds over the province's contribution with just over a year before the tournament is set to kick off. Queen's Park agreed in late 2023 to provide up to $97 million of that, while the federal government has pledged about $104 million, and the city is responsible for about $179 million. But while Queen's Park had previously said its contribution would include the value of provincial services required for the tournament — such as increased policing, transportation and health care — the report states that Ontario's estimated value of those services are “substantially higher than budgeted, and in some cases completely unbudgeted.” According to the document, which will be debated at council this week, there are more than $39 million in costs for provincial services still under negotiation between the two governments, which would come out of the province's $97-million share, “increasing the city's funding gap.” The report from executive director of Toronto's World Cup secretariat Sharon Bollenbach says that the city will continue negotiations with the province “to reduce uncertainties around scope and lowering ministry service costs.” The city was already facing a $18-million shortfall in its hosting budget, according to a separate report released this month. It planned to make up that gap through a combination of private donations, merchandise sales, hospitality packages and other measures. The tournament is scheduled to kickoff June 11, 2026 in Mexico City, with Toronto's BMO Field staging the Canadian national team's opening game on June 12. In a letter to city manager Paul Johnson, Deputy Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport Sarah Harrison said Queen's Park's contribution would be “exclusively limited” to investments that would deliver public infrastructure and community benefits that would outlast the games. That would include “provincial priorities such as community infrastructure projects with long-term public benefit, sport legacy and tourism support impacts.” It would exclude any costs where the “primary beneficiary” would be a nonpublic entity, such as a private or for-profit company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unfortunately for Australian football fans, no A-League sides managed to nab one of the Asian Football Confederation places, but Auckland City from New Zealand's national league will represent Oceania. Here is our guide to how the FIFA Club World Cup will work. A dedicated 24/7 channel will be available on Kayo Sports along with highlights packages, minis from every match and supplementary programming with all the colour and background stories from the tournament. Confederation of African Football - Al Ahly (Egypt), Esperance de Tunis (Tunisia), Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa), Wydad AC (Morocco).

Union of European Football Associations - Atletico Madrid (Spain), Bayern Munich (Germany), Benfica (Portugal), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Chelsea (England), Inter Milan (Italy), Juventus (Italy), Manchester City (England), PSG (France), Porto (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), Red Bull Salzberg (Austria). It appears odd that the Premier League champions will not be a part of the FIFA Club World Cup, but like in Asia, England's spots are dependent on Champions League success. Some teams who did not win their respective federation's continental title in the past four years were awarded places for their average performance over the four-year cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 20, 2025) – U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 24-player training camp roster for the upcoming matches against China PR at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn., on Saturday, May 31 (4:30 p.m. CT / 5:30 p.m. Hayes will name 23 players to suit up for each of the two matches. GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 0) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 3), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 1) DEFENDERS (8): Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride; 0/0), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA; 159/25), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 66/1), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC, ENG; 44/2), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 5/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 2/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 3/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 107/2) MIDFIELDERS (6): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 33/1), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 165/37), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 2/0), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 5/2), Lily Yohannes (Ajax, NED; 6/1) “Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” said Hayes. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways. Now that everyone has settled into a rhythm with their clubs, or is coming right off their European seasons, our players are at a good level. As has been one of our focuses this year, this camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth.” Nineteen-year-old Portland Thorns FC midfielder Olivia Moultrie, who has not played for the USA since last October against Iceland, also makes a return. She also played for the USA in early March of 2024 at the Concacaf W Gold Cup, a tournament in which she scored her first two WNT goals. Abello and LaBonta, who has three goals this season for the first place Current, are the 22nd and 23rd first-time call-ups under Hayes. Four additional players earned first-time call-ups under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore after Hayes was hired in November of 2023. Sentnor, the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, scored twice in that tournament – against Colombia and Japan – and Cooper tallied against Australia on a goal set up by Sentnor. Alyssa Thompson has four goals and two assists so far for Angel City while her younger sister Gisele, whose previous call-ups have been at outside back, will get a run as a winger during this camp. Racing Louisville forward Emma Sears also has four goals this season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An easy smile he flashes often punctures his calm, solution-oriented answers in our 45-minute chat. Matarazzo jokes that part of his brain comes from his math background (he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in applied mathematics). It's one of many facets that makes the 47-year-old New Jersey native who he is. Another way to see Matarazzo is as the trailblazing American men's soccer coach that he is. He left the states after college to play professionally in Europe, settled in Germany and never left. Matarazzo got his first big break as manager of Stuttgart, who he led to the Bundesliga. “I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place,” Matarazzo told GIVEMESPORT. “At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be.” A few months later, in February, Matarazzo was let go by Hoffenheim amid a period of chaos and internal strife at the club. “Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience,” Matarazzo said. He has spent the last seven months enjoying his time. Taking a bit of a reset from the daily grind of soccer, and traveling, but Matarazzo is ready to get back in the game. The successful coach opened up about his experience of breaking barriers as an American manager in Europe, his time and dismissal at Hoffenheim, talks with the USMNT and much more in a wide-ranging conversation with GIVEMESPORT. His answers have been lightly edited for brevity. GMS: People in football – coaches in particular – have the competitive nature, wanting to control everything, locked into the daily grind. So, what has the last 6-7 months of your life been like? Pellegrino Matarazzo: Well, I'm very conscious of time. Enjoying every moment, it's really a great opportunity to pause and reflect on things. I've been travelling quite a bit, to the United States and Italy to visit family, but also places that interest me. Of course I've been using my time on a professional level. Watching football always interests me, even though the first two months I had my TV off to create distance. Teams, coaches, matchups that I value tactically. Also I use the time to follow up on certain leagues where maybe there's the possibility of future employment. Different cultures, training methods, style of play. You say your TV was off for two months. Was that deliberate, in that “I know this is good for me to step back”, or was that like “I just need the time to get away?” I really started with selected games of coaches that interested me. With some space now to decompress, how would you sum up your time at the club? PM: To be honest, I look at the positive side. I'll always be grateful for my experience in Hoffenheim, I was able to work with some great people. Despite a very turbulent environment at the club, we were relatively successful. Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience. When I joined the club in February 2023, there was this ongoing internal power struggle happening and they were in a 9-match winless run. We managed to build a focused, strong, cohesive unit and save the team from relegation. The following season, we qualified for European competition. One game that sums up my time there was our 4-2 win against Bayern Munich in the final game of the season last year, securing a spot in the Europa League. It was a special moment that showed our true character. We went down 2-0 in the first six minutes. We remained composed, showed resilience, determination and belief and ended up scoring four goals to win against Bayern Munich. What happened in the summer— well, I guess we can get into that if you have questions. PM: Hoffenheim is a club that stands for developing talent and playing attacking football. Maxi Beier, Tom Bischof are just two obvious examples of developed talent. In these areas we were doing very good work. We had a routine every morning where we'd drink matcha tea and discuss the day, allowing us to align with our thoughts. His dismissal threw the entire club to a very unusual state. What many people don't realize, other senior leaders left the club as well and the result was a big vacuum in club leadership. My main objective was to keep the players and staff calm, focused on football. There were a lot of late transfers being made. There's always an advantage when a squad is assembled early, especially when you're in European competition, otherwise you don't have preparation time to integrate game philosophy or establish leadership in the squad. Not only did Hoffenheim make many late transfers, they were often positions and profiles where the coaching staff were looking for something else. It required a lot of mental flexibility on my part. I learned a lot in this phase. Do you feel betrayed in any way in being let go by Hoffenheim after all you did to save from relegation and then qualify for Europe? I don't know who I should feel betrayed by, Alex Rosen signed me, he was no longer there. There was a lot more to be achieved at the club. I know we were on the right path. Changing gears— You are among the trailblazers for American coaches in top European soccer. Is that an active thought that ever dawned on you or is it just, like, “I'm doing my thing”? What were the difficulties – if any – you experienced as an American manager breaking through in Germany? Or because you played there and had been there for so long, were you viewed as an honorary German? In the beginning, people knew I was Italian-American, they had doubts. It was a motivation for me to be better. Maybe that's what helped me get to where I am now, the need for excellence. I was fluent in German relatively early. That was an advantage in the German football culture, you need to be able to speak the language. PM: I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place. At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be. It was an honor to be associated with a role like that. You mentioned earlier that you were watching specific leagues that could be where your next job is. Is there anything you're able to say on which leagues those are? PM: I definitely have a clear vision and ambitious goals for what my career should look like as a head coach, but I also understand the path is not always linear. Working in the Premier League is a goal for a lot of coaches who want to work at the highest level. Serie A is also appealing to me because of a very emotional component to it, with my family roots coming from Italy. I used to watch the Serie A on a very small TV in my father's room growing up. In general, it's about taking the next step to help me grow. Lastly, to anyone reading, I want to let you give this in your own words– How do you see the game? I consider myself very adaptable to the existing conditions of a club and I form my squads around their strengths in order to win, to create identity. I consider myself a flexible coach, and with my math background, very solution-oriented. It's important in modern football to be very adaptable. That being said, I have an attacking and forward-driven nature. It's important to protect yourself in moments of vulnerability and it's important to hurt your opponent when they're exposed. That's a little of what I'm about. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Be the first to post your thoughts. Florian Wirtz is arguably the most sought-after talent in the world right now and Liverpool have taken steps to signing him The 21-year-old defender would be ‘open and happy' to join Liverpool this summer. Big praise from the World Cup-winning German. Pep Guardiola doesn't believe he should be in the conversation of the greatest manager ever while he's not retired, and offered his trio of GOATs. Eric Cantona dismissed the idea that Pele is the greatest player in football history - instead offering his own pick for that crown. The defender was seen watching the away end in full swing and fans have their thoughts on what his feelings were.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to the U.S. men's national team, manager Mauricio Pochettino isn't exactly working with a blank canvas. With that display fresh in mind, there might be a growing sense of urgency to look at other options. Now, Pochettino did engage in a degree of experimentation during the CNL. Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna emerged as a player on the rise, a wild card who can give the U.S. manager more options in attack. Ditto for Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang, with the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White also getting some looks. Circumstances, even beyond results, might open the door a bit wider for some additional new blood. The Concacaf Gold Cup starts next month, and the likes of Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie won't be available due to Juventus' Club World Cup commitments. The same could be true for Giovanni Reyna if he hasn't yet extracted himself from his Borussia Dortmund purgatory. There are also a pair of friendlies in early June against Turkey and Switzerland to allow Pochettino the chance to bring in some new players. Aaronson has filled a variety of roles in Utrecht's midfield this season, sometimes more withdrawn, and at times more advanced, but usually tilted to the left side of midfield. As for the USMNT, Aaronson's versatility should stand him in good stead with Pochettino, and McKennie's presumed absence could create an opening for some playing time. He was called up to the USMNT for a January camp in 2021, but an injury prevented him from getting on the field. Blackmon gradually made his way as a center back with Vancouver and has enjoyed a stellar start to the season, playing a massive role in the Caps' Concacaf Champions Cup triumph over Inter Miami CF. Sources told ESPN that Canada has been inquiring about Blackmon possibly playing for the CanMNT. In 2021, Berhalter seemed on his way out of MLS after an indifferent season with Austin FC, but a move to Vancouver gave him new life. And no player has benefited more from Concacaf Champions Cup performances than Berhalter, whose two goals and two assists in the semifinal round against Miami were instrumental in dispatching the Herons. Like Aaronson, Berhalter faces a crowded midfield for spots, especially with the likes of Johnny Cardoso returning after missing out on the CNL. But the Vancouver midfielder's ability on set pieces -- long a sore spot for the U.S. -- should also stand him in good stead. In the Sullivan household, Cavan has received most of the attention of late, given his scheduled move to Manchester City. But older brother Quinn has quietly put together an impressive first three months of the season in Philadelphia. He has assisted on seven goals, tied for second in MLS, and delivered 30 key passes, the eighth-highest total in the league. Sullivan's usual spot on the left wing is typically occupied by one Christian Pulisic, but there's nothing wrong with having increasing depth, especially given Sullivan's ability off the dribble, as well as his creativity. He has shown an ability to pop up in other areas of the field as well. The only question now: Will Pochettino give him a chance? Outwardly, there was some upheaval attached to Wiley's season. He was initially loaned to Ligue 1 side Strasbourg but a pair of injuries (knee tendinitis and a separated shoulder) limited him to only six league appearances and the loan was cut short. Wiley fared much better during a subsequent loan to Watford in the English Championship, so much so that there is talk he'll return to the Hornets on another temporary deal next season.</p>

The Club World Cup radically changed contracts,” Marseille President recently disclosed. He also added that: “Discussions are ongoing with other clubs, not just [Inter].” According to reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are close to sealing an agreement with Marseille after their latest offer of €23m. Marseille have reportedly been pushing for a price tag in the region of €25m. The Pink Paper adds that there is now ‘very little left' before a formal agreement is struck between the Nerazzurri and Marseille. Your email address will not be published.

The 33-year-old will leave City after a decade at the club having lifted six Premier League titles, as well as winning the Champions League and Club World Cup in 2023.

The Belgian is under contract until June 30, which covers three Club World Cup matches in the United States, but De Bruyne said he would have to look out for his own interests.

"I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point," he said after the FA Cup final in quotes carried by The Athletic.

"So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know. I'm just a player. I don't make the rules, I can't do anything about it. 

"So in the end, like I said, I'll probably have to take care of myself."

The 32-team tournament runs from June 14 to July 13.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid has agreed to make its second pre-Club World Cup signing according to Spanish radio station COPE, which cited anonymous sources. Los Blancos have already reacted to a trophyless season, in terms of primary domestic and European silverware, plus newfound dominance from bitter rival FC Barcelona, by agreeing for head coach Carlo Ancelotti to leave at the end of the season. He is likely to be replaced by club legend Xabi Alonso, and though there has been no official announcement from Madrid on the matter yet, the former midfielder has already revealed he will step down from his head coach role at Bayer Leverkusen, who he helped clinched its first Bundesliga title in 2023/2024. As we often see when things don't go right for the Bernabeu giants, President Florentino Perez has been getting his cheque book out to try and level up with Barca next term. Before what is expected to be a busy summer in the transfer market, Madrid has already completed the signing of Bournemouth and Spain central defender Dean Huijsen, who was released from his Premier League contract after the payment of a $67 million (£50 million) release clause at the weekend. According to COPE, Madrid has reached another agreement with a young star because it will re-sign Nico Paz from Como prior to June 30. If the deal is completed before said date, Madrid can recapture its ex-Argentina international for just $6.7 million (€6 million) after selling him last summer. Earlier this season, Ancelotti revealed that Madrid had been keeping tabs on Paz in Italy. I think patience is a great quality,” said the Italian. At Real Madrid, the 20-year-old is expected to battle for minutes with the likes of Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Brahim Diaz, and Arda Guler.</p>
